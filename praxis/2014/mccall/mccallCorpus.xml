               <head>Introduction<note place="foot" resp="editors">This issue originated in a panel at
                  the 2012 Modern Language Association, “Tragedy, Translation and Theory: A Tribute
                  to the Work of Thomas J. McCall.” I am grateful to Deborah White for her
                  assistance in moving the panel from presentation to publication at RCP. I also
                  want to express profound thanks to Professor Kevin McNamara, Tom McCall’s
                  colleague and good friend, who took salvaged Tom’s papers after his death and
                  provided both materials and endless assistance in gather together Tom’s work. I
                  would also like to note the support of Tom’s sister Terry McCall, who also
                  provided invaluable support and materials before and after the panel. Additional
                  materials were provided by Cynthia Chase, Andrzej Warminski, David Ferris, and Ian
                  Balfour. Luke Donahue gave excellent editorial advice for the entire issue. Tom’s
                  writing on tragedy, translation and violence is being edited by me and Kevin
                  McNamara under Tom’s chosen title <title level="m">Vortexts: Essays on Tragedy,
                     Translation and Violence</title>, as well as a manuscript he had completed
                  before he died entitled <title level="m">Romantic Origins of
                  Theory.</title>

               <p> This volume of <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> takes its
               inspiration from the writings on tragedy, translation and twentieth century literary
               theory by the late comparatist Thomas J. McCall, who died suddenly in January 2011
               after returning from a mountain trekking trip in Nepal.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Tom McCall was born in 1952 and died on January 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 2011. He received his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature at Yale
                  University and was teaching at the University of Houston-Clear Lake at the time of
                  his death. </note> Tom McCall was a highly respected Romanticist and literary
               theorist whose important early work on Friedrich Hölderlin’s translations of
               Sophocles ultimately developed into a broader critical speculation concerning the
               theoretical stakes of Hölderlin’s translations, and his poetics, for German romantic
               thought and for twentieth century theory more generally. Assembled here are three of
               McCall’s essays from across his abbreviated career: on Hölderlin’s translation of
                  <title level="m">Antigone</title>, on Walter Benjamin’s early essay “Two Poems of
               Friedrich Hölderlin,” and on the notion of “allegorical” translation as it can be
               interpreted from Hölderlin’s writings and translations of both <title level="m">Oedipus</title> and <title level="m">Antigone</title> as well as their inflection
               in Benjamin’s work. (This last piece was a later reconsideration of Hölderlin that
               remained unplublished at the time of McCall’s death.) <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ackowledgments for permissions to reprint Tom’s two essays in this
                  issue appear with the individual articles. </note> These essays are the point of
               departure for three accompanying critical pieces by Romanticists and literary
               theorists who have been engaged with McCall’s work: my own reflections on McCall’s
               early writing on Hölderlin, Ian Balfour’s skillful explication of McCall’s reading of
               Benjamin in relation to Benjamin’s and Theodor Adorno’s thoughts on philology, and
               David Ferris’s moving tribute to McCall’s work on tragedy in the form of a meditation
               on the elegiac tradition and a reading of Shelley’s elegy for John Keats, a Romantic
               writer whose life was also cut short. The three pairs of essays, taken together,
               underscore the crucial role of Hölderlin’s notions of translation and poetics in
               Romantic theory and in contemporary thought, in particular as his ideas have been
               transmitted through the work of Walter Benjamin. These critical explorations also
               help us understand the importance of Tom McCall’s work in proposing a radicalized,
               Hölderlinian theory of tragedy and translation that lingers on in twentieth- and
               twenty-first century theoretical writing. </p>

                  <p> What binds McCall’s three essays—on translation and tragedy, on poetry and
                  poetics, and on an “allegorical” tradition of translation and critique—is a single
                  thread that emerges from a dramatic scene. McCall’s critical endeavors begin with
                  the struggle over a corpse: the conflict between Antigone and Creon over the
                  burial of her brother, Polyneices. At the site of the exposed body, McCall
                  suggests, in the question of Polyneices’ burial at the heart of this Greek play,
                  Hölderlin locates a <emph>problem of translation</emph>—the passage between mortal
                  and divine. In Hölderlin’s rendering of the play, this problem of passage or
                  translation will ultimately bind the Greeks’ interpretation of the burial’s (and
                  non-burial’s) significance <emph>in</emph> the play with the Germans’ attempt to
                  find their own significations <emph>of</emph> the Greek text. What arises in the
                  Greek play as a problem of passage (or lack of passage) from one realm to the
                  other will thus become, in Hölderlin’s rendering of the play, the very problem of
                  translation from Greek to German; the struggle over a (Greek) burial is translated
                  as a problem of <emph>German</emph> destiny. In this sense the question of contact
                  with the divine is bound up, for Hölderlin, with the problem of another kind of
                  encounter: the encounter that may or may not take place in the translation of the
                  Greek play into another language and another time; the very possibility—or
                  impossibility—of contact with the Greek in the modern German text. What would it
                  mean to take account of this struggle, of the risk of exposing this corpse, in the
                  very act of translation? </p>
                  <p> It is this <emph>problem of contact</emph> that is central to McCall’s surprising
                  and evocative reading of the self-allegorizing dimension of Hölderlin’s <title level="m">Antigone</title> translation, as I suggest in my reading of “The Case
                  of the Missing Body,” and it also serves as a figurative and conceptual crux of
                  interpretation that leads across McCall’s writing in this volume. Indeed, in his
                  later essay on Benjamin’s poetics as they emerge from Hölderlin’s poetry and
                  theory, this question of contact takes another turn. Here the difficulty of
                  translation is reiterated, somewhat differently, in the critical problem of
                  approaching the “untouchable Middle” of the poem, the incalculable heart of a
                  poetic text determined through calculable law. What is a criticism, McCall asks us
                  to consider, that both approaches this center and dares <emph>not to touch</emph>
                  it? </p>
                  <p> In his final return to Hölderlin’s translations, which are inflected by his
                  reading of Benjamin’s <title level="m">Origins of German Tragedy</title>, McCall
                  names, or rather renames, this literary and critical undertaking that is both a
                  mode of translation and a poetics; he calls it “wrathful translation” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">"Wrathful Translation"
                     par. 33</ref>). This enterprise takes its name and its significance from
                  McCall’s own translation and appropriation of Hölderlin’s <title level="m">Zorn</title>, the word the poet uses to describe Oedipus’s wrathful quest for
                  what is “more than consciousness can bear or grasp” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 16</ref>). “Wrath,”
                  McCall suggests, “signals the nonendingness of the process of disowning the
                  signifier” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par.
                     17</ref>), a critical engagement with textuality that emerges from a specific
                  Romantic reading of its classical past. This quest beyond any assimilable
                  meaning—which arises, for the wrathful translator, in the act of encountering
                  foreign texts—extends beyond the specific problem of translation. At the heart of
                  this practice is the refusal of a translator, a critic, or a reader to grasp too
                  eagerly for (a final) sense; that is, to secure the literary tradition by
                  interring it in its symbolic aesthetic and moral significance. In searching,
                  endlessly, beyond signification, the critic’s hold on sense is “loosened” and the
                  encounter with the text repeatedly estranged. “It could even be argued that
                  ‘criticism’ <emph>tout simple</emph>,” McCall proposes, “has to do with the
                  critical disarticulation of the symbolic core of tragedy, especially after this
                  complex genre, considerably simplified through such lucid mimetic models as
                  Aristotle’s, renders itself to critical judgment” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par. 12</ref>) In the
                  critical act, as in the act of translation, there is a struggle over the very
                  possibility of contact with a literary text no longer conceivable in a symbolic
                  mode.</p>

                  <p> This reformulation of criticism puts McCall’s readings of Hölderlin, Ian Balfour
                  suggests, in an alternative line of thinking that accompanies and questions the
                  modern aesthetic tradition of literary criticism, an alternative tradition that
                  Balfour calls “extreme philology” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.balfour.html">"Extreme Philology" par. 2</ref>). Extreme philology emerges from the Romantic
                  critics (including such writers as Friedrich Schlegel) and extends into the
                  twentieth century in thinkers such as Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and Paul de
                  Man. McCall’s essay on Benjamin’s “Two Poems of Friedrich Hölderlin” likewise
                  insists on the importance of this early work of the German critic as an important
                  contribution to an anti-aesthetic or anti-symbolic criticism, a tradition of
                  “poetic calculation” (rather than “poetic inspiration”) that pays close attention
                  to the “mechanical” operations of a poem and the resistant details of poetic
                  language. Starting with the description of the “calculable law” (a notion taken
                  from Hölderlin) and the “functions” of the poem that operate according to this
                  law, Benjamin ultimately ends up, McCall explains, at an incalculable core: “To
                  surpass the sublimity of the sublime,” he remarks, “is to become something wholly
                  prosaic [. . .] in an inversion that Benjamin precisely specifies as an
                  ‘untouchable sober-prosaic figure’ and that he links to a poetological term called
                  a ‘Caesura’” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">"Plastic Time"
                     par. 11</ref>). This Hölderlinian use of the term, McCall elaborates, “is a
                  means to thematize the real resistance of such ‘untouchability’ to critical
                  appropriation” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">par.
                  21</ref>). The Benjaminian notion of the caesura—the site of a significatory break
                  or gap—is drawn from Hölderlin’s “Remarks on <title level="m">Oedipus</title>,”
                  and exemplifies another way in which tragedy passes into its translations—from
                  Greek to German, from drama to poetry to criticism—at the very site of its own
                  lacunae: at the places where it cannot simply be grasped or touched.</p>
                  <p> The end of McCall’s essay on Benjamin could be said both to exemplify, and to
                  allegorize, this work of extreme philology, when the argument turns to Benjamin’s
                  citation of the final lines of Hölderlin’s “Blödligkeit” (“Timidity”) as an
                  example of the “striking caesura,” of the “untouchable middle” of the poem.
                  Benjamin writes: <quote>How much [Hölderlin] signifies the untouchable middle of
                     all relation is embodied most powerfully in the last two verses [. . .] “and
                     (we poets) bring one of the heavenly ones. And ourselves we bring capable
                     hands.” So the poet is no longer seen as form, but only still as principle of
                     form, the Delimiter, the one still carrying even his own body. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Benjamin, “Two Poems of Friedrich
                        Hölderlin,” Hölderlin,” cited and translated by McCall in “<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">Plastic Time and Poetic
                           Middles: Benjamin’s Hölderlin</ref>.” </note>
                     </quote> These enigmatic lines of Benjamin, for McCall, illustrate the caesura of
                  the poem in the peculiar Hölderlinian parallel by which the poet brings both “one
                  of the heavenly ones” and “capable hands,” a juxtaposition that estranges, and
                  indeed literalizes, the hands of the poet, as if they were something that could be
                  merely carried or “brought.” It is “the juxtaposition of the theophanic and the
                  technological (capable hands, which Hölderlin elsewhere calls the
                     <emph>mechane</emph>),” McCall suggests, “that constitutes the caesura, which
                  here strikes the reader as the Hölderlinian-Benjaminian project to realize, always
                  only imperfectly, the complete separateness and distantiation that the perfectly
                  ‘sober’ unity of lyric demands” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">par. 22</ref>). In McCall’s
                  reading, we might elaborate, the point of possible contact—between the god and the
                  poet, whose hands, writing the poem, would seem so close to the divine—is the
                  place where any contact by means of <emph>sense</emph> becomes impossible, as the
                  poetic figure of “hands” becomes literally unrecognizable. Yet the realization of
                  this “sober” dimension of the poem is also “holy”—a “holy-sober” style that might
                  be seen as an imperative for the poet, for the translator, and, somewhat
                  differently, for the critic.</p>

                  <p> What does it mean for this act of translation, of poetic composition, or of
                  criticism to be given the name of “wrath,” an affect that, in his final essay in
                  this issue, McCall associates with a line of critical affects including Kant’s
                     <title level="m">Wohlgefallen</title> (satisfaction) and Benjamin’s <title level="m">Trauer</title> (mourning)? In translating McCall’s “Wrathful
                  Translation” in his own title, “Mournful Translation,” David Ferris suggests that
                  this question can only be approached through another passage: not from ancients to
                  Romantics, or from Greek to German, but from the nineteenth to the twentieth
                  centuries, from Greek to (Hölderlinian and Benjaminian) German, or in this case,
                  from German to English. In the modern elegy, which Ferris illustrates with
                  Shelley’s “Adonais,” the affect of mourning effectively translates the endless
                  wrathful quest of the tragic hero and, like Hölderlinian translation, puts into
                  question its own mournful yearning for sense. “Wrath” and ”mourning” could perhaps
                  be said to take part in a history of affects that are always engaged with their
                  own translation, with the attempt <emph>to pass over</emph> that both drives and
                  frustrates the aesthetic and poetic endeavours.</p>
                  <p> Wrathful translation, as McCall defines it, is indeed a quest that refuses to
                  settle on any signification, a self-staging and self-questioning “allegorical”
                  process—a term McCall borrows from Benjamin’s discussion of the Baroque
                  mourning-play and from Paul de Man’s reformulation of the distinction between
                  allegory and symbol. To translate in wrath is not to consolidate, but rather to
                  disperse sense, even as one seeks to translate the text at hand. “[The
                  translation’s] senses are played out so fast, made and unmade so often” McCall
                  writes, “that [it] serves as a metacommentary on its own acts of sense-making, and
                  stages, beyond itself, the genesis and erasure of sense” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">"Wrathful Translation"
                     par. 32</ref>). It is this dispersal of sense that is passed on in “mournful
                  translation,” in its modulation of the tragic legacy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ferris argues that the elegiac mode both precedes and succeds
                     tragedy in a complicate their intertwined relation and cultural significance.
                  </note> Mournful translation fervently engages with, but ultimately resists, the
                  longing to “translate” (a) death into a knowable name or subject, to confer on it
                  sense and a delimitable place in time so that grief might be purged in a poetic
                  act of catharsis. In its own elegiac quest, the mournful translation is thus most
                  effective—and affective—in its refusal to conclude at this place of rest.
                  Shelley’s “Adonais,” in Ferris’s own mournful reading, can be said to “translate”
                  grief most powerfully through its very withholding of the mourned one’s name in
                  its ultimately unreadable title, and in its transferring of mourning onto the name
                  of the “sad Hour” that the poem calls up and through which it denudes time itself
                  of the comforting conclusion to grief.</p>

                  <p> In this context, it is perhaps significant that all of the essays in this issue
                  can be said to center around, and convey, literary and critical acts of mourning:
                  the attempt of Antigone to bury her dead brother; the unstated mourning of
                  Benjamin in his essay “Two Poems of Friedrich Hölderlin” which, Ian Balfour
                  suggests, is “intimately bound up with the then recent death of his friend,
                  Friedrich Heinle” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">par.
                     10</ref>); and Shelley’s elegiac response to the death of John Keats. These
                  scenes have now also become, for those of us writing in this volume, the textual
                  sites of a very present mourning, in our own attempts to pass between the living
                  and the dead. This wrathful yearning and this frustrated mourning may be the only
                  way, indeed, that translation ever takes place, in the passing on of an affect
                  that refuses to be grasped. The precariousness of such a passage may also find,
                  perhaps, its own allegory in the fate of the mourners about whom we all have
                  written here: the early death of Antigone in the tomb to which she was consigned
                  by Creon; the suicide of Benjamin during WWII that strangely repeats, though in
                  very different circumstances, the suicide in WWI of Friedrich Heinle; and the
                  early death of Shelley, just one year after “Adonais”—a poem that uncannily
                  anticipates, in the lines of its final stanza, his accidental death at sea. The
                  translation from dramatist to poet, from poet to critic, and from theorist to
                  theorist, takes place through the precariousness of a grief, and a textual
                  transmission, that, as Shelley laments in his poem, may “itself be mortal.” It is
                  indeed this mortality, McCall has revealed to us, that incites the yearning (the
                  wrath, the mourning) of translation, and what prevents it from ever coming to an
                  end.</p>
                  <p> In this context, too, we might also return to McCall’s careful elucidation of the
                  quest for contact that Hölderlin passes on to us from the heart of tragic drama.
                  The critical endeavor (in its wrath or grief) can never simply grasp or hold onto
                  what lies before it, but may nonetheless pass on what Sam Weber has called the
                  “touch of translation,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Sam Weber, “A Touch of
                     Translation.” </note> a phrase inspired by Benjamin’s own figure for “the
                  relation between translation and original”: <quote>

                        infinite, so the translation touches the original fleetingly and only in the
                        infinitely minute point of its meaning, in order to pursue its own course
                        following the law of fidelity, in the freedom of the movement of

                  <emph>In memory of Tom McCall</emph>
               </ab>
               <p> The term “philology” tends to conjure images of dusty manuscripts squinted at by
               dusty professors. It might seem out of place in the discursive haunts of the
               Frankfurt school, broadly understood, whose major concerns were fighting fascism and
               resisting any number of formations and formulations of capitalism—especially of the
               “late” variety. A discipline whose name means something like “the love of words”
               hardly seems of a piece with such intellectual endeavors and their high stakes, both
               political and social. Something of the same suspicion might hold for
               post-structuralist—and specifically deconstructive—modes of analysis that, if
               undeniably text-based, were and are pervasively concerned with matters of difference,
               power, and institutional force. In both domains, some the “late” surprisingly strong
               appeals are made for or in the name of <emph>philology</emph>. When Hamlet, at a
               certain point in the play bearing his name, is asked what he is reading, he replies:
               “Words, words, words” (2.2.192). It’s not a very satisfying answer to Polonius who
               asked him. Perhaps it is even a sign of Hamlet’s perversity, if not quite his
               madness. What matters to Polonius is “matter,” as he makes explicitly, literally
               clear. Something is distinctly amiss when there is, or appears to be, an undue focus
               on words. Yet that is what philology, in the first instance, for better or worse,
               does. It attends to words: their senses, their sequences, even their sounds. In
               arguing for a “return to philology,” Paul de Man contends, only a little polemically,
               that literary analysis does and ought to scrutinize <emph>how</emph> meaning is
               produced in advance of any attempt to fix or even just to make sense of meaning (25).
               In its more meaning-oriented disciplinary fellow travelers, literary criticism and
               literary history, this too is often the case. Even historically oriented literary
               criticism—directed to the world outside the text—tends for at least a while to dwell,
               more or less poetically, with words as they are articulated.</p>
               <p> Yet when old-school philology did what it does, it moved outward from the literary
               text to its enveloping historical contexts, centering the text in question in
               something of a series of concentric circles extending from the author’s life (inner
               and outer) to his or her immediate literary and historical contexts (history of the
               pertinent genre, for example, or the grand historical events, forces, or mode of
               production), zones of more or less settled meaning thought to be formative for the
               production of the text. What could be more sensible than that? Indeed, such
               protocols, when well executed, have yielded all kinds of impressive, clarifying
               results. Think of the grand tradition that goes from Giambattista Vico through Erich
               Auerbach to Edward Said and beyond. Yet philological analyses prosecuted under this
               banner often come up short on several counts. To begin with an exemplary lament from
               a philosopher who earned his livelihood as a classical philologist from a tender age:
               “Ah, it is a sad story, the story of philology! The disgusting erudition, the lazy,
               inactive passivity, the timid submission.—Who was ever free?” (Nietzsche 3.325).
               Friedrich Nietzsche is arguably the inaugurator of a counter-tradition that could be
               dubbed extreme philology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Among the possible
                  precursors in critical philology together with (critical) reflections on the idea
                  and practice of such philology, one could rank Giambattista Vico and Friedrich
                  Schlegel. </note> He opined, in the unfinished “untimely meditation” titled “We
               Philologists,” that <quote>The stance of the philologist towards antiquity is
                  apologetic, or else dictated by the view that what our own age esteems highly can
                  likewise be found in antiquity. The correct point of departure, however, is the
                  reverse one, namely, to proceed from an insight into our modern perversity and to
                  look back: then much of what in antiquity had heretofore been rebarbative will
                  appear as profound necessity. (3.325; my translation)</quote> Brushing against the
               complacent, conservative philology of his time, Nietzsche struck out to set the
               discipline on its head, as he did spectacularly in his first book, <title level="m">The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music, </title>unleashing the force of
               the Dionysian for a too Apollonian academic discipline, not just as a topic but as a

               Wilamowitz-Moellendorf would write a stinging and not simply defensive, much less
               naïve, critique, branding Nietzsche’s effort “<title level="m">Zukunftsphilologie</title>” (“Future-Philology”)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An English translation of Wilamowitz-Moellendorff’s attack can be conveniently

               it was a charge Nietzsche would in turn brandish as a kind of banner: “People believe
               philology is at an end—and I believe that it has not yet begun” (325; my
               translation).</p>
               <p> Something of the future Nietzsche envisioned took shape in the thinkers and texts I
               address in what follows. I track the practice and some of the theory of “extreme”
               philology, critical texts that occupy a place at the edge of a spectrum of a
               discipline whose center has tended to be conservative in more ways than one, a
               discipline dedicated to preserving and honoring classic(al) texts of the past, a
               discipline often bent on consigning those texts to the past—embalming rather than
               just preserving—even as it promotes their reading in the present.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For first-rate accounts of the ethos and attitude of classical
                  philology from “within” but sympathetic to any number of Nietzsche’s contentions,
                  see Karl Reinhardt, Glenn Most, and James Porter. For a literally old-school,
                  sharp history of classical philology to the early twentieth century century, see
                  Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. For a recent, thorough account of Nietzsche’s philology
                  and its relation to his contemporaries, see Christoph Benne. </note> The more or
               less Nietzschean counter-tradition is critical, skeptical, open to the dark side and
               to the obscurity of texts, willing to admit the limits of its knowledge as well as
               being not unaware of the pressure philologists in a given present can—and in some
               sense should—apply to texts of the past.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Not all
                  the philologists or quasi-philologists in this loose counter-tradition share
                  Nietzsche’s politics. Yet even Walter Benjamin, whose politics were usually quite
                  different from Nietzsche’s, invokes favorably the Nietzsche of the <title level="m">Untimely Meditations</title>, especially the second “On the Use and
                  Abuse of History for Life,” which argues for (among other things) a critical
                  history and one directed against “the victors.” For an acute reading of that
                  Nietzsche essay in relation to nineteenth-century German thinking on philology,
                  see Glenn Most. </note> Most particularly, the discipline of philology, which is
               by definition committed to making sense of texts, is, in the hands of these critical
               philologists, often geared to confronting crucial and definitive moments when texts
               stop making sense, when philology comes up against its own limits. This sort of
               stance need not have been and is not in every respect “extreme” but it can come
               across as such, in contrast to the sometimes sloppy humanist (and often bourgeois)
               complacency of so much that passes for philological scholarship and
               understanding.</p>
               <p> The readings and reflections I shall focus on from Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno,
               and Tom McCall are characterized by attention to the complexity and violence of
               language registered alternately by allegorical readings or simply by dwelling on what
               exactly the text says, so far as one can know or articulate it. These procedures too
               can have the force of radicality. The examples singled out cluster around the work of
               Friedrich Hölderlin, the object of some of the most intense philological work, both
               practical and theoretical, expended upon any post-classical author. Hölderlin is in
               this horizon both a special and an exemplary case of a poet to seize on. “Discovered”
               in a major way only very belatedly, roughly a century after the high-water mark of
               his creativity, Hölderlin became, after the first good edition of his work by Norbert
               Hellingrath in the second decade of the twentieth century, a touchstone and a cipher,
               with his body of work enlisted in any number of struggles: ideological, aesthetic,
               and philosophical, as Helen Fehervary has charted. One could see him alternately (and
               mutually exclusively) as a fervent supporter of the French Revolution as well as of
               the rights of man/citizen or as a harbinger of the “fatherland” to come, destined to
               take such horrific shape in the era of Hitler. Something of a cultural history of
               Germany in the long twentieth century could be written by tracking how this one poet
               was read and fought over left and right by the left and the right, with, say, Georg
               Lukács, Adorno and Benjamin on the one (left) hand, as it were, and on the “right”
               hand (including center-right, in political terms) imposing figures such as Max
               Kommerell, and Martin Heidegger, whose complex, adulatory readings throughout the
               1930s and 1940s, including on the theme of the fatherland, were of a piece with any
               number of tenets of fascist ideology, even if his (non- or anti-mimetic) aesthetic
               principles bore little relation to the run-of-the-mill Nazi “scholarship” and
               journalism devoted to the poet.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Kommerell was the
                  author of numerous distinguished essays but also of one notorious book from 1928
                  called <title level="m">The Poet as Führer in German Classicism</title> (a book
                  Benjamin reviewed with decidedly mixed feelings in “Against a Masterpiece,”
                     [<title level="m">Selected Writings</title> 2.378-385]). He was throughout the
                  1920s in the inner circle of the (Stefan) George-Circle, having served as George’s
                  secretary for several years and having studied with Friedrich Gundolf. He broke
                  from the circle at the end of the 20s. He became a party member of the NDSAP in
                  1939. </note> The division even marks the two most extensive editions of
               Hölderlin, with Friedrich Beissner’s so-called <title level="m">Grosse Stuttgarte
                  Ausgabe</title>, begun in the WWII years and supported by the Nazis on one side,
               and on the other the so-called <title level="m">Frankfurter Ausgabe</title> published
               beginning in the 1970s by the <emph>Roter Stern</emph> (Red Star) press, a publisher
               that wears its left-wing politics on its sleeve. The acme of the right-wing use and
               abuse of Hölderlin came with the grotesque Nazification of the poet, when tendentious
               selections of his work were made available to troops in “field editions” by the
               hundreds of thousands in the Second World War. It seems that any number of Nazis were
               happy to overlook the likelihood that when Hölderlin said “fatherland” he most often
               meant Swabia, whose imperial pretensions were zero.</p>
               <p> Hölderlin also poses a particular set of problems for philology, old-school and
               otherwise. If one of the main goals of traditional literary understanding is to get
               at, as far as possible, the author’s intention, that task is rendered more precarious
               than usual, given Hölderlin’s real and perhaps also sometimes feigned madness. His
               late poems are often signed “Scardanelli” and he gives a number of these poems,
               written between 1806 and 1843, dates such as 1748, 1758, 1676, and, most chillingly,
               1940—times when he was not by any measure alive. Any number of philologists/literary
               historians simply ascribe these to a period of madness, but dating the onset and
               severity of madness is not an easy thing at the best of times, and more difficult
               with the patchy records of Hölderlin’s life—to say nothing of the difficulty
               presented by what Paul de Man called “the madness of words” (122). Adorno reacts
               negatively to those who caution about the forbidding character of the difficulties of
               certain literary <emph>oeuvres</emph> (Georg Trakl, Hölderlin, Franz Kafka): such
               difficulties are spurs to understanding, not signals to throw up one’s hands and
               abandon all hope. What is more, subjective intention, for Adorno, even in the
               production of first-person lyric poetry, will be recognized as largely irrelevant.
               Philology, old-school and new, is to be mobilized but it cannot remain simply
               old-school.</p>

                  <p> One is often introduced to Walter Benjamin as the media theorist of “The Work of
                  Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility” or the cultural historian of
                  nineteenth-century Paris in the Arcades project and the writings on Charles
                  Baudelaire. Rarely does one think of him as, in the first instance, a philologist,
                  and yet philology and reflection on it is more than a minor concern of his
                  throughout the various “phases” of his variegated career. In a relatively early
                  letter to Gershom Scholem, after his dissertation on the concept of critique in
                  German Romanticism but before the great <title level="m">Elective
                     Affinities</title> essay, much less the writing (though not the prior
                  conceiving of) the Baroque <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title> book, Benjamin
                  reflects on philology as a topic and a vocation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  terms, how he has “given some thought to philology” and that he “was always aware

                     </note> He goes on to specify and to gloss at some length just what he means by
                  philology, a discipline one might think of as already rather circumscribed:
                     <quote>It seems to me [. . .] that, like all historical research, philology
                     promises the same joys that the Neoplatonists sought in the asceticism of
                     contemplation, but in this instance taken to the extreme. Perfection instead of
                     consummation, the guaranteed extinction of morality (without smothering its
                     fire). It presents one side of history, or better, one layer of what is
                     historical, for which a person may indeed be able to gain regulative and
                     systematic, as well as constitutive, elementary logical concepts; but the
                     connection between them must remain hidden. I define philology, not as the
                     science or history of language, but as the <emph>history of terminology</emph>
                     at its deepest level. In doing this, a most puzzling concept of time and very
                     puzzling phenomena must surely be taken into consideration. If I am not
                     mistaken, I have an idea of what you are getting at, without being able to
                     elaborate on it, when you suggest that philology is close to history viewed as
                     a chronicle. The chronicle is fundamentally interpolated history. Philological
                     interpolation in chronicles simply reveals in its form the intention of its
                     content, since its content interpolates history. (176)</quote> One observes how
                  the apparent delimitation of philology—a history <emph>only</emph> of
                  terminology—nonetheless quickly leads to history in general and to one of its
                  fundamental narrative modes, the chronicle, just by virtue of the fact that one
                  would have to come to terms with terms over and in time. Benjamin is certainly
                  right that the notion of time entailed—elaborated by him elsewhere—is puzzling and
                  he wonders aloud whether his “oracular pronouncements about philology” would be of
                  any use to Scholem (176). One can imagine why Scholem, in a letter that does not
                  survive, might have proposed the chronicle as a historiographical analogue to
                  philology. If the chronicle aims to record in neutral, more or less objective
                  fashion what is pertinent about a historical event or series of events (one notes
                  what is noteworthy, as it were), then it would seem to correspond to philology’s
                  goal of presenting or accounting for all that is significant in a text. Benjamin
                  would much later, in the theses “On the Concept of History” drafted close to the
                  end of his life, posit the chronicle as a model for historiographical plenitude
                  insofar as it does not distinguish between great and small, thus allowing for the
                  redemption, at some future date, of the totality of a given past: <quote>The
                     chronicler who narrates events without distinguishing between major and minor
                     ones in accord with the following truth: nothing that has ever happened should
                     be regarded as lost to history. Of course only a redeemed mankind is granted
                     the fullness of its past—which is to say, only for a redeemed mankind has its
                     past become citable in all its moments. Each moment it has lived becomes a

                     “Interpolationen: Benjamins Philologie” on Benjamin’s tendency to move from the

                  Benjamin’s letter to Scholem of 1921 the chronicle is a rather different matter.
                  Benjamin determines it as “interpolated history,” a kind of intervention of
                  history in history.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a superb set of
                     reflections on the chronicle as interpolation, and more generally, for the
                     status of interpolation for Benjaminian philology, see “Interpolationen:
                     Benjamins Philologie.” </note> His model for interpolation, as he explains to
                  Scholem, is the allegorical tale of a miniature woman by Goethe, “Die neue
                  Melusine” (“The new Melusina”), that is inserted into the vast encompassing
                  narrative of <title level="m">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</title> (<title level="m">Wilhelm Meister’s Journeyman Years</title>). The fact of
                  interpolation—even if the interpolation of a history—suggests an intervention, a
                  construction, not simply the neutral representation of what has happened, even if
                  that is what it “contains.” But the chronicle seems to be, in Benjamin’s
                  conception, representation <emph>and</emph> intervention, record <emph>and</emph>
                  event. Benjamin writes to Scholem, after re-reading his correspondent’s (lost)
                  letter: “Chronicle, interpolation, commentary, philology—they all have
                     <emph>one</emph> nexus” (<title level="m">C </title>176). Each of the items in
                  this series is at one time or other throughout Benjamin’s corpus conceived, via a
                  protocol or almost a habit of thought, as something other than a belated mimetic
                  version of what has preceded it. </p>
                  <p>The insistence on the desirability and inescapability of philology, reflected on
                  so searchingly in 1921, is never really left behind in Benjamin’s work, not even
                  in what turned out to be the last years of his life. When in the 1930’s Benjamin
                  was devoting a good deal of his energy to combating forms of fascism, he saw his
                  massive, unfinished, perhaps un-finishable book on Baudelaire and the Arcades as
                  bound up with that struggle, indeed part and parcel of his political thinking. The
                  status of philology in all this was rather fraught, as became clear in the
                  exchanges between Benjamin and Adorno about the former’s work on Baudelaire.
                  Having eagerly awaited Benjamin’s long-in-the-works work, Adorno, on first reading
                  it, could not conceal his disappointment with what Benjamin had produced, charging
                  it especially with an inattention to <emph>mediation</emph> in its shuttling—one
                  might say lurching—from the macro-and micro-economic to the works of culture,
                  which Benjamin had thought legible in Baudelaire’s poems and their milieu of
                  production (<title level="m">CC </title>280ff).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                  Countering Adorno’s various charges, Benjamin wrote back the following on December
                  9, 1938: <quote>When you speak of a “wide-eyed presentation of mere facts” you are
                     characterizing the proper philological attitude. This had to be embedded in the
                     construction as such and not only for the sake of results. The indifference
                     between magic and positivism must, as you so aptly put it, be liquidated. In
                     other words, the philological interpretation of the author should be preserved
                     and overcome [<emph>aufgehoben</emph>] in Hegelian fashion by the dialectical
                     materialist. Philology is the examination of a text, which, proceeding on the
                     basis of details, magically fixates the reader on the text. What Faust took
                     home in black and white is closely related to Grimm’s devotion to little
                     things. They have in common that magical element whose exorcism is reserved for
                     philosophy, here to the final part. (<title level="m">C</title> 587)</quote>
                  The allusion to Goethe’s <title level="m">Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy
                  </title>invokes the episode where a student says “<foreign>Denn, was man schwarz
                     auf weiss besitzt,/ Kann man getrost nach Hause tragen</foreign>” (“What one
                  possesses in black in white, one can take home with confidence [literally,
                  “consoled’]”), a saying that, when spoken in the presence of Mephistopheles, comes
                  across as naïve (lines 1966-67, “Studierzimmer” 2). The student sounds guilty of
                  simply taking the text at its word and partaking of the ethos of the
                  wide-eyed-ness of (a certain) philology. The other reference to the great
                  philologist Jakob Grimm is perhaps apocryphal; nonetheless, Benjamin invokes it at
                  least twice, and one other place he does so is in his essay “Rigorous Study of
                  Art” where he praises this attention to (even) insignificant things as “the spirit
                  of true philology” (<title level="m">SW</title> 2.668). Nothing, in principle,
                  escapes philology, and in this it resembles, once again, the chronicle, the mode
                  of historiography that avoids weighing matters in a balance, distinguishing
                  between great and small, as Benjamin outlines it in the “Theses.” Everything
                  remains to be read, and to be read again, later, otherwise.</p>
                  <p> In his response to Adorno, what Benjamin conjures with one hand—the magic of
                  philology’s fixation on the text—is spirited away with the other hand, the more or
                  less tight fist of dialectical materialism, though one might not be mistaken in
                  thinking Benjamin wants to have it both ways, especially if we understand the
                  emphasis in “sublated” (“<foreign>aufgehoben</foreign>”) as indicating
                  preservation. (The term <foreign>aufheben</foreign> can mean to negate, preserve
                  and/or raise to a higher level, and often in Hegel means all three at once.)
                  Benjamin never had much time for Hegel, but the mechanism of
                     <foreign>Aufhebung</foreign> was congenial to him as a negatively dialectical
                  concept/figure with affinities to the dynamics of fulfillment or completion so
                  crucial to how he thought culture and history worked. In any event, Benjamin goes
                  on to assuage Adorno on the score of a certain philology’s eventual disappearance:
                     <quote>The appearance of closed facticity which attaches to a philosophical
                     investigation and places the investigator under its spell, fades to the extent
                     that the object is construed in an historical perspective. The base lines of
                     this construction converge in our own historical experience. (<title level="m">CC </title>292)</quote> In these lines we glimpse the linkage of (the new,
                  rethought) philology to the outlines of Benjamin’s now familiar but still
                  challenging theory of historical understanding that entails, instead of grand
                  historical, causal narratives, the <emph>construction</emph> and articulation of
                  two moments: of the knowing and the known, the citing and the cited. If there
                  still is any lingering doubt about the import of philology for Benjamin’s later
                  thinking, one should consider this remarkable, lapidary pronouncement in the
                  drafts to his “Theses on the Concept of History,” which is also to say the
                  theoretical underpinnings of the Arcades project: “The historical method is a
                  philological one” (<title level="m">SW</title> 4.405). Enigmatic in this form, the
                  pronouncement is less so in the larger passage from which it comes: <quote>If one
                     wants to consider history as a text, then one can say of it what a recent
                     author says of literary texts—namely, that the past has left in it images,
                     comparable to those registered by a light-sensitive plate. “The future alone
                     has developer at its disposal strong enough to allow the image to appear in all
                     its details. Some pages in Marivaux or Rousseau contain a secret sense, which
                     the contemporary reader could not have deciphered completely.” The historical
                     method is a philological one, whose foundation is the book of the world. “Read
                     what was never written,” says Hofmannsthal. The reader, to be thought of here,
                     is the true historian. (<title level="m">SW</title> 4.405; translation
                     modified).</quote> It’s hard to overestimate how much of Benjamin’s work
                  throughout the 1930s was devoted to figuring out how history works, in general and
                  in kinds and examples of its particulars. It is thus of considerable importance
                  for our understanding of the status of philology in his thinking that he
                  determines the historical method he outlines and practices as a
                     <emph>philological</emph> one. This seems consistent with his perhaps enigmatic
                  pronouncement to Scholem that philology required one to think through a “puzzling
                  notion of time,” just what Benjamin did from roughly 1920 to 1940. Over time
                  Benjamin gradually crafted a theory of history and its epistemology that
                  stipulated that: <quote>Articulating the past historically means recognizing those
                     elements in the past which come together in the constellation of one and the
                     same moment. Historical knowledge is uniquely and only possible in the
                     historical moment. But cognition in the historical moment, however, is always
                     cognition of a moment. Insofar as the past gathers itself together in a
                     moment—in a dialectical image—it enters into the involuntary memory of mankind.
                        (<title level="m">SW</title> 4.403; translation modified)</quote> That
                  historical knowledge only occurs as a relation of one moment to another is one
                  reason why the models for it are reading and citation. Such knowledge is even
                  enacted <emph>as</emph> history, as the charged examples of revolution make plain:
                  the French Revolution “<emph>cited</emph>” the Roman one (Thesis XIV) and the
                  revolutionaries of July 1830 reiterated Joshua’s stopping of the sun (Thesis XV),
                  along the lines of what Karl Marx had outlined as revolution’s <foreign>modus
                     operandi</foreign> in the opening pages of <title level="m">The Eighteenth
                     Brumaire </title>(<title level="m">SW</title> 4.395). It is not just that our
                  knowledge of history is mediated by reading and citation: it is
                     <emph>structured</emph> as they are, as the encounter in and of a more or less
                  determinate present with a more or less determinate moment in and of the past, of
                  one act of language with another, or of an act of language with something other
                  than language. </p>
                  <p> In his response to Adorno on the charge of being too philological, Benjamin
                  introduces some other key categories pertinent to our thinking through the
                  possibilities and parameters of philology, categories that will be crucial for
                  Adorno in his understanding of Hölderlin and for his aesthetic theory in general:
                     <quote>If you think of other writings of mine, you will find that a critique of
                     the attitude of the philologist is an old concern of mine, and it is basically
                     identical with the critique of myth. Yet in each case it is this critique that
                     provokes the philological effort itself. To use the language of <title level="m">Elective Affinities </title>[Benjamin’s essay on Goethe’s novel,
                     not the novel itself] it presses for the exhibition of the material content in
                     which the truth content can be historically revealed. (<title level="m">CC
                     </title>292)</quote> Once again, Benjamin appears to have it both ways,
                  defending the philological texture of his Baudelaire work and saying he has long
                  prosecuted a critique of the attitude of the philologist. The inadequacy of some
                  philology requires more, better, different philology. Benjamin rightly invokes his
                  “epoch-making” essay on <title level="m">Elective Affinities</title>: there
                  Benjamin elaborates a theory—adumbrated in the early Hölderlin essay—whereby a
                  work of art possesses both subject matter or material content
                     (<foreign>Sachgehalt</foreign>) and truth content
                     (<foreign>Wahrheitsgehalt</foreign>) in a dialectical, historically changing
                  fashion. The effect of time passing is to disentangle or pry apart these two
                  aspects of the work that are conjoined at the moment of production. According to
                  Benjamin, a basic law of literature dictates that: “ [. . .]the more significant
                  the work, the more inconspicuously and intimately its truth content is bound up
                  with its material content.” With that passage of time, however, “truth content
                  always remains to the same extent hidden as the material content comes to the
                  fore” (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.297). Critique, Benjamin maintains, is
                  concerned with the truth content of a work of art and commentary with its subject
                  matter, but it becomes clear that the ideal philologist—and later the historical
                  materialist whose work is modeled on philology—necessarily engages both, not least
                  because the character of the relation between truth content and subject matter
                  alters with every significant change in and over time. Reading, for this reason,
                  is what Benjamin sometimes calls, after the German Romantics, “an infinite task,”
                  even if each and every reading is finite, punctual (<title level="m">SW</title>
                  4.402).</p>

                  <p> Let us turn now to Benjamin’s early (and in his lifetime, unpublished) essay
                  modestly entitled “Two Poems by Friedrich Hölderlin,” dating from the early years
                  of the First World War. It’s not easy to know what to make of this essay,
                  considered by him and others his first major literary study. It appears to have
                  been a highly charged text for him, not least as its subject matter—poems
                  featuring the death of the poet or readiness for death on the part of the poet—is
                  intimately bound up with the then-recent death of his friend, Friedrich Heinle, a
                  poet who committed suicide rather than be conscripted into military service. Yet
                  quite aside from any personal resonance, it is an elusive, oddly textured essay.
                  One paragraph extends for almost five pages. A good deal of it seems almost
                  mystical (Scholem called it “deeply metaphysical” [<title level="m">SW</title> 1.
                  36]), riddled with epigonal, arch-Goethean language: “inner form,” “innermost,”
                  “quintessence,” and so on. At one point Benjamin even uses the word “mystical” is
                  an apparently approving tone (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.34). The essay was
                  never published in his lifetime, and Benjamin did not return to the central
                  category explored in his text. Almost only readers of Benjamin would do so, one of
                  them being none other than Theodor Adorno.</p>
                  <p> At the conceptual center of the essay is a category for which Benjamin had to
                  fashion an unheard-of word or dredge up a forgotten one: “<foreign>das
                     Gedichtete</foreign>.” It could be rendered as the “poeticized” or “poetized”
                  (Ralph Waldo Emerson’s term, adopted for the Harvard edition) or “poematized”
                  (McCall’s rendition). “<foreign>Das Gedichtete”</foreign> was, and is, a very
                  unusual term. No less than Goethe used (perhaps coined?) the term, if only in
                  conversation, when he claimed “<foreign>Das Gedichtete behauptet sein Recht, wie
                     das Geschehene</foreign>” (“The poetized [i.e. what has become poetry] claims
                  its right just as much as what has happened”) but Goethe gives it no technical or
                  special force (22.650). The term seems not have taken hold for about one hundred
                  years and then was invoked fleetingly, though in charged circumstances.</p>
                  <p> It is a term that, strikingly, Heidegger would later also invent—or
                  re-invent—decades after Benjamin. For all their massive differences, Benjamin and
                  Heidegger find common ground in this term and for a common reason, namely, a sense
                  that the time-honored metaphysical distinction between form and content seems
                  inadequate to do justice to whatever it is that Hölderlin writes, what he poetizes
                  or poeticizes. Here is how Benjamin characterizes what he, almost for the first
                  time, calls <foreign>das Gedichtete</foreign>: <quote>As a category of aesthetic
                     investigation, the poetized differs decisively from the form-content model by
                     preserving within itself the fundamental aesthetic unity of form and content.
                     Instead of separating them, it distinctively stamps in itself their immanent
                     necessary connection [. . .]. In the unity of form and content [. . .] the
                     poetized shares one of the most essential characteristics with the poem itself.
                     It too is built on the basic law of the artistic organism. It differs from the
                     poem as a limit-concept, as the concept of its task
                     [<foreign>Aufgabe</foreign>] not simply through some fundamental characteristic
                     but solely through its greater determinability
                        [<foreign>Bestimmbarkeit</foreign>]; the poetized is a loosening up of the
                     firm functional coherence that reigns in the poem itself, and it cannot arise
                     otherwise than by disregarding certain determinations, so that the meshing, the
                     functional unity of the other elements is made evident. (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.19) </quote> There are other glosses on and identifications of
                  just what “<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>” is, such as “the synthetic unity of the
                  intellectual and perceptual orders” (19) but it is remarkable in the passage above
                  that is said to be characterized “<emph>solely</emph> through its determinability”
                  (my emphasis). “Determinability” is of those categories Benjamin so often invokes
                  featuring the suffix “-ability,” a gesture whose consequences Samuel Weber has
                  analyzed in exemplary fashion in <title level="m">Benjamin’s -abilities</title>.
                  Such terms denote the condition of possibility of the realization of “x” rather
                  than its empirical realization. “Determinability” is a term replete with
                  virtuality. As it happens, in the poems Benjamin singles out for scrutiny, the
                  greater presence or absence of determination will be not only a defining
                  structural feature of <emph>das Gedichtete</emph> but also a value, such that the
                  greater determination of one poem over another will be the very sign of its
                  superiority.</p>
                  <p> Benjamin uses the phrase “aesthetic commentary” to characterize his undertaking,
                  “commentary” usually having designated (more so in his day than ours) a mode of
                  dealing with a text engaged within the discipline of classical philology.
                  Benjamin’s commentary is in the spirit of what he thinks of as philology “in the
                  expanded field,” one might say, even if here he does not call it philology
                     here.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In a very fine analysis of the essay,
                     and the fullest that we have, Alexander Honold is likely right to maintain that
                     Benjamin’s project is “<foreign>weniger philologisch als aesthetisch</foreign>”
                     (“less philological than aesthetic”) (53), though that is partly a matter of
                     texture rather than content. </note> Benjamin juxtaposes two poems of
                  Hölderlin’s so-called mature period (he was around thirty years old), poems so
                  closely allied that they could be considered “versions” of each other, as they
                  share numerous identical or similar formulations and formal features. The analysis
                  is prosecuted in the mode of immanent critique. We are not informed of any dates,
                  nor given a recognizable historical content or a framework in the history of
                  ideas, nor much that is pertinent from the history of literature or other examples
                  of the genre. Even though “the poeticized” is considered a limit-concept between
                  life and poem, we are alerted that we will learn nothing of the poet’s life. And
                  yet Benjamin’s text, in a way that seems to go beyond quoting, paraphrasing, or
                  mimicking Hölderlin’s, engages “the living,” “the people,” and nothing less than
                  the cosmos. This all could still be understood as immanent criticism, as only
                  having to do with the imaginary of the poem, but when Benjamin repeatedly refers,
                  for example, to “this world” (<foreign>diese Welt</foreign>) the analysis seems to
                  burst, at moments, the immanent borders it erected in the first place (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.25, 32ff)</p>
                  <p> It is also immanent <emph>critique</emph> insofar as it allows for and demands
                  judgment or evaluation, <foreign>Beurteilung</foreign>, even judgment of its
                  truth, which is not necessarily a concern of all philological endeavors.
                  Commentary usually entails going through everything of real significance in a
                  poem, down to, in the spirit of Jakob Grimm, its “details.” Benjamin might be said
                  to have done just that, in a dense twenty or so pages on two short poems. It is
                  literally an essay in “comparative literature,” though within one and the same
                  language, comparing what could be considered two poems with an elective affinity
                  or two versions of the “same” poem. In the confrontation, the first version,
                  “Dichtermut” (“The Poet’s Courage”), emerges as almost systematically lacking in
                  relation to the final version or later poem “Blödigkeit” (“Timidity”). Benjamin
                  not only analyzes but critiques the first version (or the first poem) in terms of
                  its artificial mythologizing, posing the negative category of mythology against
                  what is, for the moment, the far more positive category of myth, the latter
                  implying a certain “inner greatness and structure of the elements” (20).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Across the spectrum of Benjamin’s diverse works
                     the valence of the term “myth” can be charged as positive, negative, or
                     neutral. </note> The first poem celebrates or exhorts the poet’s courage,
                  seeming to tie his (or, less likely, her) fate to the fates unduly or, even more,
                  to the overriding figure of the sun god that dominates the final stanzas and helps
                  account for the possibility of a “beautiful death.” By contrast, the later poem
                  vaults beyond the “sun-god” (<foreign>Sonnengott</foreign>) to the “god of the
                  heavens” (<foreign>des Himmels Gott</foreign>), which Benjamin judges to be more
                  mythical than mythological, one of numerous instances of it deepening the earlier
                     version.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McCall rightly notes the latter as
                     an example of Hölderlin’s signature periphrasis (para. 18). </note> The first
                  version presents an “impenetrability of relation,” even as it invokes any number
                  of distinct and seemingly related entities, whereas the second poem operates
                  according to the law of identity (in the good sense, because dialectical). All
                  unities in the latter poem already appear in intensive “interpenetration.” One can
                  grasp the structure of relations, whereby “the identity of each individual being
                  is a function of an infinite chain of series in which the poeticized
                     unfolds.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a painstaking analysis of the
                     grand distinction between the two texts as examples of a “substance poem” and a
                     “function poem,” see Peter Fenves. </note> It presents “the spatiotemporal
                  interpenetration of all configurations in a spiritual quintessence, the poeticized
                  that is identical with life” (<title level="m">SW </title>1.24, 25). By stark
                  contrast, the first poem stagnates in the felt “immediacy” of life, atomizing
                  entities, in an indeterminate or underdetermined way: abstract expressionism, as
                  it were.</p>
                  <p> The first poem, “Dichtermut” (“The Poet’s Courage”), is found to be, in effect,
                  not true to itself but then it finds its truth in “Blödigket” (“Timidity”), a poem
                  that literally invokes the category of truth. Whereas the second line of
                  “Dichtermut” reads: “<foreign>Nährt zum Dienste denn nicht selber die Parze
                     dich</foreign>?” (“Does not the Parca [fate] herself nourish you for
                  service?”), its later transformation in “Blödigkeit” reads “<foreign>Geht auf
                     Wahrem dein Fuss nicht</foreign>?” (“Does not your foot tread on truth [what is
                  true], as upon carpets?”). This latter, startling line—much like the extraordinary
                  phrase from “Dichtermut” “<foreign>zur Wende der Zeit</foreign>,” (“at the turning
                  of time”)—seems of a piece with any number of features adding up what Benjamin
                  discerns as a deepening of thought and figure in the second poem, which is also to
                  say its truth. It’s not that the explicit invocation of “what is true”
                     (<foreign>das Wahre</foreign>) guarantees the truth of that utterance, but it
                  does lodge the possibility of truth, however poetic, in the consciousness of the
                     reader.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Readers coming to Benjamin’s essay
                     from outside the German philosophical tradition might be surprised by the
                     emphasis on truth, but such emphasis is virtually a constant in German
                     aesthetic theory in Friedrich Schelling, G.W.F. Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger,
                     Benjamin, Adorno, and more. </note> The second poem or later version of the
                  first poem is, among other things, the critique of the first: the second
                  articulates the truth that the first failed to, the truth of relationality. It
                  performs its own truth of greater determination. From early on in his thinking
                  Benjamin tended to follow Friedrich Schlegel, the principal author addressed in
                  his dissertation, in his positing that the work of art, of its own accord, called
                  for critique—and that critique was not something accidental that might or might
                  not befall a work of art. The work of art, for which Schlegel’s model was Goethe’s
                     <title level="m">Wilhelm Meister</title>—a highly self-conscious,
                  self-reflexive novel—is a medium of reflection, which is also to say, for Schegel
                  and for Benjamin after him, a medium of self-reflection. Moreover, as
                  self-reflection, the work of art is in some sense the first, more or less
                  encrypted instance of the very critique it calls for. The chain is, in principle,
                  infinite: there is no end to the call for critique. In our case: Hölderlin’s poems
                  demand the critique of a sort that Benjamin delivers, and Benjamin’s text arguably
                  provokes a reading along the lines delivered by Tom McCall.</p>
                  <p> The power of Tom McCall’s formidable essay “<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.plastic_poetic.html">Plastic Time and Poetic
                     Middles: Benjamin’s Hölderlin</ref>” lies in the tenacity with which he tracks
                  the rhetoric and thinking of Benjamin and the rigor with which he articulates the
                  stakes involved. McCall rightly refrains from inscribing Hölderlin, following
                  Benjamin, into a tradition rife with a post-Platonic and quasi-Biblical ethos of
                  inspiration (or its naturalized equivalents, as in Wordsworth) thought to have
                  granted Romantic poetry a good deal of its authenticity and authority. Instead
                  McCall underscores how Hölderlin’s activity operates in the realm of what the poet
                  calls “lawful calculation.” It is governed by what McCall glosses as “a strict,
                  lawful, and rule-governed poetics, with its calculus and quasi-machinal functions”
                  (para. 3). Benjamin proposes, in keeping with such a poetics, a schema of
                  functions and relations that would account for how Hölderlin’s poetry works. As we
                  have seen, the two poems Benjamin elects to compare relate to each other in such a
                  way that the later poem emerges as a deepening, more intense, more determinate
                  version of its predecessor. Indeed, in some sense, its fulfillment: a motif and
                  structure that characterizes a dynamic built into each of Benjamin’s central
                  categories of language, translation, critique, and history. </p>
                  <p> In the circumscribed context of Benjamin’s intense study of two short poems, the
                  fulfillment—via greater determination, deepening, and intensification—of one poem
                  in a later one sounds like an unequivocally good thing. That dynamic, is enveloped
                  in a nexus of terms such as “innermost,” “quintessence,” inner form,” all of which
                  articulate aspects of <emph>das Gedichtete</emph>, the posited unity of form and
                  content, as well as the unity of the intellectual and perceptual orders. What
                  could be better? </p>
                  <p> McCall’s essay is tenacious in tracking any number of elements and
                  rhetorical/conceptual moves in Benjamin’s essay that work against any ideal notion
                  of <emph>das Gedichtete</emph> or the “aesthetic organism” whose inner form it is.
                  Honing in on the middle (<foreign>Mitte</foreign>) Benjamin posits as organizing
                  the Hölderlin poem which consists of its various “functions,” McCall notes:
                     <quote>It is the multiplicity of functions that constitutes Benjamin’s special
                        <foreign>topos</foreign> of “the <emph>Middle</emph>” [<foreign>die
                        Mitte</foreign>] of the poem—which, as “the untouchable middle of all
                     relation” (125), is not the actual stanzaic mid-point of the poem but a
                     conceptual repository for the irreducibly unrecognizable modalities of the
                     signifying process, and for the ultimately undiscoverable relations linking
                     already enacted meanings to their productive “functions.” The Benjaminian
                        <foreign>topos</foreign> of “the Middle” is the means taken to mark out the
                     way in which both the poem, and the tradition informing it, become aporetic for
                     criticism—no longer simple readable and understandable, but more of a task—when
                     the reading turns on the issue of calculation rather than inspiration and its
                     associated concepts. (para. 8)</quote> In what might sound like a bleak,
                  extreme reformulation of Benjamin’s argument in his reading of Hölderlin, McCall
                  is in effect almost only noting and synthesizing what Benjamin says in various
                  passages and then drawing the consequences. Whereas some readers of Benjamin might
                  focus on the literally central notion of “the middle,” McCall draws our attention
                  to its qualification as “unapproachable” and has us pause over it, not content to
                  proceed to the possibly more satisfying or comforting notion/figure of the middle.
                  Here, and in general, McCall’s essay also has the virtue of tying Benjamin’s
                  analyses back to some of its sources in the poetological writings of Hölderlin,
                  which display an idealist framework and almost stubbornly balanced, dialectical
                  prose that is easy to misread if one emphasizes the play of its master terms and
                  overlooks their complicating qualifications. McCall’s rigor tracks Benjamin’s
                  rigor tracking Hölderlin’s rigor, and the result is that we see what is actually
                  happening in the text.</p>
                  <p> The complexity of McCall’s analysis is raised a notch or two when he shows how
                  the passage from the “substance” poem of “Dichtermut” to the greater determination
                  of “Blödigkeit” in effect shows that the problematic identified with the posited
                  notion of “the middle” results in the project of a second-order “lyric of
                  criticism”: <quote> [. . .] at the “middle” of the poem “the sum-total of all
                     functions” (124) is indeed to be located, but in relations of identity so
                     embedded, so inaccessible in their totality, that such identifications can
                     exist only in the mode of a “task” [<foreign>Aufgabe</foreign>] to be
                     undertaken again and again, but destined to fail. The unavoidable
                     incompleteness of reading the lyric engenders the construct of “the poematized”
                        [<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>], a sort of secondary “lyric of criticism” or
                     metapoem abstracted from the actual poem [<foreign>das Gedicht</foreign>],
                     imposed as a task and existing to make those relation-functions of the poem
                     available to criticism in a more visible and determinate form: “The principle
                     of the poematized generally is the sole <emph>sovereignty of relation</emph>”
                        [<foreign>Alleinherrschaft der Beziehung</foreign> (124)]. (para. 12)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The page numbers internal to McCall’s quotation

                     </quote> Philology, Werner Hamacher maintains, tends to extend philology (which
                  begins with poetry as “first philology”), and here we see a brilliant example of
                  McCall extending what in some sense is already present in Benjamin’s essay (“95
                  Theses” 26-7). By determining the character of poetry as a matter of
                  determinability and casting the latter of the two poems as a matter of greater
                  determination in relation to the first, the latter poem in effect resembles the
                  work of interpretive philology, which likewise consists of articulating relations
                  of greater determination (by deciding on some possibilities and excluding others,
                  even if the decision is to point to an ambiguity). </p>
                  <p>In the passage above, McCall in effect undermines in advance what could sound like
                  Benjamin’s triumphant proclamation of “the sole sovereignty of relation” that
                  constitutes <emph>das Gedichtete</emph>. But then here too he is really only
                  following Benjamin’s lead, following Hölderlin, by unpacking what is at stake and
                  calling into question the character of that sovereignty, as he does again in this
                  related passage: <quote>For Benjamin, the Hölderlin text is the self-reading (or
                     metacommentary) of the inaccessibility to analysis of its unity functions; the
                     failure of penetration in this self-reading [. . .] becomes the very condition
                     of possibility for the phenomenal unity the poem is able to achieve. The
                     possibility of “materialization” [<foreign>Versachlichung</foreign>], as of
                     unity itself, arises from the <emph>density</emph> of relations “at the
                     middle”—a density too “thick” (the <foreign>dicht</foreign> of
                        “<foreign>Dichtung</foreign>”) in the interrelations of its functions to be
                     differentiated in criticism. Aesthetic unity depends here, as elsewhere, upon
                     the impossibility of a complete critical disarticulation. This density is
                     associated with a certain “violence” of tragico-mythical relata [. . .] the
                     textual symptom of which is the displayed unity of the lyric. Immanence, the
                     poetic middle, is a function of the violence (forcefulness, density,
                     “thickness”) of those identity relations it harbors; without the closeness and
                     tightness, i.e. violence, of relations, there would be no (“untouchable”)
                     immanence. (para. 17)</quote> The great theme of so many of Tom McCall’s
                  essays—the violence of language, the violence of the aesthetic—is elucidated here
                  apropos the category at the center of Benjamin’s essay, <emph>das
                     Gedichtete</emph> as the “untouchable middle.” This phantom middle is said by
                  Benjamin to be a “product [<foreign>Erzeugnis</foreign>] and object
                     [<foreign>Gegenstand</foreign>]” (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.19) of the
                  analysis, one more way in which the constructed (non-natural) synthetic unity of
                  the poem is like the philological project that will attempt to understand it, with
                  the task, the <foreign>Aufgabe</foreign>, of philology responding to and in some
                  sense repeating the task of the poem. </p>

                  <p> The specter of “<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>” surfaces again in Theodor Adorno’s
                  late, formidable essay “Parataxis: On Hölderlin’s Late Poetry.” Despite being a
                  voracious reader of literature and much else, Adorno could hardly be called a
                  philologist. In responding to Adorno’s rather severe critique of his work on
                  Baudelaire, Benjamin opened one of his letters with the decidedly testy line:
                     “<foreign>On est philologue ou on ne l’est pas</foreign>” (“Either one is a
                  philologist or one is not”) (<title level="m">C</title> 596). Yet this
                  non-philologist, Adorno, whose writings on literature account for about 1/20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his published work, and an equally small portion of the
                     <foreign>Nachlass</foreign>, comes to write about Hölderlin some fifty years
                  after Benjamin’s essay on the poet, and is clearly in his old and older friend’s
                  debt. Adorno’s essay originated as an address before the Hölderlin Society
                     (<foreign>Hölderlin-Gesellschaft</foreign>), which is to say, before an
                  audience filled mainly with (modern) philologists.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an illuminating, thorough account of the occasion of the
                     address and the polemical character of essay (written largely contra
                     Heidegger), see Robert Savage, <title level="m">Hölderlin after the
                        Catastrophe: Heidegger—Adorno—Brecht</title>. </note> Adorno begins by
                  acknowledging the many advances in the understanding of Hölderlin via philology in
                  the narrow and broad senses. Indeed, remarkable strides had been made since, say,
                  Nietzsche only had access to Hölderlin’s work in partial, unsatisfactory fashion
                  and when extended commentary on the poet’s corpus was almost non-existent.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> There are exceptions to the rule, such as the
                     astonishing monograph from 1896 <title level="m">Hölderlins “Brod und
                        Wein’</title>:<title level="m"> ein exegetischer Versuch</title> by Emil
                     Petzold, a high school teacher. </note> But already in the opening paragraph,
                  Adorno challenges what would have been axiomatic for a good many in his audience:
                  “The difficulty of these authors does not prohibit interpretation so much as
                  demand it. According that axiom, knowledge of literary works would consist in the
                  reconstruction of what the author intended. But the firm foundation philology
                  imagines it possesses has proved unstable” (“Parataxis” 109). Against the
                  pervasive tendency of philology to take authorial intention as a basis for guiding
                  interpretation, Adorno argues that “What unfolds and becomes visible in the works,
                  the source of their authority, is none other than the truth manifested objectively
                  in them, the truth that consumes the subjective intention and leaves it behind as
                  irrelevant” (110). Whereas this may be true in general, Adorno is interested in
                  registering its consequences in the vexed case of Hölderlin, for whom the subject
                  has a special, historically constituted status, not least for his singular (but in
                  some respects, not-so-singular) relation to language.</p>
                  <p> The “starting-point” for philology, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff contended in his
                  history of the discipline, is “a feeling of wonder in the presence of what we do
                  not understand” [“<foreign>das Verwundern über das Unverstandene</foreign>”] (1).
                  Adorno recognizes, as we noted above, that philology has proved itself capable of
                  putting us in a position to understand some texts and things better, and yet that
                  there are limits to that philological understanding even or especially regarding
                  what is arguably the most essential: <quote>What philological explanation is
                     compelled to clear out of the way nevertheless fails to disappear from what
                     first Benjamin and later Heidegger called “<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>,” that
                     which has been composed poetically. This moment, which eludes the grasp of
                     philology, inherently demands interpretation. It is the moment that is obscure
                     in literary works, not what is thought in them, that necessitates recourse to
                     philosophy. (“Parataxis” 111-12) </quote> Adorno, who would have been among the
                  first to read Benjamin’s unpublished essay, invokes the notion of <emph>das
                     Gedichtete</emph>, the poetized, as if it is an apt, useful category in
                  thinking through Hölderlin. In it, Adorno too sees a category that helps to
                  overcome clunky distinctions of form and content which he finds, unsurprisingly,
                  not to have been thought through in sufficiently (read, negatively) dialectical
                  fashion. Yet unlike Benjamin, for whom the analysis of <emph>das Gedichtete</emph>
                  is the endpoint of the analysis, for Adorno the provocation for poetry and the
                  poeticized demand translation into philosophy. For Benjamin, as we saw, the
                  dynamics of each of language, translation, critique, and history demanded that any
                  given entity be thought in terms of translation and even fulfillment. Adorno
                  specifies in no uncertain terms that it is philosophy that is to come to terms
                  with poetry, since poetry and philosophy have a common object in <emph>truth
                     content</emph>. But not just <emph>any</emph> philosophy or philosophical
                  approach—Adorno’s essay features a stinging critique of Heidegger as a reader of
                  Hölderlin, in the same spirit as <title level="m">The Jargon of
                     Authenticity</title>, but here attack is more pointed. Though Heidegger can
                  surely be admired for the seriousness with which he takes Hölderlin’s poetry,
                  Adorno sees him as making some arch-philological and arch-philosophical errors in
                  explicating Hölderlin—not least in rendering him too philosophical—by focusing on
                  what is enunciated as if it were articulated in the mode of statements,
                     <foreign>Aussagen</foreign>. Certainly Hölderlin’s poetry is riddled, to an
                  unusual degree, with quasi-philosophical dicta such as “<foreign>Es ereignet sich
                     aber das Wahre</foreign>” (“But what is true emerges”) and the like. To
                  Adorno’s mind, Heidegger, in his zeal to enlist Hölderlin’s judgments on this or
                  that matter of content (the fatherland, truth, etc.) tends to sacrifice form and
                  language, with all its complicated configurations, such that Hölderlin’s poetry
                  appears sometimes reduced to a series of more or less debatable sayings or
                  positions.</p>
                  <p>The understanding of Hölderlin, however, is helped partly by Heidegger in taking
                  up, independently, the very category Benjamin too had stumbled on or had been
                  forced to invent. Adorno acknowledges the possibilities it affords for thinking
                  through Hölderlin, even as he does something a little different than either of his
                  forerunners. As he says in the following remarkable footnote: <quote>The
                     concretization of the poetic substance (<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>), a
                     desideratum which Hölderlin too experienced as binding—his whole mature work
                     asks mutely how it is possible for a poetry that has shaken off the illusion of
                     the close at hand to become concrete—takes place only through language. The
                     function of language in Hölderlin qualitatively outweighs the usual function of
                     poetic language. If his poetry can no longer trust naively either to the
                     poetically chosen word or to living experience, it hopes to attain bodily
                     presence through the constellation of words and in fact from a constellation
                     that is not satisfied with the form of the logical judgment. As a unity, the
                     latter levels out the multiplicity that lies within the words; Hölderlin is
                     after connection, which allows words, which are condemned to abstractness, to
                     sound, as it were, again. The first strophe from “Brod und Wein” (“Bread and
                     Wine”) is paradigmatic for this and extraordinarily effective. It does not
                     restore the simple, general words it uses but instead links them to one another
                     in a manner that reworks the strangeness proper to them (<foreign>ihre eigene
                        Fremdheit</foreign>), their simplicity, which is already an abstract
                     quality, to make it an expression of alienation
                     (<foreign>Entfremdung</foreign>). Such constellations have moved across into
                     the paratactic, even where parataxis does not emerge fully in the grammatical
                     form or the construction of the poem. (339-340, trans. modified)</quote> What
                  Heidegger neglected, from Adorno’s vantage, was the texture of Hölderlin’s verse,
                  its rhetoric writ small and large: that includes the status of words (Hölderlin’s
                  odd abstractions that are nonetheless not usually philosophical), but even more
                  the signature stylistic/grammatical form of parataxis that gives Adorno’s essay
                  its title. In the hands of most writers and in the midst of many texts, parataxis
                  is one figure among others; yet clearly, for Hölderlin, parataxis—the sequencing
                  of words and phrases without logical connectors (and, though, if, etc.)—is no
                  longer a strictly localized figure of speech or thought, but a more pervasive
                  trait informing how all units of the poem do or not hang together (to translate a
                  little too literally the German <foreign>zusammenhängen</foreign>). In Hölderlin’s
                  hands parataxis is pushed to point of challenging logic as such. It is all the
                  more so when combined with the self-conscious exploitation of inversion (Longinus’
                  paradigm for sublime, anti-natural rhetoric) that “intensifies the violence done
                  to language” (136). Adorno continues: <quote>Whether intentionally on Hölderlin’s
                     part or simply by the nature of things, this occasioned the sacrifice of the
                     period [verse paragraph], to an extreme degree. Poetically, this represents the
                     sacrifice of the legislating subject itself. It is in Hölderlin, with that
                     sacrifice, that the poetic movement unsettles the category of meaning for the
                     first time. (136)</quote> This last is an astonishing claim, spelling the most
                  serious sort of challenge for philology, whose mission is usually predicated on
                  the undoubted possibility of meaning, even if sometimes recognized as hard to
                  ascertain. This disruption adds to the complexity of what is occasioned by
                  Hölderlin’s practice, as outlined in the penultimate passage from Adorno quoted
                  above regarding <emph>das Gedichtete</emph>. It’s easy not to notice, but also
                  hard to process Adorno’s claim about the strangeness, the foreignness proper to
                  words. In that passage one is almost lulled into thinking by Adorno’s phrasing
                  that he is about to say something closer to the opposite: is not “properness”
                  proper to words? Instead he insists that strangeness
                     (<foreign>Fremdheit)</foreign> is proper (<foreign>eigen</foreign>) to them.
                  Adorno was the author of two essays explicitly devoted to what he and we tend to
                  call “foreign” words (“On the Use of Foreign Words” and “Words from Abroad”). The
                  latter of these was a response to complaints registered about a radio address he
                  had given, an address peppered with occasional foreign words and phrases,
                  something that irked sections of his German-speaking audience. Adorno, who once
                  opined in <title level="m">Minima Moralia</title> that “German words of foreign
                  derivation are the Jews of language” (110) offered a spirited defense of these
                  alien terms, these verbal Jews, invoking for his cause Walter Benjamin, whose
                  well-known theory of translation calls for translations to mark themselves as
                  foreign and not simply to dissolve into the so-called target language, as if
                  pretending one is not translating. In his <title level="m">One-Way Street</title>
                     (<title level="m">Einbahnstrasse</title>) Benjamin had compared the polyglot
                  man of letters to a surgeon who performs a difficult operation on his idea and in
                  doing so inserts “a foreign term as a silver rib” into the idea, that is,
                  something artificial or inorganic that nonetheless makes the patient all the
                  stronger when the organic rib was doing quite the opposite (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.476). The startling thing about Adorno’s note on Hölderlin’s
                  “poetic substance” is that he is claiming that all words are foreign words.
                  Hölderlin’s procedures restore the original impropriety of words, the proper, if
                  radical, impropriety, as it were, masked by the seeming native or organic or
                  non-foreign character of words as they so often appear to so-called “native”
                  speakers. The precarious movement of language renders virtually everything a
                  matter of transport, of metaphor, of translation. It is no wonder, we are told,
                  that on the occasion of Adorno’s address to the Hölderlin society, some gasped,
                  some got up and left.</p>

                  <p>The work of Tom McCall inscribes itself in the tradition of “extreme philology”
                  (with particular and indeed the utmost attention to Hölderlin) or at the very
                  least a philology sensitive to the extremities of texts. We have already seen how
                  McCall tracks and deepens this sort of analysis in his reading of Benjamin reading
                  Hölderlin. In coming to a close, I want to highlight some aspects of McCall’s most
                  direct engagements with Hölderlin, readings that rival in their intensity and
                  perspicacity the achievements of his illustrious predecessors. </p>
                  <p> McCall concentrates on Hölderlin’s notoriously eccentric translations of
                  Sophocles, as powerful as they are problematic. He sees in them much more than a
                  failed attempt by a poet on the cusp of madness and with a less-than-perfect grasp
                  of ancient Greek struggling with the local difficulties of translating two of the
                  most imposing tragedies in the canon. They are a performance of and reflection on
                  the vexed historical and linguistic relations obtaining between a modern German
                  and an ancient Greek, a bridge over something that Walter Benjamin, not for
                  nothing, specified as abyssal. In his famous essay on “The Task of the
                  Translator,” Benjamin had contended that translations were characterized by the
                  “looseness” or the “fleeting” relation to the meaning of the originals, for which
                  the paradigm is Hölderlin’s project on Sophocles: <quote>Confirmation of this as
                     well as of every other important aspect is supplied by Hölderlin’s
                     translations, particularly those of the two tragedies of Sophocles. In them the
                     harmony of the languages is so profound that sense is touched by language only
                     the way an aeolian harp is touched by the wind [. . .]. Hölderlin’s
                     translations in particular are subject to the enormous danger inherent in all
                     translations: the gates of a language thus expanded and modified may slam shut
                     and enclose the translator with silence. Hölderlin’s translations from
                     Sophocles were his last work; in them meaning plunges from abyss to abyss until
                     it threatens to become lost in the bottomless depths of language. (<title level="m">SW</title> 1.262)</quote> One of the surprising turns in the
                  passage is the movement from what is plausibly the “enormous danger” associated
                  with Hölderlin’s work on Sophocles—on the brink of madness—to the claim that such
                  “enormous danger” is not only possible more generally but “inherent in all
                  translations.” Benjamin invokes a Hölderlinian phrase “from abyss to abyss” in the
                  act of suggesting that there is something exemplary about the counter-exemplary
                  translations by Hölderlin. They expose what is always already at stake. </p>
                  <p>Hölderlin’s translations were often understood, perhaps because of the combination
                  of madness and bad Greek, to be unduly literal renditions of Sophocles, or at
                  least their <foreign>Wörtlichkeit</foreign>, as Benjamin stresses, a term usually
                  translated as “literality” (indeed, one of its senses) but which also can denote
                  the character of being “word-for-word,” thus also a matter of syntax. Tending to
                  take, by and large, the word as the unit to be translated, rather than the more
                  usual (at least now) option of the sentence, Hölderlin produces versions that are
                  faithful (aside from errors!) at one level, but “monstrous” (the word is
                  Benjamin’s [<title level="m">SW </title>1.260]) at another, because the
                  word-for-wordness of the translation results in a distinctly strange German text,
                  verging on un-German.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The volume of the
                     Frankfurt edition of the translations produces an interlinear version of the
                     Greek text and a German one (not identical to Hölderlin’s, which is on the
                     opposite page), which permits one to gauge the relative word-for-wordness of
                     Hölderlin’s versions. See <title level="m">Sämtliche Werke </title>of
                     Hölderlin. </note> This is of great theoretical import for Benjamin, since he
                  is arguing against translations that simply dissolve into their own language and
                  for translations that mark themselves as foreign, that retrain traces of their
                  other from the original at the very surface of the “home” language. </p>
                  <p> Something of the texture and power of McCall’s reading of Hölderlin’s procedure
                  can be registered by following his analysis of one of the famous locutions:
                  Hölderlin’s rendition of Zeus as, astonishingly, “<foreign>Vater der
                     Zeit</foreign>” (“father of time”). (What follows is part McCall, part my
                  extrapolation or gloss of McCall.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I am following
                     the analysis in Tom McCall’s “<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">Wrathful
                        Translation</ref>” published for the first time in this collection. </note>)
                  McCall understandably wonders why a virtually pure transliteration of the Greek
                  name Ζεύς as the German <emph>Zeus</emph> would not be a perfectly good, obvious
                  choice, the identity of the two names being bolstered by the familiarity with Zeus
                  as a Greek god for any educated German. Here what would get “lost in translation”
                  would seem to be as minimal as can be. Moreover, as McCall recalls, normally
                  proper names stand outside the domain of units of language that require
                  translation. If anything need not be translated—and indeed resists translation—it
                  would be the proper name. At most, there is sometimes a transposition of some
                  letters, substituting the equivalents or near equivalents between the languages.
                  And one might think that in the translation of the name of a <emph>god</emph>, one
                  should interfere as little as possible. Not only does Hölderlin not reproduce the
                  name literally, letter by letter, in German, he switches the category from proper
                  name to common noun, or a phrase made up of common nouns. Eschewing the obvious
                  and easy translation, Hölderlin opts for a charged, resonant and allegorizing
                  “name” that is hardly a name, indeed something closer to an epithet or gloss.
                  McCall notes: “Holderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and
                  shows that even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated
                  again and again, in a rhetorical movement which we will be aligning with allegory”
                  (“Wrathful Translation” para. 7). “Father of time” renders, improperly, “Zeus,”
                  providing a figuration where none seemed required. Of the possible determinations
                  of Zeus (from among all his characteristics or attributes) Hölderlin singles out
                  “father of time”—which is not just any identity when it comes to translation and,
                  for that matter, tragedy. It is in and through time that Zeus becomes the “father
                  of time.” The intervention of time makes Zeus appear as the “father of time,” as
                  the engenderer of time, the agent of the victory of the Olympians over the
                     Titans.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hölderlin’s short ode “Natur und
                     Kunst oder Saturn und Jupiter” (“Nature and Art or Saturn and Jupiter”) aligns,
                     allegorically, Jupiter/Zeus with art and its difference from nature. One way to
                     conceive of this is that art, as the break from or with nature, marks the
                     beginning of time. </note> Zeus made possible his ultimate translation, in the
                  fullness of time, as “father or time.” The father of time is all the more just
                  that, in and after (some) time, retroactively. But how does this work as a
                  translation? If Zeus is the “father of time” is that not included, as it were, in
                  the name Zeus? Why render him in just that and only that way? It is at once more
                  specific and more reductive to call Zeus “father of time.” It makes explicit and
                  allegorical what was only one aspect to which the name Zeus possibly referred.
                  Time is the very medium in which Zeus transforms and in such a way that it renders
                  it necessary or plausible for Hölderlin to (re)name Zeus “father of time.”</p>
                  <p>The charged identification of Zeus as “father of time” is linked to another motif
                  that McCall highlights in Hölderlin’s characterization of how time operates in the
                  Sophoclean tragedies (both <title level="m">Oedipus Tyrannos</title> and <title level="m">Antigone</title>), namely the <foreign>reissende </foreign>(tearing)
                  texture of time. Following the famous analysis of the caesura, the
                  counter-rhythmical interruption required to balance the two unequal “halves” of
                  each tragedy—a caesura paradoxically featuring the appearance of the “pure word”
                  such that representation as such appears, in each play, in the oracular speeches
                  of Tiresias—Hölderlin comments on the wrath of Oedipus that takes the form of his
                  relentless desire to know: <quote>Hence, afterwards, in the scene with Creon, the
                     suspicion: because an ungovernable thought, which is weighed down with sad
                     secrets, becomes unsure, and the faithful and certain spirit suffers in angry
                     immoderation that delights in destruction and only follows the tearing rapacity
                     of time (der reissenden Zeit nur folgt). (<title level="m">EL</title> 320)<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                     </quote> McCall’s exemplary analysis of the strangely central function of
                  wrath—the chief pathos driving Oedipus’ knowledge and unifying god and man, even
                  as those two pull endlessly in opposite directions—<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">can be read at length in
                     this volume</ref>. Here I want only to call attention to the motif of “tearing”
                     (“<foreign>reissend</foreign>”) that McCall emphasizes and boldly translates as
                  “lacerating.” The tragic hero here follows time in its tearing, its rending, its
                  lacerating. Oedipus tears, rends. This tearing is part and parcel with, and partly
                  the result of, Oedipus’ wrathful and “foolishly wild search for consciousness”
                  (321). The fragile unity of Oedipus’ consciousness is torn apart via his own
                  search for the identity of the man who caused the plague plaguing Thebes, an
                  unnecessary error, from Hölderlin’s vantage, insofar as Oedipus interpreted
                  Tiresias’ oracle “too infinitely” by paradoxically limiting the cause to a single
                  man when the oracle specified nothing of the kind. Oedipus interpreted too broadly
                  by narrowing in on the single man that will turn out to be none other than
                  himself. The search-and-destroy mission, which takes the form of knowing and
                  interpreting, unfolds all too quickly. As McCall notes in typically witty fashion:
                     <quote> [. . .] in the “baroque” translations of Greek tragedy (such as
                     Hölderlin’s Sophocles), allegory occurs at allegro pace; its sense are played
                     out so fast—made and unmade so often—that the text serves as a metacommentary
                     on its own acts of sense-making, and stages, beyond itself, the genesis and
                     erasure of sense itself. (“Wrathful Translation” para. 32) </quote> It’s not a
                  matter of indifference that Hölderlin names Zeus “father of time” in a play, a
                  dramatic tragedy that unfolds in time, and not just in any way, as McCall makes
                  clear. A tragedy is one of a small number of kinds of literary works that, insofar
                  as it is performed, can’t be stopped. One can’t put it down. The familiar tragic
                  thematics of fate and inevitability are rendered all the more forceful when
                  unfolding in a headlong, allegro allegory such as <title level="m">Oedipus
                     Tyrannos</title>. Time tears, lacerates in almost real time as it brings
                  mythical, dynastic, <foreign>longue-durée</foreign> forces to a head. The tearing
                  in time ultimately rends and renders the tragic sufferer out of time altogether:
                     <quote>He steps into the path of fate as the guardian of the natural power
                     which tragically removes man from his orbital of life, the very mid-point of
                     his inner life, to another world, and tears (<foreign>reisst</foreign>) him off
                     into the eccentric orbit of the dead. (<title level="m">EL </title>318)</quote>
                  Moreover, the spectators of this spectacle—even if death is beyond vision—are in
                  their turn torn or, as McCall would have it, lacerated. As Hölderlin remarks:
                     <quote>Hence in the chorus of the <title level="m">Oedipus</title>, the
                     lamenting and peaceful and religious elements, the pious lie (<emph>If I am a
                        soothsayer</emph>, etc.), and the sympathy to the point of complete
                     exhaustion towards a dialogue which, in its angry sensitivity, will tear apart
                     the souls of these very listeners. (324)</quote> Often one imagines the
                  audience as the survivors of tragedy, who may or may not be mirrored by characters
                  within the play, along the lines of the chorus in so many Athenian tragedies or of
                  a Horatio to an expired Hamlet. Yet here not even the audience escapes being torn
                  apart. Hölderlin, as McCall recalls, contends that the very words of Sophoclean
                  tragedy are “deadly”—not just that they are about death. At every level,
                  Hölderlin’s tragic translations oscillate between the making and what McCall terms
                  the erasure of sense.“Everything,” Hölderlin posits in the remarks on <title level="m">Oedipus</title>, “is speech against speech, which mutually cancel
                  each other out” (323).</p>
                  <p>Philology is, in the very fabric of its being, dedicated to making sense of texts.
                  In the extreme case of Hölderlin, who is at the same time exemplary, philology
                  confronts literature in the act of unmaking sense even as much as it makes
                  sense(s). Such philology requires extreme measures to respond, in this case, to
                  the Hölderlin translations that McCall judiciously calls “critical.” In this the
                  translations are not fundamentally different from Hölderlin’s poetic works—works
                  that are themselves sensibly understood as what Hamacher calls “first philology.”
                  In his grand endeavor McCall exemplifies the sort of philosophically informed
                  philology practiced by thinkers, such as Adorno and Benjamin, not prone to smooth
                  over difficulties of texts in order to encompass them in some overarching
                  discourse that makes eminently good sense. To make perfect sense of Hölderlin:
                  that way madness lies.</p>

               <p> The centrality of Greek tragedy, and in particular Sophocles’ <title level="m">Antigone</title>, as a conceptual object for German Idealism and Romanticism
               remains a vital source of contemporary reflection concerning the conceptual,
               political, and ethical sources of our own theoretical thought. Tom McCall’s 1988
               essay, “The Case of the Missing Body,” provides an important contribution to these
               issues through an original reading of Friedrich Hölderlin’s translation of <title level="m">Antigone</title> and his enigmatic notes on this work.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Tom McCall, “The Case of the Missing Body,” reprinted in this
                  issue. Permission to reprint generously granted by</note> McCall’s title signals a
               particular enigma concerning the problem of burial at the heart of Sophocles’ play,
               which centers on the struggle between Antigone and Thebes’ king Creon over the corpse
               of her brother Polyneices. In McCall’s reading, Hölderlin’s translation foregrounds
               the strange appearing and disappearing of the corpse in its various attempted and
               failed burials, a drama that ultimately concerns the possibility for this corpse—and
               consequently those around it—to achieve contact with the divine and, more largely, to
               be inscribed in a world of meaning. More importantly, McCall argues, the case of the
               missing body is not only the story of the corpse <emph>in</emph> the play, but also
               the story of what happens to the corpse in the movement <emph>between</emph>
               Sophocles’ Greek version and Hölderlin’s German version, a linguistic drama of
               translation in which the corpse literally appears and disappears. Sophocles’ play, in
               Hölderlin’s German, thus becomes, in McCall’s reading, an “allegory of translation”
               in which the failure to bury Polyneices’ body dramatizes the destiny of the play as
               it is translated by the modern Germans (“Hesperians”), whose destiny is itself
               defined by the very necessity of translating Greek texts. The questions that begin
               and end Sophocles’ play, as McCall suggests—“what to <emph>do</emph> with the
               unsightly corpse, whether to bury it or not”—thus become equally demanding questions
               about the way in which we understand the significance of translation as a model for
               reading and for meaning-making in Hölderlin’s work. And the question of the body is
               also the site of a fatal enigma that is carried over, translated—or not translated—in
               our own theoretical confrontations with Romantic texts and in our own attempt to
               respond to all texts, though particularly, perhaps, those in which we encounter what
               remains of the dead.</p>
               <p> What is at stake in these questions is hinted at in the other meaning of McCall’s
               title, “the case of the missing body,” which alludes to Hölderlin’s analysis of the
               loss of vision or destiny in the moderns, who put their corpses—both actual and
               textual—in cases. Hölderlin writes: <quote>For this is the tragic for us: that,
                  packed up very still in some sort of container, we depart the realm of the living,
                  not that—consumed in flames—we expiate the flames which we could not tame.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Hölderlin’s December 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 1801 Letter to Böhlendorff in Pfau, <title level="m">Friedrich
                        Hölderlin</title>, 150. I have modified Pfau’s translation to accord with
                     McCall’s translatin in his essay. </note>
                  </quote> Whereas the Greeks practiced burial rites that enabled and displayed the
               contact with the divine at the site of the dead body, the moderns, as McCall glosses
               this passage, “hide from their eyes the sight of actual, visible translation between
               the two realms” (62). This turning away from the site of contact, McCall suggests,
               refers not only to the actual burial practices of the moderns, but also to the texts
               of the translated Greek “tragedies” that serve the moderns as central sites of
               meaning-making. Modern tragedy—which, McCall says, can only occur for Hölderlin at
               this moment within the institution of translated Greek tragedy—also confronts the
               moderns with the problem of contact between worlds, between ancient Greek visionary
               culture and modern experience, between Greek text and German meaning. Turning away
               from the site of contact, the moderns thus, in McCall’s words, “cannot [. . .] bear
               to witness the passage itself, but must resort to the strongboxes, ‘containers,’ and
               protective coffin-concepts of modern culture” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 16</ref>). Protected by the
               coffin-concepts in which they encase the texts of Greek tragedy, the moderns shelter
               themselves from the problem of translation, from what happens if “the object of
               translation—the body, the dead, which for Hölderlin were represented by ‘the Greeks’
               and their original scripts—disintegrates and pollutes the holy, or drives spirit out
               of its fragile embodiments.” For McCall, then, Hölderlin’s translation of <title level="m">Antigone</title> raises the question of what it means to face—to
               translate, and to read—the drama of the corpse and the drama of language staged
               around it without simply slipping it back inside its coffin. For what Hölderlin
               achieves as translator, McCall writes, is to act “as an undertaker who opens a crypt
               in the dramatic process of ‘translating’ the relics [. . .] to holier ground” (64).
               What does it mean, then, for a translation to open a crypt? And how do we
                  <emph>read</emph>, without simply entombing, the corpse at the heart of <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*%29antigo%2Fnh&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*%29antigo%2Fnh0">Ἀντιγόνη</ref>’s, and <title level="m">Antigonä</title>’s, drama of
               translation?</p>
               <div>
                  <head>I Contact</head>
                  <p> At the heart of this question is the problem of contact, or the manner in which
                  Greek tragedy, for Hölderlin, stages the means by which “the Spirit of Time and
                  Nature” confronts the sensory object of its interest: <quote>The boldest moment in
                     the course of a day or in a work of art is where the spirit of the age and
                     nature, when the heavenly which takes hold of man, and the object in which he
                     is interested, come to oppose one another most ferociously; because the
                     sensuous object only extends half of the way while the spirit awakens most
                     powerfully where the second half sets in.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Hölderlin, “Remarks on ‘Antigone,’” in Pfau, 110.</note>
                     </quote> As McCall interprets these lines, the artwork at its boldest moment is to
                  “exhibit ‘Spirit’ (or the spirit-in-man) and the material object of its ‘interest’
                     <emph>as</emph> they are in themselves, each without its other half that
                  completes it” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>).
                  Tragedy is indeed, for Hölderlin, concerned with “that space, gap, vacuum,
                  ‘stage,’ or moment of passage that separated immaterial powers and those material
                  vehicles of their potential empowerment [. . .] Tragedy is <emph>about</emph> this
                  space [. . .] or stage of potential contact [. . .] and transport [. . .] of sense
                  and meaning” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 11</ref>).
                  But for McCall, strikingly, the “sensory object” in <title level="m">Antigone</title> is not simply any object or body, but rather, he says, “none
                  other than the exposed body of Polyneices” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>). By interposing
                  the corpse as the exemplary “object” to which spirit—or meaning—must attach,
                  McCall thus makes less certain, less dialectically smooth, the meeting between
                  what he goes on to interpret as the “philosophical drama” of attempted inspiration
                  or contact between ‘the spiritual (Concept, idea, Meaning [. . .]) and the
                  material (the visible body of Polyneices [. . .] the letter)” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>). Rather than two
                  forces or movements, we thus have in tragedy, then, a focus on an uncertain space
                  or gap between the “immaterial powers and those material vehicles of their
                  potential empowerment,” a site “where Spirit hinges—or doesn’t hinge—onto word (or
                  art-work)” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 11</ref>).
                  Indeed, it is only of a corpse that McCall can write of this scene, elegantly,
                  that “the object (or body) makes absolutely no effort to reach out and touch
                  Spirit, but ‘reaches only half-way’—not unlike Michaelangelo’s Adam who languidly
                  awaits the inspiriting touch of God” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>). </p>
                  <p> The Greek tragedy—or at least <emph>this</emph> Greek tragedy, as I would
                  elaborate on McCall’s argument, must then be (re)read as staging a question about
                  its own possibility, as text, to perform the rites, to enable the contact between
                  spirit and body, letter and meaning. For, as McCall points out, Hölderlin does not
                  say that Spirit actually makes contact with the body, but only that it “‘wakes up
                  quite forcefully’ [. . .] where its space, the ‘second-half,’ begins” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>). Does the spirit
                  “flare into wakefulness where the body ends (or ends up),” McCall asks, “or [. .
                  .] simply [. . .] at the boundary of its own territory, which may still be
                  separated, by an unbridgeable lacuna, from the corporeal domain of things?” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 12</ref>). The deadness of
                  the corpse, its possible inaccessibility to the spirit, or meaning, thus hinders
                  the certainty of a philosophical solution (so often provided by the Germans for
                  Greek tragedy and for <title level="m">Antigone</title> in particular) and indeed
                  of any definite interpretation that could appropriate this corpse to spirit—and
                  this Greek corpus to modern sense. By showing that <title level="m">Antigone</title> “exposes [human character] to the dangers of that possible
                  lacuna of non-relation that separates Spirit and object” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 13</ref>), Hölderlin’s
                  translation, McCall suggests, reveals an urgent question at the heart of the
                  tragedy: “Is there contact between the two, or isn’t there?” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 13</ref>). </p>

                  <p> It is this question that, as I read McCall, makes <title level="m">Antigone</title> not only a central play for the Greeks—an exemplary Greek
                  tragedy—but also an exemplary tragedy for the moderns, who now must, as Hölderlin
                  suggests in a letter to his friend Böhlendorff, reread and estrange the inherited
                  Greek corpus in order to confront the radical difference, the problem of
                  translation or contact, between the texts of the ancients and those of the moderns
                  who are determined by this very past. Just as the Greeks have distanced themselves
                  from their own “nature” in order to become who they are, Hölderlin famously writes
                  Böhlendorff in 1801, so too must the moderns distance themselves from the Greeks
                  (or rather the received forms in which they have inherited them), as their own
                  “nature,” in order escape their current predicament, which Hölderlin calls
                     “<foreign>das Schicksallose, dysmoron</foreign>”: fatelessness, or the dwelling
                  in mere “positivity,” in McCall’s words, the repetition of received and
                  unappropriated clichés with no relation to one’s historical situation. At stake,
                  as McCall argues in his essay “Ödipus Translator,” is thus the achievement of an
                  “authentic temporal destiny,” a destiny made possible only by confronting or
                  exposing oneself to the contact—or non-contact—between the two radically different
                  languages and texts that constitute the Germans and their cultural origins, an
                  exposure that must take place through translation, and more specifically the
                  translation of tragedy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> McCall, “Ödipus

                     <title level="m">Antigone</title>, in staging the struggle over the exposed body,
                  also stages the struggle for any translation to confront—to have contact with—the
                  spirit of the Greek tragedy itself, in its courageous exposure of the dangers of
                  decay, of a decomposition that takes place at the site of passage, of the
                  possibility of fragmentation of the material “object.” The problem of “contact” is
                  ultimately, then, a problem of the material dimensions of languages in relation to
                  each other, of a relation to linguistic foreignness—which is already staged in the
                  Greek tragic text—that may disable the translation of languages as a translation
                  of concepts.</p>
                  <p> Hölderlin’s translation, moreover, in exposing or de-crypting <title level="m">Antigone</title>, produces something strange, a surprise that goes far beyond
                  the question of what constitutes the “Greek” or even a different, new and
                  estranged foreignness that could be re-appropriated by the Germans. For <title level="m">Antigone</title>, as McCall points out, “is not about cremation at
                  all, but about burial and its containers.” The difficulty of burial does not only
                  concern the exposure of Polyneices, but also the entombment of Antigone. The
                  tragedy thus exemplifies the <emph>modern</emph> problem of contact, the problem
                  of its own translation <emph>as it passes into the moderns</emph> through their
                  protective coffin-concepts: <quote>[McCall writes t]hat “<foreign>unterirdische
                        Behausung</foreign>” [underground dwelling] and “<foreign>gegrabene
                        Kluft</foreign>” [dug-out chasm] in which Antigone is banished are
                     hypberbolic figures for the “modern” tragedy of excessive containment which may
                     put bodies out of reach of spirit. This play, then, has something to do with
                     “modern tragedy” (“das Tragische bei uns”), and so qualifies as an (ancient)
                     tragedy about modern modes of representation and translation which violate
                     their spirits and bodies either by ‘grounding’ them too much, or not enough.

                     <title level="m">Antigone</title>, in McCall’s reading of Hölderlin’s translation,
                  is a play that stages itself as its own future, a destiny that also takes the form
                  of its entombment in the coffin-concepts of the moderns. The play thus raises the
                  possibility that it is indeed impossible to translate, because the enigma of this
                  corpse and its translation refuses residence even within its original language.
                  But the conflict and drama of the play are precisely about the
                     <emph>necessity</emph> of translating, of honoring the dead and making contact
                  with spirit, and of doing so properly. Hölderlin’s task and McCall’s reading of
                  it, as I would argue, suggests, then, that translation is <emph>most called for
                     just where it is least possible</emph>. The corpse is the place in which
                  contact, the touching of two absolutely separate worlds, is most urgently
                  demanded, even as the gods turn away from humans, even as the dead body refuses
                  the touch of our own search for meaning. How translate, then, how give this text,
                  and this lifeless body, meaning, how find contact at this site? What does
                  Hölderlin <emph>do</emph>, McCall implicitly asks, with Polyneices’—and the
                  text’s—corpse? </p>

                  <p> Something unthinkable happens, McCall tells us, between Sophocles’ and
                  Hölderlin’s texts. This occurs in the first burial scene of Polyneices, the first
                  attempted burial that takes place after King Creon has mandated no burial for the
                  attacker of his city, and which we find out about from a guard who rushes to tell
                  Creon the mysterious news: </p>
                  <quote>
                     <hi rend="bold">Guard:</hi> Well, here it is. The corpse—someone has just given it
                  burial and disappeared after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh and performing
                  the other rights that piety demands. <lb/>

                     <hi rend="bold">Guard:</hi> I do not know. For there was no scar of a pickax to be
                  seen there, no earth thrown up by a mattock. The ground was hard and dry,
                  unbroken, not rolled over by wheels. The doer was someone who left no trace[. .
                  .]. The dead man was veiled from us [had been made invisible]—not shut within a
                  tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him [. . .] And no sign was visible that
                  any beast of prey or any dog had approached or torn him.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Sophocles, <title level="m">Antigone</title>, ed. Sir Richard
                     Jebb.</note>
                  </quote>
                  <p>In the Greek text, the guard begins his speech by saying that he “doesn’t know”
                  the burier of the body because the body has been buried by someone who leaves no
                  signs. For the guard, this is remarkable, as is the fact that the mere sprinkling
                  of dust—not a true burial beneath the ground—has actually made the body disappear:
                  “the dead man was veiled [had been made invisible].” The disappearance of the
                  body—and the disappearance of the act of making it disappear—are staged in the
                  Greek, McCall suggests, as the very signature of the gods—not of Antigone, as is
                  most often assumed—and may be precisely the model of successful translation par
                  excellence: a semi-divine act in which no sign remains behind to decay or pollute.
                  In the first burial scene, then, <title level="m">Antigone</title> at least
                  briefly stages what might have been the proper fate of the body, had it been
                  allowed to rest properly for the remainder of the play.</p>
                  <p> But in Hölderlin’s text the “not knowing” of the guard is transformed into
                  something darker and more philosophical: “I do not know” becomes
                     “<foreign>Undenklich</foreign>,” “Unthinkable.” What is unthinkable is, in
                  German, precisely the signlessness of the the one(s) who buried the body, a line
                  that, in translation, acquires the visionary tone of Hölderlin’s later work:
                     “<foreign>Zeichenlos war der Meister</foreign> [Signless was the Master].” In
                  its oracular tone and echoes of his later lyrics, this line, McCall suggests,
                  recalls Hölderlin’s frequent use of the term in his late poetry to describe
                  divinized poets. Another story is now inscribed in the play of Sophocles:
                     <quote>The translation (“<foreign>Zeichenlos war der Meister</foreign>”), then,
                     appears to be telling its own tragedy within the original tragedy: while
                     telling Sophocles’ story about Gods who (seem to) intervene in human affairs in
                     order to cover over the “outrageous sight” of death, the line also tells
                     Hölderlin’s story about the <foreign>Deus absconditus</foreign> of the
                     Hesperians, which may be that “God” who can only presence himself “in the form
                     of death,” in, that is, figures of spirit absented from itself. But that
                     absence of signs, which in the Greek burial are the signs of a divine
                     superintendency over mortal affairs becomes in translation a more tragic sort
                     of absence, since those signs (we don’t see) left behind by the hand of Greek
                     deity are no longer—in German—assignable to the “Master” (God or vatic poet),
                     who are “<foreign>Zeichenlos</foreign>” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">“Case” 17</ref>). </quote> The
                  unthinkable that the play tells about itself may be understood, then, as its
                  translation out of the world of successful translation; that is, the Greek
                  tragedy’s destiny as it attempts to pass over, and yet does not, into the language
                  of the modern Germans. In this way Hölderlin translates the Greek texts as telling
                  a double story (or non-story) of untranslatability: not a movement from
                  translation to non-translation, but a non-movement, or a juxtaposition, of a Greek
                  text already allegorizing its own impossible translation, and a German text unable
                  to grasp even this message, unable to face the history of an untranslatable
                  language from which it, itself, emerges.</p>
                  <p> From a certain perspective, Hölderlin’s translation <emph>might</emph> thus be
                  read, following McCall’s interpretation, through the notion of Blanchot’s “double
                  infidelity” of gods and men that holds the two together, faithful, as they turn
                  away from each other: here, the language of Greek and the language of German
                  parting ways from each other just where translation should, but cannot take place,
                  telling a story of vigilance in the dark night of the gods’ absence. McCall offers
                  some implicit support for this story in another part of the passage, precisely
                  where the guard says that Polyneices’ body “had been made invisible (<foreign>ho
                     men gar ephanito</foreign>).” Hölderlin writes simply, “<foreign>Nichts
                     Feierlichs</foreign>” (“there was nothing ceremonious/nothing to give burial
                  rights to,” line 255). <foreign>Feiern</foreign>, a word used by Hölderlin
                  throughout his work as a word of celebration, had also been used earlier in the
                  Sophocles passage to describe the rites of burial that the body, according, to the
                  guard, indeed had been given (line 247). But by writing “<foreign>Nichts
                     Feierlichs</foreign>” here, Hölderlin replaces the body that had been given
                  burial rites by the gods (and thus made invisible) with the absence of anything at
                  all to which to give rites. The words following “<foreign>Nichts
                     feierliches</foreign>”—<foreign>es war kein grabmal nicht [no
                     grave-monument]</foreign>—further abolish the Greek burial, McCall suggests.
                  “No grave and no burial! What has happened to the body?” McCall asks. “Far from
                  being “made invisible,” it has literally got lost in translation.” In shifting
                  from an <emph>invisible</emph> body to <emph>no body at all</emph>, Hölderlin
                  appears again to have inscribed in the translation a certain destiny of loss: “It
                  would appear, then, that the translation employs the mysterious burial of a corpse
                  as a means to announce the death of modern poetry, now no longer capable of
                  celeberating [. . .] the congruence of poetic signs and divine intentions and to
                  preserve bodies in translation” (<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.missing_body.html">par. 30</ref>). If we note the
                  fact that, according to McCall, the Greek text was <emph>already</emph> seen as
                  allegorizing its own untranslatability, then the relation between Greek text and
                  German translation might be understood as a kind of radical structure of
                  belatedness, an absolute untouchability or lack of contact: a Greek text that is
                  only readable as a future in which it can no longer be translated, and a German
                  text that repeats this anticipatory language in the form of a traumatic loss of
                  meaningful signs. </p>

                  <p> Yet Tom McCall offers another reading as well, something that does not allow us
                  to “close the case” of the missing body in even this radicalized elegiac mode. At
                  the very point of absolute loss, of infinite loss one might say—between a body
                  already lost and a body only to return as the torn-up pieces of an unreadable
                  text—McCall begins to speculate, to turn to yet another text, a third text that
                  interposes itself in McCall’s own intrepretive process. Hölderlin had, apparently,
                  been working with the corrupt “Juntina” edition of Sophocles of 1555. The phrase
                  Hölderlin translates as “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” (“Nothing to
                  celebrate”)—which in the corrected Greek version is <foreign>ho men gar
                     ephanito</foreign> (“the dead man had been made invisible “)—is given by the
                  Juntina edition as <foreign>ouden gar ehanisto</foreign> (“Nothing had been made
                  invisible”), that is, the <emph>opposite</emph> of what the correct Greek text
                  actually says. Is it possible, McCall asks, that Hölderlin might simply have been
                  making a mistake, supposing that <foreign>ephanito</foreign> (“had been made
                  invisible”) was a form of the verb <foreign>aphagnidzo</foreign> (“to render
                  funeral rites to”), which had come up 8 lines earlier (in the word
                     <foreign>kaphgisteusas</foreign>) and translated by Höldelrin as
                     “<foreign>gefeirt</foreign>” (given funeral rites)? “The translator,” McCall
                  writes, “Might simply have failed to notice the small difference between a nu (v)
                  and a gamma (y) and thus confused “celebrate with due burial” with “make
                  invisible.” </p>
                  <p> “Nichts Feierlichs” (nothing to celebrate) might just be a simple mistake then.
                  But McCall reminds us that Hölderlin’s translations do tend to translate by
                  commenting on themselves, to face up to their own belatedness. Rather, he
                  suggests, <quote>“Nichts Feierlichs,’ then, might just be a phrase marking the
                     translator’s real bafflement when faced with the Greek phrase: <foreign>ouden
                        gar ephanisto</foreign> (“Nothing had been made invisible”).
                        “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” might well be a critical statement
                     about the unreadability of the original: “There is nothing (here) that is the
                     (possible) object of (my) translation/celebration.” At the moment when
                     something goes wrong in the original (“for how could there <emph>not</emph> be
                     a celebration”—Hölderlin might have thought—“when this was asserted 8 lines
                     before?”), there does the translator bring in his own “originals,” whose
                     emblematic adjective is “Feierlich”, to celebrate, into the text of
                     translation, but he introduces them in the form of a negation: “<foreign>Nichts
                        Feierlichs</foreign>.” </quote> Hölderlin, McCall suggests, when faced with
                  something unreadable in his text, something <foreign>undenklich</foreign>,
                  unthinkable, imposes his own emblematic word just at the site of unreadability.
                  The task of the translator—the task of the poet—is achieved, or “given up” in this
                  juxtaposition of <foreign>Nichts</foreign> (nothing) and
                     <foreign>Feierlich</foreign> (celebratable): “nothing for which to give burial
                  rights,” and behind it, the giving of burial rights, the dead body to be given its
                  proper respect. Two letters coming together, making contact, McCall thus
                  suggests—or not making contact: nu (v) and gamma (y): so similar and yet so
                  different, touching and yet not touching in Hölderlin’s text. Touching because
                  they are confused with one another, not touching because that confusion of
                  letters, based on the unreadability of their difference, makes the text a blank, a
                  spot of unreadability for Hölderlin—right at the spot of the dead body. Yet this
                  is the place that Hölderlin also, McCall asserts, posits a new poetic figure:
                     <foreign>feiern</foreign>, to give burial rights to, to celebrate. </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="underline">McCall’s</hi> speculative reading, I would suggest, must also
                  be read as an allegory, as we attempt to know, or read, in this text before us,
                  what will allow us to have contact with its writer, and how to give proper respect
                  to what is <foreign>undenklich</foreign>, unthinkable, at the heart of his essay.
                  McCall allegorizes for us, first of all, the work of the later moderns—we who look
                  back upon the Romantics as our past—a past important less for its content, Paul de
                  Man will say in an essay on Wordsworth and Hölderlin, than for the fact that we
                  have experienced it “only in its passing away.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     de Man, “Wordsworth and Hölderlin,” 50. </note> But McCall also tells us
                  something, in advance of himself, about the site of a hoped-for contact, an
                  untranslatable text, for which, it seems “there is nothing to celebrate.” Touching
                  and not touching us, readable and unreadable, humorous and playful, and rigorously
                  attuned to the materiality and randomness of language—Tom’s work tells us, in the
                  face of our own desire either to struggle for contact or to turn away from his
                  death, to put him in his coffin, what Paul de Man once also warned: “True mourning
                  is less deluded. The most <emph>it</emph> can do is to allow for non-comprehension
                  and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac, non-celebratory, non-lyrical,
                  non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or better, <emph>historical</emph> modes of
                  language power.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> de Man, Paul. “Anthropomorphism

               <p>It would be a mistake to confuse the choice of subject for this essay, the name of
               Shelley’s unrelenting elegy, as an easy mirror in which to honor the work of a friend
               and scholar for whom such mirrors, as the preceding epigraph confirms, were objects
               of suspicion. Nor did he ever seek to take the easy critical path. Rigorously trained
               in classical Greek and German thought, he pursued their interrelation as the driving
               and unresolved question of our critical and historical modernity in the Romantic
               period. By addressing the name of Shelley’s elegy, and by inflecting it through a
               task taken up by Sophocles, Frederich Hölderlin, and Walter Benjamin, this essay
               seeks to honor Tom McCall’s work and his engagement with these three figures whose
               significance to Romanticism and its legacy remains at the core of his thought. </p>

                  <head>1. Tragic Prologue: Wrathful Translation</head>
                  <p>In an essay that remained unpublished at the time of his death, “<ref target="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">Wrathful Translation: The
                     Sophocles of Hölderlin</ref>,” Tom McCall returns to a subject that had
                  attracted his attention early in his career: the encounter of German Romanticism
                  with Greece.<note place="foot" resp="editors">McCall’s s essay belongs to a book
                     project that had the working title, “Vortexts.” The second epigraph to this
                     paper is the concluding sentence of McCall’s “Wrathful Translation.” McCall had
                     first written about Hölderlin’s translations in his doctoral thesis at Yale.
                     This thesis, “Allegories of Translation: Hölderlin’s Translations of
                     Sophocles,” was completed in 1987 under the direction of J. Hillis Miller.
                  </note> In this essay, McCall focuses on those translations of Sophocles by
                  Hölderlin which, as Walter Benjamin reminds us in "The Task of the Translator,”
                  were considered “monstrous” in the nineteenth century (1.260).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Benjamin recalls this reception in the context of a remark about
                     Hölderlin’s “literal rendering of syntax.” </note> Rather than discount this
                  “monstrousness” and normalize it in the context of the critical and literary
                  theory of the later twentieth-century, McCall examines this monstrous aspect as
                  the effect of an unresolved problematic within Sophocles’ account of the tragic, a
                  problematic subsequent literary history and criticism has sought to subdue, if not
                  make disappear, through its “tragic” accounts of the history of tragedy. Relying
                  on Hölderlin’s remarks to his translations of Sophocles, McCall takes another
                  approach that pits Greek tragedy against its reception as it is embodied in the
                  modern project of translation. This project (not to mention its evolving
                     <foreign>telos</foreign>, a world literature) has demanded a transparency and
                  accuracy which has had the result of denying the critical challenge of its source
                  through what Mallarmé called “the false appearance of a present” (310). What
                  McCall sets out to demonstrate is that within the practice of translation, on
                  which the survival of literature as a cultural form has been increasingly
                  dependent since Romanticism, there is a tension that possesses a crucial, critical
                     potential.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the significance of the
                     translation to Romanticism, see Antoine Berman. </note> For McCall, this
                  critical function no longer depends on the old cliché of translation studies which
                  states that any translation is predicated on the loss of the original—as if
                  translation were an elegiac exercise always mourning an impossible task and as if
                  solace could be found in the necessity of endlessly repeating this task. </p>
                  <p>McCall defines the tension present in Hölderlin’s translations as “the disjunction
                  between the arbitrariness of signs, on the one hand, and the deep embeddedness of
                  meanings in their historical traditions, on the other” (1). Lest this remark be
                  dismissed as if it were a transparent, deconstructive gesture, it is important to
                  keep in mind that McCall does not evoke Saussure’s fundamental insight concerning
                  the arbitrariness of the sign as if it were the beginning and end of a
                  deconstructive reading. McCall locates this insight on one side of a tension
                  between the embeddedness of meaning in a tradition and the language through which
                  such tradition exists and reproduces (or retranslates) itself. What this tension
                  then sets up is a historical problem in which neither embedded meaning nor the
                  condition of its transmission can prevail. In this respect, McCall is correct to
                  speak of a tension that is historical and critical at the same time. Adopting
                  Hölderlin’s language, McCall locates this tension in the “wrath” (<title level="m">Zorn</title>) of Oedipus, which is subsequently developed as the hallmark of
                  Hölderlin’s own translations of Sophocles—hence the title of McCall’s essay,
                  “Wrathful Translation.”</p>
                  <p>Hölderlin’s emphasis on the “wrathfulness” of Oedipus defines the tragic
                  experience according to an affective state that runs counter to the tradition in
                  which tragedy has become the carrier of an ahistorical, human truth whose
                  affirmation informs the task of cultural interpretation and its practice of
                  translation. Against such a tradition, Hölderlin points to Oedipus’s wrath or
                  anger (both translate <title level="m">Zorn</title>) as the result of a desire for
                  knowledge that cannot grasp what it seeks to attain. Instead, it experiences an
                  “enormity” (<foreign>das Ungeheure</foreign>) that the hero cannot resolve or
                  reconcile. McCall summarizes Hölderlin’s account of this irreconcilable enormity
                  as follows: <quote>As the human vehicle of this energy, Oedipus is driven mad,
                     enraged in “the mad and frantic questing for a consciousness.” Driven by
                     “wrathful curiosity (<foreign>zornige Neugier</foreign>) [. . .] the
                     knowledge-desire (<foreign>Wissen</foreign>)” of Oedipus “provokes itself to
                     know more than it can bear or grasp.” (16)</quote>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrases in single quotes are translated by McCall from
                     Hölderlin’s “Anmerkungen zur Ödipus,” 53. This work will subsequently be
                     referred parenthetically using the abbreviation <title level="m">FHA</title>.
                  </note> By focusing on the force of this moment, McCall asserts Hölderlin’s
                  resistance to the long shadow cast upon tragedy by the kind of formal, structural
                  device that Aristotle introduces in the <title level="m">Poetics</title> when he
                  insists on <foreign>katharsis</foreign> as the crucial outcome of the tragedy.
                  Indeed, Aristotle’s formalization of tragedy and its leading concept,
                     <foreign>katharsis</foreign>, have become so embedded within the critical
                  discussion of tragedy that one begins to suspect that what is at stake in this
                  account of tragedy is a <foreign>katharsis</foreign> whose task is to prevent the
                  infection of critical interpretation by the kind of emotional states (pity, fear,
                  etc.) that this critical concept is called upon to purge from tragedy, and, by so
                  doing, secure the pleasure of a mimetic and historically transmissible knowledge. </p>
                  <p>Hölderlin, by turning our attention away from such a <foreign>katharsis</foreign>
                  and back to the tragic, refuses the role of this structuring concept as a means of
                  re-establishing the link between knowledge and pleasure on which the origin of
                  Aristotle’s mimetic account of tragedy rests.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This return occurs in Chapter 14 of the <title level="m">Poetics</title> when
                     Aristotle states that pity and fear are experienced through the mimetic
                     portrayal of the facts of Oedipus’ history—a result, Aristotle claims, that is
                     true even if one does not see the play but only hears the history of Oedipus
                     (“it is what anyone who hears the story of Oedipus would feel” [14.53b6-7]).
                     This embedding of pity, fear and suffering in the facts of the Oedipus story
                     makes the mimetic portrayal of those facts become the source of such emotions
                     for Aristotle. As a result, they are already experienced in a manner of
                     presentation, mimesis, which, from almost the very beginning of the <title level="m">Poetics</title>, is defined in terms of producing pleasure.
                     Aristotle speaks of pleasure as a universal effect of mimesis: “everyone takes
                     joy in what is mimetic” (<foreign>to khairen tois mimēmasi pantas</foreign>)
                     (4.48b8-9). In this respect, the mimetic account of tragedy has already purged
                     such emotions as pity and fear, leaving only the introduction and
                     identification of a formal moment (the Aristotelian
                        <foreign>katharsis</foreign>) to authorize this purification as a structural
                     device. </note> For Hölderlin, the suffering of the tragic takes a different
                  path, one that does not entertain the mediation and disappearance of sorrow
                  through joy. Rather, this suffering follows what Hölderlin refers to in his
                  remarks on Oedipus’s exchange with Kreon as a time that “tears apart.” Hölderlin
                  writes (here cited in McCall’s stronger—Hölderlin-like one might say—translation):
                  “the true [. . .] Spirit suffers in wrathful unmeasure (<foreign>im zornigen
                     Unmaas</foreign>), which, in destruction-joy
                     (<foreign>zerstörungsfroh</foreign>), only follows lacerating time”
                     (<foreign>der reissenden Zeit nur folgt</foreign>)”.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Aristotle is clear that what <foreign>katharsis</foreign> does
                     is purge emotional states that are considered destructive so that the pleasure
                     resulting from this purification of the tragic is alone what remains. He refers
                     to both pity (<foreign>eleos</foreign>) and fear (<foreign>phobos</foreign>) as
                        <foreign>pathēmata</foreign> (<title level="m">Poetics </title>6.49b28).
                     More significantly, in relation to Hölderlin’s remark that Oedipus “suffers in
                     wrathful unmeasure” (discussed below), Aristotle not only defines these
                     emotions in his <title level="m">Rhetoric</title> as painful to the body
                        (<foreign>lupē</foreign>) but, in the case of <foreign>phobos</foreign>, he
                     uses a word to characterize this pain, <foreign>tarakhē</foreign>, that
                     signifies something which is out of order with respect to the body and to the
                     mind (<foreign>Estō dē ho phobos lupē tis ē tarakhē</foreign>) (<title level="m">Ars Rhetorica </title>2.5). </note> In this sentence, McCall’s
                  attention falls upon the adverb, “only” in order to emphasize that the tragic
                  figure is left with nothing but time to follow. McCall writes, “the hero literally
                  ‘follows time’ by rejecting and renouncing all meanings, in such a way that
                  consciousness and self-identity cannot be consolidated, a failure that is,
                  precisely, the spirit of tragedy, the spirit of (the) time” (16). McCall’s
                  identification of this moment of failure provides the basis for a literal relation
                  to time on the condition of a rejection and renunciation of “all meanings.” It is
                  as if time, as what tears apart, has completed its task, leaving behind an empty
                  time that Oedipus can only follow now that the organization of time according to
                  knowledge has met an impasse. Such a moment provides tragedy with a moment of
                  culmination, which, in the later and Christian-influenced development of the
                  genre, will be solidified into the demand that the tragic hero must die—until such
                  a demand begins to border on farce with the arrival of the revenge tragedy and,
                  later, the Baroque mourning-play. But, in a subsequent and more precise remark,
                  McCall recognizes that neither the rejection nor renunciation of all meanings, in
                  which this moment of culmination occurs, permits the separation of time from its
                  “tearing apart.” Accordingly, the time which tears apart remains a time that has
                  never really been separated from the “tearing” in which it appears. This is
                  because such time is not an object of knowledge but the condition on which the
                  representation of knowledge rests.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the
                     “Remarks on Oedipus,” Hölderlin speaks of a similar moment in terms of the
                     caesura which, within the succession of representations within a work, allows
                     representation itself to appear in the form of an “empty transport” (<title level="m">FHA</title> 16.250). </note> The rejection and renunciation of
                  “all meanings” is therefore an act that must submit to this condition with the
                  result that it must also be renewed constantly lest this rejection and
                  renunciation of all meanings should be allowed to satisfy, albeit negatively, the
                  desire it cannot fulfill. </p>
                  <p>McCall’s reading of Oedipus’s wrath and the time it follows is undertaken in order
                  to isolate a critical-historical sequence, namely, the “constant collapsing—and
                  intertwining—of symbol and allegory” (20). In doing so, his strong and violent
                  translation of “<foreign>reissenden Zeit</foreign>” as “lacerating time” brings to
                  the fore an undeveloped aspect of his reading of Hölderlin’s “Remarks on Oedipus”:
                  an experience of time that occurs as affect.<note place="foot" resp="editors">McCall’s main remarks focus on time in Hölderlin’s translation of “Zeus” as
                        “<foreign>Vater der Zeit</foreign>” (“Wrathful Translation,” 4-20), and do
                     so in order to indicate that “by treating the proper name (Greek ‘Zeus’) as a
                     common name that must be translated (‘<foreign>Vater der Zeit</foreign>’),
                     Hölderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and shows that
                     even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated again
                     and again” (7). </note> In the context of Hölderlin’s remarks, this experience
                  offers an understanding of time no longer confined to a succession—which Hölderlin
                  associates with “lawful calculation”—that can be “repeated reliably.” This is
                  precisely the lawful succession over which Aristotle’s
                     <foreign>katharsis</foreign> would stand guard.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Hölderlin’s account of this “lawful calculation” occurs at the
                     beginning of his “Remarks on Oedipus” and it provides the example of what
                     tragedy both embodies and against which it asserts a counter-measure: “The law,
                     the calculation, the way in which a feeling-system, man in his entirety,
                     develops as if under the influence of the elemental, and how representation,
                     sensation and reason appear in different successions yet always according to a
                     certain law, exists in tragedy more as a state than as a succession.” (<title level="m">FHA</title> 16.250; translation mine). </note> Against this
                  succession, Hölderlin distinguishes a content that the “lawful calculation” cannot
                  renounce or reject and that remains in a relation of balance to this calculation.
                  It is through the inability to renounce this content that the tragic and the
                  elegiac coincide. In what follows, I will take up this coincidence in order to
                  question the history of a genre whose embedded traditional practices—namely a
                  recourse to the pastoral and an experience of time as mourning or lamentation—have
                  given rise to a generic pattern that also aims at the <foreign>katharsis</foreign>
                  of emotion. If read according to this pattern, the elegy and its tradition does
                  little more than conform to the Aristotelian account of tragedy; it allows a loss
                  to generate the pleasure of mimetic knowledge by defining that loss according to
                  the needs of the historical present and the future it demands (pleasure, mimesis,
                  etc.). But, in recognizing this pattern in a genre that is older than tragedy, are
                  we not also recognizing that what Aristotle has given to the tradition of
                  understanding tragedy is itself an elegiac account that will reach its culmination
                  in George Steiner’s <title level="m">The Death of Tragedy</title>? If so, then the
                  critical success of the Aristotelian account of tragedy will have removed any
                  other account of the suffering and the task of mourning within the elegiac. </p>

                  <head>2. The Time of Mourning</head>
                  <p>Walter Benjamin’s study of the transformation of the tragic in his <title level="m">Origin of the German Tragic Drama</title> draws attention to this
                  removal of mourning when he remarks that “Aristotle’s <title level="m">Poetics</title> is silent on mourning as the resonance of the tragic” (<title level="m">OGT </title>118; translation modified).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This work will subsequently be referred parenthetically using
                     the abbreviation <title level="m">OGT</title>. Benjamin does go on to observe
                     that “modern aesthetics has often believed itself to have grasped a feeling in
                     the concept of the tragic itself” but this feeling is then clarified to be the
                     “emotional reaction [<foreign>Gefühlsreaktion</foreign>] to tragedy and the
                     mourning-play” (118; translation modified). What Benjamin points to here is
                     that this removal of mourning in Aristotle is not corrected in modern
                     aesthetics, since all the latter has done is to impose the emotional reaction
                     of the audience onto the tragic, and then confuse this reaction with what
                     occurs in the events of the drama. This appropriation of the tragic by modern
                     aesthetics does not therefore grasp the place of mourning in the tragic. As
                     Benjamin subsequently observes with respect to the
                        <foreign>Trauerspiel</foreign>, whose name invokes mourning, “these are not
                     so much the plays which cause mourning as plays in which mournfulness finds
                     satisfaction: plays [that take place] before the mournful” (119). </note> This
                  resonance, Benjamin argues, occurs nowhere with more significance than in the
                  German Baroque drama, where “mournfulness,” like Hölderlin’s “wrathful
                  translation,” registers the “enormity” at the core of Athenian tragedy. McCall
                  alludes to this resonance when, in a taxonomy of the emotional terms through which
                  the western critical tradition has confronted its own embedded meanings, he refers
                  to Benjamin’s account of modern tragic consciousness in the “mourning-plays” as
                  “another modulation” in which “‘wrath’ is toned down into the less rabid but
                  steadier <foreign>Trauer</foreign> (mourning) and melancholy.” If this modulation
                  is followed according to Benjamin’s account of mourning as the resonance of the
                  tragic, then tragedy is no longer conceivable as a singular moment determining the
                  value of a cultural tradition, but is rather the intensification of what Hölderlin
                  would understand as the counter-measure through which history is exposed to the
                  “time that tears apart.” In this case, since the modulation between “wrath” and
                  mourning becomes a matter of emotional intensity, the tragic “wrathful unmeasure”
                  that requires critical and historical <foreign>katharsis</foreign> is still
                  present in the act of mourning. </p>
                  <p>For Benjamin, the emotional experience Hölderlin links to “unmeasure” is sustained
                  across this modulation from the tragic to the mournful: he writes, “one of the
                  laws of the <foreign>Trauerspiel</foreign>” is that “in the heart of mourning”
                  these laws are represented in “a feeling” (<title level="m">OGT</title> 139).
                  Benjamin then goes on to define this feeling as something that is both “detached
                     [<foreign>gelöst</foreign>] from any empirical subject” and is also “intimately
                  bound to the fullness of an object” (<title level="m">OGT</title> 139; translation
                  modified). Mourning, like wrath in Hölderlin’s “Remarks on Oedipus,” is not
                  determined by the subject (if it were, it would follow modern aesthetics when it
                  believes that it “grasps” the feeling of the tragic mimetically); rather, Benjamin
                  defines this feeling as an intention capable of a “special intensification”
                  matched only by love and how it relates to its object. The intensifying of
                  intention through mourning is the correlate of the wrath which Oedipus also
                  suffers as the result of an intention to know more than he can grasp or bear.
                  However, in its modulation of wrath, mourning has a different relation to
                  “tearing-apart time” since it lacks the rapidity with which the moment of anger
                  appears. </p>
                  <p>In the elegy, Hölderlin’s “unmeasure” can be (and has been) easily displaced into
                  an individual subject’s experience of loss, which can take the form of a death, an
                  absent lover, or the effect of exile. But, what is out of measure is not such a
                  loss; it belongs only to the past. What is out of measure is always so in the
                  present, that is, in the time that elegy dwells on through mourning and
                  lamentation. If the significance of this moment, what occurs within it, and its
                  relation to “tearing-apart time” is to be approached, then close attention should
                  be paid to the complete sentence in which Hölderlin introduces this understanding
                  of time. Hölderlin writes: <quote>Hence, later on, in the scene with Kreon, the
                     wonderfully wrathful curiosity, because thought, ungovernable and loaded with
                     tragic secrets, becomes insecure, and the true certain spirit suffers in
                     wrathful unmeasure, suspicion, destruction-joy, only follows lacerating time.

                           (<title level="m">FHA</title> 16.253). </note>
                     </quote> What is out of measure—that is, what not conform to the measured relation
                  of reconciliation—is experienced in a combination, “destruction-joy.” This
                  combination is not only outside the balance of opposed terms (joy/unhappiness),
                  but it is also what follows a time defined by the power to “rip,” “tear,” and
                  “rupture”—all senses of the verb from which the adjective
                     “<foreign>reiβend</foreign>” is formed. The recognition of time as something
                  that tears arises at the moment when thought becomes ungovernable and insecure—the
                  moment when spirit suffers in “wrathful unmeasure.” “Destruction-joy” alone
                  follows such a time. As such, it remains unpurgeable, since the joy that should
                  follow from the catharsis of a destructive emotion also carries destruction with
                  it. Here, destruction is not something that already mediates joy, as is the case
                  in Aristotle’s <title level="m">Poetics</title>. Furthermore, wrath is not
                  synonymous with this destruction either; wrath arises because of the
                  inseparability of destruction and joy in their unreconciled relation.</p>
                  <p>In his “Remarks on Oedipus,” Hölderlin refers to this tearing-apart as a wrath
                  that boundlessly unites, on the one hand, natural force and, on the other, what is
                  “most inward” in the human (<foreign>gränzenlos die Naturmacht und des Menschen
                     Innerstes im Zorn eins wird</foreign>). In describing how this boundless
                  uniting occurs, Hölderlin uses precisely the language of purification that has
                  been used to translate Aristotle’s <foreign>katharsis</foreign>, but he does so
                  with entirely different effect. Hölderlin writes: “boundless union purifies itself
                  through boundless separation” (<foreign>gränzenlose Eineswerden durch gränzenloses
                     Scheiden sich reinigt</foreign>) (<title level="m">FHA </title>16.257).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The shift away from the purification of
                     Aristotelian tragedy is completed here. <foreign>Katharsis</foreign>, as
                     purification, does away with the enormity (Hölderlin’s word) of the emotions.
                     But here, what Hölderlin invokes as purification is precisely what produces
                     such an emotion and does so without check; it is boundless whereas Aristotelian
                     purification is the establishment of boundary and measure as the source of
                     meaning so that the human is no longer out of step with natural force. This
                     understanding is emphatically underscored by Hölderlin when he changes a
                     citation from the tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, the <title level="m">Suda</title>, in which it is stated “that Aristotle was nature’s scribe,
                     dipping the quill into meaning” (<foreign>Hoti Aristotelēs tēs phuseōs
                        grammateus ēn, ton kalamon apobrekhōn </foreign>
                        <emph>
                           <hi rend="underline">eis noun</hi>
                        </emph>). In Hölderlin’s version,
                     Aristotle is omitted, and the act that links meaning to nature (and which is
                     directly relevant to what Hölderlin says immediately prior this phrase when he
                     speaks of natural force and what is most inner to the human) becomes a
                     well-intentioned act: “Nature’s scribe, dipping the well-meaning quill”
                        (<foreign>ton kalamon apobrekhōn </foreign>
                        <emph>
                           <hi rend="underline">eunoun</hi>
                        </emph>) thus relieving Aristotle of his
                     reputation as the one who unites nature and meaning in language. The original
                     phrase from the <title level="m">Suda</title> is cited in <title level="m">FHA
                     </title>16.257n. Hölderlin also addressed the relation of anger and
                     purification in the poem, “Ganymede”; Hölderlin writes, “<foreign>Im Zorne
                        reinigt aber / Sich der Gefesselte nun, nun eilt er</foreign>” (But now in
                     anger the restrained one purifies itself, now hurries). </note> Unlike
                  Aristotelian <foreign>katharsis</foreign>, this purification maintains each
                  element of the joy-destruction pair in a balance. The Aristotelian purification
                  asserts that the disturbing elements (those that contribute to unmeasure) can be
                  overcome by union, that destruction can be transformed or “purified” by joy, that
                  the emotions of pity, fear, etc., can be removed by the subsequent reassertion of
                  the pleasure taken in mimetic knowledge.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A later
                     critical-historical interpretation of <foreign>katharsis</foreign> will
                     emphasize the significance of knowledge to <foreign>katharsis</foreign> in the
                     form of clarification. Thus Leon Golden: “it is only katharsis in the sense of
                     ‘intellectual clarification’ that can provide a telos for tragedy that is in
                     harmony with the general argument of the Poetics” (447). Although Golden
                     champions this sense of <foreign>katharsis</foreign>, he also points out that
                     he is not the first to advance it, but is rather the most recent in a long
                     tradition. Golden provides a summary of prior accounts of the interpretation of
                        <foreign>katharsis</foreign> (447-449). </note> Hölderlin’s account of a
                  boundless union purified through boundless separation demands that the
                  joy-destruction pair occurs as irreconcilable confrontation and that this
                  confrontation is experienced in an emotional state that has no counter-resolution.
                  Such irreconcilability confirms the extent to which this relation cannot be
                  assimilated by its subject as an object of knowledge. To do so is to resolve
                  tragic experience into a historical sequence whereby joy is removed from its
                  temporal co-presence with destruction. Only through this removal can joy claim a
                  historical time that is proper to itself (historical because this moment is
                  defined only in relation to what is temporally separate from it). Hölderlin
                  counters this <foreign>kathartic</foreign> separation by defining the relation of
                  destruction and joy in terms of a purification that maintains rather than denies
                  the tearing-apart of time embodied in the joy-destruction pair. In short, for
                  Hölderlin, the tragic is what witnesses a present in which two forces are bound
                  irreconcilably to one another in the same time. Separating these forces and
                  maintaining their separation is the task of a history that seeks to produce an
                  imitation of time in which both the present and its future find satisfaction in
                  the irreversible pastness of the past. Such a past would be so irretrievably lost
                  that it may always reappear in the present in the safe form of translations so
                  much less wrathful than what they translate. </p>
                  <p>Despite the separation of past and present and the transformation of their
                  “wrathful unmeasure” into a mimetic as well as aesthetic pleasure through a
                  historically oriented <foreign>katharsis</foreign>, the only means by which this
                  separation is sustained is through mourning. Here, the cathartic anticipation of
                  pleasure turns to a form of feeling defined by relation to a preceding loss. But,
                  as Benjamin points out in a remark on the mourning-play in which history and this
                  attenuation is most at stake, the feeling of mourning counters its own promise of
                  a future in which history, as the measure of time, is restored. Benjamin remarks:
                     <quote>Mourning is the state of mind in which feeling revives
                        [<foreign>neubelebt</foreign>] the empty world in the form of a mask in
                     order to possess [<foreign>haben</foreign>] an enigmatic satisfaction in its
                     contemplation. Every feeling is bound to an <foreign>a priori </foreign>object,
                     and the representation of this object is its phenomenology. (<title level="m">OGT</title> 139)</quote> If mourning revives an empty world in the form of
                  a mask, it is in order to have something in the world to mourn. Since mourning
                  demands an object—its <foreign>a priori</foreign> condition, Benjamin states—then
                  the phenomenology we know as history is grounded in a mask that stands in the
                  place of the silence of the past. This mask may take the form of either an image
                  or a word—both of which, Benjamin notes, proliferate in the mourning-plays to the
                  point of excess or unmeasure (to use Hölderlin’s term). In this proliferation the
                  tragic appears but is not defined as something singular. Benjamin writes: “what is
                  tragic is the word <emph>and</emph> the silence of the past” (<title level="m">OGT</title> 118; emphasis added). One is not present without the other. This
                  is why Benjamin also states, “There is in all mourning a tendency to silence
                     [<foreign>Sprachlösigkeit</foreign>] and this infinitely more than inability or
                  reluctance to communicate. The mournful feels [<foreign>fühlt sich</foreign>] it
                  is known through and through by the unknowable” (<title level="m">OGT</title>,
                  224; translation modified). These two sentences mark the point at which Benjamin’s
                  remarks touch on the cause of Oedipus’s “wrathful measure”: to know more than he
                  “can bear or grasp.” At the same time, they touch unintentionally on the tendency
                  that defines the history of the elegy, in particular, the recurrent moment in the
                  tradition of this genre when its mourning invokes both an inability and reluctance
                  to communicate its suffering—a tendency nowhere more evident than in the ironic
                  and anti-elegiac mode that twentieth-century elegy turns to as its experience of
                  loss. But what if this recurrent moment, in which the elegy laments its own power
                  of mourning, were masking a “wrathful unmeasure” and translating it knowingly into
                  an object of loss as its cathartic act? This question marks the starting point of
                  Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title>—the elegiac name in which wrathful
                  unmeasure becomes mournful translation.</p>

                  <head>3. The Silence of Naming</head>
                  <p>More than any other aspect of this poem, the critical reception of Shelley’s
                     <title level="m">Adonais</title> has centered on the name that takes the place
                  of Keats. This act of naming, once read in the context of Benjamin’s observation,
                  which forms the epigraph to this paper (“to be named [. . .] remains perhaps
                  always a presentiment of mourning” [<title level="m">OGT</title>, 224]), indicates
                  a significance quite different from those attempts to decipher the name of Adonais
                  according to the promise that such a deciphering could yield the meaning of this
                  elegy and thereby bring the critical mourning directed at this name to an end. In
                  light of Benjamin’s observation, it is important to keep in mind that it is the
                  intent of naming that contains the presentiment (<foreign>Ahnung</foreign>) of
                  mourning. Given Benjamin’s claim, that mourning is an intention bound to an
                  object, then the name that entitles Shelley’s poem can be understood, first, as
                  placing the elegiac in the presentiment or anticipation of such an object, and,
                  second, as the mask by which the poet “revives the empty world.” Yet, in Shelley’s
                  case, the promise of such a revival remains in question, and does so beginning
                  with the name it is written under: who or what is to be revived in the compounded
                  name of Adonais? And, can the enigmatic nature of this name still produce the
                  satisfaction that, in accordance to the expectations of elegiac tradition,
                  successfully sustains a phenomenology that speaks for the silence of death? </p>
                  <p>The preceding questions have surfaced in the reception of <title level="m">Adonais</title> through the tendency to read Shelley’s elegy either as a
                  failure or as an act of writing that the elegiac can barely survive. Of the first,
                  the most exemplary is the judgment of W. H. Auden (who otherwise lauded the
                  success of poets in writing elegies) that <title level="m">Adonais</title> is “the
                  only elegy I know of which seems to me a failure” (147). Auden’s measure of
                  failure indicates that this elegy is a singular example in the genre (rather than
                  the object of Auden’s repeated antipathy to Shelley). If the context in which
                  Auden’s judgment is expressed provides any clue, what constitutes such a failure
                  appears to be a mournfulness that exceeds its subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Rachel Wetzsteon observes that Auden’s preference in elegy
                     appears to run toward a language that is “subdued in tone and matter of fact in
                     subject-matter” (114n.25)—if the examples of elegies he includes in <title level="m">A Certain World</title> are any indication of elegies that do not
                     fail. </note> Peter Sacks, who places <title level="m">Adonais</title> at the
                  limit of elegiac writing, is less restrained in describing such an excess when he
                  writes that “<title level="m">Adonais</title> marks an extremity that no later
                  elegy would reach” (165). Both Auden and Sacks react to an “unmeasure” in <title level="m">Adonais</title>. While this unmeasure is the clear sign of a failure
                  for Auden, it is not so clear in the case of Sacks who, despite recognizing an
                  extremity that threatens the genre, still allows Shelley to have accomplished many
                  of the goals embedded in the elegiac tradition, including what is perhaps the most
                  important of these goals: “[Shelley] has expressed and purged his anger” (165).
                  The admission of “tragic” language here, as well as the vocabulary of Aristotle’s
                  account of tragedy (purgation), indicates how much Sacks still retains the “lawful
                  calculation” through which tragedy has been read despite the evidence of its
                  texts, not to mention Hölderlin’s corrective which McCall brings to the fore in
                  his account of the former’s “wrathful” translations. But if an inability to
                  experience anything other than this “lawful calculation” is the result of
                  Shelley’s elegy, even when it goes to the edge of its own ruin, then the affective
                  moment that Hölderlin identifies as central to tragic experience and its account
                  of time would also be removed. In the more exacting terms of Benjamin’s account of
                  mourning, this pattern removes the intensification of intention in the elegy,
                  which is not the same thing as the achievement of that intention or its near
                  destruction. In both these cases, the temporal relation between the object of
                  suffering and the language of mourning in which that suffering takes place would
                  be obscured. </p>
                  <p>Sacks recognizes the danger of achieving the intention of elegy when he makes this
                  achievement the extremity at whose edge Shelley stands. Yet, it is Sacks who
                  drives Shelley to this extremity before pulling back into the kind of figurative
                  solace that follows from the threat of ruin. Only in the hypothetical substitution
                  of intention and object in the act of mourning, and after the subsequent rejection
                  of that hypothesis, can Sacks still preserve the historical tradition of elegy.
                  Sacks writes: Shelley’s “mourning imagination, its apparently literal rather than
                  literary thrust [. . .] draws him on to what all mourners need to avoid—their own
                  drive beyond life and beyond language whose detours and saving distances keep them
                  alive” (165). The moment of hesitancy in this account of Shelley’s extremity is
                  pronounced. Shelley’s “mourning imagination” is “<emph>apparently</emph> literal,”
                  and this is not the only moment of hesitation expressed by Sacks as he seeks to
                  protect the “literary thrust” from what appears to be an equally thrust-like
                  “drive beyond life.” In the preceding sentence, Sacks writes: “Shelley insists on
                  what <emph>seems</emph> to be a literal rather than a figurative identification
                  with the consolatory image” (167; emphasis added). Sacks’s remarks all tend
                  towards an account of mourning that protects the subject from too close an
                  identification with its object, lest it succumb to what it mourns. But, in doing
                  so, Sacks’s rhetorical use of “seems” and “apparently” indicates that the
                  extremity he attributes to Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title> still falls
                  within the realm of an intention that cannot quite be fulfilled. This does not
                  mean that the image Sacks refers to as “consolatory” can be resurrected in order
                  to save Shelley’s elegy from its extremity. The issue sidestepped here is the one
                  Benjamin points to: mourning can only produce such an image because the world it
                  refers to is an empty one. To argue that the purpose of the elegy, and with it the
                  literary, is to preserve the significance of figurative language by locating the
                  elegiac in a world whose transport of meaning is not empty but merely lost or
                  missing. Loss is the figure that has been embedded in the historical tradition of
                  the elegiac mourning as the guarantee that its literary mode—its mournful
                  language—will not miss the mark even as it fails to attain its object. On this
                  point, Sacks again hesitates despite the confidence with which the communal “we”
                  is assumed: “we recognize now how thoroughly he has driven his version of the
                  genre <emph>to the brink of its own ruin</emph>” (167; emphasis added). </p>
                  <p>To go to the brink is not to cross to the other side. Like the loss that elegy
                  places before itself, the promise of transcendence and reconciliation that should
                  flow from this loss is the name of an extremity that occurs neither in the world
                  nor beyond it. The time of such extremity is always the present. The hesitation of
                  Sacks’s reading is the effect of this extremity, even when all that remains is an
                  intent to preserve a model of mourning in which the subject derives mimetic or
                  figurative consolation in the image it produces for its own contemplation. To
                  literalize this image is, on the one hand, as Sacks points out, to attempt to go
                  beyond it, but, on the other hand, to take this image as the sign of the literary
                  is also to literalize it in order to define literature as nothing less than a
                  phenomenology of language whose purpose is to protect us from an empty world. This
                  world responds with silence to the images of loss and transcendence thrust before
                  it. Such silence is the only witness to an empty world that stands apart from the
                  names through which it is addressed and through which the elegy intensifies the
                  intention of mourning. When Benjamin locates this intention in the act of naming
                  that also contains a presentiment of mourning, he gives it an intention that
                  drives it toward the object as its meaning, but this drive only intensifies the
                  separation in which the promise of all intentional acts is preserved. Mourning
                  exposes the extremity of naming in the empty silence of the world’s response to
                  such naming. To mourn one must name, but such naming stands apart from the
                  dangerous possibility of a translation that achieves an over-identification and an
                  over-determination of its source. This is precisely what happens when emptiness is
                  figured as the sign of loss or transcendence: the same silence triggers the
                  possibility of both. As if to work against this figuration, Benjamin gives one
                  more twist to this relation between naming and the presentiment of mourning when
                  he states that such a presentiment is even more present when naming is replaced by
                  reading: <quote>To be named [. . .] remains perhaps always a presentiment of
                     mourning. But how much more so not to be named, <emph>only read rather, read

                     emphasis added, trans. modified)</quote> In order to function as a more
                  significant presentiment of mourning, the task of reading must proceed
                  uncertainly, or without safety (both senses of <foreign>unsicher</foreign>). It is
                  here that Keats, in not being named by Shelley, is preserved as the object of an
                  intention that guards against any <foreign>katharsis</foreign> even as that
                  intention employs the embedded traditions of elegy but within a sense of time that

                  <p>It is not the name of Keats that marks the historical loss against which this poem
                  contends, but a name combined (in no particular order of importance) of a Greek
                  mythological figure, Adonis; the Hebrew word, a<emph>donai</emph> (lord or ruler),
                  used to address the divine in the place of a proper name; the Greek word for
                  nightingale <foreign>aēdōn</foreign>, which if not for the long
                     <foreign>ē</foreign> would be an exact homophone for the
                     <foreign>adōn</foreign> of Adonis; and finally the Greek sound of lament,
                     “<foreign>ai</foreign>.” The role of these different elements in determining
                  the meaning of Shelley’s poem has been a subject of considerable critical concern,
                  even anxiety, as indicated by the recurring attempts to explain why Shelley coined
                  the name “Adonais” as title to this elegy. The anxiety that drives this concern is
                  how to decide among these four choices so that the challenge posed by Shelley’s
                  invented name can be resolved; namely, the challenge of locating an addressee as
                  the meaning of the poem rather than its occasion. </p>
                  <p>As a result of Earl Wasserman’s essays on this poem, this challenge became defined
                  around his attempt to fold the Hebraic <foreign>adonai</foreign> within the always
                  desired classical genealogy that elegy has demanded.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Earl Wasserman’s <title level="m">The Subtler Language
                     </title>(285-361) and <title level="m">Shelley: A Critical Reading</title>
                     (462-502). </note> The challenge Wasserman first introduced just over fifty
                  years ago remains a critical reference point, as a recent essay indicates by its
                  enlisting of an extensive, associative philology in order to marginalize the
                  Hebraic <foreign>adonai</foreign>. As a means of resolving this issue, such an
                  associative philological account provides no more persuasive an argument than the
                  absence of any evidence documenting Shelley’s knowledge of Hebrew.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, H.J. Jackson’s “The ‘ai’ in Adonais.” Jackson
                     argues for a “dislodging” of the Hebrew <foreign>adonai</foreign> from “its
                     current domination of the field” (782) by isolating two elements: the Greek
                     word for nightingale, “<foreign>adōn</foreign>” [sic] and the presence of the
                     Greek sound of lament, “ai,” used by Shelley in other works, notably <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. Having done so, Jackson calls in the
                     plural form of the Greek word “<foreign>adōn</foreign>es” thus handily
                     accounting for the stray “s” that comes after “ai” sound of lamentation:
                     adon-ai-s/adon-e-s. If we disregard the philological inexactitude of eliding
                     the Greek spelling of the word for nightingale from <foreign>aēdōn</foreign> to
                        <foreign>adōn</foreign> then perhaps this would be, as Jackson says, the
                     “least controversial of the other suggestions” (meaning one suggestion in
                     particular, the Hebrew “adonai”). A more measured account of the presence of
                     the nightingale in the name Adonais is given by Kelvin Everest in “Shelly’s
                        <title level="m">Adonais</title> and John Keats.” Everest rightly notes that
                     the presence of <foreign>aēdōn</foreign> in Adonis is more in the manner of a
                     pun and cites Socrates’ etymologies in Plato’s <title level="m">Cratylus</title> in order to show how similarity in sound is confused with
                     etymological relation. The connection between Keats and the name Adonais on the
                     basis of <foreign>aēdōn</foreign> remains a thematic argument that requires
                     either the general association of poetry with the song of the nightingale, or
                     else the evocation of Keats’s famous ode, which, beyond its title, does not
                     address the nightingale again by its name—an aspect of the ode that draws
                     attention to the question of naming posed by the title of Shelley’s elegy for
                     Keats. Beyond this ode, the word “nightingale” occurs thirteen times in the
                     whole of Keats’s poetry, and mostly does so in poems which are less than
                     memorable. Only in <title level="m">Endymion</title> does the word occur more
                     than once. See the Keats concordance <ref target="http://www.rc.umd.edu/reference/keatsconcordance/">elsewhere at
                        Romantic Circles</ref>. </note> What is at stake here is the desire to
                  resolve the absence of any verifiable indirect—never mind direct—naming of its
                  addressee, or, in other words, to return propriety to what appears in the form of
                  a proper name. In this respect, the challenge embodied in the name Adonais
                  functions in relation to Keats in the same way that <foreign>adonai</foreign> does
                  in relation to Yahweh in the Hebrew Old Testament: both name what cannot appear in
                  itself and certainly not in the time in which this naming occurs. In both cases,
                  what is emphasized is the temporality of address, which is precisely the question
                  that informs Shelley’s engagement with the elegiac across this poem, not just in
                  its title. In contrast to this question, the dislodging of
                     <foreign>adonai</foreign>, or even its appropriation in the name of evoking
                  symbolic archetypes (as in Wasserman), become examples of a restrictive reading
                  that is more confident than Shelley of how and where the elegiac can place its
                  subject. </p>
                  <p>Before any ascribing of meaning to <foreign>adonai</foreign>, the presence of this
                  word in Shelley’s title complicates the traditional use of a classical name in
                  order to evoke a setting (above all, classical Greek pastoral) that promises a
                  transmutation of the mournful task that defines the elegiac. In this respect, the
                  name Adonais is not comparable to Milton’s substitution of an already-existing
                  classical name, Lycidas, for his drowned friend, Edward King. Yet, already in
                  Milton’s substitution it is possible to discern the task that the name Adonais
                  exposes in the classically influenced elegiac tradition: translation, namely, the
                  transposition of a subject into a name whose existence invokes the solace of an
                  idealized world. Two senses of translation are involved in this task in its
                  classical adoption: the prevailing modern use of this word which involves the task
                  of finding one word for another across linguistic boundaries, and the etymological
                  sense of a transfer from one location to another.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This etymological meaning survives only in the specialized context of
                     ecclesiastical terminology, where it is used to describe the transfer, for
                     example, of a bishop from one diocese to another. </note> This second sense has
                  figured prominently in the elegy as a means of invoking a literary setting and a
                  place in which human life is no longer defined by the complications of its
                  temporality. Such a sense gives the elegy its generic tendency to relocate death
                  in a topography, a tendency that survives its classical models—as is the case with
                  Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” in which even the act of writing an
                  elegy, never mind the subject it addresses, is translated into a very specific
                  space. Within this tradition, the difference Shelley introduces in the name
                  “Adonais” is to pose the central question that informs elegiac writing: how and
                  where to locate the name this writing invokes so that it may translate what
                  Benjamin calls “the empty mask of mourning” into a figure for an idealized object
                  and, in so doing, transform the loss and mourning occasioned by this mask as if it
                  were an object of satisfying contemplation.</p>
                  <p>The task Shelley faces in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, as the opening line
                  indicates, is one in which both mourning and translation are implicated: mourning
                  because of the initial act of weeping expressed by Shelley; translation, since
                  this line, except for one word, repeats the opening of Bion’s “Epitaph on Adonis”:
                  “I weep for Adonais—he is dead!”<note place="foot" resp="editors">All references
                     to Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title> are to <title level="m">Shelley’s
                        Poetry and Prose</title>. Bion’s “Epitaph on Adonis” begins “<foreign>Aiazō
                        ton Adōnis, ‘apōleto kalos Adōnis!’ / ‘ōleto kalos Adōnis,’ epaiazousin
                        Erōtes</foreign>.” In J. D. Reed’s translation: “I mourn for Adonis: ‘Fair
                     Adonis is dead!’ / ‘Fair Adonis is dead,’ the Loves mourn in reply” (<title level="m">Bion of Smyrna</title> 122-23). </note> For Shelley to open his
                  elegy with another’s words, Bion’s, in the place of his own, and to do so in an
                  elegy that addresses its subject in the name of another, is already to affirm an
                  aspect of the Hebrew use of <foreign>adonai</foreign> as the generalized issue
                  from which Shelley’s elegy proceeds: the impropriety of a name that never had or
                  no longer has a temporal subject. The effect of this issue is immediately present
                  in the second line of Shelley’s poem as Shelley diverges from the repetition that
                  occurs in Bion’s “Epitaph on Adonis.” Where Bion’s announcement of his own
                  mourning is followed by the repeated antiphonal response “Fair Adonis is dead”
                  made by the “Loves,” Shelley’s version takes a different turn. No antiphonal
                  response is made to his mourning as a means of affirming that mourning. Instead,
                  Shelley gives a command to mourn:</p>
                  <quote>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I weep for Adonis—he is dead!</l>
                        <l>O, weep for Adonis! (1-2)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                  <p>Already the task faced by this elegy can be discerned in its the opening
                  declaration as “I weep” is interrupted in the second line when its verb is
                  suspended subjectless and the subject, “I,” is replaced by the interjection “O”
                  which stands in the place where the subject formerly stood (I weep / O, weep). The
                  tenuous hold of a subject on this elegy is only increased by the imperative. To
                  whom is it addressed? The subsequent lines provide some clarification when Shelley
                  identifies a universalized “we” whose answer to the command, “weep,” are tears
                  that remain ineffective: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l rendition="#indent4">though our tears</l>
                           <l>Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head! (2-3)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> From the very beginning of Shelley’s elegy, the task of mourning
                  is not a facile unbinding or recovery of life from death; it is not, in this case,
                  a project that aims at a successful figuration of death in a mask that the living
                  demand to contemplate even if it operates under that imperative. This is why the
                  empty “O” of the second line can be read in the place of the “I” from which elegy
                  and the experience of loss proceeds and never more so than when it is falsely
                  figured in a collective experience on whose behalf the poet claims to speak. This
                  interjected “O” also has its own role to play in this elegy of displaced
                  beginnings. Following immediately upon the word “dead” at the end of the first
                  line, the second line which makes the command to weep begins with a letter that
                  suggests there is something else displaced in this poem’s address to death, and
                  like the title, <title level="m">Adonais</title>, it is a matter of a letter. As
                  observed above, the second word of the second line is again “weep” but the place
                  of “I” in the first line is occupied by a letter which stands facing us with an
                  emptiness that points to its failure to symbolize the death this elegy addresses.
                  Absent from this “O” is the line that transforms it into <foreign>theta</foreign>
                  (Θ) which, when used alone, stands for the Greek word for death, Θανατος
                     (<foreign>thanatos</foreign>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In addition to
                     the general use of Θ, the tokens used to vote for the death penalty in
                     classical Athens would be inscribed with this single letter. This letter, in a
                     reference to death, occurs in a citation attributed to Plato which forms the
                     first epigraph to <title level="m">Adonais</title>. </note> And, lest we miss
                  the play of these letters, its least obvious one (the absent
                     <foreign>theta</foreign>) is precisely what occurs at the beginning of the
                  immediate following phrase (“<emph>th</emph>ough”) and the opening word of the
                  next line (“<emph>Th</emph>aw”). Each begins with the letters by which
                     <foreign>theta</foreign> is transliterated, thus forming a sequence at the
                  beginning of the first three lines that runs “I [. . .] O [. . .] Th [Θ] [. . .]”:
                  the subject’s address to death (“I weep for Adonis—he is dead”), the interruption
                  of that address by an interjection and command that does not identify the subject
                  to which it is addressed, then the obscured appearance of what has been displaced
                  all along but to which the poem is bound: death. Death, which occasions the
                  subject of this elegy, does not appear, but is separated and dispersed so that it
                  unbinds the traditional pattern of elegy in a way that does not presume that it,
                  its language, or its images, can be taken for granted. The fate of this latter
                  element, the image, is forcefully present as a result of the “frost” that holds
                  the head of Adonais in its bind in the form an unidentifiable figure, “head,” that
                  not only remains torn apart from the tears it provokes, but also provides the sole
                  bodily part in which the subject of the poem’s address is figured.</p>
                  <p>From this opening, it is clear that what Auden calls this poem’s failure is not a
                  failing, nor is it an exercise to be made subordinate to a spirit that cannot be
                  measured. After the displacement of the poet in the first two lines and the
                  recognition that our tears cannot thaw the frost that now binds Adonais to the
                  figure of a head, the poem turns to time in the form of a “sad Hour” as one whose
                  mourning should offer more than has been achieved so far. But, as it turns out,
                  this Hour, in order to mourn, needs to be instructed in the art of lawful
                  calculation and its repeatability: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years</l>
                           <l>To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,</l>
                           <l>And teach them thine own sorrow, say: with me</l>
                           <l>Died Adonais, till the future dares</l>
                           <l>Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be </l>
                           <l>An echo and a light unto eternity!</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The Hour addressed by Shelley is both one of the
                     <foreign>Hōrai</foreign>, the goddesses of the seasons in whom time is figured
                  as nature, and an address to something more than such a measure of time since this
                  “sad Hour” is “selected from all years.” It is not just part of a generalized
                  cycle repeated each year. In addition this “Hour” is distinguished from “all
                  years,” that is, it is distinguished from any measure of time and from any claim
                  to completion resonant in the word “all.” In this respect, it has more in common
                  with the sense of <foreign>hōra</foreign> as the specific moment in which the time
                  for something to happen has come (the “hour has arrived,” for example). What is
                  invoked in line 4 of <title level="m">Adonais</title> is such an hour, but what
                  arrives with it is not the measure of time but time defined as an affect: it is a
                  “sad Hour.” This “hour” stands apart from “all years”; it is a time called upon to
                  mourn the loss that the poet identifies with in the second line when he writes of
                  “our tears.” For this mourning to occur, the “sad Hour” is given three tasks by
                  the poet: first, “rouse thy obscure compeers”; second, “teach them thine own
                  sorrow”; third, in order to fulfill this second imperative, “say: with me /Died
                  Adonais.” What is revealed in these lines is that the poet must not only instruct
                  the “sad Hour” about how to teach a sorrow that is intensively identified with
                  that Hour (“thine own”) but must also communicate what is at stake in this
                  mourning: that the time of an event—Adonais’s death—must stand with a significance
                  that is not given by such a measure of historical time. The disjunction which
                  appears here is amplified in the closing lines of this first stanza when Shelley
                  voices the sentiment that Adonais’s fate and fame “shall be an echo and a light
                  unto eternity,” but then binds this sentiment to a future that “dares to forget
                  the past.” The inevitability of this binding has already been expressed in the
                  words through which the sorrow of the “sad Hour” is to teach its own sorrow to its
                  “obscure compeers”: “with me / Adonais died.” In this phrase, the time of mourning
                  and the time of the event it addresses are made contiguous by means of a spatial
                  and temporal metonymy. In this metonymy, two unreconciled senses of time are
                  forced to stand in balance with one another: the moment of an event (Adonais’s
                  death) and the experience of that event. Together these form the emotional affect
                  from which Shelley’s elegy proceeds.</p>
                  <p>What already surfaces through the figure of the “sad Hour” is taken up by the
                  second figure Shelley invokes, except on this occasion the focus is no longer
                     <emph>time</emph> but shifts to <emph>place</emph> in relation to Adonais’s
                  death. Shelley asks at the beginning of the second stanza: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Where were you mighty Mother, when he lay,</l>
                           <l>When thy Son lay pierced by the shaft which flies</l>
                           <l>In darkness? Where was Urania </l>
                           <l>When Adonais died? (10-13)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Repeated here is the disjunction in which the elegy originates
                  and to which one of its strongest thematic strains seeks to return: the
                  coincidence of place and experience. Also repeated is the obscurity of comparison
                  evoked by reference to “compeers” in the first stanza. This obscurity resurfaces
                  here when the event that defines the elegiac, death, is described as occurring “in
                  darkness,” in what remains obscure because it cannot be seen. Yet, the fate
                  achieved in this darkness is also what is meant to become “an echo and light unto
                  eternity.” The disjunctive conjunction of the darkness of the event with the
                  assertion of a light that the future will at some point dare to extinguish also
                  extends to the solitary Echo who “rekindles faint melodies” in this passage. This
                  rekindling, as a form of repetition, not only recalls the imperative to teach that
                  Shelley gives to the “sad Hour” in the first stanza; it is also present when
                  Shelley answers here his own question, “Where was Urania when Adonis died?” and
                  tells us where she was as well as what she was doing: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l rendition="#indent4">With veiled eyes,</l>
                           <l>’Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise</l>
                           <l>She sate, while one, with soft enamoured breath,</l>
                           <l>Rekindled all the fading melodies,</l>
                           <l>With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,</l>
                           <l>He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of death. (13-18)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> With veiled eyes, Urania is surrounded by Echoes who, contrary to
                  their name, are not being listened to but are themselves the listeners. By
                  reversing the expected order, the lawful calculation that defines the place of an
                  echo, Shelley not only separates the echo from the event of a sound in which it
                  originates, but also puts these Echoes in the position of waiting to have a sound
                  to echo. But, no such sound occurs. Instead, one Echo repeats already-heard
                  sounds, “fading melodies,” that mask the arrival of death which comes, not with
                  sound or visibility (the shaft that kills flies in darkness), but with “bulk,” the
                  “bulk of death.” The clash between sound—its lightness of breath, its repetitions,
                  and its melodiousness—with the bulk of death not only brings a condition that
                  cannot be repeated into a scene filled with repetitions that are given no origin,
                  but it also sets up this scene as one that already mocks—“like flowers that mock
                  the corse beneath”—the event that is about to arrive.</p>
                  <p>The disjunction fuelled by this mockery will later force Urania to the recognition
                  that her mourning is driven by an identification to which she is doubly bound and
                  to which she gives voice in her address to the dead Adonais: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l rendition="#indent4">I would give</l>
                           <l>All that I am to be as thou now art!</l>
                           <l>But I am chained to Time and cannot thence depart. (232-34)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The time to which Urania is chained contains both the demand for
                  identification as well as its denial. To become Adonais is to become the bulk that
                  no sound, no word, and no name can achieve without first relinquishing the meaning
                  and destroying the intention of that identification. The effect of this situation
                  on the task of elegy is already recognized by Shelley when, in one of his few
                  direct interjections into this poem, he remarks: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Alas! That all we loved of him should be,</l>
                           <l>But for our grief, as if it had not been,</l>
                           <l>And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!</l>
                           <l>Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene</l>
                           <l>The actors or spectators? (181-85)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Only in the echo of grief does the past have a time in which to
                  be present; otherwise, as Shelley observes, the living will be as if they had not
                  been. Shelley goes on to note that this present, this grief, is bound by the same
                  condition that makes grief possible in the first place: mortality. The result of
                  this condition is that the address expressed in grief is separated from what it
                  would address by the presence of a mortality within that same address. The “I” who
                  weeps at the very beginning of <title level="m">Adonais</title> now becomes the
                  source and object of the suffering as it fails to find its proper destination in a
                  name that has always kept its impropriety. On the heels of this recognition, there
                  then arrives the arrest of knowledge Hölderlin locates in the wrath of Oedipus:
                  “Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene the actors or spectators?” Bereft of
                  a place of departure and bereft of a reason to guard the possibility of such a
                  place, Shelley can only account for the past as a scene, a performance that allows
                  no decision as to whether one is its actor or spectator. Such a decision presumes
                  a knowledge that can be grasped and calculated in the form of a history that can
                  be repeated and purified in that repetition.</p>
                  <p>When such purification or catharsis is not possible, the question of who mourns
                  and for what comes to the fore. It does so precisely because the elegy mourns for
                  the scene it produces as if it were a past that could be reenacted or translated
                  into another place, another time. Here, the full force of the name of Shelley’s
                  elegy is felt but not simply for its challenge to the critical demand that has
                  taken hold of genre: whence is it and why? What is at stake in this name, Adonais,
                  is that it is more flower than “corse.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">On this
                     image, see, Andrew Epstein. </note> To read Adonais as more “corse” than
                  “flower” would be, according to Benjamin’s account of mourning, to remain unnamed
                  since it is only from the name that mourning can arise (“To be named [. . .]
                  remains perhaps always a presentiment of mourning”). To demand the body of Keats
                  as the subject of this elegy’s name is to misunderstand that we mourn for the name
                  that remains, for the name whose meaning is granted by the death of what it names
                  in its act of naming. Such naming points to an experience of death in the only
                  form that this experience can take: a presentiment of mourning. As another poet,
                  this time one who takes the name of Adonis, writes in a poem addressing yet
                  another unnamed poet, such a death is always preceded by a word, its name. It is
                  for the name of such a word that we mourn and, as these lines by Adonis recognize,
                  it is in the necessity of that mourning that the tragic remains, as long as we do
                  not forget McCall’s admonition and mistake the painting for a mirror:</p>

                  <p> Hölderlin’s translations of Sophocles occupy an ambiguous place in his work.
                  Composed and published during his most intense period of lyric creativity
                  (1801-1805), the Sophocles translations are generally regarded as highly
                  significant, if not central, achievements in that complex of texts collectively
                  periodized as the poet’s <emph>Spätwerk</emph>, mostly associated with the late
                  hymns and lyric fragments. In spite of numerous allusions to, and citations from,
                  the Sophocles-project, the subject has elicited only a handful of monographs<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Beissner published the first full-length study in
                     1933: <emph>Hölderlins Übersetzungen aus dem Griechischen</emph>; W.
                     Schadewaldt, “Hölderlins Übersetzung des Sophokles”; K. Reinhardt, “Hölderlin
                     und Sophokles”; W. Binder, “Hölderlin und Sophokles”; R. B. Harrison,
                        <emph>Hölderlin and Greek Literature</emph>; George Steiner,
                        <emph>Antigones</emph>, pp. 66-106; P. Lacoue-Labarthe, “The Caesura of the
                     Speculative.” This list is representative, not exhaustive. </note>, and the
                  question remains: does Hölderlin’s writing during this period culminate in the
                  Sophocles translations, or do the latter—in their wild swerves from the original
                  and their arcane meanings—rather announce the onset of the poet’s loss of sense in
                  the onset of mental illness? It is of course possible to answer, “yes” to both
                  questions; but however the critic answers these and other questions, it appears
                  that the translations (of both Pindar and Sophocles) exist at the boundaries of
                  our classifications and pose challenges to our present practices and capacities of
                  evaluation and appreciation.</p>
                  <p> Vastly outnumbered as it is by the score of books and essays on the late hymns,
                  or on <emph>Hyperion</emph>, or Hölderlin’s own tragedy <emph>Empedokles</emph>,
                  the relative paucity of commentary devoted to the translations is not hard to
                  understand. The obscure idiom of the “Notes” (<emph>Anmerkungen</emph>) attached
                  to <emph>Antigone </emph>and <emph>Oedipus Tyrannus</emph> stands as a
                  hermeneutical obstacle to those who would seek to interpret the translations
                  themselves; and these latter are themselves rife with turns of phrase and word
                  usages that are as “difficult” as any in the late lyrics. If we allow the figure
                  of speech that gives voice and spirit to texts (and many of Hölderlin’s lyrics are
                  mediations on the possibility of this figure), then the spirits and voices of the
                  Sophocles translations are more diffuse or elusive than those which the reader
                  soon feels, or imagines, to be present in the late hymns. The characteristic
                  “voices” of the lyrics are indeed recognizable in the translations—as in the
                  German rendition of the famous first stasimon of <emph>Antigone</emph>, the
                     <emph>polla ta deina </emph>ode. But such lyric or hymnic voices are mixed in
                  with other voices, or nonvoices, which are hard to identify and which seem to come
                  out of the nowhere of a purely linguistic conjuration. From one point of view at
                  least, these often inscrutable tonalities can be compared to the latest
                  lyrics—those written after 1806, during the years of Hölderlin’s
                  institutionalization: in both the translations and the productions of the last
                  phase, the speaker can conceal himself behind poetic statements which are hard to
                  assign to any recognizable person. The predictable rhyme and regular meter of the
                  last or latest lyrics creates a mask of poetic cliché effacing or distancing the
                  sense of the personal; just as the <emph>dramatis personae </emph>speaking the
                  lines of <emph>Antigonä </emph>are neither Sophoclean nor really Hölderlinian, but
                  can appear as characters beyond our ken and kinship, with those disembodied voices
                  of textual pasts and futures which Hölderlin’s translations bring into play. If
                  these texts resist the reader’s attempt to give them recognizable voices and
                  spirits—if we don’t know just <emph>who </emph>is speaking and to what
                  purposes—then the task of interpretation and classification can be awkward.</p>
                  <p> There exists another reason why such scant attention has been given to the
                  Sophocles translations, despite their acknowledged importance. The literary
                  tradition, like human consciousness, is highly selective and incorporates into
                  itself only what insures the continuity of its own discourse. As an indispensable
                  instrument of the <emph>traditio imperii</emph>, translation plays its crucial
                  role in the constitution of literary history; but tradition prefers to define its
                  high moments and monuments by reference to original works rather than to
                  translated ones. The work of literature is supposed to rise from the depths of the
                  authorial consciousness; especially in the Romantic text, claims to originality
                  are based on the sense of an origination from “within,” that place which modernity
                  has assigned as the domain of imagination, or aesthetic and ethical freedom. But a
                  translation can’t originate from this region directly—<emph>its </emph>origin is
                  already “outside,” in another always more original text. How can the Romantic
                  translator vie with the Romantic author for originality, when the former has
                  already yielded up so many of his authorial prerogatives to another, always more
                  original and originary author—original works appear to live up to and fulfill,
                  better than translations do, commonsense and contextualist assumptions about
                  written texts: namely, that literature is mimetic, responding to and representing
                  the psychological experience and socio-historical conditions of authors. No matter
                  how creative or “original” it may be, a translation is valued just because it is
                  derivative: it re-represents, as an interpretation and a rewriting, what the
                  original author felt, said, thought, or created. There are no texts in our
                  literary halls of fame that are there as translations because to accord to a work
                  classed as “translation” the status of a canonical “original” would be to discard
                  deeply embedded presuppositions about artistic autonomy and to accept instead
                  another model of literature—one in which non-mimetic influences (such as
                  linguistic or intertextual ones) would prevail over personal, representation, and
                  historical assumptions. </p>
                  <p> Two essays on Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations may serve to illustrate how the
                  binary opposition “original”/”translation” becomes the framework within which the
                  critic is compelled to work, even when his own insights suggest that this
                  framework may be inadequate. A central problem for those who write on Hölderlin’s
                  translation will be how to account for—or what to do with—their wild deviations
                  from the original, their semantic and tonal swerves from it, and, in general,
                  their radical revision of their own “efficient cause” (Steiner 72); and the
                  specific task of those who operate wholly within the above binary system is to
                  elaborate strategies and ideologies which save <emph>Antigonä </emph>and
                     <emph>Ödipus der Tyrann as translations</emph> (as repetitions and
                  representations of Sophocles) while acknowledging them as <emph>originals
                  </emph>(as repetitions and representations of “Hölderlin”). But this
                  reconciliation of the text under the two aspects of secondary, belated
                  “translations” and primary, original “originals” is not so reasonable as may
                  appear at first glance.</p>
                  <p> “The <emph>Antigonä </emph>carries to extremity the radicalization of lexical and
                  syntactic means, the shift from sequential-logical conventions and from the
                  external reference of ordinary discourse to an internalized coherence of metaphor
                  and image-clusters” writes George Steiner in a recent study of Hölderlin’s
                     <emph>Antigone </emph>(67). Steiner thus does full justice to the radicality
                  and “self-consuming anarchy” of the translations; the latter “seem to prefigure
                  Mallarmé’s text” in their “‘paratactic,’ which is to say ‘discontinuous’ [. . .]
                  fragmented mode of relation” (16). But Steiner then keeps the recognized
                  linguistic anarchy and violence of the <emph>Antigonä</emph> well contained within
                  “the ideal [. . .] of fusion, of a homecoming (tragically frustrated) to oneness
                  between consciousness and the world” (69). Although this Return of the temporally
                  alienated consciousness to modern Hesperia along the path of translation is
                  “tragically frustrated,” Hölderlin’s fracturing and disruption of the Sophoclean
                  text reflect, for Steiner, the “record of a pilgrimage out of inner exile” (69).
                  The “extra-territoriality” of Hölderlin’s translation—its excesses and
                  idiosyncrasies which defy interpretation—creates (in the economy of Steiner’s
                  exegesis) the need for the aesthetically compelling myth of a tragic romance which
                  can explain and account for the translator’s excesses: Hölderlin commits “treason”
                  against Sophocles, but this is a “loving treason of a rare kind” (105). The Modern
                  betrays the Ancient, his master, only in order to become, in the affective pathos
                  of this “tragedy of translation,” the “transmutation of the Greek original into
                  its ‘wholeness’” (80).</p>
                  <p> Wolfgang Schadewaldt’s work on Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations provides a
                  second example of how the wildness of these translations—their “obscurity,”
                  “isolation,” and “aberrancy”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        “<foreign>Abseitig</foreign>” recurs again and again in Schadewaldt’s
                     essay.</note>—is inscribed within a normative vision of literature which
                  privileges the original over the translation, even when the latter is promoted to
                  the status of (almost) original literature. In Schadewaldt’s argument, the more
                  “original” (=refractory, insubordinate, or “wayward”) the translation is, the more
                  “Hölderlinian”; but the more Hölderlinian, the more “Sophoclean” the text becomes,
                  because poets are best at fathoming the latent designs of other poets. In this way
                  the very “idiosyncrasies” of the translator, and his many “swerves” from the
                  original text, lead “to the most astonishing of insights into the essence of Greek
                  tragedy” (279). Schadewaldt does enumerate a number of unfruitful mistranslations
                  of the Greek, but he goes on to say that “the majority of Hölderlin’s linguistic
                  errors are creative errors.” Although the translations are full of “the strangest
                  riddles” and eccentricities, their hieroglyphic and arcane idiom still stands—for
                  Schadewaldt—under the aegis and in the service of a “universal truth” having to do
                  with the essence of tragedy. Hölderlin’s “creative errors” (as opposed to his
                  “linguistic” ones) and riddling phrases are at one and the same time a “new
                  discourse” [<emph>Neusprache</emph>] and a “restatement” or “repetition”
                     [<emph>Nachsprechen</emph>] of Sophocles and the discourse of the original. </p>
                  <p> Yet how else can we read <emph>Antigonä</emph>, for example, except <emph>as
                  </emph>a translation? Is it not, after all, a “translation”? Doesn’t
                     “<foreign>Geist der Liebe</foreign>” translate the Greek word
                  <emph>eros</emph>, à la Hölderlin, in the sense it takes in the third stasimon of
                     <emph>Antigone</emph>, just before the heroine stages (in the
                     <emph>kommos</emph>) her own “encrypting”? However idiosyncratic
                     “<foreign>Geist der Liebe</foreign>” is for <emph>eros</emph>, isn’t the
                  substitution in the end a legitimate revision of the anarchic and destructive
                  Greek “libido” into a Romantic energy and
                     <emph>Vereinigungsphilosophie</emph>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                     historico-philosophical idea of the
                     “<foreign>Vereinigungsphilosophie</foreign>” is summarized by Gerhard Kurz in
                     his <emph>Mittelbarkeit und Vereinigung</emph>, 16-31. </note> that strives for
                  synthesis and reconciliation? Again, isn’t a translation supposed to draw upon the
                  special resources of its language in order to achieve a palingenesis of the
                  original Spirit [<emph>Geist</emph>] in the words of the translation, and thus to
                  make the difficult passage between two different semiotic systems and historical
                  epochs? There are many examples that could be cited where the passage between
                  original and translation—insofar as that passage can be said to take place at
                  all—is much harder to subsume or sublate as instances of “translation.” But the
                  above example, where <emph>eros</emph> becomes “<foreign>Geist der
                  Liebe</foreign>,” may exemplify a “passage” and “translation” that is just as
                  problematic as other, much more obscure moments, since “<foreign>Geist</foreign>”
                  and “<foreign>Liebe</foreign>” are especially suited to generate a fog that hides
                  the lacunae of always potential non-relations between “Greek” texts and
                  “Hesperian” ones. There is enough textual evidence to suggest that Hölderlin was
                  using the translations as a pretext to write towards some unknown (style or sense)
                  in order to bring about some radical mutation in literary language. In this case,
                  the Sophoclean original could have served as a “pre-text” authorizing an
                  experiment whose purpose was to elaborate a writing that would be resistant to the
                  “positivity” of tradition, with its exhausted conventions and depleted
                     resources.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The fact that Hölderlin often
                     adhered closely to the Greek syntax, and mimed it in the German word order,
                     doesn’t weaken the point being made here that Hölderlin was carrying out his
                     own experiments in the textual laboratory of Sophocles. </note> When the
                  difficulties of understanding the hybrid or mutant language become
                  intolerable—when its openings to fresh meaning turn into hermeneutical
                  bafflements—then the text can fall back on the Greek tragedy, or fall <emph>into
                  </emph>the meanings of the original, and thus make itself readable. </p>
                  <p> To interpret Hölderlin’s “tragedies” by the light of the Sophoclean originals is
                  perhaps as necessary as translating texts (in general) into experiences, or
                  experience into texts, and as necessary as assigning extra-textual referents to
                  texts: such modes of “translation” are what bestow meaning and authority upon
                  text. But this necessity—the shadow or ghost of a (Hölderlinian) Sophocles who
                  haunts, and constantly repossesses, the translator’s language—at the same time
                  violates that language, since it runs the risk of foreclosing or forcing meanings,
                  or ceasing to read them, or reading them only in certain directions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Paul de Man’s “The Return to Philology”: to
                     “return” to philology means “to read a text closely as a text and not to move
                     at once into the general context of human experience or history” (23).</note>
                  As he states in the “Notes to Antigone,” the “weak point” [<emph>Schwäche</emph>]
                  of modern representation is its “absence of destiny,” which he labels “<emph>das
                     Schicksallose</emph>” and “<emph>das dysmoron</emph>” (<emph>FHA</emph>
                     409ff).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Citations from “Anmerkungen zur
                     Antigonä” will be abbreviated <emph>FHA</emph> (<emph>Frankfurter
                        Ausgabe</emph>). </note> The translations would, then, (Hölderlin’s argument
                  implies) attempt to forge a discourse that can escape or elude those figures which
                  provide the designs for one’s unfateful history (<emph>dysmoron</emph>); but such
                  an escape can only be attempted <emph>in </emph>and <emph>through</emph> a
                  translation of the authoritative and nomothetic Original—whose own fate-fulness is
                  what causes the impotence of modern, belated writing. Translation in Hölderlin’s
                  context thus describes an encounter of Hesperian modes of figuration
                     (“<foreign>vaterländische(n)</foreign>,” “<foreign>Vorstellungsarten</foreign>”
                     [<emph>FHA</emph> 418]) with themselves in their unfallen, original and
                  lapidary, state. Translation is a way to restate or refigure oneself at the
                  origin, and a way to repeat and recycle modern (unfateful or “positive”) figures;
                  but the repetition has the purpose of erasing the original, which is remembered
                  (repeated) in order to be forgotten. Whether these two facets (translating,
                  remembering, repeating the original vs. forgetting or effacing it in one’s own
                  originations) should be structured as a dialectic (as Steiner’s and Schadewaldt’s
                  arguments do), or whether these two moments should be conceived as an
                  irreconcilable difference (non-dialectical, admitting of no, or little, mutually
                  illuminating reciprocity)—is a question that implicitly informs the following
                  sections of this essay, whose concern is more to provide material for a
                  consideration of the question, than to answer it. We turn now to the play
                     <emph>Antigone</emph>, which is about a translation, that “translation” of the
                  body of the slain Polyneices to the Otherworld where it is to be hallowed but kept
                  out of sight; yet the attempts to bury (translate, render) it all end in failure,
                  and at the end the corpse gets torn to pieces, rent rather than properly rendered
                  to Hades. We propose, then, to investigate the theme of burial in the
                     <emph>Antigone</emph>—or rather the attempted burial ending in the
                     <emph>sparagmos</emph> of the body—as an articulation and philosopheme about
                  translation in general, and about Hölderlin’s translations of <emph>Antigone
                  </emph>in particular. </p>

                  <p> The argument could be made that the real hero of this play is not Antigone, but
                  the corpse of her brother Polyneices. Characters could be said to exist as much
                  for its sake, as it for their sakes.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                     thematic importance of the body of Polyneices has largely been obscured by the
                     history of interpretation of <emph>Antigone</emph>. As the most popular play
                     (Greek or otherwise!) of the nineteenth century, <emph>Antigone </emph>owes its
                     popularity not to the body of Polyneices but to Antigone, the heroine who
                     incarnates a feminine intuition that remains true to itself and to those family
                     values its champions even when faced with death. The ideaization of the female
                        <emph>as sister</emph> no doubt offered an ethic more socially viable (for a
                     rising bourgeoisie) than the female as wife, mother, mistress, or friend, since
                     the sister figure would allow the spectator/reader to be titillated by the
                     young, beautiful, and nubile heroine, while at the same time the audience
                     morality could be assuaged by that heroine’s non-sexual love for a family
                     member, which is meant to take precedence over all erotic impulses. But
                     Antigone’s love for her brother (her “brotherly love”) depends for its very
                     purity—its elevation over the sexual—upon the deadness of her brother, for this
                     deadness kills the possibility of incest (very much a skeleton in the family
                     closet), and raises her love to the status of a Christian <emph>agape</emph>.
                     One should recall that the body of her brother is totally destroyed—as if to
                     eradicate in this <emph>sparagmos</emph> all possibility of any sexual
                     attachment between the heroine and her loved one, and thus assure the complete
                     spirituality of her love.</note> As the constant object of dialogue and
                     <emph>agon</emph>, the body is the decomposing source of the play’s conflicts
                  and catastrophes. It reveals character in generating their antithetical
                  discourses, since they are always uttering words over it, and about it, in their
                  attempts to appropriate it for their own purposes and tell different stories about
                  it. The questions that begin and end the play are questions about the body: what
                  to <emph>do </emph>with the unsightly corpse, whether to bury it or not, where to
                  put it, and what will be the psychological, political, and aesthetic consequences
                  if it is (or isn’t) buried.</p>
                  <p> In this essay we are considering the play <emph>Antigone </emph>(both Sophocles’
                  and Hölderlin’s texts) as an allegory of translation, centered in the brouhaha
                  over burial and funeral rite. Greek tragedy characteristically discomposes human
                  institutions by disclosing (or, in the present case, unearthing) possibilities
                  customary suppressed and concealed—such as incest, parricide, and decaying bodies.
                  To approach the theme of burial as exemplification or literalization of
                  translation (which, when it means “say the same thing in another language,” is
                  always figural) is by no means alien to Hölderlin’s own theory and practice of
                  translation, as this section hopes to demonstrate. There are three attempts to
                  bury (translate) the body, and each one fails; the <emph>Antigone</emph> is
                  accordingly about what happens when translation doesn’t take place. In this
                  allegory of failed translation, the object of translation—the body, the dead,
                  which for Hölderlin were represented by “the Greeks” and their original
                  scripts—disintegrates and pollutes the holy, or drives spirit out of its fragile
                  embodiments. At the end we are left with pieces of Polyneices but no Polyneices,
                  and the Gods announce their rage in the bloodied semiotic vehicles of Teiresias’
                  omen—the birds who literally rend each other to pieces.</p>
                  <p> Greek tragedy has fascinated Hölderlin and others because of its technique of
                  staging, even as collision and rupture, the conjuncture of the natural and
                  supernatural. In the “Notes” to his plays and elsewhere, Hölderlin scrutinizes the
                  place or <emph>topos </emph>of contact between divine and human, and interrogates
                  this place or moment as to the modes and means of relation and communion, or
                  non-relation and difference, achieved or achievable between the ordinary and the
                  uncanny. Two passages will help to suggest how tragedy, in Hölderlin’s eyes, is
                  concerned with that space, gap, vacuum, “stage,” or moment of passage that
                  separates immaterial powers and those material vehicles of their potential
                  empowering and inhabiting. To Hölderlin, then, tragedy is <emph>about</emph> this
                  space where Spirit hinges onto word (or art-work)—or doesn’t hinge—or where “God”
                  erupts into human temporality and grasps “man” (or doesn’t do so); and tragedy,
                  being about this space or stage of potential contract, is also about that
                  transport (or obstruction) of sense and meaning in the passage of meaning between
                  two languages. It should come as no surprise to anyone acquainted with Hölderlin’s
                  thought that the linguistic problem of translation is inextricably bound up with
                  theological and existential issues. </p>
                  <p> The first passage, taken from the “Notes to Antigone,” dissects the moment of
                  “translation” by freezing “the Spirit of Time and Nature” in the moment of its
                  “wildest” confrontation with that “sensory object” in which it (or man) is
                  interested: <quote>Der kühnste Moment eines Taglaufs oder Kunstwerks ist, wo der
                     Geist der Zeuir und Natur, <foreign>das Himmlische</foreign>, was den Menschen
                     ergreift, und der Gegenstand, für welchen er sich interessiert, <emph>am
                        wildesten gegeneinander stehen</emph>, weil der sinnliche Gegenstand nur
                     eine Hälfte weit reicht, der Geist aber <emph>am mächtigsten erwacht</emph>,
                     da, wo die zweite Hälfte angehet. In diesem Momente muß der Mensch sich am
                     meisten festhalten, deswegen steht er auch da am offensten in seinem Charakter.
                        (<emph>FHA </emph>412, my emphases)</quote> At its “boldest moment,” the
                  “Kunstwerk” (in this case, the tragedy <emph>Antigonä</emph>) or
                     “<foreign>Taglauf</foreign>” (consciousness in the historical and temporal
                  cycles of its percipience) is to exhibit “Spirit” (or the spirit-in-man) and the
                  material object of its “interest” <emph>as </emph>they are in themselves, each
                  without its other half that completes it. Without that sensory object which it
                  desires to spiritualize, acculturate, or translate, spirit is a dervish whirling
                  in a vacuum, or frenzied nothingness; and the sensory objects of spiritual quest
                  manifest themselves in this hiatus as truly inert, dead matter, or matter reduced
                  to what it would be without the saving aura of spiritual appropriation and desire.
                  As is clear from the context of this citation from the “Notes,” that “sensory
                  object” of Spirit’s attentions in none other than the exposed body of
                     Polyneices.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hölderlin writes this paragraph
                     as a commentary to the preceding lines taken from his translation of
                        <emph>Antigone</emph> ll. 499ff.: “<foreign>Was wagtest du ein solches
                        Gesetz zu brechen</foreign>?” (Creon)—“<foreign>Darum, mein Zeus berichtete
                        mirs nicht, Noch hier im Haus das Recht der Todesgötter</foreign>,” etc.
                     (Antigone). This exchange marks the climax in the protagonists’
                        <emph>agon</emph>, which is all about the body of Polyneices and the “crime”
                     of burying it. </note> But it is important to note that this philosophical
                  drama which the “Kunstwerk” boldly presents stages a scene of
                     <emph>potential</emph> or <emph>attempted</emph> inspiration or contact between
                  the spiritual (Concept, Idea, Spirit, Meaning, “<foreign>das
                  Himmlische</foreign>”) and the material (the visible body of Polyneices, physical
                  bodies in general, the letter). That is, the object occupies the “first-half,”
                  while the domain of Spirit [<emph>Geist</emph>] inhabits the “second-half.” The
                  object (or body) makes absolutely no effort to reach out and touch Spirit, but
                  “reaches only half-way”—not unlike Michelangelo’s Adam who languidly awaits the
                  inspiriting touch of God. We are not told that Spirit actually makes contact with
                  the body, but only that it “wakes up quite forcefully” [<emph>am mächtigsten
                     erwacht</emph>] where its space, the “second-half,” begins. It is unclear
                  whether Spirit begins precisely where the body ends (or “ends up”), or whether it
                  simply begins or flares into wakefulness at the boundary of its own
                  territory—which may still be separated, by an unbridgeable lacuna, from the
                  corporeal domain of things, objects, and bodies.</p>
                  <p> “In this moment [<emph>In diesem Momente</emph>] man must get a grip on himself
                  the most,” presumably because the daemonic energy of awakened Spirit and matter
                  would reveal human character (“<foreign>steht er auch da am offensten in seinem
                     Charakter</foreign>”) by exposing it to the dangers of that possible lacuna of
                  non-relation that separates Spirit and object. Is there contact between the two,
                  or isn’t there? Can we speak of a passage and transport between the two, or rather
                  can there be only a hiatus, “caesura,” or abyss dividing them? The “man” who thus
                  confronts this question is thus not only the generic “man” represented by the
                  tragic hero and heroine, but also the reader and translator of bold works of art,
                  culture, and nature [cf. “Taglauf”]. Their own “spirits” (here to be identified
                  generally with the drive and desire that invests “sensory objects” with meaning)
                  are revealed in that very moment when they compelled to witness that the objects
                  (bodies, words) of their interests always remain potentially untouched and
                  “unspirited” by their attempts to appropriate and master them. </p>
                  <p> In Hölderlin’s philosophical tableau (preceding citation), then, we see “the
                  Spirit of Time and Nature” provoked by the heterogeneity and inertia of its object
                  into a sheer vigilance, one reflecting all the difficulty or impossibility of
                  making contact or otherwise engaging that object. At issue is what happens in the
                  passage (or non-passage) between Spirit as “transcendental [i.e., as yet
                  unfigured] Signified” and its material or sensory signifiers. Tragedy itself,
                  then—and the <emph>Kunstwerk</emph> in general—is the attempted mode of transport
                  and translation across the gap between Gods and bodies. We might concretize this
                  somewhat abstract exposition (which is forced on us by the abstractions of the
                  “Notes”) by taking the funeral ritual (and the first burial passage in the
                     <emph>Antigone</emph>) as an example of the means of transport and translation
                  across the “gap” outlined above. </p>
                  <p> The salient features of Hölderlin’s philosopheme—the waking Spirit, its
                  indifferent, lackadaisical object, the ambiguity about the contact between the
                  two, and the capacity of that ambiguity to reveal “character”—are all features of
                  burial rituals. The way in which a culture deals with its dead does provide a kind
                  of index to that culture. Those mythic spells (=Hölderlin’s “das Himmlische”) that
                  a people weaves around its dead in order to sanctify and hallow them (or: get rid
                  of, “forget” them by “remembering” them with grave and epitaph) can well reveal
                  (cf. “<foreign>steht er auch da am offensten in seinem Charakter</foreign>”) the
                  historico-spiritual nature of a culture. Whether they operate by inhumation,
                  cremation, mummification, or exposure of the body to birds (as in Zoroastrian
                  customs), or to the elements (Amerindians), funerary conventions are crucial in
                  the life of a culture: these rituals all aim to close the gap between
                     <emph>animus</emph> and <emph>corpus</emph>, and such closure then allows the
                  members of a community to envision themselves as participants of dramas larger and
                  more meaningful than the individual tragedies of biological extinction. </p>
                  <p> A passage from a well-known letter to Böhlendorff explicitly thematizes the sense
                  of “tragedy” [<emph>das Tragische</emph>] as a genre or sentiment <emph>about
                  </emph>the attempted closure and enclosure of the dead, their transport out of the
                  world of the living: <quote>Denn das ist das Tragische bei uns, daß wir ganz
                     stille in irgendeinem Behälter eingepackt vom Reiche der Lebendigen
                     hinweggehen, nicht daß wir in Flammen verzehrt die Flamme büßen, die wir nicht
                     zu bändigen vermochten. (<emph>Sämtliche Werke und Briefe</emph> 2.913)</quote>
                  Understood as a reference both to the literary genre and to tragic misfortune,
                  “what is tragic for us” has to do with the fact that “we depart the realm of the
                  living” while “packed up very still in some sort of container.” Modern tragedy
                     (“<foreign>das Tragische bei uns</foreign>”)—which after the
                     <emph>Empedokles</emph> project could only occur within the institution of
                     <emph>translated</emph> Greek tragedy—finds its central emblem or master trope
                  in the coffin, which can be so emblematic of “the tragedy” of Hesperian
                  representation because it is the vehicle of transport and transformation by which
                  the dead are “translated” from the corporeal to the spiritual realm. Playing on
                  the meanings of “<foreign>das Tragische</foreign>,” Hölderlin comments on the loss
                  of visionariness among the moderns, whose tropologies (modes of transport,
                  metaphorical resources) are designed to hide from their eyes the sight of the
                  actual, visible translation between the two realms—such as cremation (“the
                  flames”) would exhibit. Whether the moderns have lost faith in the possibility of
                  such translation and “passage between,” or whether they simply cannot tolerate the
                  unmediated contact with the daemonic energies that flare up (or “wake up”) in that
                  funerary passage of cremation, they cannot in any case bear to witness the passage
                  itself, but must resort to the strongboxes, “containers” [<emph>Behälter</emph>],
                  and the protective coffin-concepts of modern culture. This modern mode of
                  transport is, the citation suggests, potentially deluded: whereas “the Greeks” can
                  be sure of translation, can be sure that the spirit takes over as the body turns
                  to ashes (because they <emph>watch</emph> this happening), the moderns watch their
                  bodies go intact into the container, which then gives the illusion that it will
                  preserve the body <emph>intact</emph>, but which will rather just conceal the
                  disintegration of the body. The implication of Hölderlin’s observation to his
                  fellow tragedian Böhlendorff is that modern tragedy is under the spell of a double
                  bind: if the body were destroyed in full view, and annihilated in the flame, the
                  modern would lose <emph>mastery</emph> of the sacred (since it would either
                  consume consciousness in its own conflagration; or the sacred would withdraw or
                  vanish altogether, for the sight of the disintegrating body would call the
                  spiritual into question, and perhaps even destroy it, along with the body); but,
                  in retaining his mastery and control of the sacred by transporting bodies (away
                  from the living) in the coffin the modern never knows if translation takes place,
                  since the transmutation of the body into spirit—if it takes place—is hidden within
                  the coffin, which itself is hidden underground. </p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Antigone</emph>, though, is not about cremation at all, but about burial and
                  its containers. That “<foreign>unterirdische Behausung</foreign>” and
                     “<foreign>gegrabene Kluft</foreign>” into which Antigone is banished are
                  hyperbolic figures for the “modern” tragedy of excessive containment which may put
                  bodies out of reach of spirit. This play, then, has something to do with “modern
                  tragedy” (“<foreign>das Tragische bei uns</foreign>”), and so qualifies as an
                  (ancient) tragedy about modern modes of representation and translation which
                  violate their spirits and bodies either by “grounding” them too much or not
                  enough. Antigone’s “burial” is diametrically opposed to that of Polyneices, her
                  brother and alter-ego; she is buried too much, and he too little. But the focus of
                  our inquiry is the corpse. Hölderlin went so far as to read this corpse, both the
                     <emph>arche </emph>and <emph>telos </emph>of Spirit, as the <emph>locus
                     classicus</emph> of the Absolute, or the place where “the unmediated God” is to
                  manifest itself as a figure in the text of translation; as such, the corpse—with
                  its catastrophes of interrupted burial—marks out the space of possible
                  translation: between languages, between the living and the dead, between “Spirit”
                  and its self-figurations, and between the textual <emph>corpus </emph>of Sophocles
                  and that of Hölderlin. If we keep in mind that the western literary canon itself
                  was for Hölderlin a sort of “container” or pervasive coffin-text that hid the
                  Sophoclean <emph>corpus</emph> from view and put it out of our hermeneutical reach
                  (thereby preserving <emph>us </emph>from it), then we might compare Hölderlin’s
                  undertaking as translator to that of an undertaker who opens a crypt as the first
                  act in the dramatic process of “translating” the relics of a newly canonized saint
                  to holier ground. </p>

                  <head>3. The first burial of the <emph>Antigone</emph> (lines 245ff)</head>
                  <p> The issue of the previous two sections can be crystallized and fruitfully
                  complicated through a comparison of the German and Greek texts at the moment of
                  the first burial passage. Creon had issued an edict mandating the execution of
                  anyone who buries Polyneices, the attacker of Thebes and thus its archenemy. The
                  frightened and evasive guard tells the enraged king that the body has been buried
                  under very mysterious circumstances: nobody saw just who buried the corpse, and
                  the perpetrator has left no traces of himself or herself at the scene of the
                  crime. In Wolfgang Schadewaldt’s rendition: <quote>Denn da war keiner Hacke Schlag
                     noch einer Schaufel/ Aushub. Hart war die Erde, trocken, ohne Riß,/ Und auch
                     von keinem Wagen nicht befahren/ Mit Rädern, sondern da war keine Spur/ Von
                     irgendeinem Täter. —Als es uns/ Der zeigte, der die erste Tagwacht hatte,/
                     Kam’s alle als ein unbegreiflich Wunder an./ Der Tote war verschwunden—nicht zu
                     Grab gebracht,/ Nur leicht—wie um Befleckung zu vermeiden/ —Lag Staub darauf.
                     Und keine Spuren/ Zu sehn von einem Raubrier, einem Hund,/ Daß er gekommen und
                     an ihm gezerrt. (115)</quote> The unsigned burial is an “unmanageable wonder”
                     [<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qau%3Dma&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qau%3Dma0&amp;prior=pa=si">θαῦμα</ref>

                  noses, and also because these “body-guards” have failed in their duty and may have
                  to pay for it with their lives.</p>
                  <p> It can be plausibly argued that the Gods buried Polyneices in this first burial,
                  and not Antigone (as is usually assumed)—who is caught performing the second
                  burial at ll. 407ff. The chorus afterwards ventures the opinion that the burial
                  was “god-imposed” [<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qeh%2Flaton&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qeh%2Flaton0&amp;prior=kai%5C">θεήλατον</ref>], but Creon vehemently rejects this suggestion on the grounds
                  that “the Gods would never bury a traitor” (cf. lines 282-3); he instead suspects
                  hired subversives, perhaps members of Polyneices’ party who transgress the edict
                  just to challenge his authority. The divine has intervened elsewhere in Greek
                  literature to protect the dead from decomposition, and the entire play testifies
                  to the grave sacrilege of unburied bodies.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                        <emph>Iliad </emph>24.610-12, the gods bury Niobe’s children. Hektor’s body
                     is also saved from putrefaction. Arguments for the divine burial in

                     in Sophocles: the two burials of Antigone.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> We dwell momentarily on the presence of the divine in this burial scene because
                  this first “translation” of the body takes place in a context of the uncanny and
                  the supernatural. As an inscription of divine care for or “interest” in the body,
                  the non-signs (in)visible on the gravesite function as emblems of the play’s own
                  deep-rooted idealism and of its theology. In asking to be read as the signature of
                  the very Gods to the deed of burial, the signlessness (which the passage describes
                  at length) suggests that the Hand of God may be at work in all burials and
                  translations: these latter two are each of them operations that require the
                  collaboration of deity in their arduous tasks to veil from us the sight of
                  disintegration, whether of bodies or books and their meanings (which disintegrate
                  if they are not translated). Both translation and burial are a means of avoiding
                  the materiality of signs, and this ability to conjure away the material dimension
                  (of things)—which is rooted in the local and specific, and which therefore cannot
                  be translated or buried without violating the thing—is a sorcery that has to
                  enlist the aid of supernatural forces, which themselves leave no marks. </p>
                  <p> The actual burial, which here is very much a sorcery, is described at line 255.
                  At the beginning of his report, the guard had told Creon that “somebody just
                  buried the body” (ll. 245-6), and he reiterates this fact at line 255: <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%28&amp;la=greek&amp;can=o%283&amp;prior=parh=n">ὁ</ref>

                  Careful readers should be a bit disturbed or intrigued by this assertion of the
                  guard, since the body has not “really” been buried. That is, this burial is a
                  small miracle in itself, one exemplifying the sense of preternatural legerdemain
                  of the one (or One) who performed it: this “burial” is purely ritual or figural,
                  since it consists of just a few handfuls of dust scattered over the corpse in a
                  symbolic gesture to ward off the taboo or curse of the unburied dead. The corpse,
                  that is, is still “there,” and very much visible. The words “had been made
                  invisible” used by the guard to describe the burial is then a figure of speech,
                  but one made so efficacious by the magic coating of dust that the figure turns
                  into literal description: the body <emph>is </emph>translated away into its proper
                  realm, for the animals so eager to tear into it—“a meal for birds and dogs”
                  (205-6)—can’t see it and so leave it untouched.</p>
                  <p> Before observing how Hölderlin translates this uncanny translation, we should
                  first get a general sense of the verbal ambience of both the Greek and the German
                  passages, which are set out in full below (Greek lines 245-58). The Greek text
                  below differs from Hölderlin’s text (a corrupt Florentine edition) at one place,
                  which I shall indicate later on. </p>

                  the excited <emph>homme du peuple</emph> that he is, especially when his speech is
                  contrasted with Creon’s (preceding) introductory address (ll. 162-210), with its
                  balanced locutions and magniloquent phraseology of kings. Still, the guard does
                  manage to unfold the “wonder hard to behold” of the burial with some logic and
                  precision. He takes care to narrate even this quite remarkable occurrence in a
                  rhetoric of order and lucidity (as in “neither [. . .] nor” [<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29%2Fte&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29%2Fte1&amp;prior=d'">οὔτε</ref> [. . .] <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29%2Fte&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29%2Fte1&amp;prior=d'">οὔτε</ref>] [l. 257]; or cf. the simile “as” in 256 which implies some
                  presence of mind). It is as if this rational framework would, by seeking to
                  contain the great mystery of the burial within the bounds of the
                     <emph>logos</emph>, thus offer it up in palatable form to the (political)
                  reason of the king.</p>
                  <p> Hölderlin’s guard, however, nullifies all subtlety. The German elides the plastic
                  and delicate particles of the Greek and thus imparts to translation a disconnected
                  and asyndetic construction. Hölderlin’s efforts to preserve the Greek word order
                  taxes the German syntax with inversions (“<foreign>Nirgend war von einem Karst/
                     Ein Schlag</foreign>”) and troubles the sense with ellipses (cf. the omitted
                  verbs in “<foreign>Und dicht das Land; der Boden ungegraben</foreign>”). The style
                  of the translator’s late hymns has been compared to the syntagmatic composition of
                  both the Baroque <emph>Trauerspiel</emph>
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     Norbert von Hellingrath first pointed out the stylistic parallels between
                     Hölderlin’s translations of Sophocles and Baroque poetry. Cf. <emph>Hölderlins
                        Vermächtnis</emph>. Walter Benjamin also compares the translations with
                     Baroque <emph>Trauerspiel </emph>in his <emph>Ursprung des deutschen
                        Trauerspiels</emph>. </note> and the Expressionist lyric<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Kurt Bartsche, <emph>Die Hölderlin-Rezeption im deutschen
                        Expressionismus.</emph>
                     </note>, and this comparison is no less apt for the Sophocles translations;
                  especially in the later play <emph>Antigonä</emph> a mild dyslexia comes through
                  as a result of the translator’s efforts to foreground the individual word by
                  deleting syntax.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cf. Hans Peter Jaeger,
                        <emph>Hölderlin und Novalis: Grenzen der Sprache </emph>and Theodor Adorno’s
                     “Parataxis.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> This foregrounding radically alters the tonality of the passage. Whereas the
                  Greek account of the burial is recounted and narrated by one who successfully
                  masters his fear of the king, the German account comes across as being declaimed
                  and intoned by a wild-eyed prophet. The Greek reports the burial in the
                  locutionary mode of recollection and <emph>oratio obliqua</emph>, while the German
                  in a sense performs the event in its very utterance, which here itself becomes an
                     <emph>Ereignis</emph>. The inflections of the German guard approximate those of
                  a zealous preacher—perhaps not unlike on who recited the Bible for hours to the
                  seminarians during the translator’s schooling at the <emph>Stift</emph> in
                  Tübingen.</p>
                  <p> This comparison helps in specifying the pitch or verbal thrust of Hölderlin’s
                  German, which is theological and absolute. To Creon’s question (“Who would ever
                  dare such a thing—”), the guard responds with two words which hardly receive any
                  emphasis: <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐκ</ref>

                     “<foreign>Ich weiß es nicht</foreign>” or Kuchenmüller’s “<foreign>Ich weiß
                     nicht</foreign>” (Kuchenmüller 14)—Hölderlin’s rendering takes the reader (with
                  some violence) out of Sophocles’ text and translates one into the immensities of
                  another textual place, that “<foreign>Wüste der Spekulation</foreign>”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The phrase occurs in a letter (1.1.1799) to his
                     brother: “<foreign>Kant ist der Moses unserer Nation, der sie aus der

                        (<emph>StA </emph>6.1.304).</note> which to Hölderlin evoked the side of
                  modern writing. “<foreign>Undenklich</foreign>” connotes regions beyond the limits
                  of mind, memory, and perception, as in the phrase “<foreign>undenkliche
                     Zeit</foreign>,” or in Kant’s phrase in the first <emph>Critique</emph>, where
                  parallel lines are said to run out “into the Unthink-like” [<emph>ins
                     Undenkliche</emph>], into a place where thought has no place. Hölderlin had
                  identified tragedy, translated or original, with a modern writing of the Absolute:
                     “<foreign>Undenklich</foreign>” recalls the word
                     “<foreign>Undenkbare(m)</foreign>” in an apothegm from the “Notes to Antigone,”
                  where tragedy stages “man’s understanding” as it roams around “as under [the realm
                  of] the Unthinkable” [<emph>des Menschen Verstand, als unter Undenkbarem
                     wandelnd</emph>] (<emph>FHA </emph>413).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Such

                     unlimited historical and political possibilities not (yet) realized. Any path
                     taken across this “desert”—whether the inscribing pens of “Reason” or in the
                     transport of bodies in burial rites—would necessarily involve what Hölderlin
                     calls (in <emph>Grund zum Empedokles</emph>) the “<foreign>Nichtdenken des
                        Unbekannten</foreign>,” i.e., the radical forgetting of the desert terrain,

                  <p> This melodramatizing or absolutizing of the original manifests itself in other
                  ways. The Greek specifies and qualifies as it unfolds the details of the burial.

                  statement implies, but this particular one had the characteristic of being without
                  sign. Yet Hölderlin makes a “big Idea” out of the Greek, which in itself is a
                  highly significant phrase, but it remains only informational. “<foreign>Zeichenlos
                     war der Meister</foreign>,” however, is oracular and suggests, in a way the
                  Greek does not, other, wider contexts—whether the semiotic manifestations of deity
                  in general, the absence of their mark on graves, or engravings. “Zeichenlos war
                  der Meister,” that is, easily recalls the gnomic tonalities of the translator’s
                     <emph>Spätwerk</emph>, whose intertextual presence in the Sophocles (and
                  Pindar) translations often supply interlinear glosses (as here: “<foreign>Ein
                     Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos,/ schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast/ die Sprache
                     in der Fremde verloren</foreign>”—from “Mnemosyne”). </p>
                  <p> “<foreign>Meister</foreign>,” for <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%28rga%2Fths&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%28rga%2Fths0&amp;prior=a)/shmos">οὑργάτης</ref>, also has strong lyrical overtones. The Greek word is poised in
                  a delicate semantic balance between criminal “perpetrator” and masterful
                  “artificer,” and so reflects the guard’s ambivalence as to whether the burial is a
                  miracle of divine artifice or a felony crime. “<foreign>Meister</foreign>,”
                  however, removes this fine ambiguity, and places the emphasis on the sense of
                  “craftsman” or “virtuoso.” “<foreign>Meister</foreign>” is, of course, a common
                  trope in the translator’s lyrics for authors and architects, whether Gods (e.g.,
                     “<foreign>Mein Meister und Herr</foreign>!” apostrophizing Christ in “Der
                  Einzige”) or divinized poets (“<foreign>Wenn nur vollendet sein Bild und fertig
                     ist der Meister</foreign>” in “Friedensfeier”). The translation
                     (“<foreign>Zeichenlos war der Meister</foreign>”), then, appears to be telling
                  its own tragedy within the original tragedy: while telling Sophocles’ story about
                  the Gods who (seem to) intervene in human affairs in order to cover over the
                  “outrageous sight” (ll. 205-6) of death, the line also tells Hölderlin’s story
                  about the <emph>Deus absconditus</emph> of the Hesperians, which may be that “God”
                  who can only presence himself “in the form of death,” in, that is, figures of
                  spirit absented from itself (cf. “<foreign>der Gott, in der Gestalt des Todes,
                     gegenwärtig ist</foreign>” [<emph>FHA </emph>417]). But that absence of signs,
                  which in the Greek burial are the signs of a divine superintendency over mortal
                  affairs becomes in translation a more tragic sort of absence, since those signs
                  (we don’t see) left behind by the hand of Greek deity are no longer—in
                  German—assignable to the “<foreign>Meister</foreign>” (God or vatic poet), who are
                     “<foreign>Zeichenlos</foreign>.”</p>
                  <p> The statement “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” amplifies the theme about
                  the disjunction between Authors and Signs which the translation appears to be
                  telling. But “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” (“There was nothing
                  ceremonious”) is a very odd way to translate the remarkable Greek phrase “The body
                  had been made invisible” [<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%28&amp;la=greek&amp;can=o%283&amp;prior=parh=n">ὁ</ref>

                  one notes the participle “<foreign>gefeiert</foreign>” (eight lines before) for
                     <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas0&amp;prior=palu/nas">κἀφαγιστεύσας</ref>—“having performed proper burial rites.”
                     “<foreign>Feiern</foreign>” is evidently deployed in the sense of “bury” or
                  “commemorate with a funeral,” with the result that the immediate contextual
                  meaning of “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” would be “No funeral or burial
                  took place.” But this negates the burial which very definitely took place in the
                  Greek, and which provides the central dramatic motivation for the entire episode.
                  The words following “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>” further abolish the
                  miraculous Greek burial: “<foreign>Es war kein Grabmal nicht</foreign>”
                  (correctly, for <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tumbh%2Frhs&amp;la=greek&amp;can=tumbh%2Frhs0&amp;prior=h)fa/nisto">τυμβήρης</ref>

                  has happened to the body? Far from being “made invisible,” it has literally got
                  lost in translation.</p>
                  <p> Hölderlin’s lyrical intertext is echoed once again in the phrase “<foreign>Nichts
                     Feierlichs</foreign>.” “<foreign>Feier</foreign>,”
                     “<foreign>feierlich</foreign>,” and “<foreign>feiern</foreign>” recur in the
                  late lyrics, and refer to that celebration and ceremony that poetry is meant to
                  be. A common motif in Hölderlin’s <emph>Spätwerk</emph> is to recount how the Poem
                  of the Moderns is to come into being <emph>as </emph>the commemoration and
                  celebration of Greek letters. Yet it becomes ever more difficult a task to revive
                  Greek text-events (such as Sophoclean tragedy or Pindaric Ode) in the hymn, elegy,
                  or translation, since the modern tropologies and mythologies of “celebration” grow
                  less and less able—in the passage of time, and as both the perdurance and alterity
                  of the precursor’s originations seem more and more inescapable to understand, and
                  so to tell about, their very origins in Greece. The Moderns are to hymn themselves
                  by singing the Ancients, since the poetic celebration of the Ancients is the means
                  by which the moderns repossess and re-appropriate for their own purposes the
                  poetic discourse of the ancients, which they are constrained to use. If they are
                  properly celebrated, the Greeks can speak Hesperian, or speak for them; but if the
                  Greeks are not celebrated, if “no celebration of poetry takes place,” or if “there
                  is nothing that is the object of a celebration” (“<foreign>Nichts
                     Feierlichs</foreign>”), then the Hesperians lose their voice and themselves
                  remain untranslated into recognition. It would appear, then, that the translation
                  employs the mysterious burial of a corpse as a means to announce the death of
                  modern poetry, now no longer capable of celebrating, as the Greek original, the
                  congruence of poetic signs and divine intentions, their secret affiliations, and
                  their capacity to translate bodies, and thus words, into other contexts which
                  preserve their souls and meanings intact. Hölderlin’s guard, who later delivers an
                  obsequy on that spirit (who appears not to have been celebrated), tellingly refers
                  to himself as “<foreign>den Geisterlosen</foreign>” (“the one without Geist,”
                  rendering line 274, “the ill-fated one”).</p>
                  <p> Yet the “case of the missing body” is far from closed. More philological evidence
                  must be taken into consideration. In Hölderlin’s Greek text, the “Juntina” edition

                  “nothing had been hidden from us,” “we recognized the terrible deed of burial.”
                  Yet Hölderlin <emph>may </emph>not have been reading, interpreting, and so saving
                  the text; he might not have been thinking, just here (at line 255) about Greek
                  burials and how best to translate them into modern (non)burials. Rather, he might
                  simply have been making a mistake, supposing (erroneously) that <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h%29fa%2Fnika&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h%29fa%2Fnika0&amp;prior=i%5Ew=">ἠφάνι</ref>

                  lines earlier in the word <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas0&amp;prior=palu/nas">κἀφαγιστεύσας</ref>, translated by the word “<foreign>gefeiert</foreign>”
                     (“<foreign>wies geziemt, gefeiert</foreign>”—“as is fitting, he was buried”).
                  The translator might simply have failed to notice the small difference between a
                     <emph>nu</emph> (ν) and a <emph>gamma </emph>(γ), and thus—while under the
                  influence of the nearby <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ka%29fagisteu%2Fsas0&amp;prior=palu/nas">κἀφαγιστεύσας</ref>—confused <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fagn-i%2Fzw0">ἀφαγνίζω</ref> (to Hölderlin=“celebrate with due burial”) with <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw&amp;la=greek&amp;can=a%29fa%5En-i%2Fzw0">ἀφανίζω</ref> (“make invisible”).</p>
                  <p> Does the “philological” thesis that the translator made a mistake annul the one
                  previously proposed, which we might call the “thematic” or “allegorical”
                  explanation? Does the theory about the simple mistake make otiose the theory that
                  Hölderlin translates Sophocles by thematizing the limitations of modern poetic
                  rituals—limitations which impinge upon the translator’s consciousness when it is
                  faced with “the Absolute,” in the form of the first burial, with its prodigiously
                  efficacious burial ritual and its aura of supernatural protection? The
                  philological account is in fact no less conjectural than the “thematic” one.
                  Previous expositions of Hölderlin’s translation, and recently Seifert’s work on
                  the Pindar translations, have demonstrated that Hölderlin frequently mistranslated
                  on purpose, in order to align the lexical register and rhetorical implications of
                  the translations with those of his own poetic discourse.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Seifert’s <emph>Untersuchungen zu Hölderlins
                        Pindar-Rezeption</emph>.</note> One could even speak of an index of
                  refraction by which the Greek is often “bent” on its passage into the German in
                  order to fit into a lyrical intertext. Although “<foreign>Nichts
                     Feierlichs</foreign>,” for example, might well be a mistake (unconscious
                  misprision), it is impossible to know with any certainty whether Hölderlin knew
                  what he was doing when he wrote these words. Other “mistakes” are more certainly
                  classifiable as genuine mistakes, such as <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fu%3Dlon&amp;la=greek&amp;can=fu%3Dlon0">φῦλον</ref> (“people”) misunderstood for <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fu%2Fllon&amp;la=greek&amp;can=fu%2Fllon0">φύλλον</ref> (“leaves” at <emph>Oedipus Tyrannus </emph>l.19). Yet each
                  deviation is to be evaluated in its own individual circumstances and specific
                  context, and questions about the translator’s conscious intentionality will often
                  be complex or undecidable. </p>
                  <p> The “allegorical” reading of the passage does show one tendency of Hölderlin’s
                  translations: they “translate” by commenting on their relation to the original.
                  Such phrases as “<foreign>Undenklich</foreign>,” “<foreign>Zeichenlos war der
                     Meister</foreign>,” “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>,” “<foreign>der
                     gekommen und</foreign> zerrissen” have a metacritical function that comments
                  upon or evaluates the original either <emph>while </emph>translating it, or
                     <emph>instead </emph>of translating it. That is,
                  “<foreign>Undenklich</foreign>,” for example, translates (albeit somewhat oddly)
                  the guard’s <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐκ</ref>
                     <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dd%27&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dd%270&amp;prior=ou)k">οἶδ’</ref>, but it also evaluates “Sophocles” and “the Greeks,” as well as the
                  relation that the translator’s understanding and linguistic means bear to the
                  original text, its form and content. In this way Hölderlin translates Sophocles in
                  order to speak about himself, or rather to allow his language to say whatever it
                  wants when it is compelled to face up to its own belatedness in the self-conscious
                  confrontation with the language of Sophocles—“<foreign>Das Träumerischnaive.
                     Eigentliche Sprache des Sophokles</foreign>” (<emph>FHA</emph> 413).</p>
                  <p> “<foreign>Nichts Feierlichs</foreign>,” then, might just be a phrase marking the
                  translator’s real bafflement when faced with the Greek phrase <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ou%29k&amp;la=greek&amp;can=ou%29k0&amp;prior=*fu/lac">οὐ</ref>

                     Feierlichs</foreign>” might well be a critical statement about the
                  unreadability of the original: “There is nothing (here) that is the (possible)
                  object of (my) translation/celebration.” At the moment when something goes wrong
                  in the original (for “how could there <emph>not </emph>be a burial-celebration”—so
                  Hölderlin might have thought—“when the text has asserted this very event eight
                  lines before?”), there does the translator bring in his own “originals,” whose
                  emblematic adjective is “Feierlich,” into the text of translation, but he
                  introduces them in the form of a negation: “<emph>Nichts</emph> Feierlichs.” Where
                  the original is unreadable, the translator resorts to profanity. </p>

                  <emph>This essay was originally published in</emph> Studies in
               Romanticism <emph>31.4 (1992): 481-99. Reprinted with kind permission of the Trustees

               </p>
               <p> The study of lyric poetry, especially since the romantics, has tended to fall under
               the aegis of what is broadly known as “the aesthetic tradition.” A substantial
               reality, existing outside the poetic text, is thought to be translated into that
               text, most often by an autonomous lyric consciousness, localizable in the poem, which
               gives voice to a world of objects (emotions, ideas, experience, mind) capable of
               being represented. Although Hegel’s phrase “the sensible appearance of the idea”
                  (<emph>das sinnliche Scheinen der Idee</emph>) pertains to a Greek artistic era of
               the symbol which he believes irretrievably past for the moderns, this notion—lifted
               out of the specific Hegelian historical schematizations—exactly describes lyric in
               its general aesthetic context, in which intellectual and sensate features are brought
               together into synthesized unities. Coleridge’s notion of the symbol as an organic
               fusion of inner and outer, particular and universal, also helps to situate the lyric
               in its aesthetic mode: the lyric, like the symbol upon which it is based in this
               tradition, “always partakes of the reality which it renders intelligible; and while
               it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part in that Unity [. . .].”
                  (30).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an excellent discussion of romanticism
                  in the aesthetic tradition, see Cynthia Chase, “Translating Romanticism: Literary
                  Theory as the Criticism of Aesthetics in the Work of Paul de Man.” </note> This
               tradition is well-known and hegemonic, having shaped significantly both the writing
               of lyric poetry and its criticism since the romantics. </p>
               <p> The subject of the present essay is Walter Benjamin’s early (1914) essay on
               Hölderlin—“Two poems of Friedrich Hölderlin” [“Zwei Gedichte von Friedrich
               Hölderlin”], unpublished at the time yet surely regarded by the young Benjamin to be
               of great significance for future directions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> All
                  references are to “Zwei Gedichte von Friedrich Hölderlin” are from <emph>Walter
                     Benjamin: Gesammelte Schriften</emph>, Vol. 2 (“Aufsätze, Essays, Vorträge”),
                  hereafter abbreviated as <emph>GS</emph>. Translations are my own. References to
                     <emph>Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik</emph> and “Goethes
                  Wahlverwandtschaften” and are in the first volume of <emph>GS.</emph>
                  </note> Explicitly calling itself an “aesthetic commentary,” this essay demonstrates
               its affiliation to the aesthetic tradition with frequent formulations of “unity”
                  [<emph>Einheit</emph>] and “identity,” e.g., “of sensory and intellectual forms”
                  [<emph>die Identität der anschaulichen und geistigen Formen</emph>] involved in
               the achievement of the lyric (<emph>GS </emph>2.1.112). A cursory reading of this
               dense, at times obscure piece might in fact come to dismiss it as youthful,
               uncritical <emph>Schwärmerei</emph>, a youthful exercise in metaphysical poetics or
               aesthetic ideology.</p>
               <p> It can be shown, however, that Benjamin’s essay occurs within <emph>another
               </emph>tradition of the aesthetic: this could be called the tradition of aesthetic
                  <emph>calculation</emph>, as a minor movement and critical mutation within a
               primary tradition of aesthetic <emph>inspiration</emph>. In the latter major
               tradition, an intuitive consciousness, disdainful of rules, creates the poem on the
               basis of its natural capability and privileged sympathy with the “greater life”;
               within “aesthetic calculation,” by contrast, appearances and poetic syntheses are
               produced according to a strict, lawful, and rule-governed poetics, with its calculus
               and quasi-mechanical functions. To the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings,”
               the <emph>furor poeticus</emph>, the “drunken” inspiration of the first aesthetic of
               inspiration, Benjamin consciously opposes a designation he borrows from Hölderlin, in
               order to mark the second aesthetic of calculation, denoted as a prosaic “Sobriety”
                  [<emph>Nüchternheit</emph>]. Rather than originating in a rhapsodic lyric
               consciousness that achieves a marriage of mind and nature, the unified poem in this
               case is produced by something more sober and prosaic: the poetic text as manufactured
               by the always repeatable and reiterable laws governing the genesis of poetic
               figurations. The shift to a poetics of <emph>calculation</emph> operates implicitly
               as a critique of the major tradition based on inspiration, which hides from itself
               its own reliance on technique, poetic mechanisms, and methodologies. Camouflaged
               within such inspired conceptions as poetic “insight,” apocalyptic imagination, and
               visionariness there lurks a lawfulness dominating all aesthetic productions. In fact,
               Benjamin’s conscious renunciation of the predominant discourse of an aesthetics of
               inspiration leads to the severe abstractness of many formulations in the essay, which
               occur in the place of those equally abstract but much more familiar conceptions
               rejected. </p>
               <p> Several years after the Hölderlin essay, in his dissertation—<emph>The Concept of
                  Art Criticism in German Romanticism </emph>(published in 1920)—Benjamin is careful
               to establish the historical pedigree of this anti-inspirational “sobriety” of
               calculation. He associates Novalis, Schlegel, and Hölderlin with the “anti-aesthetic”
               aesthetic of prose, the proper vehicle of romantic reflection, understood, in its
               purest form, as the reflection of reflection. The dissertation links the notion of
               “the holy-sober” [<emph>heilig-nüchtern</emph>] (<emph>GS </emph>1.1.104)—mentioned
               in the earlier Hölderlin essay—to features associated with it in Hölderlin’s “Notes
               to Oedipus” accompanying his 1804 translations of Sophocles: “lawful calculation”
                  [<emph>gesetzlicher Kalkul</emph>] and “mode of procedure”
                  [<emph>Verfahrungsart</emph>] (<emph>FHA </emph>16.249-50);<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Except for references to <emph>Werke und Briefe</emph>,
                  parenthetical citations of Hölderlin will be abbreviated <emph>FHA.</emph>
                  </note> these refer to textual machineries of sense-making
                  [<emph>Empfindungssystem</emph>], narration, and figuration capable of
               “manufacturing” the beautiful, each time the right “laws” are applied. Benjamin’s
               attraction to the “lawful calculation” attending the Hölderlinian notion of
               “sobriety” makes poem-making less a natural and inspired creation than the product of
               specific <emph>functions </emph>and linguistic operations. </p>
               <p> We shall return to Benjamin’s citations of Hölderlin’s “lawful calculation”; for
               now, we note only that the aesthetic sense of “unity” in the essay on Hölderlin is
               based on calculated, even mechanical, textual processes of signification. Indeed,
               Benjamin speaks of a <emph>unity-function </emph>[<emph>Funktionseinheit</emph>] by
               virtue of which the Hölderlinian lyric “Blödigkeit” [Timidness] presents itself as
               unified (<emph>GS </emph>2.1.107). Not the substance-unity discourse of aesthetics of
               inspiration but the sober-mechanical mode in the aesthetic tradition is the issue
               here: “Not <emph>substantially</emph> but <emph>functionally </emph>is the identity
               given as law” (117). A function is whatever “relates” or “binds together” elements
               into a composite, into unity. Speaking, therefore, of the fundamental “law” of
               Hölderlinian lyric as “relatedness” or “relationality” [<emph>Verbundenheit</emph>],
               Benjamin postulates a “unity for the <emph>function </emph>[<emph>Funktion</emph>] of
               the binding and the bound” (122). Unspecified abstractions proliferate in this dense
               essay, but the notion of the poem as a concatenation of “identity-functions”
               intimately bound up within their correspondent “lawfulness”
                  [<emph>Gesetzlichkeit</emph>] is foremost: “The law according to which all
               apparent elements of sense and of ideas shows itself to be the sum-total
                  [<emph>Inbegriffe</emph>] of essential, <emph>in principle infinite</emph>,
               functions—is called the Law of Identity [<emph>das Identitätsgesetz</emph>]” (108). </p>
               <p> One recurrent “function” or law in all of those “identity laws” whose application
               produces unity may be called the “phenomenality” function, to specify the textual act
               by means of which a consciousness (or poetic subjectivity) makes its presence felt in
               the poem; a number of Benjamin’s formulations have to do with expositions of that
               specific identity-function which translates abstractions (such as the poet, human
               emotions, gods) into forms and formal <emph>expressions </emph>within the poetic
               text: the function by which, e.g., “the poet steps into life [within the poem]”
               (116), or the function by which, e.g., “the innate spiritual temporal order of
                  <emph>joy </emph>[<emph>Freude</emph>] is rendered sensible, audible” (117); or
               the identity function which makes “gods into highly particular and determinate
               figures [<emph>Gestalten</emph>]” (118). Phenomenalization is that process of
               signification which institutes the text <emph>as </emph>an expression. Even “time”
               turns out to be a function in this essay: <emph>die Funktion der Zeit</emph>. The
               1914 essay is remarkable in the way it argues for—rather than merely takes for
               granted—phenomenalization and lyric expression as the end result of quite specific
               and complex acts (calculations, identity-functions) of textual signification.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “The principle of intelligibility in lyric poetry,”
                  writes a well-known critic influenced by Benjamin, “depends on the
                  phenomenalization of the poetic voice” (de Man 55). </note>
               </p>
               <p> However important the “phenomenality-function” is, it is still but <emph>one</emph>
               of a manifold of functions which together make up the rhetorical and syntactical
               identities of the poem: “But the insight in the function presupposes the multiplicity
               of relational-possibilities [<emph>Verbindungsmöglichkeiten</emph>]” (106)—so
               presupposing, also, a multiplicity of functions that comprise textual relations, many
               of which, it is suggested, cannot (yet) be identified. With the term
               “relational-possibilities” and its affiliations in the “Zwei Gedichte” essay, we find
               embryonically the famous distinction, in the 1921 essay on “The Task of the
               Translator,” between the “meaning” of a text [<emph>das Gemeinte</emph>] and “the way
               in which meaning is produced” [<emph>die Art des Meinens</emph>]. This distinction
               implies a new set of <emph>relations</emph>: a signifying process has to be
                  <emph>related to </emph>a signification, a meaning now <emph>bears a relation to
               </emph>certain devices of meaning which may or may not be able to produce it. In
               other words, contained in the overall sense of “relational possibilities” is a
               forceful point of entry for critical reading, one based on the possible
               non-convergence of textual significations, on the one hand, with those performative
               “functions” which actualize them (or fail to). A dense theoretical tract of
               Hölderlin’s (available in the 1913 Hellingrath edition Benjamin admired, and entitled
               “Werden im Vergehen”) emphasizes “relationality” [<emph>Beziehungsart; die
                  Möglichkeit aller Beziehung</emph>] as the act of relating both themes and forms;
               one theme to another; forms to each other; meanings to linguistic forms; acts to
               interpretations; modes of signifying to significations. This act of relating becomes
               especially needful when relations usually conserved by the aesthetic conventions
               (governing meaning and its devices) have been disrupted by what Hölderlin calls a
               “genuinely tragic language.” “Werden im Vergehen” theorizes about an accelerated
               performance of textual dissolution in which acts of signifying always fail and need
               to be reenacted (in order to fail again). This continual, accelerated failure to
               “relate” leads to the constant need to relate, thereby constituting the sense of
               “relationality,” a dynamic romantic model for what post-Saussurean criticism later
               calls “inscription” or “materiality.” </p>
               <p> It is this multiplicity of functions that constitutes Benjamin’s special
                  <emph>topos</emph> of “the <emph>Middle</emph>” [<emph>die Mitte</emph>] of the
               poem—which, as “the untouchable middle of all relation” (125), is not the actual
               stanzaic mid-point of the poem but a conceptual repository for the irreducibly
               unrecognizable modalities of the signifying process, and for the ultimately
               undiscoverable relations linking already enacted meanings to their productive
               “functions.” The Benjamin <emph>topos </emph>of “the Middle” is the means taken to
               mark out the way in which both the poem and the tradition informing it become
               aporetic for criticism—no longer simply readable and understandable, but more of a
               task—when the reading turns on the issue of calculation rather than inspiration and
               its associated concepts.</p>
               <p> At this point, we must backtrack to the Hölderlinian determination of “lawful
               calculation” [<emph>gesetzlicher Kalkul</emph>] or “calculable law”
                  [<emph>kalkulables Gesetz</emph>] mentioned earlier; calculability always
               engenders a concomitant incalculability. Poetics produces aesthetics, but the latter
               owes its potency to its ultimate unreadability. The sense of poetic “law” (and sober
               calculation) in the Hölderlin text brings before critical reading a genuine alterity
               (something which cannot be calculated), which appears to defy all attempts to reflect
               it back into discursivity. It is the inaccessibility of this otherness to
               conceptuality in Hölderlin’s text—a difference which, again, asserts itself in
               Hölderlin’s sense of poetics—which Benjamin translates as the “untouchable middle” of
               aesthetic unity.</p>
               <p> To see how what we may call the “otherness of lawfulness” informs Benjamin’s sense
               of inaccessible immanence, we cite Hölderlin: in the “Notes to Oedipus” (1804), the
               artwork is the place where “the living sense, which cannot be calculated, is brought
               into relation with the calculable law” (<emph>FHA </emph>16.250). When “the living
               sense,” that which, by itself, “cannot be calculated” [<emph>nicht berechnet werden
                  kann</emph>]—and which here does not itself get calculated—is instead
                  <emph>brought into relation </emph>[<emph>in Beziehung gebracht</emph>] with what
                  <emph>can </emph>be calculated (or, say, determined, articulated), we have a
               liminal situation with two conceivable sides, an inside or near side within
               calculation (determination) and a far side determined only as the hollow “outside” to
               the contours of formation. The law may be reflected from within the lawful formation,
               with the reflection here both made possible and determined by the law; but the “far”
               side—that part of the living sense which comes into contact with the near,
               determinable (lawful) side—cannot be calculated from its own side, which lies outside
               of the law and the calculable. One such moment in this (unlawful) alterity could be,
               for example, the incalculable sense of repetition itself, which asserts itself in the
               always repeatable law. The number of divergent expositions of the important concept
               of repetition (Freudian, Kierkegaardian, Nietzschean, Hegelian, and so on) could
               itself serve as an illustration of its incalculability. In Hölderlin’s case, the
               “coming into contact with form” can only be reflected from the side of formation,
               which finds itself occurring always only over against the unconditioned. His
               formulation of “lawful calculation” in fact describes a function or process of
               signification. With such functions, such identifications of uniformity, we may
               believe that we have comprehended the text and its modes of signifying; and we have
               done so, to some extent. Yet such comprehension only occasions a new
               indeterminateness as its condition of possibility. </p>
               <p> This may be further clarified by noting that, in the above passage from Hölderlin,
               the sense of “rhythm” (and with it the prosodic term, “caesura,” to be treated below)
               closely attends the idea of “lawful calculation.” “Rhythm,” as a pure rhythmicity
               involved in the merely formal “rhythmical succession of representations,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     <emph>FHA</emph> 16.250: “<foreign>in der rhythmischen Aufeinanderfolge der
                     Vorstellungen</foreign>”; “[. . .] <foreign>wird die Aufeinanderfolge des
                     Kalkuls, und der Rhythmus geteilt</foreign>”; “<foreign>Ist nun der Rhythmus
                     der Vorstellungen so beschaffen daß</foreign>.” </note> is the reduction of the
               aesthetic (as calculation) to pure repetition, the aesthetic as a repetition
               compulsion. The repeatability of the law according to regular recurrence creates the
               conditions for the aesthetic; “rhythm,” the abstract design of repetition, is the
               aesthetic in the mode of pure relationality. Yet the aesthetic (which in the literary
               context, at least, qualifies as the general condition for cognition) cannot itself be
               comprehended as mere regular recurrence; what is cognized (the rhythm, the regular
               return of the aesthetic) is irremediably estranged from those conditions (rhythmical
               functions) which produce it. “Rhythm” would thus also denote the failure to master
               the aesthetic, to fathom it critically.</p>
               <p> This problematic informs Benjamin’s reading of Hölderlin (and of lyric; and later,
               it turns out, of Greek tragedy). As he explains, the identification of relations and
               their functions lies beyond the pale of critical scrutiny: at the “middle” of the
               poem “the sum-total of all functions” (<emph>GS </emph>2.1.124) is indeed to be
               located, but in relations of identity so deeply embedded, so inaccessible in their
               totality, that such identification can only exist in the mode of a “task”
                  [<emph>Aufgabe</emph>] to be undertaken again and again, but destined to fail. The
               unavoidable incompleteness of reading the lyric engenders the construct of “the
               poematized” [<emph>das Gedichtete</emph>], a sort of secondary “lyric of criticism”
               or metapoem abstracted from the actual poem [<emph>das Gedicht</emph>], imposed as a
               task, and existing to make those relation-functions of the poem available to
               criticism in a more visible and determinate form: “The principle of the poematized
               generally is the sole <emph>sovereignty of relation</emph>” [<emph>Alleinherrschaft
                  der Beziehung</emph>] (124).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Two helpful
                  discussions of Benjamin’s Hölderlin essay, to which my own exposition is indebted,
                  may be cited here. Rainer Nägele, “Benjamin’s Ground,” and David Wellbery,
                  “Benjamin’s Theory of the Lyric.” </note> This “poematized,” Benjamin makes clear,
               does not exist in the mode of a universal and metaphysical category applicable to
               other poetic texts, but is <emph>sui generis</emph>, a singular project(ion) of its
               actualized poetic text.</p>
               <p>Associated with this “untouchable middle of all relation” [<emph>die unberührbare
                  Mitte aller Beziehung</emph>] are two related designations: the poet, and
               death—or, we may say, the dead poet, that poet who reveals himself in the metapoem as
               death, the frozen intersection of relata taken out of flux and fixed in the poem:
               “unified in death [<emph>im Tode</emph>] [. . .] are all <emph>known
               </emph>relations” (125, my emphasis). “Death” as immanence has to do with “Form in
               its <emph>deepest </emph>binding” [<emph>Gestalt in ihrer tiefsten Bindung</emph>]
               (110). In the book on German tragic drama (which Benjamin began working on only a few
               years after the Hölderlin essay), the sense of inaccessible immanence is prominent in
               the delineation of the inarticulate but knowingly superior hero of Greek tragedy; in
               the Hölderlin essay, as later, it has to do with muteness, but in the present case
               with a certain inarticulateness of criticism—as regards the inscrutability and
               unnameability of unity-functions. In their untouchable place “within,” “death” and
               “the poet” look like displaced names for the sum-total of unnamed functions “at the
               middle.” The “death” or dead-spot there evokes the sense of a densely clustered
               network of congealed relations, so recalling the close-packed “thickness” of language
               etymologically suggested in the word <emph>Dichtung</emph>. Within general
               (unwritten) “life” at large, death may be the great Dissolver of relation-functions
               and relationality, but here it is what reifies relations on the flat surfaces of
               writing, from within an immanence made all the more inscrutable by being manifested
               only in the externality of the epitaphic, textual surface [<emph>Mitte und
                  Erstreckung</emph>] (116). “Death” as the great Congealer of (textual) relations
               is <emph>Versachlichung</emph> (or “materialization”—the act of becoming material,
               objective inscription), a poetic function which Benjamin, following Hölderlin,
               associated with a certain fiction: the “death” of the gods. </p>
               <p> Such a death, a dying into inscription, is for Benjamin (as for Hölderlin) a
               specifically <emph>temporal </emph>action determined as a god-death: an internal
               concentration of formative energy or “temporal/timely Plastic” [<emph>zeitliche
                  Plastik</emph>] erupts from the pressure of immanence to congeal into the
               inscribed names and attributes of divinity. The inscription of the divine name
               introduces a temporality into what is written, thematized as “death.” The temporality
               of inscription, we should note, occurs in a particularly romantic and modern critical
               revisitation of ancient “Greece,” a literary <emph>topos </emph>which signifies for a
               nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernity the historico-philosophical possibility
               that the sacred word could render itself entirely present within phenomenality, i.e.,
               could render itself aesthetic. But this coherence of the oracular and the visible
               without loss of sense can only appear to us “Hesperians” (moderns) now as a
               peculiarly Greek “aesthetic mistake” [<emph>Kunstfehler</emph>], to use Hölderlin’s
                  term.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This occurs in a letter to Friedrich
                  Wilmans, who published Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations. In this letter of
                  September 1803, Hölderlin justifies his translation practice as a means to open
                  the text up to fresh meaning by declassicizing the Greek formulation (through an
                  emphasis on the eccentric and “oriental”) and by “correcting” the Greek “aesthetic
                  mistake” [“[. . .] <foreign>un ihren kunstfehler</foreign> [. . .]
                     <foreign>verbessere</foreign>”]. See <emph>Hölderlin: Werke und Briefe
                  </emph>2.947.</note> In its pretense to have utterly transcended the temporal in
               becoming a flower of poetic artifice, the god’s name introduces “death” into the text
               as a radical forgetting of temporality, which yet abides as an unconditioned temporal
               excess, something incalculable, a “plasticity” still left over after the inscription
               of the beautiful image—which itself relies on plastic time as its own condition of
               possibility. In Benjamin’s spatial metaphorics, “depth” and “immanence” are the sites
               of this death; they are the markers of this aesthetic “mistake,” this forgetting of
               an inconceivable, but always sovereign, excess. </p>
               <p> Plastic time thus rips something immanent from within the poetic middle in its
               depth, and conjugates this onto the graphemic, physiognomic surface of the text.
               Temporal “plasticity” involves the capability to transform and invert the immanent
               into its superficial forms, according to the “function of time” [<emph>Funktion der
                  Zeit</emph>], a function which determines the tightness or looseness of relata in
               the textual web, the <emph>Dichtung </emph>(118). The deeper, more distant the
               particular “relation of identity” informing the poem is to be located “at the
               middle,” so the more “untouchable,” which is to say, “timely” and plastic it will be.
               The gods are “produced,” says Benjamin, when they “fall prey to their own forces of
               formation,” i.e., when the force of the identity-function governing them is so
               intense (concentrated, forceful, binding) that it turns into a “temporal-internal
               seizure” (121), turning the internal inside out to display itself within the
               unifications of deadened, phenomenalized forms. As often in the hyperbolically
               self-conscious texts of Hölderlin, a beautiful deadness of expression, a literary
               cliché on the mere poetic surface, evokes the inexpressible as that expression’s
               insinuation of its own impending erasure.</p>
               <p> It is probable that this motif of “materialization,” as well as the closely related
               notion of “immanence,” is derived directly from the “Notes”
               [<emph>Anmerkungen</emph>] to Hölderlin’s translations of <emph>Antigone </emph>and
                  <emph>Oedipus Tyrannus</emph>. Although he did make use of Böhm’s 1905 edition
               (which excludes the “Notes”) for the texts of the two poems discussed in the essay
               (“Dichtermut” and “Blödigkeit”), the “Notes” would doubtless have been available to
               Benjamin in the Hölderlin edition he preferred—the 1913 Norbert von Hellingrath
                  edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See <emph>GS </emph>2.3.921-22.</note>

               <p> Exposition of the Hölderlinian contexts must here be omitted in order to focus on
               Benjamin’s transformations and revisions. We note, first, the Benjamin reads
               Hölderlin’s poem “Blödigkeit” (or rather its “poematized” version at issue in a
               critical reading) as an allegory for the “deep” immanence of its own relations, in an
               application of principles gleaned from the “Notes” to <emph>Antigone </emph>and to
                  <emph>Oedipus</emph>. For Benjamin, the Hölderlin text is the self-reading (or
               metacommentary) of the inaccessibility to analysis of its unity-functions; the
               failure of penetration in this self-reading (undertaken in the “metapoem”) becomes
               the very condition of possibility for the phenomenal unity the poem is able to
               achieve. The possibility of “materialization” [<emph>Versachlichung</emph>], as of
               unity itself, arises from the <emph>density </emph>of relations at “the middle”—a
               density too “thick” (the “<foreign>dicht</foreign>” of “<foreign>Dichtung</foreign>”)
               in the interrelations of its functions to be differentiated in criticism. Aesthetic
               unity depends here, as elsewhere, upon the impossibility of a complete critical
               disarticulation. This density is associated with a certain “violence” of
               tragico-mythic relata (see set of citations under #3 above), the textual symptom of
               which is the displayed “unity” of the lyric. Immanence, the poetic middle, is a
               function of the violence (forcefulness, density, “thickness”) of those identity
               relations it harbors; without the closeness and tightness, i.e., violence, of
               relations, there would be no (“untouchable”) immanence. We have already linked such
               violence to the Hölderlinian notion of “rhythm” as the violent regularity (a Greek
                  <emph>ananke</emph>) with which the aesthetic returns, as the mostly passive
               reenactment of a relation-function. We should also note that this violent force
               governing relations “at the middle” may be intimated either by self-dissolving
               signifiers on the textual surface (see last Benjamin citation under #3 above) or by
               fixed signifiers having the sense of being prematurely congealed, such as the
               materialization of the dead “god” (in citations under #2 above). The effect is the
               same: an innate temporal plasticity, concentrated into a violent energy, either
               “gives up” representing itself or “gives in” to a representation which fails it. </p>
               <p> Further, Benjamin introduces two designations, linked to the notion of “temporal
               plastic” and “violent relations at the middle,” and discussed through the two
               Hölderlin lyrics featured in the essay: a merely “mythological,” earlier draft
               “Dichtermut” yields to a “mythic,” revised draft “Blödigkeit.” Whereas the elements
               in the first (“mythological”) text are “loose,” having no “energetic” relation to a
               submerged and violent plasticity at the middle, the elements of the “mythic” poem
               exist in dense and violent relation to their immanence “at the middle.” In other
               words, there is no immanence (and thus submerged violence) in the “mythological”
               poem, characterized by the “lack of relation” [<emph>Beziehungslosigkeit</emph>]
               among its elements and by its “isolation of form” [<emph>Vereinzelung der
                  Gestalt</emph>] (<emph>GS </emph>2.1.111); its constituents therefore unable to
               “make sense,” the poem is made up of mere citations of prior (possibly once “mythic”)
               texts. As evidence, Benjamin refers to conventional phrases (in “Dichtermut”) merely
               recycled from a “mythological” diction of (neo)classical poetry at hand: e.g.,
                  “<emph>der Sonnengott</emph>” [the Sungod/Apollo] (120) and “<emph>die
                  Parze</emph>” [Destiny]. The “dead” citationality of, for example, the
               (neo)classical “<emph>der Sonnengott</emph>” (earlier draft), isolated and
               unmeaningful because not proceeding from a nexus of functions embedded in the poem,
               is forcefully revised into the “romantic” “<emph>des Himmels Gott</emph>” [God of
               Heaven] of the later draft, which exhibits (in German, not in translation) the
               peculiar tension of the Hölderlinian periphrasis. On Benjamin’s reading, “<emph>des
                  Himmels Gott</emph>” would issue from a “density” and active energy of relational
               identites, thus illustrating the “intensity of relation” [<emph>Instensität der
                  Verbundheit</emph>] of a “mythic” immanence (108). </p>
               <p> This is to say that signification depends entirely upon the processes of an
               aesthetic context involving “mythically-bounded elements” (see citations under #3)
               rather than upon the mere citation of elements having an extra-textual reference:
               “The mythological demonstrates itself as <emph>Mythos </emph>only in the measure of
               its <emph>boundedness </emph>[<emph>Verbundenheit</emph>]” (109). The “classical” and
               “mythological” mode of the earlier draft thus fails to <emph>be aesthetic</emph>,
               thereby failing to be a lyric, be an original, with corresponding loss of immanence.
               To put this another way: the merely “mythological” is the stuff of aesthetic
                  <emph>ideology</emph>, whose unity-functions and modes of phenomenalization will
               be more transparent for a criticism that will be able to carry out its tasks more
               easily on mythological materials than on mythic. But if the signification functions
               of a text prove to be more transparent and readable, they will also be less forceful,
               less aesthetically efficacious, less innately unified. The process of revision in
               going from the earlier to the later draft of the poem may trace out the passage from
               classical to romantic, which (following Hölderlin’s lead in this respect) is a
               passage into immanence. But the aesthetic functions of the immanent text of romance
               will prove to be unreadable, beyond the reach of criticism; the latter will be unable
               to distinguish individual relata in the dense plastic clusters “within,” caught up as
               they will be in a text governed, says Benjamin, by the “impenetrability of relations”
                  [<emph>die Undurchdringlichkeit der Beziehungen</emph>] (111). Once we are in the
               (romantic) revision, it becomes “difficult,” says Benjamin, “to acquire a possible
               access into this fully unified and singular world.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                  The revised poem is called “<emph>die anschaulich-geistige Ordnung, der neue
                     Kosmos des Dichters. Schwer ist es, einen möglichen Zugang zu dieser völlig
                     einheitlichen und einzigen Welt zu gewinnen</emph>” (111). </note> This is to
               say that the more criticism succeeds (in unraveling the unity-functions of a text),
               the less the successful critical performance is likely to mean anything. Still, the
               mythological appears to be the appropriate vehicle of discursive truth, unlike “the
               mythical,” which is indifferent to it.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Winfried
                  Menninghaus’s <emph>Schwellenkunde: Walter Benjamins Passage der Mythos</emph>,

               <p>
                  <emph/>Benjamin asserts, for example, that the earlier draft of Hölderlin’s
               lyric achieves no real relation to “death,” since “<emph>life </emph>was still the
               precondition for death” (123); that is, “death” here comes from an extra-textual life
               and so is “substantial” rather than textually immanent—unlike that “death” of the
               later draft, determined as “Form in its deepest binding” (110). Here the classical
               citation from the first draft recalls that “other” aesthetic tradition we began with,
               in which lyric unity is conceived as imported into the text from outside it, as
               something substantial and merely referential. Lacking the immanence of what in the
               Hölderlin-Benjamin context emerges as the genuine artwork associated with a “mythic”
               and “romantic” relationality, the classical, Greek and “mythological” production
               would be aligned with “the weakest achievements in art,” which, as Benjamin reminds
               us early in his essay, fail because they “relate <emph>immediately </emph>to life,”
               as opposed to “the strongest” works, connected with “a sphere related to the
               mythical” (107). By contrast, the later draft (“Blödigkeit”) does realize “death” as
               this immanent, binding relation, and to such a degree that “a <emph>new</emph>
               meaning of death” is to emerge from it, although this “new” meaning may only be
               proleptic, paradoxically to be realized when <emph>this </emph>lyric in its
               turn—“with the turn of time” (citing the poem’s <emph>zur Wende der
               Zeit</emph>)—becomes mythological, i.e., becomes canonical and starts being quoted
               and translated. Still, as it presently exists in the poem, such a “death” is
               “inconceivable to us on a clearer basis” (126).</p>
               <p> As Benjamin explains it (125), the central “characteristic” of Hölderlinian
               “sobriety” [<emph>Nüchternheit</emph>] is best referred to only at the end of his
               essay, where it can finally emerge in its determinateness. There, he asks where the
               Hölderlin <emph>topos</emph> of the “holy-sober” is “still that of Greece.” As his
               subsequent remarks make clear, this is the same as asking if the “holy-sober” belongs
               to the lyric sublimity of that other aesthetic tradition derived from “inspiration,”
               where the artwork is conceived as the direct <emph>life expression</emph> of a people
               and of an individual [the poet]. Though it may be “composed in Greek forms,” the
               “holy-sober”—so runs the answer—is emphatically not Greek, which is to say, not
               related to the inspired “Ecstasy”—“the <emph>mania</emph> of Plato”—of the major
               aesthetic tradition at all, but rather to that “mechanical reason” which “soberly
                  [<emph>nüchtern</emph>] constitutes the work” (<emph>GS</emph> 1.1.106). If “life”
               and, for example, that “new death” discussed in the last paragraph are productions of
               the “Holy-Sober” mode, they would spring (like any produce of sobriety) from
                  <quote>the <emph>inner </emph>Sureness [<emph>Sicherheit</emph>] in which they
                  [sober words] stand in his [Hölderlin’s] own spiritual life, in which now Sobriety
                  is allowed, required—because it is, in itself, holy, <emph>beyond all elevation in
                     the sublime</emph> [<emph>jensits aller Erhebung im Erhabnen</emph>]. (125)
               </quote> To surpass the sublimity of the sublime is to become something wholly
               prosaic, at once ultra- and anti-sublime, in an inversion that Benjamin precisely
               specifies as an “untouchable sober-prosaic figure” [<emph>unantastbaren nüchternen
                  prosaischen Gestalt</emph>] and that he links to a poetological term called a
               “Caesura” (<emph>GS</emph> 1.1.106). This latter notion, again borrowed from
               Hölderlin, is a means to thematize the real resistance of such “untouchability” to
               critical appropriation. “Caesura” [<emph>Zäsur</emph>] does not occur in the
               discussion of Hölderlinian “holy-sober” in the dissertation
               (<emph>Kunstkritik</emph>) several years later, and for good reason: there the sober
               law, the materials it shapes—and its associated “untouchability”—are always to be
               re-assimilated into the spheres of discursive reflection by the “positive”
               dialectical appropriations of the romantic idea. Although the operation of the law
               “infinitizes” the task of criticism, in the <emph>Kunstkritik</emph> the latter will
               still be an endless success story of speculative self-meta-reflection, for the very
               reason that it finds itself challenged into furious activity by the sober-prosaic.
               Yet, in the Hölderlin essay Benjamin shows himself rather less willing to let this
               untouchability—and the potential difference it generates as unreadable immanence—be
               ultimately circumscribed entirely within the endlessly assimilative process of the
               romantic absolute, within, that is, the “absolutizing, universalizing classification
               of the individual moment [. . .] that is romanticization” (<emph>GS</emph> 1.1.67).
               But that immanence emerging in the “Two Poems” essay is instead allowed to exist more
               (which is not to say, entirely) in the mode of its genuine liminality and potential
               heterogeneity, as we have explicated this with respect to the Hölderlinian “lawful
               calculation.” Both Hölderlin and Benjamin expressly link the poetic law to what they
               call a <emph>Caesura</emph>; in a sense to be unfolded below, the latter indicates
               both a powerful aesthetic function <emph>and </emph>a threshold of criticism.</p>
               <p> Quoting the last stanza of “Blödigkeit”—a stanza which very possibly motivated (in
               conjunction with motifs from the “Notes” to Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations) his
               entire reading of this lyric as a metacommentary on its own functions and on their
               latency as the condition of lyric unity—Benjamin mentions the caesura in the context
               of a poetic unity that is only achievable when the poet, understood as the principle
               of form, operates from within an immanence whose untouchability translates into the
                  <emph>distance</emph> [<emph>Abstand</emph>] of the poet from its materialized
               unities on its surface: <quote>Wie sehr er [the poet] die unberührbare Mitte aller
                  Beziehung bedeutet, enthalten die beiden letzten Verse am mächtigsten [. . .] “und

                     ihre Einheit. </emph>(<emph>GS </emph>2.1.125) <lb/>
                     <lb/>[How much he signifies
                  the untouchable middle of all relation is embodied most powerfully in the last two
                  verses [. . .] “and (we poets) bring one of the heavenly ones. And ourselves we
                  bring capable hands.” So the poet is no longer seen as form, but only still as
                  principle of form, the Delimiter, the one still carrying even his own body. He
                  brings his hands—and the heavenly ones. <emph>The striking caesura of this place
                     produces the distance, which the poet, as their unity, should have in the
                     presence of all form and the world</emph>.] (my translation) </quote> The
               “striking caesura” asserts itself through the curious literalization of the “hands”
               that the poet is said to “bring.” In other contexts this metonymy could appear quite
               natural: one “brings” “capable hands” as one may “bring”: “a strong back,” “a clear
               head,” “energy and enthusiasm.” The hands could elsewhere be naturalized as figures
               for the physical implements of the writer’s craft; but here the contrast with that
               “One of the gods” who is also brought contributes to an estrangement called the
               caesura. The latter is an interruption or hesitation of sense, the effect of a
               juxtaposition which strikes the reader as a faulty parallelism: “Hands—Gods.” One
               normally brings one’s hands, moreover, without needing to remember to bring them, or
               to remark that they have been brought, for they are attached to the (physical and
               lyrical) body as a natural and substantial extension. Only if hands were the
               mechanized, prosthetic devices of the amputee would they need to be remembered and
               “brought.” But this is the sense of Hölderlin’s poet of functions, a miracle of rare
               device, who—as Composer-of-functions and Composed-of-functions, as pure prosthesis, a
               pure functionality—having no attachments, can take none for granted, and must
               literally remember to bring himself into the poem [<emph>tritt nur/ Baar in’s
                  Leben</emph>, from the first stanza (116)]. “Don’t forget to carry your body into
               it, either!” comes through in Benjamin’s uncompromising reading of the caesura. In
               the prosaic repetition of “bring,” we find an emergent sense of the “holy-sober”
               stylization that Benjamin admires in Hölderlin but which can hardly be called
               “natural” or even “lyrical” in their usual senses. The poet brings the “holy One” in
               a poetic invocation of the sacred; but this “beautiful” lyric convention explicitly
               parallels something “else” that is brought, which would be macabre if it were more of
               an actual bodily part (as “this living hand” of the late Keatsian poem is) and less a
               functional or prosaic tool (of writing, composition), as it is here: the “sober,”
               mechanical and mundane “hands.” The juxtaposition of the theophanic and the
               technological (capable hands, which Hölderlin elsewhere calls the
                  <emph>mechane</emph>) constitutes the caesura, which here strikes the reader as
               the Hölderlin-Benjamin project to realize, always only imperfectly, the complete
               separateness and distantiation that the perfectly “sober” unity of lyric demands.</p>
               <p> For Benjamin, reading the caesura appears to crystallize reading Hölderlin, reading
               romanticism and the lyric, and no doubt critical reading in general. Indeed, it is
               the “unreachable goal of all German artistic praxis” not only to
               <emph>present</emph>, but to <emph>comprehend</emph> the caesura which inhabits the
               poetic discourses of “occidental junoesque sobriety” (<emph>GS </emph>1.1.182). This
               formulation appears in an essay (published in 1925) on Goethe’s “Elective
               Affinities,” which reiterates Hölderlin’s own determination of the caesura in his
               “Notes to Oedipus”: “The tragic transport [<emph>Transport</emph>] is in actuality
               empty, and the most unbound” (<emph>GS </emph>1.1.182). How does one best appreciate,
               critically comprehend, something that is “empty” [<emph>leer</emph>]? We recall for
               the moment the verse, cited by Benjamin (see preceding paragraph), which he finds
               thematic of the caesura: “He brings his hands—and the heavenly ones.” In this
               instance the disparity of those themes just before and just after the gap to be
               read—the figurations beginning and ending the “transport” across the empty
               passage—appears to offer a critical purchase on the caesura: “hands” are in stark
               disjunction with “the heavenly ones.” Is a caesura easier to read when its thematic
               frames are dissociated as here? But given the potent aesthetic that surges up through
               these very transports across an indeterminate (“unbounded”) and empty space, the
               critical articulation of this space to be read all too easily vanishes into it,
               swallowed up within the same aesthetic it would distinguish. “<emph>Er bringt seine
                  Hände</emph>—<emph>und die Himmlischen</emph>.” This paratactic figuration
               promises criticism a deep incision into the untouchable aesthetic: it plays out
               analogically the same distantiation [<emph>Abstand</emph>] at issue in the idea of
               the holy-sober, as the radical disjunction between signification and the lawful
               functions that produce it. Adorno fell for this tactic of the paratactic as a mode of
               reading Hölderlin: in Adorno’s famous reading, Hölderlin’s own “epic” style—where
               words are “piled on,” merely added on in endless supplements without any
               (“hypotactic”) subordination to an overarching motif—promises an insight into the
               Hölderlin text, with the manifold interruptions in the interpretative process that
               its own “striking caesuras” pose for readers.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                  Adorno’s “Parataxis: Zur späten Lyrik Hölderlins.”</note> Yet reading the caesura
               through such thematic disjunctions qualifies as the very problem of reading lyric,
               reading romanticism. In the preface to <emph>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</emph>, Paul
               de Man suggests that the criticism of romanticism habitually “stumbles” over those
               very “breaks and interruptions that readings disclose,” in the sense that such
               readings end up smuggling back in “the aesthetic unity of manner and substance that
               may well be what is in question in the historical study of romanticism” (ix). Our
               failure to read the romantics has to do with our failure to achieve the failure of
               aesthetic recuperation. De Man’s very example of this failure (to fail) is Adorno’s
               famous paratactic reading of Hölderlin, which recuperates the fragment (a modality of
               the caesura) under the aesthetic aegis of parataxis.</p>
               <p> Even though Benjamin, too, may gravitate towards something like a paratactic reading
               of Hölderlin in his notion of the “extensionality” [<emph>Erstreckung</emph>] of the
               text (its ability to unfold indefinitely “in a row of chains,” in a certain way, in
               accordance with a governing “fate”), he proves to be a wary reader, suspicious of the
               possible collusion of his critical strategies with the deeply embedded aesthetic
               unity of the textual object to be criticized (<emph>GS </emph>2.1.116). Indeed, the
               entire Hölderlin essay is constructed as a reminder of this possibility of collusion
               and the difficulty of achieving critical impasse. What in the Hölderlin essay is the
               unreadability (“untouchability,” “impenetrability”) of the “mythic” and original
               lyric emerges ten years later in the Goethe essay as an “inexpressible violence”
                  [<emph>ausdrucklose Gewalt</emph>] which any successful or “sober” art-expression
               harbors as its internal condition of possibility (<emph>GS </emph>1.1.182). As
               Benjamin specifies it, the inexpressibility of this violent force arises from both
               the necessity of analyzing the caesura of the artwork (as the critical access to its
               aesthetic unity), on the one hand, and from the impossibility of doing so, on the
               other, due to the way in which criticism itself, the metapoem of the poem, is (like
               the poem) “caesura’d,” always drawn into its aesthetic rhythms and unity functions.
               Thus, on the one hand, criticism is <emph>unable </emph>to differentiate “appearance
               from essence in the artwork” (ibid.); the attempt to read the radical otherness of
               the caesura is always perceived by a self-aware critique to be a misreading of
               sameness. “The Inexpressible is the critical force, which is, on the other hand,
                  <emph>unable to differentiate </emph>appearance from essence [<emph>Schein vom
                  Wesen</emph>] within art [. . .]” (<emph>GS </emph>1.1.181). On the other hand,
               this inability so far looks like the critical solipsism brought on by the iron
               machineries of dialectic recuperation, where differences are overlooked, transformed
               and forgotten through their assimilation back into those very aesthetico-critical
               unities which are being interrogated (and which would be exploded if the differences
               were allowed to exist outside of the unifying frameworks of criticism).
                  <emph>Yet</emph>, in this case, the inability, appearing as it does <emph>in
                  caesura</emph>, does not lead back into the circle of reflection, but rather
                  <emph>remains</emph> exactly where it is—at the limit of the circle: “[. . .] the
               critical force that, on the one hand, is unable to differentiate appearance from
               essence within art, but <emph>on the other hand</emph> keeps them from being
               confounded” [my emphasis]. This caesura-criticism would thus refuse that assimilation
               back into “romantic” reflection, without, however, relinquishing its status as
               criticism, for it maintains a critical difference in the face of its impossibility,
               or, rather, it refuses to act on its inability to differentiate, refuses to give up
               the impossible task of criticism. </p>

                  <emph>This essay is an excerpt from a long unpublished
                  manuscript.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Ancient tragedy cuts deeply into the multidisciplinary span of concerns that make up
               critical theory in our time. Even without us seeming to foist our critical frameworks
               upon it indiscriminately, classical Athenian tragedy, on its own terms, fully engages
               the tensions that have defined nineteenth and twentieth-century critical
               traditions—traditions which could be said, broadly, to turn on the disjunction
               between the arbitrariness of signs, on the one hand, and the deep embeddedness of
               meanings in their historical traditions, on the other. When it comes to evaluating
               the wary modern translation of a Greek tragedy, virtually every major critical
               movement of the last two centuries may be brought into play. Entire traditions (such
               as “the humanities”) depend upon translations: by bringing disparate languages and
               national literatures into relations of continuity, such traditions forge their
               changing identities through the construction of constantly reinvented and
               retranslated pasts. Yet cultural institutions, like human consciousness, are highly
               selective, incorporating into themselves only what ensures the continuities of their
               own discourses. The same principle of selection operates at the micro-levels of
               individual translations. It is easy to underestimate what must go unnoticed if that
               text called “translation” is to do its work: concealments such as the myriad
               linguistic differences between target and source languages, their disparate idioms,
               and their heteromorphous grammatical modes and lexical features.</p>
               <p>In 1804 Friedrich Holderlin published his famous translations of Sophocles, <title level="m">Antigonä</title> and <title level="m">Ödipus der Tyrann</title>.
               Although notoriously free and often incorrect by scholarly criteria, these famous
               translations nonetheless emphasize something common to all translations but mostly
               hidden by all. By virtue of their literary qualities and charged thematics,
               Hölderlin’s translations can make legible translative differences which other, more
               correct or “sober” translations conceal. His translations repeat the original, but
               repeat it <title level="m">in style</title>; they upstage it in a subversive
               repetition that seems to reverse chronological order and suggest how originals may be
               created through their translations. After all, what is a “Sophocles,” an “ancient
               Greek tragedy,” an “Oedipus,” if not a congeries of textual effects created through a
               certain text in front of the reader, a text that imparts a tone, a sense, a style “of
               Sophocles,” or “ancient tragedy”? Whatever a “Sophocles” is, it is only by virtue of
               that text (recalled to memory or physically before one) “now,” in the contemporaneous
               present. Even a Sophocles reading the original could only come to know his work
               through a textual present—in his case, a fifth-century BCE Athenian artistic amalgam
               of tragic, lyric, epic, legal and philosophical dictions. In Hölderlin’s
               translations, the imprint of this specific historico-linguistic time of the now (of
               reading and writing) is especially legible. As we will see in the last section of
               this essay, his translations construct time quite self-consciously through the
               stylistic figure of “voice.” </p>
               <p>Through their own stylistic features, the Sophocles translations thus impart a sense
               of their own constructedness as translations, a sense for the way in which originals
               are reconstituted retroactively as the verbal effect of a certain style and genre
               (namely, “translation”), the sense of what they bring, linguistically and
               historically speaking, into the text in order to give it—for the contemporary—the
               force of the original. Along with his contemporaries Tieck, Novalis and the
               Schlegels, Hölderlin recognized that a translation reproduces the dynamics of
               interpretation, so making readable the assumptions, inbred values, and linguistic
               devices which cohere into acts of signification—such assumptions and values which may
               attend the original, but which more properly, more surely, are constituents of the
               translation discourse itself, and which only by means of an insensible and secondary
               ascription of them back onto the original text can seem to derive primarily from
               it.</p>
               <p>Indeed, after the Hölderlin translations of Pindar and Sophocles, the sober,
               straightforward or “faithful” translation begins to look a little more illicit, as
               the following example will show. “We must present the myth more conclusively” (<title level="m">Sämtliche Werke: Frankfurter Ausgabe </title>415).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “<foreign>Wir müssen die Mythe nemlich überall</foreign>
                  beweisbarer <foreign>darstellen</foreign>.” Except for this translation, which is
                  from Pfau’s collection, all translations from the “Notes” are mine. <title level="m">Sämtliche Werke: Frankfurter Ausgabe</title> will hereafter be
                  abbreviated <title level="m">FHA. </title>
                  </note> So runs one of the hieroglyphic statements in the “Notes to Antigone,” a
               commentary appended by Hölderlin to his translation of that play. The “Notes” go on
               to provide an example: “Zeus” should be translated “Father of Time” [<title level="m">Vater der Zeit</title>] or “Father of Earth” [<title level="m">Vater der
                  Erde</title>]. Instead of the straightforward and (to all but Hölderlin)
               unobjectionable transliteration of “Zeus” for <ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*zeu%2Fs&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*zeu%2Fs0">Ζεύς</ref>, the metaphorical paraphrase would enliven the bare proper name “in
               order to bring it closer to our mode of representation” (<title level="m">Werke und
                  Brief </title>789). By putting on display the way in which the foreigner’s myth is
               appropriated through the particular mechanisms of one’s own historico-linguistic
               modes of representation, by showing the way in which the dead (“positive”) forms of
               the foreigner are “made to speak” through the figural devices of the target language,
               the critical or self-reflexive translation would foreground its own mythic emblems,
               thus offering the possibility of a self-reading of its own sense-making. If the
               original is shown to depend upon the particular historical and linguistic
               representational modes of the translator’s language, the rendition of the original is
               shown to depend upon a <title level="m">metaphor</title>—upon one metaphor (one myth)
               or another. The point here is less the rich thematic meaning and dense polysemy of
                  “<title level="m">Vater der Zeit</title>” than the way in which such “wild”
               rhetorical swerves in the Hölderlinian translation begin, after several readings, to
               hint at a heretofore unsuspected kindred rhetorical violence that lurks in the most
               “sober” and referentially correct of translations as well; the sober translation may
               be just as wild (“drunken”) but, by virtue of a certain longstanding intellectual
               tradition of imbibing, can appear to be felicitous. </p>
               <p>This manner of self-conscious presentation through which a translation displays its
                  <title level="m">modus operandi</title> is, in fact, not so unusual: as the
               material record of all the linguistic decisions made to render an alien text, any
               translation can be read as the metacommentary of its own acts of interpretation. If
               the translation itself could explain this point, it might say something like this:
               “What you are reading is, of course, the right translation; but, at the same time, it
               is also the logbook of all those choices I had to make in my own particular rendering
               of the original, a rendering that is necessarily circumscribed by my language,
               history, interpretative wariness.” Here, as elsewhere, translation is a performative
               (simulation) of the translated meaning—just as much as it is the (semantic)
               translation of that meaning, the two modes being, in fact, hard to differentiate.</p>
               <p>Let us think of the original text as a dense mass of linguistic features: a complex
               of amalgamated phonemes and morphemes, an interactive network of grammatical and
               rhetorical forms, a language conglomerate whose semantic and syntactical devices can
               join and disjoin in ways that are uniquely specific to that language. The
               idiosyncratic, self-conscious style of Hölderlin’s translations reminds the reader
               that the original is being rendered through an idiosyncratic representational
               mode—rendered, at any textual site, through just a certain myth (mythology) or just a
               certain trope (tropology)—among countless others possible in other languages. As it
               keeps staging its retro-constitutions of the original, the critical translation has a
               stake in reminding us that the real thing (the elusive original) is <title level="m">not</title> (correctly, felicitously) named, or only named “with a figure.” To
               some translators this common knowledge may be so common that they may scorn it as a
               mere truism that glosses over the real skill needed to come up with those felicitous
               turns of phrase that make up a translation. Or this common idea may appear to ignore
               the intense theorizing that has spawned the worldwide discipline known as
               “translation theory”; yet Hölderlin takes the commonplace to extremes when the stakes
               are so high—as here, in the translation of the holy name. The translation of
               absolutes (such as divine names, or the names of famous playwrights) depends
               crucially upon the textual mode of its re-presentation; this is what “the Absolute”
               is for a Hölderlin (and other writers of the time, such as Schlegel, Schelling and
               Novalis): always only a <title level="m">Darstellung</title> of the Absolute before
               it is the Absolute itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Philippe
                  Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy 27-37. </note> Whereas one less acute than a
               Hölderlin may be inclined to say—“There is no god outside of literature”—Hölderlin
               would say, rather, “The literary is precisely where the god is—or is not.”</p>
               <p>This is all to say: the Sophocles of Hölderlin is an “infuriated” translation that
               sets in most ruthlessly where the felicitous translation appears to be most flawless.
               Thus: the Greek letters—Zeta (<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=zw%2Fsain&amp;la=greek&amp;can=zw%2Fsain0&amp;prior=e)/ti">ζ</ref>), Epsilon (<ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=telei%3D&amp;la=greek&amp;can=telei%3D0&amp;prior=zw/sain">ε</ref>), Upsilon (υ), Sigma (ς) appear to correspond (or almost) to the German
               letters (z-e-v-s). Yet precisely this automatic translation is to be exposed by the
               critical translation as a linguistic and (as we will see) historical naiveté.
               Although the proper name may occasionally vary from language to language (“Zeus” may
               sometimes be “Jupiter”), it has no significant semantic component, and so can stay
               roughly equivalent across languages: English “Joseph” is French “Joseph” or Russian
               transliterated /zhozif/. Common names, on the other hand, require translation of the
               semanteme, which varies from language to language
                  (“dog”—“<emph>chien</emph>”—“<emph>perro</emph>”); yet here, too, the radical
               variation of the signifier is considerably stabilized through its grounding in the
               referent—the dog itself, which appears to stay exactly the same across languages (but
               we know better: a dog in German is not the same as a dog in English). One may
               rephrase this by saying that both proper and common names are denominations; that is,
               neither occurs naturally but has to be denominated, posited again and again in
               incessant speech acts by means of signifiers that are, in various complex senses,
               “arbitrary.” Yet a great divide separates the two denominative speech acts. The
               denomination of the proper name is supposed to last forever—this is, after all, the
               ideality and ideology of the proper (and, as we will see, of the symbol). But the
               denominations of the common name keep changing as that common thing they name (e.g.,
               “dog”) circulates from language to language. By treating the proper name (Greek
               “Zeus”) as a common name that must be translated (“<title level="m">Vater der
                  Zeit</title>”), Hölderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction
               and shows that even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated
               again and again, in a rhetorical movement which we will be aligning with allegory. In
               the Hölderlinian translation, the god is no more immune to the contingencies of
               linguistic process than the most common of common nouns—e.g., “dog.” Thus “<title level="m">Vater der Zeit</title>” allegorizes the figure of correspondence hidden
               within the transliteration: German “Zeus” is as much a deviant figure as “<title level="m">Vater der Zeit</title>.” The latter is the self-conscious performance of
               translation that implicates the transliteration as a performance just as wild.</p>
               <p>The very straightforwardness and apparent effortlessness of the transliteration
               exemplifies the particular aesthetic of Greek tragedy, a representational praxis
               which Hölderlin grounds in a Romantic notion of the symbol. Transliteration is
               essentially a symbolic mode, a monolingual fixation of names to spirits in a
               literality that lasts. The possibility of transliteration is the same possibility of
               naming the god in a solar language of stable meanings and apocalyptic perceptions in
               which “unification” [<title level="m">Eineswerden</title>] prevails more than
               “separation” and severance [<title level="m">Scheiden</title>], to anticipate a key
               distinction from the “Notes” that will figure in this essay. The stakes are high in
               this historico-philosophical critique of the “real” base, as here presented through
               the frame of transliteration: the real as the ideal correspondence of letters and
               spirits—a symbolic aesthetic where letters, the signifying elements between
               languages, are so closely, so internally fused as to be easily interchangeable—in
               which a defunct god can be given the same name as it once had in another semiotic
               system. Transliterating the god presupposes an Adamic language of origins that can
               institute lasting worlds of sense, linguistic worlds in which divinities may be
               translated into another language simply through a certain iconographic similarity of
               letters. <title level="m">We</title> may take this possibility for granted, but not
               Hölderlin. For him, a translation is a labor of remembrance: the easier things are to
               translate, the more “the memory of the holy ones” is blotted out. The aesthetic of
               transliteration <title level="m">must be</title> interrupted if the god is to be
               remembered.</p>
               <p>What is really at stake in translation—in the translation of a Greek tragedy? We may
               orient the question by sketching out what could be called the generalized aesthetic
               economy of Greek tragedy, at least the general form that economy has taken in
               received traditions of interpretation. Greek tragedy is famous for the way in which
               it links bodies in disastrous circumstances to the overarching spiritual powers of
               the cosmos. This propensity of tragic protagonists to be <title level="m">lacerated</title> by something they <title level="m">perceive</title> or <title level="m">think</title>, this capability of tragic bodies to be restructured
               psychically, to be <title level="m">grabbed</title> by an <title level="m">idea</title>—to suffer and to learn from it—is the special domain of tragic
               representation, where catastrophe, pain and confusion come to be assimilated into a
               spiritual knowledge. As Tecmessa of <title level="m">Ajax</title> laments, “Even in
               what we suffer I see the gods’ hand” (l. 950). Viewed from an atheological
               perspective, however, a secret pleasure lurks in this lament: the sense of protection
               by deity, implied in the context, where pain—or “madness” (<title level="m">mania</title>) or “ruin” (<title level="m">ate</title>)—are unquestioned signs of
               the divine that link the suffering body to apocalyptic vision. By contrast, bodies in
               sheer pain—without a language, without a mythical sphere of meaning—would only augur
               the indifference of gods, their withdrawal. In the self-contained symbolic cosmos of
               “the Greeks,” violent events such as murder, incest, and suicide are bound to
               mean—are aesthetically and religiously bound into meanings. It is this central
               feature of Greek tragedy, its ability to convert painful experience into cognitive
               insight—or represent conversion—that has intrigued generations of readers.</p>
               <p>At the same time there has been ascribed to tragedy the critical function to reveal
               what has been taken for granted—the normativity of the real—in the staging of its
               violent disruption. Through plot and characterization, this dramatic writing builds
               up the sense of calamity and channels it through the heroic body, where it can be
               felt along the blood and in the present moment; this derangement of the given order
               may then call attention to the givenness of that order. Yet even here, in the midst
               of “horrors, portioned to a giant nerve” (Keats I.175), even after the deep incision
               made by disaster in the order of things, even after this implicit critique, a
               meaningfulness prevails that is just as all-encompassing and powerful as that order
               destroyed. In fact, the deeper the gash, the more meaningful. The meaning of
               catastrophe for us may well be our inability to conceive of catastrophe outside of
               meaning.</p>
               <p>To what preconceptions—religious yearnings or aesthetic expectations—does the
               representational idiom of tragedy speak? What are the symbolic economies that guide,
               or have guided, the Greek writing of disaster?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> It
                  should be noted that the issue goes well beyond economies of “suffering”

                  </title>formula; goes beyond such moral axioms as “the doer suffers” [<ref target="numbering.xml">δράσαντι</ref>

                  displeasures, privileges or penalties, honor and shame that society metes out to
                  support the status quo. By the “self-contained symbolic cosmos” above we mean the
                  ancient Athenian socio-political life-world that binds individuals into specific
                  networks of reciprocal relations (such as “helping friends and harming enemies”)
                  to form the hierarchical relations of power, within the interlocking spheres of
                  family and polis, between men and women, mortals and gods, parents and children,
                  subjects and rulers.</note> The present essay hopes to articulate a response to
               such old and large questions, a response to be worked out by this conjunction:
               Sophocles, Hölderlin, and the task of translation. With its critical eye on the
               historical and linguistic <title level="m">eccentricity</title> of ancient tragedy,
               the postclassical translation has the task of dismantling the ancient text and
               putting it back together in a manner that would demonstrate the idiosyncrasy or
               singularity of what before had seemed universal or “taken for granted.” But such a
               demonstration has, all along, been the special province of tragedy; as we will see,
               the critical translation of tragedy uncovers—and then falls into—a “vortext” common
               to each.</p>
               <p>It could even be argued that “criticism, <title level="m">tout simple</title>, and in
               one way or another, has to do with the critical disarticulation of the symbolic core
               of tragedy, especially after this complex genre, considerably simplified through such
               lucid mimetic models as Aristotle’s, renders itself to critical judgment. For the
               German translator-poet Hölderlin, tragedy—which presents “the world in
               small-scale”—is an abyssal approximation to an unspeakable symbol: in his <title level="m">Grund zum Empedokles</title> (1799), the more protagonists or readers
               fall into their tragic texts, the more the symbol (as a new ideal or ideology, a new
               ground) asserts itself—as “the unspeakable,” “<title level="m">das nefas</title>”: as
               something at once linguistically and morally transgressive, a movement that outstrips
               all articulation. In this fall into tragedy, the more one’s critical ground gives
               way, the faster one falls “into” the symbol, a passage into tragic sublimity that
               robs one of the ability to speak, even, or especially, when there may be words to
               mark the fall. In <title level="m">Antigone</title>, we will see (§5), “the symbol”
               is the corpse of Polyneices—the “corpse is the image of his own destiny” (Bataille
                  44).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In another context Julia Kristeva catches

                     regression. Through that experience [. . .] ‘subject’ and ‘object’ push each
                     other away, confront each other, collapse, and start again—inseparable,

                  (4.1.21). Tragedy, translation, and psychoanalysis are alike in that they never
                  quite “get to the bottom of” their respective subject which tend to recede—or
                  dissolve—before their respective critiques. See my “Oedipus

                  <p>As the “Notes to Oedipus” contend, understanding a tragedy depends upon grasping
                  its basic principle: “the enormity,” an original coupling of human and divine in

                  innermost part of the human.” If the category of the divine constituted for the

                  <p>“The enormity” names a force-field of unsuspected magnitude with the capacity to
                  bind and unbind, either uniting consciousness, language, and the perceived world
                  together into substantial unities—or dispersing them. That capacity to conjoin
                  such constituents as matter and spirit, the visible and the intellectual, the
                  sensuous and the abstract into symbolic economies is truly an uncanny [<title level="m">Un-geheure</title>] force—just as the capacity to disunite them.</p>
                  <p>“Wrath” [<title level="m">Zorn</title>], a significant and complex term in
                  Hölderlin’s later poetry, connects violent figural process with violent emotion,
                  fusing the body to “the Enormity,” to create the enormous suffering body of the
                  tragic hero. Hölderlin’s Oedipus shares this impulse of the strength of wrath. As
                  the human vehicle of this energy, Oedipus is driven mad, “enraged” in “the mad and
                  frantic questing for a consciousness.” Driven by “wrathful curiosity” [<title level="m">zornige Neugier</title>], the “knowledge-desire” [<title level="m">Wissen</title>] of Oedipus “provokes itself to know more than it can bear or
                  grasp” in the encounter with Teiresias; and, in the dialogue with Creon, “the true
                  [. . .] Spirit suffers in wrathful unmeasure [<title level="m">im zornigen
                     Unmass</title>], which, in destruction-joy [<title level="m">zerstörungsfroh</title>], only follows lacerating time [<title level="m">der
                     reissenden Zeit nur folgt</title>].” In this “wrathful reading” of
                  oracle-texts, the hero literally “follows time” by rejecting and renouncing all
                  meanings, in such a way that consciousness and self-identity cannot be
                  consolidated—a failure that is, precisely, the spirit of tragedy, the spirit of
                  (the) time.</p>
                  <p>The stronger the sense of domination by “the positive” becomes, the more the
                  category of the “spiritual” is opened—the “spiritual,” here as the flaring up of a
                  desire that exceeds all available determinations or “forms” of representation.
                  “Wrath,” then, signals the nonendingness of the process of disowning the
                  signifier. Hölderlin’s Oedipus, possessed by “wrathful curiosity,” converts the
                  intransigence of the Sophoclean hero into negative capability: whatever his
                  character comes to know disintegrates before the raging desire to know; whatever
                  articulation he hits upon as “the case” is the fleeting allegorical marker of
                  something missed, something still to be signified. In this allegorizing language
                  there are no cognitive increments, no creeping realizations, no deepening insights
                  of consciousness—only the renewed process of renunciation. In this tragic split of
                  desire and knowledge, the hero is sent into a “frantic questing after a
                  consciousness” [<title level="m">das närrischwilde Nachsuchen nach einem
                     Bewusstsein</title>] (<title level="m">Große Stuttgarter Ausgabe

                     remarkable way. This is when, as the “Notes to Oedipus” explain it, “the
                     spirit” of Oedipus “is conquered by the simple brute speech of his servant”
                     (i.e., the “shepherd of Laius”). A revolutionary political motif—the complete
                     inversion of authority, where now it is the servant who gives the law—is
                     interpolated into the raging stream of negations, bringing closure but not
                     bestowing consciousness. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This quest of Hölderlin’s Oedipus seems much closer to separationist allegory than
                  to consolidating symbol, but in fact cannot be determined purely in the mode of
                  one or the other. On the one hand it is appropriate to align “wrathful reading”
                  with a certain kind of allegory, in which not one or another fixed “level of
                  meaning” is intended (e.g., reading Homer as Christian allegory), but a kind of
                  enervated or “infuriated” allegory that suggests the endlessness of allegorical
                  process and the permanent non-coinciding of signifier and signified which enables
                  that process. Thus the hypercritical spirit (of Oedipus) keeps perceiving,
                  “limitlessly” and in rage, a still unsignified excess of spirit. This is precisely
                  what “<emph>Geist</emph>” <emph>is</emph>, or at least the <emph>Geist</emph> of
                  tragedy: a structure of opposition [<title level="m">Entgegen-setzung</title>] and
                  non-convergence between a readerly/writerly consciousness and those (oracle) texts
                  which would “mirror” it; a consciousness which then only <title level="m">intensifies</title> its self-scrutiny—awakens the responsibility for reading
                  its texts with as many eyes as possible—to the degree it keeps failing to find
                  itself formulated in them. Spirit is this excess—this “enormity” as the enormous
                  difference between consciousness and language, played out in a frenetic allegory
                  where vital-internal forces are permanently estranged from their external
                     formulations.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The notion of “opposition”—the
                     oppositionality of articulations, “thesis” and “antithesis”—has a particular
                     significance in German Idealism. As Klaus Düsing notes, Hegel and Hölderlin
                     were at one time (1801 Jena) quite close in their understanding of binary
                     opposition itself as the structural signifier of an irremediable excess not
                     subject to dialectical sublation, such as the presence of the infinite in the
                     finite consciousness. Hegel will later make that difference be the drive-spring
                     into higher unity. See “Die Theorie der Tragödie bei Hölderlin und Hegel,” 59.

                  and linguistic space: Hellenic “Zeus” (a paternal figure) is rendered into a
                  Germanic “<emph>Vater</emph>” who comes back to refigure the original—tearing it
                  from its proper name, out of its extended symbolic body, and relocating it in the
                  historico-linguistic field of <title level="m">allegory</title>: “Father of Time.”
                  If symbolic language refers to the mythopoetic capability of a language, its
                  ability to deliver meanings that last, allegorical language denotes the regressive
                  character within language that resists not so much meaning, as settled and
                  definitive meaning, the stabilized truths of common reading. With origins in Babel
                  rather than Thebes, the kind of allegory at issue here generates a historical
                  language which follows the path of separation [<title level="m">Scheiden</title>],
                  its senses becoming dispersed, incessantly differentiated, non-translatable,
                  embedded in the local and idiomatic, never arising above its materials, resisting
                  totality. The symbolic (which aligns with “the mythic”) and allegorical (“the
                  historical”) coexist as contrastive linguistic modes in any given text, but it
                  makes a great difference whether one gives weight to the mythical or to the
                  historical modes of a text. Hölderlin calls their conflict “the Enormity” [<title level="m">das Ungeheure</title>] to denote that textual site, imagined by
                  speculative criticism, where the centripetal forces of symbolic binding exist in
                  violent equation alongside the centrifugal forces of allegorical unbinding. The
                  spirit of tragedy dwells in this violence, dwells “in wrath” between them, as a
                  monstrous mix of each.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Compared to the numerous
                     critical writings on Hölderlin’s poetic corpus, relatively few have been
                     devoted to the poet’s Sophocles translations. To list a few of the latter:

                     Sophokles”; Karl Reinhardt, “Hölderlin und Sophokles”; Wolfgang Binder,
                     “Hölderlin und Sophokles”; Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, “The Caesura of the

                     Antigonä”; Jochen Schmidt, “Tragödie und Tragödientheorie. Hölderlins

                  </p>
                  <p>This is to say that the frantic pace of this allegory never completely undoes the
                  symbol, never manages to escape its identity fixations—just as the symbol is set
                  in motion, internally modified by, the allegory within it. Hölderlin’s “spirit” of
                  tragedy is the amalgam of each. The Time-Spirit [<title level="m">Zeitgeist</title>] of the moderns operates in the textual spaces in between
                  allegory and symbol, becoming symbol in order to be allegory—and vice-versa.
                  “Wrath,” the energizing force of “the enormity,” denotes the constant
                  collapsing—or intertwining—of symbol and allegory.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Whereas allegory foregrounds the process of symbolization, the
                     connecting of disparate items into figural equations, the symbol conceals that
                     process, for there the connections appear, by definition, to be “natural,”
                     automatic or self-generating: the symbolic linking of “wind” to “spirit,” for
                     example, or to “breath” or “inspiration” occurs almost seamlessly and seems to
                     “partake of the reality which it renders intelligible” (Coleridge 661).
                     Allegory, which tries to take nothing for granted, links its terms more
                     self-consciously; it would just as well link “wind” to something unnatural
                     (“bed”) or abstract (“love”) as to something “natural.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the law of tragedy, what seems to be certain knowledge or secure
                  identity—absolute unification—is the symptom of a deep violence, a deep gash of
                  formation that the symbol cuts into the unconditioned. “Death” itself qualifies as
                  a supreme instance of “unification,” in the Romantic sense of a unification with
                  natural elements. A concise definition of symbol and allegory will help the
                  exposition. “Whereas the symbol postulates the possibility of an identity or
                  identification, allegory designates primarily a distance in relation to its own
                  origin, and, renouncing the nostalgia and the desire to coincide, it establishes
                  its language in the void of this temporal difference” (de Man 207). Recalling once
                  again the formulation of tragic process in “the Notes”: “the enormity [. . .]
                  comprehends itself in this way: unchecked unification [symbolic activity] purifies
                  itself through unchecked separation [allegory].” Hölderlin’s wrathful spirit of
                  tragedy shuttles back and forth between a momentary halting [“unification,” <title level="m">Eineswerden</title>] and a transition away from that halt
                  [“separation,” <title level="m">Scheidung</title>] that ends in further
                  determinations. While properly speaking both “unification” and “separation” are
                  moments of inscription, in the former, sense coalesces into inscription, congeals
                  into stasis, while “separation” refers to a movement away from inscription into
                  dissolution; thus the “becoming unified” is the “<title level="m">possibility</title> of an identity” (emphasis added) and the “separation” is
                  “a distance in relation to its own origin.” As a “coupling” of human and divine,
                  as the “union” of natural and human, “the enormity” qualifies as a symbolic
                  identity; yet, as wrathful union, as “one in wrath,” Hölderlin’s symbol of “the
                  enormity” is self-critical, always turned against itself as it keeps trying to
                  keep open the original gap between signifier and signified that is always being
                  collapsed in symbolic processes. Allegory can be itself—can be the movement away
                  from identifications and lasting determinations—only by coming to a halt,
                  postulating “identity” in momentary determinations, which then are to be left
                  behind, cancelled out as its means to intensify its “search for a consciousness”
                  and move on toward further allegorizations. Hölderlin had renounced the proper
                  name “Zeus” because it was “too” symbolic, insufficiently temporary, not
                  allegorical enough. But he had not completely renounced the charge of the symbol:
                  god=father. Father “Zeus” remains a symbolic “father,” only now this father
                  self-consciously fathers allegorical concepts: father of time, father of
                  earth.</p>

                  <p>A historico-philosophical axiom informs our subject matter: as the familiar story
                  goes, there is a great historical divide between “us” (moderns) and “them”
                  (ancients), a difference which the critical translation of the ancients keeps
                  trying to reassert. Greek tragedy, with its specific representational mode, is no
                  longer possible for postclassical historical thinking. Hölderlin had extolled “the
                  clarity of the presentation,” the crystalline lucidity of representations in the
                  Homeric epic, as the major Greek achievement, which we moderns have then inherited
                  as our second-nature. In this perspective, clear and distinct perceptions may owe
                  their existence mostly to recycled memory-citations; what seem to be our clearest
                  empirical perceptions might owe their very sharpness and seeming “objectivity” to
                  “positivity,” as the unbreakable habit that keeps repeating the same (already
                  formulated) Greek senses, which only through custom and automatism have come to be
                  known as “the truth,” the unique and best sense.</p>
                  <p>Developing a notion derived from Winckelmann, Schiller, and others, Hölderlin
                  postulates the fundamental mode of Greek tragedy to be a “naïve” one in which
                  words are “actual and deadly” [<title level="m">das Tödlichfaktische, der
                     wirkliche Mord aus Worten</title>—“the actual death from words”] (“Anmerkungen
                  zur Antigonä” in <title level="m">FHA</title> 16.418). In this particular Greek
                  orientation toward texts, “words” can have a direct contact with the material
                  world; their rhetorical force to maim or kill, to drive mad, apotheosize or impart
                  understanding may be remarked in the apocalyptic fictions of Greek tragedy, with
                  its curses, its omens and shattering revelations.</p>
                  <p>Thus in a letter Hölderlin could state that the Greeks had achieved a “sureness”
                  in “the phenomenalization of concepts”; this production of an art world made of
                  clear and certain senses constituted the “highest mode of the sign” (<title level="m">FHA </title>2.921).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See the letter
                     to Böhlendorff of November 1802: “The view of antiquity has given me an
                     impression, which makes not only the Greeks more comprehensible to me, but also
                     the highest in art [<title level="m">das Höchste der Kunst</title>]—art, which
                     even in the highest movement and phenomenalization of concepts [<title level="m">Phänomenalisierung der Begriffe</title>], and everything seriously
                     intended, even in these cases everything stays and maintains itself, so that
                     the sureness in this sense is the highest mode of the sign [<title level="m">die höchste Art des Zeichens</title>].” </note> Born into a fiery glory of
                  unconditioned energy and pure desire, they discovered how to channel wild natural
                  forces into cultural signs, creating themselves through such marvels as civic law
                  and religion, founding myths and curse words that actually worked. The eminently
                  readable language of the Greeks could make real contact with the material world;
                  their representational mode can touch “<foreign>matériellement la
                  vérité</foreign>” (Mallarmé, cited in Benjamin IV.I.17); but such immediacy of
                  word and world is no longer possible for us “moderns” or belated “Hesperians,” for
                  whom the “naïve-visionary” language of the Greeks can only be an “aesthetic
                  fallacy” or “artistic mistake” [<title level="m">Kunstfehler</title>].<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Hölderlin’s letter of 28 September 1803 to
                     Friedrich Wilmans, the publisher of the Sophocles translations: “I hope to
                     present Greek art—which is strange to us due to its national customs and
                     mistakes [<title level="m">Fehler</title>]—in a more lively manner to the
                     public, that I accentuate the oriental, which that art denied, and correct
                     their artistic mistake [<title level="m">Kunstfehler</title>], where it occurs”
                        (<title level="m">FHA</title> 2.925). The “oriental” is that aspect of Greek
                     “sobriety” or “representational clarity” which had to be rhetorically
                     suppressed, or taken for granted, as the price to pay for its lucid
                     forcefulness.</note> Over time, the original creations of the ancients lead
                  us—their successors—down the path of increasing abstraction and lost definition,
                  for their art forms could only be produced in the “naïve” climate of <title level="m">Greek </title>representation now impossible for historically
                  self-conscious modernity. While the Greek art of representation had created a
                  world accessible to the senses, the belated moderns end up only mimicking the
                  original (Greek) acts of phenomenalization. The moderns may try to “say the same,”
                  yet there is no corresponding production of a sense-certain world. The vast,
                  anterior “intertext” of tradition stands between the most proper part of the
                  modern and the modern body; the very mark of the belated text is its ingrained
                  failure to connect with materiality, but this failure to be Greek is also what
                  gives belated, “Romantic” writing its potential to read the Greek text
                  critically—to “translate” it. Hölderlin suggestively characterizes Romantic
                  textual praxis as so many allegories of force, whereby cultural formations and
                  discourses are always being (allegorically) “forced more resolutely back toward
                  earth” (<title level="m">entschiedener zur Erde zwinget</title>) by “<title level="m">our</title> Zeus.” The dominant tendency [<title level="m">Haupttendenz</title>] of Romantic writing is its incessant allegorical drive
                  toward a greater phenomenality. This drive is the symptom of the moderns’ “weak
                  point,” their inability “to meet with something” [<title level="m">etwas treffen
                     zu können</title>] (<title level="m">FHA </title>16.418).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hölderlin’s speculative reading of the “ancients”/”moderns”
                        <title level="m">topos</title> suggests a way to reframe some of the
                     significant projects of Anglo-European Romanticism. Rousseau’s <title level="m">Discourse on the Origin of Inequality </title>and Wordsworth’s “Preface to
                     the Second Edition of the <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>,” for
                     instance, bemoan the loss of sense in the creeping abstractness of cultural
                     productions; their own projects rise up to meet this loss, whether (in
                     Rousseau’s case) to remind us of the ever-widening “distance between the mere
                     sensation and the most simple knowledge” of an object or (in Wordsworth’s case)
                     to justify a poetic diction that would be the “spontaneous overflow of powerful
                     feelings.” </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet no true writer should even want to imitate the Greeks, whose ancient
                  mythico-symbolic mode of immediate perception would simply be an “artistic
                  mistake” [<title level="m">Kunstfehler</title>] for the self-reflexive modern. The
                  marvelous correspondence and seamless fusion of word and body, of letter and name
                  (transliteration), the coalescence of the corporeal and rhetorical exemplifies
                  (for “us”) the violence of language as an <title level="m">unknown</title> which
                  comes back to “rip” into the body, a language whose violence springs from its very
                  naiveté, its symbolic authority coming from its “excess of internality” [<title level="m">Übermass der Innigkeit</title>].<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     “Grund zum Empedokles,” in <title level="m">FHA</title> 1.871. Anticipating the

                        German Tragic Drama</title>, Hölderlin associates tragedy with “the deepest
                     interiority.” In Benjamin, allegoresis, working from within the symbolic nexus,
                     attempts to spin out of such immanence; it tries but ultimately fails, leaving
                     in its wake the debris of citations, which serve to generate tragic affect in
                     the form of melancholia. In other words, the unassimilated “citationality” is
                     put in the service of an aesthetics of the modern “untragedy” of <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>.</note> The critical translation is to make
                  history by displaying history: the latter is to appear in the way that the
                  translation consistently tries—and fails—to reproduce the “deadly” Greek text,
                  whose mythico-symbolic mode has the rhetorical force of literal meaning. Bad
                  translation and bad literature have this in common: both repress historical
                  differences in their pretence to be falsely “Greek.” Hölderlin’s translations
                  would expose this <title level="m">attempt</title> to be Greek, so making manifest
                  the latent gravitation of the “belated” mode of representation toward
                  “textuality.” </p>
                  <p>Hölderlin’s translation works critically toward loosening the pre-set
                  correspondence between names and bodies (physical or spiritual), trying to
                  separate them, displace them into the mode of allegory. The genre of tragedy,
                  famous for the way it aligns linguistically mediated knowledge with bodily or
                  spiritual states, is the very place to display how far this attempt to drive a
                  wedge between words and things, gods and names, original and translation may
                  succeed, and what that success may signify.</p>
                  <p>Surely one of the most important ruling ideas of Romantic and post-Romantic
                  tradition is the notion of “belatedness” and the closely associated “positivity,”
                  to name the entrapment of postclassical writers within those already elaborated
                  (“positive”) forms of their classical inheritance. The belated ones (“Hesperians”)
                  are doomed to live in worlds invented by those who came before, the “originals,”
                  the ancients; thus inscribed within the text of antiquity, they may well be
                  “without destiny” [<title level="m">Schicksallos</title>].<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The historical-cultural problem of orientation is explicitly
                     linked to “positivity” in the “Commentary to Antigone”: “[. . .] since the
                     Fate-less, the <title level="m">dusmoron</title>, is our weak point” (<title level="m">FHA</title> 16.418). </note> “Positivity,” the inability to posit,
                  denotes the crisis of the moderns as a kind of textual incarceration. Their
                  history is monotony; no matter how hard they try to rewrite the past, they will
                  always end up only projecting themselves into the same continuous and
                  nonrevolutionary futures.</p>
                  <p>Yet precisely this alienation from antiquity defines the wrathful “spirituality”
                  of the Hesperians and their corresponding representational mode. As Hölderlin
                  pointedly remarks, the Hesperian spirit is a “<foreign>Begeisterung</foreign>”
                  [“inspiriting”], a signifying energy which flares up in the attempt to disown the
                  past. But this desublimation and disinheritance of the ancients must be kept

                  <p>The attempt to get to the bottom of the (Greek) symbol has been a remarkably
                  “emotional” experience in European criticism. Hölderlin’s “wrath” is just one of
                  many emotions of a critical tradition that has a stake in keeping open the gap
                  between the letter and the spirit. The critique of “positivity” runs the gamut of
                  critical emotions: “wrath” is an accelerated, infuriated, more antagonistic—yet
                  less self-confident—version of the Schillerian “sentimental,” and can be linked,
                  further, to a series of philosophemes of emotion in significant discourses of the
                  last two centuries. “Rage” [<emph>Zorn</emph>] and “suspicion”
                     [<emph>Ahnung</emph>] later take the more subdued form of Nietzschean
                     <emph>ressentiment</emph> (bearing a grudge); Freud will attach the names of
                     <emph>Lust</emph> and <emph>Unlust</emph> [pleasure and unpleasure], as their
                  emotive concomitants, to the stabilization and destabilization of the instinct
                  forces within the psychic economy; in another modulation, “wrath” is toned down
                  into the less rabid but steadier <emph>Trauer</emph> [mourning] and melancholy
                  which marks the modern tragic consciousness in the work of Walter Benjamin.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “<emph>Das Traurige fühlt sich so durch und durch
                        erkannt vom Erkennbaren. Benannt zu sein [. . .] bleibt vielleicht immer
                        eine Ahnung von Trauer. Wie viel mehr aber, nich benannt, sondern</emph> nur
                        gelesen<emph>, unsicher durch den Allegoriker gelesen</emph>” (Benjamin
                     1.398).</note> In the above exhibits, the emotion philosophemes work critically
                  to disrupt or interrupt direct expression, putting the customary or immediate
                  meaning “on hold” in codes of feeling, until it can be discharged again—the
                  “emotional criticism” reminding us not to accept the previous identifications so
                  dispassionately as before. The coding of meaning in the language of emotions
                  operates as a powerful revisionary thematics whose purpose is to awaken the
                  reader’s awareness of the densely mediated nature of facts, truth, identities, and
                  translations. In summary, <emph>Zorn</emph> is but one moment in a massive
                  strategy—here organized under the rubric of the emotion-word—to save tradition
                  from a conformity which keeps threatening to deaden it.</p>
                  <p>To this list we may include other critical affects such as Kant’s “satisfaction”
                     [<title level="m">Wohlgefallen</title>], the telltale reminder that whatever
                  appears to be unified in the judgment of beauty cannot ever qualify as a
                  cognition, the spite [<title level="m">zlost’</title>] of Dostoyevskii’s <title level="m">Underground Man</title>, the <title level="m">jouissance</title> of
                  Hélène Cixous’ <foreign>écriture feminine</foreign>. All of these emotion-words
                  serve to indicate that an unselfconscious, unmediated, or “naïve” aesthetic has
                  been critically remarked and rigorously refused. In other words, these emotional
                  words are the repositories of affective reaction against—or programmed liberation
                  from—the positivity that haunts all representations. The subject always falls
                  short of meaningful determinations; it lags behind the meanings it may give
                  itself, or that are ascribed to it by hegemonic traditions. It is this sense of
                  disjunction and displacement—this out-of-placeness—that such words as
                  “sentimental,” “wrathful,” “resentful,” “mournful” are to mark.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Could we look for a comparative dynamic of speed in these
                     emotional words of criticism? Could we rank the speed with which subjects are
                     ripped out of language as meaning-laden discourse and thrown into language as
                     sheer velocity? For example: Schiller’s category of “the sentimental” and
                     Nietzsche’s <title level="m">ressentiment</title> appear to be subdued, slower
                     forms of Hölderlin’s more infuriated “wrath” or <title level="m">Zorn</title>;
                     while Benjamin’s melancholic genius of Baroque <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>—caught in the frenetic activity of incessant
                     allegorization—could be said to reject meanings nearly as vigorously as
                     Hölderlin’s Oedipus. “To be named,” says Benjamin, “is to have the premonition
                     of melancholy. But how much more if not named but only read—and read with
                     uncertainty, through the allegorist.”</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We return for the moment to Benjamin’s “mourning,” a twentieth-century reference
                  point for tragic language. The radical allegory of Benjamin’s seventeenth-century
                  Baroque tragedy, the play of mourning or <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>,
                  keeps signifying that the sense cannot be fixed, with the result that the sense of
                  engendering allegory itself (allegoresis) is signified. A given meaning always
                  points to another meaning, as if to say: “It is not really, not entirely, <title level="m">this</title> sense here which is meant, but <title level="m">another</title> one, further down the signifying chain.” Or: “Perhaps it
                     <title level="m">is</title> this sense—but not the way it’s being read, <title level="m">now</title>. In any case, the sense is not this, not here, not
                  now—except for the sense of this allegorical signpost pointing elsewhere. In other
                  words, the sense is ‘falling,’ moving elsewhere. So just keep reading.” The
                  allegory in Benjamin’s <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title> is sped up to the
                  point where the allegorical sense truly seems to happen with vertiginous
                  “fleetingness”: “As those who fall somersault as they fall, so the allegorical
                  intention would fall prey to the vertigo [<title level="m">dem Schwindel</title>]
                  of its ungrounded depths [<title level="m">ihrer grundlosen Tiefe</title>] [. .
                  .]” (I.I.405). In both Baroque <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>, but even more
                  so in the “baroque” translations of Greek tragedy (such as Hölderlin’s Sophocles),
                  allegory occurs at allegro pace; its senses are played out so fast—made and unmade
                  so often—that the text serves as a metacommentary on its own acts of sense-making,
                  and stages, beyond itself, the genesis and erasure of sense itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Compare Georg Lukacs’ <title level="m">The Theory
                        of the Novel</title>, where the novelist is a writer of epic, thrown into
                     temporality by belatedness. The novelist tries to achieve the “relationship to
                     totality” that could be achieved in the classical epic: the novel “approximates
                     as closely as possible” the “organic” (i.e., the continuous and “natural” epic,
                     where meaning and form exist in the closure of a symbiotic relation), but that
                     approximation “is nevertheless not a true-born organic relationship, but a
                     conceptual one which <title level="m">is abolished again and again</title>”
                     (76). </note> Benjamin chooses Hölderlin as exemplar of the good translation
                  because the distinctive feature of the latter’s translation style is its
                  “fleetingness”—its provisionality, tentativeness, self-staging specificity, or
                  idiosyncrasy as translative style.</p>
                  <p>In tragedy, “the enormity [. . .] purifies itself.” Absolute self-purification
                  could only be reached with the total erasure of all meaning—yet then there could
                  be no movement “away,” no <title level="m">abjection</title> of the tragic word.
                  In the words of one writer, “interpretation is directed not so much at the meaning
                  as towards reducing the non-meaning of the signifiers, so that we may rediscover
                  the determinants of the subject’s entire behaviour” (Lacan 212). The wrathful
                  translation reverses this and could be said to <title level="m">augment</title>,
                  thematically and tonally, the non-meaning of the signifier. “Fleetingness” points
                  up the specific modality of a given translation—the fact that it takes the
                  original and touches just a piece of it, making that fragmentation stand for the
                  whole. In the wrathful translation, the classical roles of long-term suppression
                  (of some transgression) and the sudden remembering of the same are inverted,
                  making such lines as Oedipus’ momentous self-recognition “All too true!”—his
                  anagnorisis at line 1182 (melodramatized, idealized, and possibly even knowingly
                  ironized in Hölderlin’s rendition: “<foreign>Das Ganze kommt genau
                     heraus</foreign>!” [“The Whole comes out exactly!”])—remind us of what has to
                  be suddenly forgotten whenever clear understanding is to come.</p>

                  <p>It stands to reason that the “purification” to be accomplished in translated
                  tragedy should involve the connection of two extremes: the utterly sacred and the
                  utterly profane, a God and a corpse, and the linkage between them that has to be
                  asserted again and again as the connection between them—once “purified”—keeps
                  vanishing. In keeping with the ancient institution of tragedy, the purification
                  has a purely ritualistic aspect that exceeds any mere cognitive insight or
                  thematic expression. </p>
                  <p>The key passage (quoted above) on the self-purifying “enormity” from the “Notes to
                  Oedipus” recurs in the “Notes to Antigone.” Comparing the two articulations, “the
                  enormity” of the Oedipus turns into “the unmediated God” of Antigone, each coming
                  to seize itself purely, to “purify” itself: <quote>[. . .] the Enormity [<title level="m">das Ungeheure</title>], as god and humankind couple it, and as,
                     without limit, the force of the natural [<title level="m">die

                        [<title level="m">im Zorn Eins wird</title>], comprehends itself in this
                     way: unchecked unification [<title level="m">Eineswerden</title>] purifies
                     itself through unchecked separation [<title level="m">Scheiden</title>].
                     (“Notes to Oedipus”)<lb/>
                        <lb/> [. . .] the unmediated God, one with the human
                     [. . .] [through] the infinite Inspiriting [<title level="m">Begeisterung</title>] without limit—that is to say in oppositions [<title level="m">in Gegensazen</title>], in consciousness, which consciousness
                     cancels—purely separating itself, grasps itself, and the God is present in the
                     figure of death [<title level="m">in der Gestalt des Todes</title>]. (“Notes to
                     Antigone”) </quote> In these extreme compressions, “the enormity” or “the
                  unmediated god” is to “grasp itself” through the scrutiny—the overview—of those
                  processes by which identity is articulated, constantly made, undone, and revised.
                  Critical readers will accede to such grasping only asymptotically, according to
                  their own negative capabilities. The purifying insight comes from the tragic
                  realization that all determinations are, at least to wrathful vision, absolutely
                  equal. <title level="m">Alles ist Rede gegen Rede</title> (<title level="m">FHA
                  </title>16.257). In the symbolic mode of “unchecked unification” [<title level="m">das granzenlose Eineswerden</title>] there can be (or seem to be) unquestioned
                  points of contact, actual conjunctures of language and physical bodies; the
                  allegorical mode of “unchecked separation” [<title level="m">granzenloses
                     Scheiden</title>] drives a wedge between the body and the word and tries to
                  pass through the space it had seemed to open. The original connection is not so
                  much severed as altered in a process that may be called “loosening,” which
                  Hölderlin understood, in the “Notes to Oedipus,” as “the remembrance of the holy
                  ones” [<title level="m">das Gedächtnis des Himmlischen</title>].</p>
                  <p>Here we may speak of a <title level="m">topos</title> of evanescent sense that
                  characterizes the wrath-driven language of tragedy—and translation of tragedy:
                  this would be a metalanguage of signification that stages the production and
                  destruction of determinations. The faster that process of making and unmaking
                  sense on the stage of tragic language, the more “wrath” (“mourning,” <title level="m">ressentiment</title>, <title level="m">jouissance</title>, etc.) is
                  generated as the aesthetic affect. Compared to original works, whose figurations
                  are more durable, being more “symbolic”—less unraveled by the exegetical actions
                  of allegory or translation—the antithetical, countering art of allegorical
                  unraveling is self-referential in the way that it intimates that its institutions
                  of meaning are already on their way to erasure. This is to say that the kind of
                  translation at stake here knows itself as the continuous performance of the act of
                  naming, and its “sense” is a metalanguage displaying its incessant acts of
                     denominating.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The theoretical prose fragment

                     latter to be the hallmark of tragic language especially: “the original part of
                     every authentically tragic language” is its “ever creative” part [<foreign>das

                  <p>Returning now to the passage from the “Notes to Antigone”: if “the God” can be
                  said to appear anywhere in <title level="m">Antigone</title>, it is in the rotting
                  corpse of Polyneices, the most obvious thematic referent for the “figure of
                  death.” For the “corpse” is the <title level="m">locus classicus</title> of “the
                  sacred” in this drama that works through the consequences of its central figural
                  equation. The unburied body is a signifier for the holiness of the traditional
                  laws that sanction burial and that, consequently, are so sure, so deeply embedded
                  in social practice, that they cannot be countermanded by any merely temporal
                  authority. They are fully outside of discourse, outside of all contestation—and
                  thus “unwritten.” To allegorize this symbolic equation means, in the present
                  argument, to “separate” [<title level="m">heilig sich scheidend</title>] its
                  terms, to show “primarily a distance” between what, in the original text, appears
                  as a “unification” [<title level="m">Eineswerden</title>]: corpse=sacred law. What
                  would it mean to translate this god? To “purify” the connection between the corpse
                  and it? To disarticulate—and to rearticulate—that connection from the vantage of
                  “the infinite”?</p>
                  <p>The equation is complex enough on its own terms. We recall that the Creon of
                     <title level="m">Antigone</title> issues an edict that forbids the burial of
                  the slain traitor, Polyneices, whose corpse stands for the merely historical
                  language of the king (Creon), his political edict that begins to rot the moment it
                  is issued. But the corpse also stands for the necessity of sacred law that will
                  overpower the edict and hide the rot. The law that hides the corpse must be
                  absolutely decisive—sacrosanct—to the degree that the body is an unholy decay. In
                  this play family ties, the blood bond of siblings, make common cause with the
                  sacred laws; the family is as holy an institution as rotting corpses are an unholy
                  decay. If the body were not rotting, not such “an outrage,” not famous, not royal,
                  and had no family ties, the laws that demanded its burial might begin to look less
                  transcendent, less purely “religious” and more a merely hygienic or cosmetic
                  expedient. If one in full-blown amnesia could discover the body, the latter could
                  appear as “purified” in the sense required—it would appear, that is, as a <title level="m">separate thing</title>, on its own and outside of any cultural ties,
                  in those few moments before the natural aversion to corpses takes hold, causing
                  even the amnesiac (who never quite forgets everything) to withdraw. Allegorical
                  process—the “purification” mentioned in Hölderlin’s commentary—strives to reach
                  that separate thing as it would present itself in amnesia, yet in the full-blown
                  consciousness of the impossibility of ever completely forgetting. Hölderlin had
                  posited the particular spirituality of the Hesperians to be the <title level="m">Deus absconditus</title>; their “God” can only manifest itself “in the form of
                  death,” in, that is, figures of spirit absented from itself. “Purification”
                  entails a “deformation” in the sense of an emptying out of existential contents
                  that leaves behind the desanctified and abstract vessels of signification.</p>
                  <p>The primary symbolization driving the equation “dead body”=“the sacred” is, of
                  course, that between nature (body) and culture (laws): the rotting body
                  literalizes natural process, a tremendous power, an “enormity,” which then gets
                  channeled into the cultural law (which needs visible embodiment) through the
                  symbolic linkage. “Nature” flows into “culture,” and the law grows more numinous
                  as the body rots. But the task of allegorization is separation, “a distance in
                  relation to its origin”—where “origin” may be one of either terms, the body or the
                  sacred law. As postulated, the task of translation involves bringing to light the
                  (concealed) palimpsests which invisibly hold together what appear to be the clear,
                  certain senses of Greek tragedy, in a demonstration in which even those
                  palimpsests have been destabilized and are “falling” into a dispersal of
                  mediations. If, for example, tragic horror could translate, as if by magic,
                  abstract mental contents into immediate representations of the horrible—a rotting
                  corpse representing the “unwritten laws” of tradition (<title level="m">Antigone</title>), or the notion that one’s wife is really one’s mother—this
                  ancient translation is to be encountered in a critical movement of dispersion that
                  can never quite dissolve the original linkage, but that can gain a deeper
                  awareness of its constructed nature as pre-analytically given norm—of its being a
                  symbolization, a product of repeated mediations rather than an occurrence that
                  occurs by itself and without discursive mediation.</p>
                  <p>Still, could one possibly separate out the body from that nexus of claims (of
                  family, of the state, of religious tradition) made upon it? Would this entail
                  seeing the body as a merely biological event or “thing”? Even this would be to
                  allegorize it otherwise, but the reallegorization would still qualify as a
                  “separation” of the original terms. Or, inversely, what would happen to the sacred
                  law of burial if the power of nature, the corpse-power (“<title level="m">die
                     Naturmacht</title>,” in Hölderlin’s terms), were siphoned away from it? It
                  would look more like a mere artifice of culture sanctioned only by convention.
                     <title level="m">Antigone</title> would then be a play about conflicting but
                  equally justified political positions (cf. Hegel’s reading of <title level="m">Antigone</title> as a tragic conflict of “individual rights” versus “state
                  rights”) rather than, as traditionally and classically, a play about the fatal
                  hiatus between the politico-cultural order and the raw, sovereign power of deity,
                  which cannot be signified, named, or assigned—or, rather, can be, when the
                  signifier is a corpse: when “the God” [<title level="m">der Gott</title>] may
                  appear “in the form of death” [<title level="m">in der Gestalt des Todes</title>],
                  as the “Notes to Antigone” put it (<title level="m">FHA </title>16.417).</p>

                  <p>[<emph>In the first part of section five, McCall proceeds with an illustration of
                     his argument through a somewhat revised version of his reading of
                     </emph>Antigone<emph> from “The Case of the Missing Body” and concludes with
                     the following paragraphs, which also close the essay as a whole.</emph>]</p>
                  <p> [T]he “wrathful translation” foregrounds what remains hidden in most other
                  translations, whose voice—its principle of continuity—is muted; in Hölderlin’s, it
                  is notable, remarkable, singular. Hölderlin translates the Greek, but translates
                  it into the hymnic vocality of Hölderlin. By foregrounding their own voice, his
                  vociferations put on display their principle of translational continuity, making
                  one mindful that all translations employ specific principles of unification. One
                  may read the rhetorical forcefulness of his hymnic-oracular style as a signifier
                  for the singularity of a style; that style renders the original, but the style is
                  one of many possible, a contingent mode of unification that is taken for granted
                  in such common texts as newspapers and translations. “Wrath” is a reaction to the
                  fallacy of the natural style, the one that usually goes unnoticed. The “wrathful”
                  translation imparts a sense of the contingency of styles that render.</p>
                  <p>The legendary “faithfulness” ascribed to a given translation always depends—at
                  some level of scrutiny—upon a ritual burial of the original. All translations
                  “repeat” the original—or, more precisely, they claim to represent it. Without
                  self-justification, they pass off their own substitutive proposals as the
                  “original” or anterior meaning. The notion of “passing,” passing as a member of
                  another race or gender—or a body passing for buried—is appropriate here, where one
                  thing is accepted as something else through a deception at once dramatic and
                  transgressive.</p>
                  <p>The farther one pushes the common notion that meaning gets “lost in translation,”
                  the more translation looks to be not so much the <emph>repetition</emph> of the
                  original than a textual performance that <emph>simulates</emph> such a repetition
                  through careful scholarship and crafty composition. A language is an integral
                  unity, its formal and semantic registers so closely bound together that the
                  original sense cannot be transferred and repeated in another language without
                  always being fragmented and displaced into other “senses,” with their own
                  translative refigurations and realignments of sense. But that genre called
                  translation works as a powerful textual charm in which the idea of
                     <emph>simulation</emph> (not the same as repetition) is played down; if it were
                  not, the text would begin to look arbitrary (more like just another original), as
                  if it were merely fabricating meanings instead of translating them. Whatever is
                  inscribed on the seductive pages of “translation” is instantaneously granted the
                  meaningfulness and status of “translation”; even the most woefully inept attempt
                  to render a foreign text may be a “bad” translation, but it is still a
                  translation. From this angle, translations are the performatives of translation,
                  that discourse which acts as if it were “saying the same”—which it does, but
                  through a complex pantomime. Translations are paintings often mistaken for
                  mirrors. </p>
