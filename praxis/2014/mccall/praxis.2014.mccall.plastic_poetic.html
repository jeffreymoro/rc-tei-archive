               <p>The study of lyric poetry, especially since the romantics, has tended to fall under
                  the aegis of what is broadly known as “the aesthetic tradition.” A substantial reality,
                  existing outside the poetic text, is thought to be translated into that text, most
                  often by an autonomous lyric consciousness, localizable in the poem, which gives voice
                  to a world of objects (emotions, ideas, experience, mind) capable of being represented.
                  Although Hegel’s phrase “the sensible appearance of the idea” (<em>das sinnliche Scheinen der Idee</em>) pertains to a Greek artistic era of the symbol which he believes irretrievably past
                  for the moderns, this notion—lifted out of the specific Hegelian historical schematizations—exactly
                  describes lyric in its general aesthetic context, in which intellectual and sensate
                  features are brought together into synthesized unities. Coleridge’s notion of the
                  symbol as an organic fusion of inner and outer, particular and universal, also helps
                  to situate the lyric in its aesthetic mode: the lyric, like the symbol upon which
                  it is based in this tradition, “always partakes of the reality which it renders intelligible;
                  and while it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part in that Unity [.
                  . .].” (30).

                  </div> This tradition is well-known and hegemonic, having shaped significantly both the writing

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The subject of the present essay is Walter Benjamin’s early (1914) essay on Hölderlin—“Two
                  poems of Friedrich Hölderlin” [“Zwei Gedichte von Friedrich Hölderlin”], unpublished
                  at the time yet surely regarded by the young Benjamin to be of great significance
                  for future directions.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All references are to “Zwei Gedichte von Friedrich Hölderlin” are from Walter Benjamin:
                           Gesammelte Schriften, Vol. 2 (“Aufsätze, Essays, Vorträge”), hereafter abbreviated
                           as GS. Translations are my own. References to Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen
                           Romantik and “Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften” and are in the first volume of GS.</span></div>
                  </div> Explicitly calling itself an “aesthetic commentary,” this essay demonstrates its affiliation
                  to the aesthetic tradition with frequent formulations of “unity” [<em>Einheit</em>] and “identity,” e.g., “of sensory and intellectual forms” [<em>die Identität der anschaulichen und geistigen Formen</em>] involved in the achievement of the lyric (<em>GS </em>2.1.112). A cursory reading of this dense, at times obscure piece might in fact come
                  to dismiss it as youthful, uncritical <em>Schwärmerei</em>, a youthful exercise in metaphysical poetics or aesthetic ideology.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It can be shown, however, that Benjamin’s essay occurs within <em>another </em>tradition of the aesthetic: this could be called the tradition of aesthetic <em>calculation</em>, as a minor movement and critical mutation within a primary tradition of aesthetic
               <em>inspiration</em>. In the latter major tradition, an intuitive consciousness, disdainful of rules,
               creates the poem on the basis of its natural capability and privileged sympathy with
               the “greater life”; within “aesthetic calculation,” by contrast, appearances and poetic
               syntheses are produced according to a strict, lawful, and rule-governed poetics, with
               its calculus and quasi-mechanical functions. To the “spontaneous overflow of powerful
               feelings,” the <em>furor poeticus</em>, the “drunken” inspiration of the first aesthetic of inspiration, Benjamin consciously
               opposes a designation he borrows from Hölderlin, in order to mark the second aesthetic
               of calculation, denoted as a prosaic “Sobriety” [<em>Nüchternheit</em>]. Rather than originating in a rhapsodic lyric consciousness that achieves a marriage
               of mind and nature, the unified poem in this case is produced by something more sober
               and prosaic: the poetic text as manufactured by the always repeatable and reiterable
               laws governing the genesis of poetic figurations. The shift to a poetics of <em>calculation</em> operates implicitly as a critique of the major tradition based on inspiration, which
               hides from itself its own reliance on technique, poetic mechanisms, and methodologies.
               Camouflaged within such inspired conceptions as poetic “insight,” apocalyptic imagination,
               and visionariness there lurks a lawfulness dominating all aesthetic productions. In
               fact, Benjamin’s conscious renunciation of the predominant discourse of an aesthetics
               of inspiration leads to the severe abstractness of many formulations in the essay,
               which occur in the place of those equally abstract but much more familiar conceptions
               rejected.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Several years after the Hölderlin essay, in his dissertation—<em>The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism </em>(published in 1920)—Benjamin is careful to establish the historical pedigree of this
                  anti-inspirational “sobriety” of calculation. He associates Novalis, Schlegel, and
                  Hölderlin with the “anti-aesthetic” aesthetic of prose, the proper vehicle of romantic
                  reflection, understood, in its purest form, as the reflection of reflection. The dissertation
                  links the notion of “the holy-sober” [<em>heilig-nüchtern</em>] (<em>GS </em>1.1.104)—mentioned in the earlier Hölderlin essay—to features associated with it in
                  Hölderlin’s “Notes to Oedipus” accompanying his 1804 translations of Sophocles: “lawful
                  calculation” [<em>gesetzlicher Kalkul</em>] and “mode of procedure” [<em>Verfahrungsart</em>] (<em>FHA </em>16.249-50);
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Except for references to Werke und Briefe, parenthetical citations of Hölderlin will
                           be abbreviated FHA.</span></div>
                  </div> these refer to textual machineries of sense-making [<em>Empfindungssystem</em>], narration, and figuration capable of “manufacturing” the beautiful, each time the
                  right “laws” are applied. Benjamin’s attraction to the “lawful calculation” attending
                  the Hölderlinian notion of “sobriety” makes poem-making less a natural and inspired
                  creation than the product of specific <em>functions </em>and linguistic operations.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We shall return to Benjamin’s citations of Hölderlin’s “lawful calculation”; for now,
               we note only that the aesthetic sense of “unity” in the essay on Hölderlin is based
               on calculated, even mechanical, textual processes of signification. Indeed, Benjamin
               speaks of a <em>unity-function </em>[<em>Funktionseinheit</em>] by virtue of which the Hölderlinian lyric “Blödigkeit” [Timidness] presents itself
               as unified (<em>GS </em>2.1.107). Not the substance-unity discourse of aesthetics of inspiration but the sober-mechanical
               mode in the aesthetic tradition is the issue here: “Not <em>substantially</em> but <em>functionally </em>is the identity given as law” (117). A function is whatever “relates” or “binds together”
               elements into a composite, into unity. Speaking, therefore, of the fundamental “law”
               of Hölderlinian lyric as “relatedness” or “relationality” [<em>Verbundenheit</em>], Benjamin postulates a “unity for the <em>function </em>[<em>Funktion</em>] of the binding and the bound” (122). Unspecified abstractions proliferate in this
               dense essay, but the notion of the poem as a concatenation of “identity-functions”
               intimately bound up within their correspondent “lawfulness” [<em>Gesetzlichkeit</em>] is foremost: “The law according to which all apparent elements of sense and of ideas
               shows itself to be the sum-total [<em>Inbegriffe</em>] of essential, <em>in principle infinite</em>, functions—is called the Law of Identity [<em>das Identitätsgesetz</em>]” (108).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One recurrent “function” or law in all of those “identity laws” whose application
                  produces unity may be called the “phenomenality” function, to specify the textual
                  act by means of which a consciousness (or poetic subjectivity) makes its presence
                  felt in the poem; a number of Benjamin’s formulations have to do with expositions
                  of that specific identity-function which translates abstractions (such as the poet,
                  human emotions, gods) into forms and formal <em>expressions </em>within the poetic text: the function by which, e.g., “the poet steps into life [within
                  the poem]” (116), or the function by which, e.g., “the innate spiritual temporal order
                  of <em>joy </em>[<em>Freude</em>] is rendered sensible, audible” (117); or the identity function which makes “gods
                  into highly particular and determinate figures [<em>Gestalten</em>]” (118). Phenomenalization is that process of signification which institutes the
                  text <em>as </em>an expression. Even “time” turns out to be a function in this essay: <em>die Funktion der Zeit</em>. The 1914 essay is remarkable in the way it argues for—rather than merely takes for
                  granted—phenomenalization and lyric expression as the end result of quite specific
                  and complex acts (calculations, identity-functions) of textual signification.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“The principle of intelligibility in lyric poetry,” writes a well-known critic influenced
                           by Benjamin, “depends on the phenomenalization of the poetic voice” (de Man 55). </span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>However important the “phenomenality-function” is, it is still but <em>one</em> of a manifold of functions which together make up the rhetorical and syntactical
               identities of the poem: “But the insight in the function presupposes the multiplicity
               of relational-possibilities [<em>Verbindungsmöglichkeiten</em>]” (106)—so presupposing, also, a multiplicity of functions that comprise textual
               relations, many of which, it is suggested, cannot (yet) be identified. With the term
               “relational-possibilities” and its affiliations in the “Zwei Gedichte” essay, we find
               embryonically the famous distinction, in the 1921 essay on “The Task of the Translator,”
               between the “meaning” of a text [<em>das Gemeinte</em>] and “the way in which meaning is produced” [<em>die Art des Meinens</em>]. This distinction implies a new set of <em>relations</em>: a signifying process has to be <em>related to </em>a signification, a meaning now <em>bears a relation to </em>certain devices of meaning which may or may not be able to produce it. In other words,
               contained in the overall sense of “relational possibilities” is a forceful point of
               entry for critical reading, one based on the possible non-convergence of textual significations,
               on the one hand, with those performative “functions” which actualize them (or fail
               to). A dense theoretical tract of Hölderlin’s (available in the 1913 Hellingrath edition
               Benjamin admired, and entitled “Werden im Vergehen”) emphasizes “relationality” [<em>Beziehungsart; die Möglichkeit aller Beziehung</em>] as the act of relating both themes and forms; one theme to another; forms to each
               other; meanings to linguistic forms; acts to interpretations; modes of signifying
               to significations. This act of relating becomes especially needful when relations
               usually conserved by the aesthetic conventions (governing meaning and its devices)
               have been disrupted by what Hölderlin calls a “genuinely tragic language.” “Werden
               im Vergehen” theorizes about an accelerated performance of textual dissolution in
               which acts of signifying always fail and need to be reenacted (in order to fail again).
               This continual, accelerated failure to “relate” leads to the constant need to relate,
               thereby constituting the sense of “relationality,” a dynamic romantic model for what
               post-Saussurean criticism later calls “inscription” or “materiality.”</p>
            <p>It is this multiplicity of functions that constitutes Benjamin’s special <em>topos</em> of “the <em>Middle</em>” [<em>die Mitte</em>] of the poem—which, as “the untouchable middle of all relation” (125), is not the
               actual stanzaic mid-point of the poem but a conceptual repository for the irreducibly
               unrecognizable modalities of the signifying process, and for the ultimately undiscoverable
               relations linking already enacted meanings to their productive “functions.” The Benjamin
               <em>topos </em>of “the Middle” is the means taken to mark out the way in which both the poem and
               the tradition informing it become aporetic for criticism—no longer simply readable
               and understandable, but more of a task—when the reading turns on the issue of calculation
               rather than inspiration and its associated concepts.</p>
            <p>At this point, we must backtrack to the Hölderlinian determination of “lawful calculation”
               [<em>gesetzlicher Kalkul</em>] or “calculable law” [<em>kalkulables Gesetz</em>] mentioned earlier; calculability always engenders a concomitant incalculability.
               Poetics produces aesthetics, but the latter owes its potency to its ultimate unreadability.
               The sense of poetic “law” (and sober calculation) in the Hölderlin text brings before
               critical reading a genuine alterity (something which cannot be calculated), which
               appears to defy all attempts to reflect it back into discursivity. It is the inaccessibility
               of this otherness to conceptuality in Hölderlin’s text—a difference which, again,
               asserts itself in Hölderlin’s sense of poetics—which Benjamin translates as the “untouchable
               middle” of aesthetic unity.</p>
            <p>To see how what we may call the “otherness of lawfulness” informs Benjamin’s sense
               of inaccessible immanence, we cite Hölderlin: in the “Notes to Oedipus” (1804), the
               artwork is the place where “the living sense, which cannot be calculated, is brought
               into relation with the calculable law” (<em>FHA </em>16.250). When “the living sense,” that which, by itself, “cannot be calculated” [<em>nicht berechnet werden kann</em>]—and which here does not itself get calculated—is instead <em>brought into relation </em>[<em>in Beziehung gebracht</em>] with what <em>can </em>be calculated (or, say, determined, articulated), we have a liminal situation with
               two conceivable sides, an inside or near side within calculation (determination) and
               a far side determined only as the hollow “outside” to the contours of formation. The
               law may be reflected from within the lawful formation, with the reflection here both
               made possible and determined by the law; but the “far” side—that part of the living
               sense which comes into contact with the near, determinable (lawful) side—cannot be
               calculated from its own side, which lies outside of the law and the calculable. One
               such moment in this (unlawful) alterity could be, for example, the incalculable sense
               of repetition itself, which asserts itself in the always repeatable law. The number
               of divergent expositions of the important concept of repetition (Freudian, Kierkegaardian,
               Nietzschean, Hegelian, and so on) could itself serve as an illustration of its incalculability.
               In Hölderlin’s case, the “coming into contact with form” can only be reflected from
               the side of formation, which finds itself occurring always only over against the unconditioned.
               His formulation of “lawful calculation” in fact describes a function or process of
               signification. With such functions, such identifications of uniformity, we may believe
               that we have comprehended the text and its modes of signifying; and we have done so,
               to some extent. Yet such comprehension only occasions a new indeterminateness as its
               condition of possibility.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This may be further clarified by noting that, in the above passage from Hölderlin,
                  the sense of “rhythm” (and with it the prosodic term, “caesura,” to be treated below)
                  closely attends the idea of “lawful calculation.” “Rhythm,” as a pure rhythmicity
                  involved in the merely formal “rhythmical succession of representations,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> is the reduction of the aesthetic (as calculation) to pure repetition, the aesthetic
                  as a repetition compulsion. The repeatability of the law according to regular recurrence
                  creates the conditions for the aesthetic; “rhythm,” the abstract design of repetition,
                  is the aesthetic in the mode of pure relationality. Yet the aesthetic (which in the
                  literary context, at least, qualifies as the general condition for cognition) cannot
                  itself be comprehended as mere regular recurrence; what is cognized (the rhythm, the
                  regular return of the aesthetic) is irremediably estranged from those conditions (rhythmical
                  functions) which produce it. “Rhythm” would thus also denote the failure to master
                  the aesthetic, to fathom it critically.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This problematic informs Benjamin’s reading of Hölderlin (and of lyric; and later,
                  it turns out, of Greek tragedy). As he explains, the identification of relations and
                  their functions lies beyond the pale of critical scrutiny: at the “middle” of the
                  poem “the sum-total of all functions” (<em>GS </em>2.1.124) is indeed to be located, but in relations of identity so deeply embedded,
                  so inaccessible in their totality, that such identification can only exist in the
                  mode of a “task” [<em>Aufgabe</em>] to be undertaken again and again, but destined to fail. The unavoidable incompleteness
                  of reading the lyric engenders the construct of “the poematized” [<em>das Gedichtete</em>], a sort of secondary “lyric of criticism” or metapoem abstracted from the actual
                  poem [<em>das Gedicht</em>], imposed as a task, and existing to make those relation-functions of the poem available
                  to criticism in a more visible and determinate form: “The principle of the poematized
                  generally is the sole <em>sovereignty of relation</em>” [<em>Alleinherrschaft der Beziehung</em>] (124).

                           is indebted, may be cited here. Rainer Nägele, “Benjamin’s Ground,” and David Wellbery,

                  </div> This “poematized,” Benjamin makes clear, does not exist in the mode of a universal
                  and metaphysical category applicable to other poetic texts, but is <em>sui generis</em>, a singular project(ion) of its actualized poetic text.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Associated with this “untouchable middle of all relation” [<em>die unberührbare Mitte aller Beziehung</em>] are two related designations: the poet, and death—or, we may say, the dead poet,
               that poet who reveals himself in the metapoem as death, the frozen intersection of
               relata taken out of flux and fixed in the poem: “unified in death [<em>im Tode</em>] [. . .] are all <em>known </em>relations” (125, my emphasis). “Death” as immanence has to do with “Form in its <em>deepest </em>binding” [<em>Gestalt in ihrer tiefsten Bindung</em>] (110). In the book on German tragic drama (which Benjamin began working on only
               a few years after the Hölderlin essay), the sense of inaccessible immanence is prominent
               in the delineation of the inarticulate but knowingly superior hero of Greek tragedy;
               in the Hölderlin essay, as later, it has to do with muteness, but in the present case
               with a certain inarticulateness of criticism—as regards the inscrutability and unnameability
               of unity-functions. In their untouchable place “within,” “death” and “the poet” look
               like displaced names for the sum-total of unnamed functions “at the middle.” The “death”
               or dead-spot there evokes the sense of a densely clustered network of congealed relations,
               so recalling the close-packed “thickness” of language etymologically suggested in
               the word <em>Dichtung</em>. Within general (unwritten) “life” at large, death may be the great Dissolver of
               relation-functions and relationality, but here it is what reifies relations on the
               flat surfaces of writing, from within an immanence made all the more inscrutable by
               being manifested only in the externality of the epitaphic, textual surface [<em>Mitte und Erstreckung</em>] (116). “Death” as the great Congealer of (textual) relations is <em>Versachlichung</em> (or “materialization”—the act of becoming material, objective inscription), a poetic
               function which Benjamin, following Hölderlin, associated with a certain fiction: the
               “death” of the gods.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Such a death, a dying into inscription, is for Benjamin (as for Hölderlin) a specifically <em>temporal </em>action determined as a god-death: an internal concentration of formative energy or
                  “temporal/timely Plastic” [<em>zeitliche Plastik</em>] erupts from the pressure of immanence to congeal into the inscribed names and attributes
                  of divinity. The inscription of the divine name introduces a temporality into what
                  is written, thematized as “death.” The temporality of inscription, we should note,
                  occurs in a particularly romantic and modern critical revisitation of ancient “Greece,”
                  a literary <em>topos </em>which signifies for a nineteenth- and twentieth-century modernity the historico-philosophical
                  possibility that the sacred word could render itself entirely present within phenomenality,
                  i.e., could render itself aesthetic. But this coherence of the oracular and the visible
                  without loss of sense can only appear to us “Hesperians” (moderns) now as a peculiarly
                  Greek “aesthetic mistake” [<em>Kunstfehler</em>], to use Hölderlin’s term.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This occurs in a letter to Friedrich Wilmans, who published Hölderlin’s Sophocles
                           translations. In this letter of September 1803, Hölderlin justifies his translation
                           practice as a means to open the text up to fresh meaning by declassicizing the Greek
                           formulation (through an emphasis on the eccentric and “oriental”) and by “correcting”
                           the Greek “aesthetic mistake” [“[. . .] un ihren kunstfehler [. . .] verbessere”].
                           See Hölderlin: Werke und Briefe 2.947.</span></div>
                  </div> In its pretense to have utterly transcended the temporal in becoming a flower of poetic
                  artifice, the god’s name introduces “death” into the text as a radical forgetting
                  of temporality, which yet abides as an unconditioned temporal excess, something incalculable,
                  a “plasticity” still left over after the inscription of the beautiful image—which
                  itself relies on plastic time as its own condition of possibility. In Benjamin’s spatial
                  metaphorics, “depth” and “immanence” are the sites of this death; they are the markers
                  of this aesthetic “mistake,” this forgetting of an inconceivable, but always sovereign,
                  excess.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Plastic time thus rips something immanent from within the poetic middle in its depth,
               and conjugates this onto the graphemic, physiognomic surface of the text. Temporal
               “plasticity” involves the capability to transform and invert the immanent into its
               superficial forms, according to the “function of time” [<em>Funktion der Zeit</em>], a function which determines the tightness or looseness of relata in the textual
               web, the <em>Dichtung </em>(118). The deeper, more distant the particular “relation of identity” informing the
               poem is to be located “at the middle,” so the more “untouchable,” which is to say,
               “timely” and plastic it will be. The gods are “produced,” says Benjamin, when they
               “fall prey to their own forces of formation,” i.e., when the force of the identity-function
               governing them is so intense (concentrated, forceful, binding) that it turns into
               a “temporal-internal seizure” (121), turning the internal inside out to display itself
               within the unifications of deadened, phenomenalized forms. As often in the hyperbolically
               self-conscious texts of Hölderlin, a beautiful deadness of expression, a literary
               cliché on the mere poetic surface, evokes the inexpressible as that expression’s insinuation
               of its own impending erasure.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is probable that this motif of “materialization,” as well as the closely related
                  notion of “immanence,” is derived directly from the “Notes” [<em>Anmerkungen</em>] to Hölderlin’s translations of <em>Antigone </em>and <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em>. Although he did make use of Böhm’s 1905 edition (which excludes the “Notes”) for
                  the texts of the two poems discussed in the essay (“Dichtermut” and “Blödigkeit”),
                  the “Notes” would doubtless have been available to Benjamin in the Hölderlin edition
                  he preferred—the 1913 Norbert von Hellingrath edition.

            <p>Exposition of the Hölderlinian contexts must here be omitted in order to focus on
               Benjamin’s transformations and revisions. We note, first, the Benjamin reads Hölderlin’s
               poem “Blödigkeit” (or rather its “poematized” version at issue in a critical reading)
               as an allegory for the “deep” immanence of its own relations, in an application of
               principles gleaned from the “Notes” to <em>Antigone </em>and to <em>Oedipus</em>. For Benjamin, the Hölderlin text is the self-reading (or metacommentary) of the
               inaccessibility to analysis of its unity-functions; the failure of penetration in
               this self-reading (undertaken in the “metapoem”) becomes the very condition of possibility
               for the phenomenal unity the poem is able to achieve. The possibility of “materialization”
               [<em>Versachlichung</em>], as of unity itself, arises from the <em>density </em>of relations at “the middle”—a density too “thick” (the “<span class="foreign">dicht</span>” of “<span class="foreign">Dichtung</span>”) in the interrelations of its functions to be differentiated in criticism. Aesthetic
               unity depends here, as elsewhere, upon the impossibility of a complete critical disarticulation.
               This density is associated with a certain “violence” of tragico-mythic relata (see
               set of citations under #3 above), the textual symptom of which is the displayed “unity”
               of the lyric. Immanence, the poetic middle, is a function of the violence (forcefulness,
               density, “thickness”) of those identity relations it harbors; without the closeness
               and tightness, i.e., violence, of relations, there would be no (“untouchable”) immanence.
               We have already linked such violence to the Hölderlinian notion of “rhythm” as the
               violent regularity (a Greek <em>ananke</em>) with which the aesthetic returns, as the mostly passive reenactment of a relation-function.
               We should also note that this violent force governing relations “at the middle” may
               be intimated either by self-dissolving signifiers on the textual surface (see last
               Benjamin citation under #3 above) or by fixed signifiers having the sense of being
               prematurely congealed, such as the materialization of the dead “god” (in citations
               under #2 above). The effect is the same: an innate temporal plasticity, concentrated
               into a violent energy, either “gives up” representing itself or “gives in” to a representation
               which fails it.</p>
            <p>Further, Benjamin introduces two designations, linked to the notion of “temporal plastic”
               and “violent relations at the middle,” and discussed through the two Hölderlin lyrics
               featured in the essay: a merely “mythological,” earlier draft “Dichtermut” yields
               to a “mythic,” revised draft “Blödigkeit.” Whereas the elements in the first (“mythological”)
               text are “loose,” having no “energetic” relation to a submerged and violent plasticity
               at the middle, the elements of the “mythic” poem exist in dense and violent relation
               to their immanence “at the middle.” In other words, there is no immanence (and thus
               submerged violence) in the “mythological” poem, characterized by the “lack of relation”
               [<em>Beziehungslosigkeit</em>] among its elements and by its “isolation of form” [<em>Vereinzelung der Gestalt</em>] (<em>GS </em>2.1.111); its constituents therefore unable to “make sense,” the poem is made up of
               mere citations of prior (possibly once “mythic”) texts. As evidence, Benjamin refers
               to conventional phrases (in “Dichtermut”) merely recycled from a “mythological” diction
               of (neo)classical poetry at hand: e.g., “<em>der Sonnengott</em>” [the Sungod/Apollo] (120) and “<em>die Parze</em>” [Destiny]. The “dead” citationality of, for example, the (neo)classical “<em>der Sonnengott</em>” (earlier draft), isolated and unmeaningful because not proceeding from a nexus of
               functions embedded in the poem, is forcefully revised into the “romantic” “<em>des Himmels Gott</em>” [God of Heaven] of the later draft, which exhibits (in German, not in translation)
               the peculiar tension of the Hölderlinian periphrasis. On Benjamin’s reading, “<em>des Himmels Gott</em>” would issue from a “density” and active energy of relational identites, thus illustrating
               the “intensity of relation” [<em>Instensität der Verbundheit</em>] of a “mythic” immanence (108).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This is to say that signification depends entirely upon the processes of an aesthetic
                  context involving “mythically-bounded elements” (see citations under #3) rather than
                  upon the mere citation of elements having an extra-textual reference: “The mythological
                  demonstrates itself as <em>Mythos </em>only in the measure of its <em>boundedness </em>[<em>Verbundenheit</em>]” (109). The “classical” and “mythological” mode of the earlier draft thus fails
                  to <em>be aesthetic</em>, thereby failing to be a lyric, be an original, with corresponding loss of immanence.
                  To put this another way: the merely “mythological” is the stuff of aesthetic <em>ideology</em>, whose unity-functions and modes of phenomenalization will be more transparent for
                  a criticism that will be able to carry out its tasks more easily on mythological materials
                  than on mythic. But if the signification functions of a text prove to be more transparent
                  and readable, they will also be less forceful, less aesthetically efficacious, less
                  innately unified. The process of revision in going from the earlier to the later draft
                  of the poem may trace out the passage from classical to romantic, which (following
                  Hölderlin’s lead in this respect) is a passage into immanence. But the aesthetic functions
                  of the immanent text of romance will prove to be unreadable, beyond the reach of criticism;
                  the latter will be unable to distinguish individual relata in the dense plastic clusters
                  “within,” caught up as they will be in a text governed, says Benjamin, by the “impenetrability
                  of relations” [<em>die Undurchdringlichkeit der Beziehungen</em>] (111). Once we are in the (romantic) revision, it becomes “difficult,” says Benjamin,
                  “to acquire a possible access into this fully unified and singular world.”

            <p><em> </em>Benjamin asserts, for example, that the earlier draft of Hölderlin’s lyric achieves
               no real relation to “death,” since “<em>life </em>was still the precondition for death” (123); that is, “death” here comes from an extra-textual
               life and so is “substantial” rather than textually immanent—unlike that “death” of
               the later draft, determined as “Form in its deepest binding” (110). Here the classical
               citation from the first draft recalls that “other” aesthetic tradition we began with,
               in which lyric unity is conceived as imported into the text from outside it, as something
               substantial and merely referential. Lacking the immanence of what in the Hölderlin-Benjamin
               context emerges as the genuine artwork associated with a “mythic” and “romantic” relationality,
               the classical, Greek and “mythological” production would be aligned with “the weakest
               achievements in art,” which, as Benjamin reminds us early in his essay, fail because
               they “relate <em>immediately </em>to life,” as opposed to “the strongest” works, connected with “a sphere related to
               the mythical” (107). By contrast, the later draft (“Blödigkeit”) does realize “death”
               as this immanent, binding relation, and to such a degree that “a <em>new</em> meaning of death” is to emerge from it, although this “new” meaning may only be proleptic,
               paradoxically to be realized when <em>this </em>lyric in its turn—“with the turn of time” (citing the poem’s <em>zur Wende der Zeit</em>)—becomes mythological, i.e., becomes canonical and starts being quoted and translated.
               Still, as it presently exists in the poem, such a “death” is “inconceivable to us
               on a clearer basis” (126).</p>
            <p>As Benjamin explains it (125), the central “characteristic” of Hölderlinian “sobriety”
               [<em>Nüchternheit</em>] is best referred to only at the end of his essay, where it can finally emerge in
               its determinateness. There, he asks where the Hölderlin <em>topos</em> of the “holy-sober” is “still that of Greece.” As his subsequent remarks make clear,
               this is the same as asking if the “holy-sober” belongs to the lyric sublimity of that
               other aesthetic tradition derived from “inspiration,” where the artwork is conceived
               as the direct <em>life expression</em> of a people and of an individual [the poet]. Though it may be “composed in Greek
               forms,” the “holy-sober”—so runs the answer—is emphatically not Greek, which is to
               say, not related to the inspired “Ecstasy”—“the <em>mania</em> of Plato”—of the major aesthetic tradition at all, but rather to that “mechanical
               reason” which “soberly [<em>nüchtern</em>] constitutes the work” (<em>GS</em> 1.1.106). If “life” and, for example, that “new death” discussed in the last paragraph
               are productions of the “Holy-Sober” mode, they would spring (like any produce of sobriety)
               from <span class="quote">‘the <em>inner </em>Sureness [<em>Sicherheit</em>] in which they [sober words] stand in his [Hölderlin’s] own spiritual life, in which
                  now Sobriety is allowed, required—because it is, in itself, holy, <em>beyond all elevation in the sublime</em> [<em>jensits aller Erhebung im Erhabnen</em>]. (125)’</span> To surpass the sublimity of the sublime is to become something wholly prosaic, at
               once ultra- and anti-sublime, in an inversion that Benjamin precisely specifies as
               an “untouchable sober-prosaic figure” [<em>unantastbaren nüchternen prosaischen Gestalt</em>] and that he links to a poetological term called a “Caesura” (<em>GS</em> 1.1.106). This latter notion, again borrowed from Hölderlin, is a means to thematize
               the real resistance of such “untouchability” to critical appropriation. “Caesura”
               [<em>Zäsur</em>] does not occur in the discussion of Hölderlinian “holy-sober” in the dissertation
               (<em>Kunstkritik</em>) several years later, and for good reason: there the sober law, the materials it
               shapes—and its associated “untouchability”—are always to be re-assimilated into the
               spheres of discursive reflection by the “positive” dialectical appropriations of the
               romantic idea. Although the operation of the law “infinitizes” the task of criticism,
               in the <em>Kunstkritik</em> the latter will still be an endless success story of speculative self-meta-reflection,
               for the very reason that it finds itself challenged into furious activity by the sober-prosaic.
               Yet, in the Hölderlin essay Benjamin shows himself rather less willing to let this
               untouchability—and the potential difference it generates as unreadable immanence—be
               ultimately circumscribed entirely within the endlessly assimilative process of the
               romantic absolute, within, that is, the “absolutizing, universalizing classification
               of the individual moment [. . .] that is romanticization” (<em>GS</em> 1.1.67). But that immanence emerging in the “Two Poems” essay is instead allowed
               to exist more (which is not to say, entirely) in the mode of its genuine liminality
               and potential heterogeneity, as we have explicated this with respect to the Hölderlinian
               “lawful calculation.” Both Hölderlin and Benjamin expressly link the poetic law to
               what they call a <em>Caesura</em>; in a sense to be unfolded below, the latter indicates both a powerful aesthetic
               function <em>and </em>a threshold of criticism.</p>
            <p>Quoting the last stanza of “Blödigkeit”—a stanza which very possibly motivated (in
               conjunction with motifs from the “Notes” to Hölderlin’s Sophocles translations) his
               entire reading of this lyric as a metacommentary on its own functions and on their
               latency as the condition of lyric unity—Benjamin mentions the caesura in the context
               of a poetic unity that is only achievable when the poet, understood as the principle
               of form, operates from within an immanence whose untouchability translates into the
               <em>distance</em> [<em>Abstand</em>] of the poet from its materialized unities on its surface: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">Wie sehr er [the poet] die unberührbare Mitte aller Beziehung bedeutet, enthalten
               die beiden letzten Verse am mächtigsten [. . .] “und von den Himmlischen/ Einen bringen.
               Doch selber/ Bringen schickliche Hände wir.” So ist der Dichter nicht mehr als Gestalt
               gesehen, sondern allein noch als Prinzip der Gestalt, Begrenzendes, auch seinen eignen
               Körper noch Tragendes. Er bringt seine Hände—und die Himmlische. <em>Die eindringliche Zäsur dieser Stelle ergibt den Abstand, den der Dichter von aller
                  Gestalt und der Welt haben soll, als ihre Einheit. </em>(<em>GS </em>2.1.125) <br/><br/>[How much he signifies the untouchable middle of all relation is embodied most powerfully
               in the last two verses [. . .] “and (we poets) bring one of the heavenly ones. And
               ourselves we bring capable hands.” So the poet is no longer seen as form, but only
               still as principle of form, the Delimiter, the one still carrying even his own body.
               He brings his hands—and the heavenly ones. <em>The striking caesura of this place produces the distance, which the poet, as their
                  unity, should have in the presence of all form and the world</em>.] (my translation)</blockquote>
            <p> The “striking caesura” asserts itself through the curious literalization of the “hands”
               that the poet is said to “bring.” In other contexts this metonymy could appear quite
               natural: one “brings” “capable hands” as one may “bring”: “a strong back,” “a clear
               head,” “energy and enthusiasm.” The hands could elsewhere be naturalized as figures
               for the physical implements of the writer’s craft; but here the contrast with that
               “One of the gods” who is also brought contributes to an estrangement called the caesura.
               The latter is an interruption or hesitation of sense, the effect of a juxtaposition
               which strikes the reader as a faulty parallelism: “Hands—Gods.” One normally brings
               one’s hands, moreover, without needing to remember to bring them, or to remark that
               they have been brought, for they are attached to the (physical and lyrical) body as
               a natural and substantial extension. Only if hands were the mechanized, prosthetic
               devices of the amputee would they need to be remembered and “brought.” But this is
               the sense of Hölderlin’s poet of functions, a miracle of rare device, who—as Composer-of-functions
               and Composed-of-functions, as pure prosthesis, a pure functionality—having no attachments,
               can take none for granted, and must literally remember to bring himself into the poem
               [<em>tritt nur/ Baar in’s Leben</em>, from the first stanza (116)]. “Don’t forget to carry your body into it, either!”
               comes through in Benjamin’s uncompromising reading of the caesura. In the prosaic
               repetition of “bring,” we find an emergent sense of the “holy-sober” stylization that
               Benjamin admires in Hölderlin but which can hardly be called “natural” or even “lyrical”
               in their usual senses. The poet brings the “holy One” in a poetic invocation of the
               sacred; but this “beautiful” lyric convention explicitly parallels something “else”
               that is brought, which would be macabre if it were more of an actual bodily part (as
               “this living hand” of the late Keatsian poem is) and less a functional or prosaic
               tool (of writing, composition), as it is here: the “sober,” mechanical and mundane
               “hands.” The juxtaposition of the theophanic and the technological (capable hands,
               which Hölderlin elsewhere calls the <em>mechane</em>) constitutes the caesura, which here strikes the reader as the Hölderlin-Benjamin
               project to realize, always only imperfectly, the complete separateness and distantiation
               that the perfectly “sober” unity of lyric demands.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For Benjamin, reading the caesura appears to crystallize reading Hölderlin, reading
                  romanticism and the lyric, and no doubt critical reading in general. Indeed, it is
                  the “unreachable goal of all German artistic praxis” not only to <em>present</em>, but to <em>comprehend</em> the caesura which inhabits the poetic discourses of “occidental junoesque sobriety”
                  (<em>GS </em>1.1.182). This formulation appears in an essay (published in 1925) on Goethe’s “Elective
                  Affinities,” which reiterates Hölderlin’s own determination of the caesura in his
                  “Notes to Oedipus”: “The tragic transport [<em>Transport</em>] is in actuality empty, and the most unbound” (<em>GS </em>1.1.182). How does one best appreciate, critically comprehend, something that is “empty”
                  [<em>leer</em>]? We recall for the moment the verse, cited by Benjamin (see preceding paragraph),
                  which he finds thematic of the caesura: “He brings his hands—and the heavenly ones.”
                  In this instance the disparity of those themes just before and just after the gap
                  to be read—the figurations beginning and ending the “transport” across the empty passage—appears
                  to offer a critical purchase on the caesura: “hands” are in stark disjunction with
                  “the heavenly ones.” Is a caesura easier to read when its thematic frames are dissociated
                  as here? But given the potent aesthetic that surges up through these very transports
                  across an indeterminate (“unbounded”) and empty space, the critical articulation of
                  this space to be read all too easily vanishes into it, swallowed up within the same
                  aesthetic it would distinguish. “<em>Er bringt seine Hände</em>—<em>und die Himmlischen</em>.” This paratactic figuration promises criticism a deep incision into the untouchable
                  aesthetic: it plays out analogically the same distantiation [<em>Abstand</em>] at issue in the idea of the holy-sober, as the radical disjunction between signification
                  and the lawful functions that produce it. Adorno fell for this tactic of the paratactic
                  as a mode of reading Hölderlin: in Adorno’s famous reading, Hölderlin’s own “epic”
                  style—where words are “piled on,” merely added on in endless supplements without any
                  (“hypotactic”) subordination to an overarching motif—promises an insight into the
                  Hölderlin text, with the manifold interruptions in the interpretative process that
                  its own “striking caesuras” pose for readers.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">
                           (12)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Adorno’s “Parataxis: Zur späten Lyrik Hölderlins.”</span></div>
                  </div> Yet reading the caesura through such thematic disjunctions qualifies as the very problem
                  of reading lyric, reading romanticism. In the preface to <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, Paul de Man suggests that the criticism of romanticism habitually “stumbles” over
                  those very “breaks and interruptions that readings disclose,” in the sense that such
                  readings end up smuggling back in “the aesthetic unity of manner and substance that
                  may well be what is in question in the historical study of romanticism” (ix). Our
                  failure to read the romantics has to do with our failure to achieve the failure of
                  aesthetic recuperation. De Man’s very example of this failure (to fail) is Adorno’s
                  famous paratactic reading of Hölderlin, which recuperates the fragment (a modality
                  of the caesura) under the aesthetic aegis of parataxis.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Even though Benjamin, too, may gravitate towards something like a paratactic reading
               of Hölderlin in his notion of the “extensionality” [<em>Erstreckung</em>] of the text (its ability to unfold indefinitely “in a row of chains,” in a certain
               way, in accordance with a governing “fate”), he proves to be a wary reader, suspicious
               of the possible collusion of his critical strategies with the deeply embedded aesthetic
               unity of the textual object to be criticized (<em>GS </em>2.1.116). Indeed, the entire Hölderlin essay is constructed as a reminder of this
               possibility of collusion and the difficulty of achieving critical impasse. What in
               the Hölderlin essay is the unreadability (“untouchability,” “impenetrability”) of
               the “mythic” and original lyric emerges ten years later in the Goethe essay as an
               “inexpressible violence” [<em>ausdrucklose Gewalt</em>] which any successful or “sober” art-expression harbors as its internal condition
               of possibility (<em>GS </em>1.1.182). As Benjamin specifies it, the inexpressibility of this violent force arises
               from both the necessity of analyzing the caesura of the artwork (as the critical access
               to its aesthetic unity), on the one hand, and from the impossibility of doing so,
               on the other, due to the way in which criticism itself, the metapoem of the poem,
               is (like the poem) “caesura’d,” always drawn into its aesthetic rhythms and unity
               functions. Thus, on the one hand, criticism is <em>unable </em>to differentiate “appearance from essence in the artwork” (ibid.); the attempt to
               read the radical otherness of the caesura is always perceived by a self-aware critique
               to be a misreading of sameness. “The Inexpressible is the critical force, which is,
               on the other hand, <em>unable to differentiate </em>appearance from essence [<em>Schein vom Wesen</em>] within art [. . .]” (<em>GS </em>1.1.181). On the other hand, this inability so far looks like the critical solipsism
               brought on by the iron machineries of dialectic recuperation, where differences are
               overlooked, transformed and forgotten through their assimilation back into those very
               aesthetico-critical unities which are being interrogated (and which would be exploded
               if the differences were allowed to exist outside of the unifying frameworks of criticism).
               <em>Yet</em>, in this case, the inability, appearing as it does <em>in caesura</em>, does not lead back into the circle of reflection, but rather <em>remains</em> exactly where it is—at the limit of the circle: “[. . .] the critical force that,
               on the one hand, is unable to differentiate appearance from essence within art, but
               <em>on the other hand</em> keeps them from being confounded” [my emphasis]. This caesura-criticism would thus
               refuse that assimilation back into “romantic” reflection, without, however, relinquishing
               its status as criticism, for it maintains a critical difference in the face of its
               impossibility, or, rather, it refuses to act on its inability to differentiate, refuses
               to give up the impossible task of criticism.</p>
