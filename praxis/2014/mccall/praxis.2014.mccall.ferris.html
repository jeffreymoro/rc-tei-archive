            <p>It would be a mistake to confuse the choice of subject for this essay, the name of
               Shelley’s unrelenting elegy, as an easy mirror in which to honor the work of a friend
               and scholar for whom such mirrors, as the preceding epigraph confirms, were objects
               of suspicion. Nor did he ever seek to take the easy critical path. Rigorously trained
               in classical Greek and German thought, he pursued their interrelation as the driving
               and unresolved question of our critical and historical modernity in the Romantic period.
               By addressing the name of Shelley’s elegy, and by inflecting it through a task taken
               up by Sophocles, Frederich Hölderlin, and Walter Benjamin, this essay seeks to honor
               Tom McCall’s work and his engagement with these three figures whose significance to
               Romanticism and its legacy remains at the core of his thought. </p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In an essay that remained unpublished at the time of his death, “<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.2014.mccall.wrathful_translation.html">Wrathful Translation: The Sophocles of Hölderlin</a>,” Tom McCall returns to a subject that had attracted his attention early in his career:
                     the encounter of German Romanticism with Greece.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>McCall’s s essay belongs to a book project that had the working title, “Vortexts.”
                              The second epigraph to this paper is the concluding sentence of McCall’s “Wrathful
                              Translation.” McCall had first written about Hölderlin’s translations in his doctoral
                              thesis at Yale. This thesis, “Allegories of Translation: Hölderlin’s Translations
                              of Sophocles,” was completed in 1987 under the direction of J. Hillis Miller. </span></div>
                     </div> In this essay, McCall focuses on those translations of Sophocles by Hölderlin which,
                     as Walter Benjamin reminds us in "The Task of the Translator,” were considered “monstrous”
                     in the nineteenth century (1.260).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Benjamin recalls this reception in the context of a remark about Hölderlin’s “literal
                              rendering of syntax.” </span></div>
                     </div> Rather than discount this “monstrousness” and normalize it in the context of the critical
                     and literary theory of the later twentieth-century, McCall examines this monstrous
                     aspect as the effect of an unresolved problematic within Sophocles’ account of the
                     tragic, a problematic subsequent literary history and criticism has sought to subdue,
                     if not make disappear, through its “tragic” accounts of the history of tragedy. Relying
                     on Hölderlin’s remarks to his translations of Sophocles, McCall takes another approach
                     that pits Greek tragedy against its reception as it is embodied in the modern project
                     of translation. This project (not to mention its evolving <span class="foreign">telos</span>, a world literature) has demanded a transparency and accuracy which has had the result
                     of denying the critical challenge of its source through what Mallarmé called “the
                     false appearance of a present” (310). What McCall sets out to demonstrate is that
                     within the practice of translation, on which the survival of literature as a cultural
                     form has been increasingly dependent since Romanticism, there is a tension that possesses
                     a crucial, critical potential.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>On the significance of the translation to Romanticism, see Antoine Berman. </span></div>
                     </div> For McCall, this critical function no longer depends on the old cliché of translation
                     studies which states that any translation is predicated on the loss of the original—as
                     if translation were an elegiac exercise always mourning an impossible task and as
                     if solace could be found in the necessity of endlessly repeating this task.</p>
               </div>
               <p>McCall defines the tension present in Hölderlin’s translations as “the disjunction
                  between the arbitrariness of signs, on the one hand, and the deep embeddedness of
                  meanings in their historical traditions, on the other” (1). Lest this remark be dismissed
                  as if it were a transparent, deconstructive gesture, it is important to keep in mind
                  that McCall does not evoke Saussure’s fundamental insight concerning the arbitrariness
                  of the sign as if it were the beginning and end of a deconstructive reading. McCall
                  locates this insight on one side of a tension between the embeddedness of meaning
                  in a tradition and the language through which such tradition exists and reproduces
                  (or retranslates) itself. What this tension then sets up is a historical problem in
                  which neither embedded meaning nor the condition of its transmission can prevail.
                  In this respect, McCall is correct to speak of a tension that is historical and critical
                  at the same time. Adopting Hölderlin’s language, McCall locates this tension in the
                  “wrath” (<em>Zorn</em>) of Oedipus, which is subsequently developed as the hallmark of Hölderlin’s own translations
                  of Sophocles—hence the title of McCall’s essay, “Wrathful Translation.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hölderlin’s emphasis on the “wrathfulness” of Oedipus defines the tragic experience
                     according to an affective state that runs counter to the tradition in which tragedy
                     has become the carrier of an ahistorical, human truth whose affirmation informs the
                     task of cultural interpretation and its practice of translation. Against such a tradition,
                     Hölderlin points to Oedipus’s wrath or anger (both translate <em>Zorn</em>) as the result of a desire for knowledge that cannot grasp what it seeks to attain.
                     Instead, it experiences an “enormity” (<span class="foreign">das Ungeheure</span>) that the hero cannot resolve or reconcile. McCall summarizes Hölderlin’s account
                     of this irreconcilable enormity as follows: <span class="quote">‘As the human vehicle of this energy, Oedipus is driven mad, enraged in “the mad and
                        frantic questing for a consciousness.” Driven by “wrathful curiosity (<span class="foreign">zornige Neugier</span>) [. . .] the knowledge-desire (<span class="foreign">Wissen</span>)” of Oedipus “provokes itself to know more than it can bear or grasp.” (16)’</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The phrases in single quotes are translated by McCall from Hölderlin’s “Anmerkungen
                              zur Ödipus,” 53. This work will subsequently be referred parenthetically using the
                              abbreviation FHA.</span></div>
                     </div> By focusing on the force of this moment, McCall asserts Hölderlin’s resistance to
                     the long shadow cast upon tragedy by the kind of formal, structural device that Aristotle
                     introduces in the <em>Poetics</em> when he insists on <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> as the crucial outcome of the tragedy. Indeed, Aristotle’s formalization of tragedy
                     and its leading concept, <span class="foreign">katharsis</span>, have become so embedded within the critical discussion of tragedy that one begins
                     to suspect that what is at stake in this account of tragedy is a <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> whose task is to prevent the infection of critical interpretation by the kind of emotional
                     states (pity, fear, etc.) that this critical concept is called upon to purge from
                     tragedy, and, by so doing, secure the pleasure of a mimetic and historically transmissible
                     knowledge.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Hölderlin, by turning our attention away from such a <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> and back to the tragic, refuses the role of this structuring concept as a means of
                     re-establishing the link between knowledge and pleasure on which the origin of Aristotle’s
                     mimetic account of tragedy rests.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This return occurs in Chapter 14 of the Poetics when Aristotle states that pity and
                              fear are experienced through the mimetic portrayal of the facts of Oedipus’ history—a
                              result, Aristotle claims, that is true even if one does not see the play but only
                              hears the history of Oedipus (“it is what anyone who hears the story of Oedipus would
                              feel” [14.53b6-7]). This embedding of pity, fear and suffering in the facts of the
                              Oedipus story makes the mimetic portrayal of those facts become the source of such
                              emotions for Aristotle. As a result, they are already experienced in a manner of presentation,

                     </div> For Hölderlin, the suffering of the tragic takes a different path, one that does not
                     entertain the mediation and disappearance of sorrow through joy. Rather, this suffering
                     follows what Hölderlin refers to in his remarks on Oedipus’s exchange with Kreon as
                     a time that “tears apart.” Hölderlin writes (here cited in McCall’s stronger—Hölderlin-like
                     one might say—translation): “the true [. . .] Spirit suffers in wrathful unmeasure
                     (<span class="foreign">im zornigen Unmaas</span>), which, in destruction-joy (<span class="foreign">zerstörungsfroh</span>), only follows lacerating time” (<span class="foreign">der reissenden Zeit nur folgt</span>)”.

                              (6)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Aristotle is clear that what katharsis does is purge emotional states that are considered
                              destructive so that the pleasure resulting from this purification of the tragic is
                              alone what remains. He refers to both pity (eleos) and fear (phobos) as pathēmata
                              (Poetics 6.49b28). More significantly, in relation to Hölderlin’s remark that Oedipus
                              “suffers in wrathful unmeasure” (discussed below), Aristotle not only defines these
                              emotions in his Rhetoric as painful to the body (lupē) but, in the case of phobos,
                              he uses a word to characterize this pain, tarakhē, that signifies something which
                              is out of …</span></div>
                     </div> In this sentence, McCall’s attention falls upon the adverb, “only” in order to emphasize
                     that the tragic figure is left with nothing but time to follow. McCall writes, “the
                     hero literally ‘follows time’ by rejecting and renouncing all meanings, in such a
                     way that consciousness and self-identity cannot be consolidated, a failure that is,
                     precisely, the spirit of tragedy, the spirit of (the) time” (16). McCall’s identification
                     of this moment of failure provides the basis for a literal relation to time on the
                     condition of a rejection and renunciation of “all meanings.” It is as if time, as
                     what tears apart, has completed its task, leaving behind an empty time that Oedipus
                     can only follow now that the organization of time according to knowledge has met an
                     impasse. Such a moment provides tragedy with a moment of culmination, which, in the
                     later and Christian-influenced development of the genre, will be solidified into the
                     demand that the tragic hero must die—until such a demand begins to border on farce
                     with the arrival of the revenge tragedy and, later, the Baroque mourning-play. But,
                     in a subsequent and more precise remark, McCall recognizes that neither the rejection
                     nor renunciation of all meanings, in which this moment of culmination occurs, permits
                     the separation of time from its “tearing apart.” Accordingly, the time which tears
                     apart remains a time that has never really been separated from the “tearing” in which
                     it appears. This is because such time is not an object of knowledge but the condition
                     on which the representation of knowledge rests.

                              itself to appear in the form of an “empty transport” (FHA 16.250).</span></div>
                     </div> The rejection and renunciation of “all meanings” is therefore an act that must submit
                     to this condition with the result that it must also be renewed constantly lest this
                     rejection and renunciation of all meanings should be allowed to satisfy, albeit negatively,
                     the desire it cannot fulfill.</p>

                  <p>McCall’s reading of Oedipus’s wrath and the time it follows is undertaken in order

                     symbol and allegory” (20). In doing so, his strong and violent translation of “<span class="foreign">reissenden Zeit</span>” as “lacerating time” brings to the fore an undeveloped aspect of his reading of
                     Hölderlin’s “Remarks on Oedipus”: an experience of time that occurs as affect.

                              der Zeit’), Hölderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and shows
                              that even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated again

                              on Oedipus” and it provides the example of what tragedy both embodies and against
                              which it asserts a counter-measure: “The law, the calculation, the way in which a
                              feeling-system, man in his entirety, develops as if under the influence of the elemental,
                              and how representation, sensation and reason appear in different successions yet always
                              according to a certain law, exists in tragedy more as a state than as a succession.”
                              (FHA 16.250; translation mine).</span></div>
                     </div> Against this succession, Hölderlin distinguishes a content that the “lawful calculation”
                     cannot renounce or reject and that remains in a relation of balance to this calculation.
                     It is through the inability to renounce this content that the tragic and the elegiac
                     coincide. In what follows, I will take up this coincidence in order to question the
                     history of a genre whose embedded traditional practices—namely a recourse to the pastoral
                     and an experience of time as mourning or lamentation—have given rise to a generic
                     pattern that also aims at the <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> of emotion. If read according to this pattern, the elegy and its tradition does little
                     more than conform to the Aristotelian account of tragedy; it allows a loss to generate
                     the pleasure of mimetic knowledge by defining that loss according to the needs of
                     the historical present and the future it demands (pleasure, mimesis, etc.). But, in
                     recognizing this pattern in a genre that is older than tragedy, are we not also recognizing
                     that what Aristotle has given to the tradition of understanding tragedy is itself
                     an elegiac account that will reach its culmination in George Steiner’s <em>The Death of Tragedy</em>? If so, then the critical success of the Aristotelian account of tragedy will have
                     removed any other account of the suffering and the task of mourning within the elegiac.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Walter Benjamin’s study of the transformation of the tragic in his <em>Origin of the German Tragic Drama</em> draws attention to this removal of mourning when he remarks that “Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em> is silent on mourning as the resonance of the tragic” (<em>OGT </em>118; translation modified).

                              Benjamin does go on to observe that “modern aesthetics has often believed itself to
                              have grasped a feeling in the concept of the tragic itself” but this feeling is then
                              clarified to be the “emotional reaction [Gefühlsreaktion] to tragedy and the mourning-play”
                              (118; translation modified). What Benjamin points to here is that this removal of
                              mourning in Aristotle is not corrected in modern aesthetics, since all the latter
                              has done is to impose the emotional reaction of the audience onto the tragic, and
                              then conf…</span></div>
                     </div> This resonance, Benjamin argues, occurs nowhere with more significance than in the
                     German Baroque drama, where “mournfulness,” like Hölderlin’s “wrathful translation,”
                     registers the “enormity” at the core of Athenian tragedy. McCall alludes to this resonance
                     when, in a taxonomy of the emotional terms through which the western critical tradition
                     has confronted its own embedded meanings, he refers to Benjamin’s account of modern
                     tragic consciousness in the “mourning-plays” as “another modulation” in which “‘wrath’
                     is toned down into the less rabid but steadier <span class="foreign">Trauer</span> (mourning) and melancholy.” If this modulation is followed according to Benjamin’s
                     account of mourning as the resonance of the tragic, then tragedy is no longer conceivable
                     as a singular moment determining the value of a cultural tradition, but is rather
                     the intensification of what Hölderlin would understand as the counter-measure through
                     which history is exposed to the “time that tears apart.” In this case, since the modulation
                     between “wrath” and mourning becomes a matter of emotional intensity, the tragic “wrathful
                     unmeasure” that requires critical and historical <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> is still present in the act of mourning.</p>
               </div>
               <p>For Benjamin, the emotional experience Hölderlin links to “unmeasure” is sustained
                  across this modulation from the tragic to the mournful: he writes, “one of the laws
                  of the <span class="foreign">Trauerspiel</span>” is that “in the heart of mourning” these laws are represented in “a feeling” (<em>OGT</em> 139). Benjamin then goes on to define this feeling as something that is both “detached
                  [<span class="foreign">gelöst</span>] from any empirical subject” and is also “intimately bound to the fullness of an
                  object” (<em>OGT</em> 139; translation modified). Mourning, like wrath in Hölderlin’s “Remarks on Oedipus,”
                  is not determined by the subject (if it were, it would follow modern aesthetics when
                  it believes that it “grasps” the feeling of the tragic mimetically); rather, Benjamin
                  defines this feeling as an intention capable of a “special intensification” matched
                  only by love and how it relates to its object. The intensifying of intention through
                  mourning is the correlate of the wrath which Oedipus also suffers as the result of
                  an intention to know more than he can grasp or bear. However, in its modulation of
                  wrath, mourning has a different relation to “tearing-apart time” since it lacks the
                  rapidity with which the moment of anger appears.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the elegy, Hölderlin’s “unmeasure” can be (and has been) easily displaced into
                     an individual subject’s experience of loss, which can take the form of a death, an
                     absent lover, or the effect of exile. But, what is out of measure is not such a loss;
                     it belongs only to the past. What is out of measure is always so in the present, that
                     is, in the time that elegy dwells on through mourning and lamentation. If the significance
                     of this moment, what occurs within it, and its relation to “tearing-apart time” is
                     to be approached, then close attention should be paid to the complete sentence in
                     which Hölderlin introduces this understanding of time. Hölderlin writes: <span class="quote">‘Hence, later on, in the scene with Kreon, the wonderfully wrathful curiosity, because
                        thought, ungovernable and loaded with tragic secrets, becomes insecure, and the true
                        certain spirit suffers in wrathful unmeasure, suspicion, destruction-joy, only follows
                        lacerating time. (“Remarks on Oedipus”; translation mine).

                        </div>’</span> What is out of measure—that is, what not conform to the measured relation of reconciliation—is
                     experienced in a combination, “destruction-joy.” This combination is not only outside
                     the balance of opposed terms (joy/unhappiness), but it is also what follows a time
                     defined by the power to “rip,” “tear,” and “rupture”—all senses of the verb from which
                     the adjective “<span class="foreign">reiβend</span>” is formed. The recognition of time as something that tears arises at the moment
                     when thought becomes ungovernable and insecure—the moment when spirit suffers in “wrathful
                     unmeasure.” “Destruction-joy” alone follows such a time. As such, it remains unpurgeable,
                     since the joy that should follow from the catharsis of a destructive emotion also
                     carries destruction with it. Here, destruction is not something that already mediates
                     joy, as is the case in Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em>. Furthermore, wrath is not synonymous with this destruction either; wrath arises
                     because of the inseparability of destruction and joy in their unreconciled relation.</p>

                  <p>In his “Remarks on Oedipus,” Hölderlin refers to this tearing-apart as a wrath that

                     inward” in the human (<span class="foreign">gränzenlos die Naturmacht und des Menschen Innerstes im Zorn eins wird</span>). In describing how this boundless uniting occurs, Hölderlin uses precisely the language
                     of purification that has been used to translate Aristotle’s <span class="foreign">katharsis</span>, but he does so with entirely different effect. Hölderlin writes: “boundless union
                     purifies itself through boundless separation” (<span class="foreign">gränzenlose Eineswerden durch gränzenloses Scheiden sich reinigt</span>) (<em>FHA </em>16.257).

                              as purification, does away with the enormity (Hölderlin’s word) of the emotions. But
                              here, what Hölderlin invokes as purification is precisely what produces such an emotion
                              and does so without check; it is boundless whereas Aristotelian purification is the
                              establishment of boundary and measure as the source of meaning so that the human is
                              no longer out of step with natural force. This understanding is emphatically underscored

                     to unmeasure) can be overcome by union, that destruction can be transformed or “purified”
                     by joy, that the emotions of pity, fear, etc., can be removed by the subsequent reassertion
                     of the pleasure taken in mimetic knowledge.

                              of knowledge to katharsis in the form of clarification. Thus Leon Golden: “it is only
                              katharsis in the sense of ‘intellectual clarification’ that can provide a telos for
                              tragedy that is in harmony with the general argument of the Poetics” (447). Although
                              Golden champions this sense of katharsis, he also points out that he is not the first
                              to advance it, but is rather the most recent in a long tradition. Golden provides
                              a summary of prior accounts of the interpretation of katharsis (447-449).</span></div>
                     </div> Hölderlin’s account of a boundless union purified through boundless separation demands
                     that the joy-destruction pair occurs as irreconcilable confrontation and that this
                     confrontation is experienced in an emotional state that has no counter-resolution.
                     Such irreconcilability confirms the extent to which this relation cannot be assimilated
                     by its subject as an object of knowledge. To do so is to resolve tragic experience
                     into a historical sequence whereby joy is removed from its temporal co-presence with
                     destruction. Only through this removal can joy claim a historical time that is proper
                     to itself (historical because this moment is defined only in relation to what is temporally
                     separate from it). Hölderlin counters this <span class="foreign">kathartic</span> separation by defining the relation of destruction and joy in terms of a purification
                     that maintains rather than denies the tearing-apart of time embodied in the joy-destruction
                     pair. In short, for Hölderlin, the tragic is what witnesses a present in which two
                     forces are bound irreconcilably to one another in the same time. Separating these
                     forces and maintaining their separation is the task of a history that seeks to produce
                     an imitation of time in which both the present and its future find satisfaction in
                     the irreversible pastness of the past. Such a past would be so irretrievably lost
                     that it may always reappear in the present in the safe form of translations so much
                     less wrathful than what they translate.</p>

               <p>Despite the separation of past and present and the transformation of their “wrathful
                  unmeasure” into a mimetic as well as aesthetic pleasure through a historically oriented
                  <span class="foreign">katharsis</span>, the only means by which this separation is sustained is through mourning. Here,
                  the cathartic anticipation of pleasure turns to a form of feeling defined by relation
                  to a preceding loss. But, as Benjamin points out in a remark on the mourning-play
                  in which history and this attenuation is most at stake, the feeling of mourning counters
                  its own promise of a future in which history, as the measure of time, is restored.
                  Benjamin remarks: <span class="quote">‘Mourning is the state of mind in which feeling revives [<span class="foreign">neubelebt</span>] the empty world in the form of a mask in order to possess [<span class="foreign">haben</span>] an enigmatic satisfaction in its contemplation. Every feeling is bound to an <span class="foreign">a priori </span>object, and the representation of this object is its phenomenology. (<em>OGT</em> 139)’</span> If mourning revives an empty world in the form of a mask, it is in order to have
                  something in the world to mourn. Since mourning demands an object—its <span class="foreign">a priori</span> condition, Benjamin states—then the phenomenology we know as history is grounded
                  in a mask that stands in the place of the silence of the past. This mask may take
                  the form of either an image or a word—both of which, Benjamin notes, proliferate in
                  the mourning-plays to the point of excess or unmeasure (to use Hölderlin’s term).
                  In this proliferation the tragic appears but is not defined as something singular.
                  Benjamin writes: “what is tragic is the word <em>and</em> the silence of the past” (<em>OGT</em> 118; emphasis added). One is not present without the other. This is why Benjamin
                  also states, “There is in all mourning a tendency to silence [<span class="foreign">Sprachlösigkeit</span>] and this infinitely more than inability or reluctance to communicate. The mournful
                  feels [<span class="foreign">fühlt sich</span>] it is known through and through by the unknowable” (<em>OGT</em>, 224; translation modified). These two sentences mark the point at which Benjamin’s
                  remarks touch on the cause of Oedipus’s “wrathful measure”: to know more than he “can
                  bear or grasp.” At the same time, they touch unintentionally on the tendency that
                  defines the history of the elegy, in particular, the recurrent moment in the tradition
                  of this genre when its mourning invokes both an inability and reluctance to communicate
                  its suffering—a tendency nowhere more evident than in the ironic and anti-elegiac
                  mode that twentieth-century elegy turns to as its experience of loss. But what if
                  this recurrent moment, in which the elegy laments its own power of mourning, were
                  masking a “wrathful unmeasure” and translating it knowingly into an object of loss
                  as its cathartic act? This question marks the starting point of Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em>—the elegiac name in which wrathful unmeasure becomes mournful translation.</p>

               <p>More than any other aspect of this poem, the critical reception of Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em> has centered on the name that takes the place of Keats. This act of naming, once
                  read in the context of Benjamin’s observation, which forms the epigraph to this paper
                  (“to be named [. . .] remains perhaps always a presentiment of mourning” [<em>OGT</em>, 224]), indicates a significance quite different from those attempts to decipher
                  the name of Adonais according to the promise that such a deciphering could yield the
                  meaning of this elegy and thereby bring the critical mourning directed at this name
                  to an end. In light of Benjamin’s observation, it is important to keep in mind that
                  it is the intent of naming that contains the presentiment (<span class="foreign">Ahnung</span>) of mourning. Given Benjamin’s claim, that mourning is an intention bound to an object,
                  then the name that entitles Shelley’s poem can be understood, first, as placing the
                  elegiac in the presentiment or anticipation of such an object, and, second, as the
                  mask by which the poet “revives the empty world.” Yet, in Shelley’s case, the promise
                  of such a revival remains in question, and does so beginning with the name it is written
                  under: who or what is to be revived in the compounded name of Adonais? And, can the
                  enigmatic nature of this name still produce the satisfaction that, in accordance to
                  the expectations of elegiac tradition, successfully sustains a phenomenology that
                  speaks for the silence of death?</p>

                  <p>The preceding questions have surfaced in the reception of <em>Adonais</em> through the tendency to read Shelley’s elegy either as a failure or as an act of writing
                     that the elegiac can barely survive. Of the first, the most exemplary is the judgment
                     of W. H. Auden (who otherwise lauded the success of poets in writing elegies) that <em>Adonais</em> is “the only elegy I know of which seems to me a failure” (147). Auden’s measure of
                     failure indicates that this elegy is a singular example in the genre (rather than
                     the object of Auden’s repeated antipathy to Shelley). If the context in which Auden’s
                     judgment is expressed provides any clue, what constitutes such a failure appears to
                     be a mournfulness that exceeds its subject.

                              language that is “subdued in tone and matter of fact in subject-matter” (114n.25)—if
                              the examples of elegies he includes in A Certain World are any indication of elegies
                              that do not fail.</span></div>
                     </div> Peter Sacks, who places <em>Adonais</em> at the limit of elegiac writing, is less restrained in describing such an excess when
                     he writes that “<em>Adonais</em> marks an extremity that no later elegy would reach” (165). Both Auden and Sacks react
                     to an “unmeasure” in <em>Adonais</em>. While this unmeasure is the clear sign of a failure for Auden, it is not so clear
                     in the case of Sacks who, despite recognizing an extremity that threatens the genre,
                     still allows Shelley to have accomplished many of the goals embedded in the elegiac
                     tradition, including what is perhaps the most important of these goals: “[Shelley]
                     has expressed and purged his anger” (165). The admission of “tragic” language here,
                     as well as the vocabulary of Aristotle’s account of tragedy (purgation), indicates
                     how much Sacks still retains the “lawful calculation” through which tragedy has been
                     read despite the evidence of its texts, not to mention Hölderlin’s corrective which
                     McCall brings to the fore in his account of the former’s “wrathful” translations.
                     But if an inability to experience anything other than this “lawful calculation” is
                     the result of Shelley’s elegy, even when it goes to the edge of its own ruin, then
                     the affective moment that Hölderlin identifies as central to tragic experience and
                     its account of time would also be removed. In the more exacting terms of Benjamin’s
                     account of mourning, this pattern removes the intensification of intention in the
                     elegy, which is not the same thing as the achievement of that intention or its near
                     destruction. In both these cases, the temporal relation between the object of suffering
                     and the language of mourning in which that suffering takes place would be obscured.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Sacks recognizes the danger of achieving the intention of elegy when he makes this
                  achievement the extremity at whose edge Shelley stands. Yet, it is Sacks who drives
                  Shelley to this extremity before pulling back into the kind of figurative solace that
                  follows from the threat of ruin. Only in the hypothetical substitution of intention
                  and object in the act of mourning, and after the subsequent rejection of that hypothesis,
                  can Sacks still preserve the historical tradition of elegy. Sacks writes: Shelley’s
                  “mourning imagination, its apparently literal rather than literary thrust [. . .]
                  draws him on to what all mourners need to avoid—their own drive beyond life and beyond
                  language whose detours and saving distances keep them alive” (165). The moment of
                  hesitancy in this account of Shelley’s extremity is pronounced. Shelley’s “mourning
                  imagination” is “<em>apparently</em> literal,” and this is not the only moment of hesitation expressed by Sacks as he
                  seeks to protect the “literary thrust” from what appears to be an equally thrust-like
                  “drive beyond life.” In the preceding sentence, Sacks writes: “Shelley insists on
                  what <em>seems</em> to be a literal rather than a figurative identification with the consolatory image”
                  (167; emphasis added). Sacks’s remarks all tend towards an account of mourning that
                  protects the subject from too close an identification with its object, lest it succumb
                  to what it mourns. But, in doing so, Sacks’s rhetorical use of “seems” and “apparently”
                  indicates that the extremity he attributes to Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em> still falls within the realm of an intention that cannot quite be fulfilled. This
                  does not mean that the image Sacks refers to as “consolatory” can be resurrected in
                  order to save Shelley’s elegy from its extremity. The issue sidestepped here is the
                  one Benjamin points to: mourning can only produce such an image because the world
                  it refers to is an empty one. To argue that the purpose of the elegy, and with it
                  the literary, is to preserve the significance of figurative language by locating the
                  elegiac in a world whose transport of meaning is not empty but merely lost or missing.
                  Loss is the figure that has been embedded in the historical tradition of the elegiac
                  mourning as the guarantee that its literary mode—its mournful language—will not miss
                  the mark even as it fails to attain its object. On this point, Sacks again hesitates
                  despite the confidence with which the communal “we” is assumed: “we recognize now
                  how thoroughly he has driven his version of the genre <em>to the brink of its own ruin</em>” (167; emphasis added).</p>
               <p>To go to the brink is not to cross to the other side. Like the loss that elegy places
                  before itself, the promise of transcendence and reconciliation that should flow from
                  this loss is the name of an extremity that occurs neither in the world nor beyond
                  it. The time of such extremity is always the present. The hesitation of Sacks’s reading
                  is the effect of this extremity, even when all that remains is an intent to preserve
                  a model of mourning in which the subject derives mimetic or figurative consolation
                  in the image it produces for its own contemplation. To literalize this image is, on
                  the one hand, as Sacks points out, to attempt to go beyond it, but, on the other hand,
                  to take this image as the sign of the literary is also to literalize it in order to
                  define literature as nothing less than a phenomenology of language whose purpose is
                  to protect us from an empty world. This world responds with silence to the images
                  of loss and transcendence thrust before it. Such silence is the only witness to an
                  empty world that stands apart from the names through which it is addressed and through
                  which the elegy intensifies the intention of mourning. When Benjamin locates this
                  intention in the act of naming that also contains a presentiment of mourning, he gives
                  it an intention that drives it toward the object as its meaning, but this drive only
                  intensifies the separation in which the promise of all intentional acts is preserved.
                  Mourning exposes the extremity of naming in the empty silence of the world’s response
                  to such naming. To mourn one must name, but such naming stands apart from the dangerous
                  possibility of a translation that achieves an over-identification and an over-determination
                  of its source. This is precisely what happens when emptiness is figured as the sign
                  of loss or transcendence: the same silence triggers the possibility of both. As if
                  to work against this figuration, Benjamin gives one more twist to this relation between
                  naming and the presentiment of mourning when he states that such a presentiment is
                  even more present when naming is replaced by reading: <span class="quote">‘To be named [. . .] remains perhaps always a presentiment of mourning. But how much
                     more so not to be named, <em>only read rather, read uncertainly</em> by the allegorist [<span class="foreign">nicht benannt, sondern nur gelesen, unsicher durch den Allegoriker gelesen</span>], and to have become highly significant only through him. (<em>OGT</em> 225; emphasis added, trans. modified)’</span> In order to function as a more significant presentiment of mourning, the task of
                  reading must proceed uncertainly, or without safety (both senses of <span class="foreign">unsicher</span>). It is here that Keats, in not being named by Shelley, is preserved as the object
                  of an intention that guards against any <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> even as that intention employs the embedded traditions of elegy but within a sense
                  of time that counters the historical succession implied in such traditions.</p>

               <p>It is not the name of Keats that marks the historical loss against which this poem
                  contends, but a name combined (in no particular order of importance) of a Greek mythological
                  figure, Adonis; the Hebrew word, a<em>donai</em> (lord or ruler), used to address the divine in the place of a proper name; the Greek
                  word for nightingale <span class="foreign">aēdōn</span>, which if not for the long <span class="foreign">ē</span> would be an exact homophone for the <span class="foreign">adōn</span> of Adonis; and finally the Greek sound of lament, “<span class="foreign">ai</span>.” The role of these different elements in determining the meaning of Shelley’s poem
                  has been a subject of considerable critical concern, even anxiety, as indicated by
                  the recurring attempts to explain why Shelley coined the name “Adonais” as title to
                  this elegy. The anxiety that drives this concern is how to decide among these four
                  choices so that the challenge posed by Shelley’s invented name can be resolved; namely,
                  the challenge of locating an addressee as the meaning of the poem rather than its

                     reference point, as a recent essay indicates by its enlisting of an extensive, associative

                     no more persuasive an argument than the absence of any evidence documenting Shelley’s
                     knowledge of Hebrew.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See, H.J. Jackson’s “The ‘ai’ in Adonais.” Jackson argues for a “dislodging” of the
                              Hebrew adonai from “its current domination of the field” (782) by isolating two elements:
                              the Greek word for nightingale, “adōn” [sic] and the presence of the Greek sound of
                              lament, “ai,” used by Shelley in other works, notably Prometheus Unbound. Having done
                              so, Jackson calls in the plural form of the Greek word “adōnes” thus handily accounting
                              for the stray “s” that comes after “ai” sound of lamentation: adon-ai-s/adon-e-s.
                              If we disregard the philological inexactitude of eliding the Greek spelling of the

                     </div> What is at stake here is the desire to resolve the absence of any verifiable indirect—never
                     mind direct—naming of its addressee, or, in other words, to return propriety to what
                     appears in the form of a proper name. In this respect, the challenge embodied in the
                     name Adonais functions in relation to Keats in the same way that <span class="foreign">adonai</span> does in relation to Yahweh in the Hebrew Old Testament: both name what cannot appear
                     in itself and certainly not in the time in which this naming occurs. In both cases,
                     what is emphasized is the temporality of address, which is precisely the question
                     that informs Shelley’s engagement with the elegiac across this poem, not just in its
                     title. In contrast to this question, the dislodging of <span class="foreign">adonai</span>, or even its appropriation in the name of evoking symbolic archetypes (as in Wasserman),
                     become examples of a restrictive reading that is more confident than Shelley of how
                     and where the elegiac can place its subject.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Before any ascribing of meaning to <span class="foreign">adonai</span>, the presence of this word in Shelley’s title complicates the traditional use of
                     a classical name in order to evoke a setting (above all, classical Greek pastoral)
                     that promises a transmutation of the mournful task that defines the elegiac. In this
                     respect, the name Adonais is not comparable to Milton’s substitution of an already-existing
                     classical name, Lycidas, for his drowned friend, Edward King. Yet, already in Milton’s
                     substitution it is possible to discern the task that the name Adonais exposes in the
                     classically influenced elegiac tradition: translation, namely, the transposition of
                     a subject into a name whose existence invokes the solace of an idealized world. Two
                     senses of translation are involved in this task in its classical adoption: the prevailing
                     modern use of this word which involves the task of finding one word for another across
                     linguistic boundaries, and the etymological sense of a transfer from one location
                     to another.

                              terminology, where it is used to describe the transfer, for example, of a bishop from
                              one diocese to another. </span></div>
                     </div> This second sense has figured prominently in the elegy as a means of invoking a literary
                     setting and a place in which human life is no longer defined by the complications
                     of its temporality. Such a sense gives the elegy its generic tendency to relocate
                     death in a topography, a tendency that survives its classical models—as is the case
                     with Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” in which even the act of writing
                     an elegy, never mind the subject it addresses, is translated into a very specific
                     space. Within this tradition, the difference Shelley introduces in the name “Adonais”
                     is to pose the central question that informs elegiac writing: how and where to locate
                     the name this writing invokes so that it may translate what Benjamin calls “the empty
                     mask of mourning” into a figure for an idealized object and, in so doing, transform
                     the loss and mourning occasioned by this mask as if it were an object of satisfying
                     contemplation.</p>

                     to affirm an aspect of the Hebrew use of <span class="foreign">adonai</span> as the generalized issue from which Shelley’s elegy proceeds: the impropriety of a
                     name that never had or no longer has a temporal subject. The effect of this issue
                     is immediately present in the second line of Shelley’s poem as Shelley diverges from
                     the repetition that occurs in Bion’s “Epitaph on Adonis.” Where Bion’s announcement
                     of his own mourning is followed by the repeated antiphonal response “Fair Adonis is
                     dead” made by the “Loves,” Shelley’s version takes a different turn. No antiphonal
                     response is made to his mourning as a means of affirming that mourning. Instead, Shelley
                     gives a command to mourn:</p>
               </div>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">I weep for Adonis—he is dead!</div>
                     <div class="l">O, weep for Adonis! (1-2)</div>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Already the task faced by this elegy can be discerned in its the opening declaration
                     as “I weep” is interrupted in the second line when its verb is suspended subjectless
                     and the subject, “I,” is replaced by the interjection “O” which stands in the place
                     where the subject formerly stood (I weep / O, weep). The tenuous hold of a subject
                     on this elegy is only increased by the imperative. To whom is it addressed? The subsequent
                     lines provide some clarification when Shelley identifies a universalized “we” whose
                     answer to the command, “weep,” are tears that remain ineffective: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="indent4">though our tears</div>
                           <div class="l">Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head! (2-3)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> From the very beginning of Shelley’s elegy, the task of mourning is not a facile unbinding
                     or recovery of life from death; it is not, in this case, a project that aims at a
                     successful figuration of death in a mask that the living demand to contemplate even
                     if it operates under that imperative. This is why the empty “O” of the second line
                     can be read in the place of the “I” from which elegy and the experience of loss proceeds
                     and never more so than when it is falsely figured in a collective experience on whose
                     behalf the poet claims to speak. This interjected “O” also has its own role to play
                     in this elegy of displaced beginnings. Following immediately upon the word “dead”
                     at the end of the first line, the second line which makes the command to weep begins
                     with a letter that suggests there is something else displaced in this poem’s address
                     to death, and like the title, <em>Adonais</em>, it is a matter of a letter. As observed above, the second word of the second line
                     is again “weep” but the place of “I” in the first line is occupied by a letter which
                     stands facing us with an emptiness that points to its failure to symbolize the death
                     this elegy addresses. Absent from this “O” is the line that transforms it into <span class="foreign">theta</span> (Θ) which, when used alone, stands for the Greek word for death, Θανατος (<span class="foreign">thanatos</span>).

                              reference to death, occurs in a citation attributed to Plato which forms the first

                     </div> And, lest we miss the play of these letters, its least obvious one (the absent <span class="foreign">theta</span>) is precisely what occurs at the beginning of the immediate following phrase (“<em>th</em>ough”) and the opening word of the next line (“<em>Th</em>aw”).

                     that runs “I [. . .] O [. . .] Th [Θ] [. . .]”: the subject’s address to death (“I
                     weep for Adonis—he is dead”), the interruption of that address by an interjection
                     and command that does not identify the subject to which it is addressed, then the
                     obscured appearance of what has been displaced all along but to which the poem is
                     bound: death. Death, which occasions the subject of this elegy, does not appear, but
                     is separated and dispersed so that it unbinds the traditional pattern of elegy in
                     a way that does not presume that it, its language, or its images, can be taken for
                     granted. The fate of this latter element, the image, is forcefully present as a result
                     of the “frost” that holds the head of Adonais in its bind in the form an unidentifiable
                     figure, “head,” that not only remains torn apart from the tears it provokes, but also
                     provides the sole bodily part in which the subject of the poem’s address is figured.</p>
               </div>
               <p>From this opening, it is clear that what Auden calls this poem’s failure is not a
                  failing, nor is it an exercise to be made subordinate to a spirit that cannot be measured.
                  After the displacement of the poet in the first two lines and the recognition that
                  our tears cannot thaw the frost that now binds Adonais to the figure of a head, the
                  poem turns to time in the form of a “sad Hour” as one whose mourning should offer
                  more than has been achieved so far. But, as it turns out, this Hour, in order to mourn,
                  needs to be instructed in the art of lawful calculation and its repeatability: </p>

               <p> The Hour addressed by Shelley is both one of the <span class="foreign">Hōrai</span>, the goddesses of the seasons in whom time is figured as nature, and an address to
                  something more than such a measure of time since this “sad Hour” is “selected from
                  all years.” It is not just part of a generalized cycle repeated each year. In addition
                  this “Hour” is distinguished from “all years,” that is, it is distinguished from any
                  measure of time and from any claim to completion resonant in the word “all.” In this
                  respect, it has more in common with the sense of <span class="foreign">hōra</span> as the specific moment in which the time for something to happen has come (the “hour
                  has arrived,” for example). What is invoked in line 4 of <em>Adonais</em> is such an hour, but what arrives with it is not the measure of time but time defined
                  as an affect: it is a “sad Hour.” This “hour” stands apart from “all years”; it is
                  a time called upon to mourn the loss that the poet identifies with in the second line
                  when he writes of “our tears.” For this mourning to occur, the “sad Hour” is given
                  three tasks by the poet: first, “rouse thy obscure compeers”; second, “teach them
                  thine own sorrow”; third, in order to fulfill this second imperative, “say: with me
                  /Died Adonais.” What is revealed in these lines is that the poet must not only instruct
                  the “sad Hour” about how to teach a sorrow that is intensively identified with that
                  Hour (“thine own”) but must also communicate what is at stake in this mourning: that
                  the time of an event—Adonais’s death—must stand with a significance that is not given
                  by such a measure of historical time. The disjunction which appears here is amplified
                  in the closing lines of this first stanza when Shelley voices the sentiment that Adonais’s
                  fate and fame “shall be an echo and a light unto eternity,” but then binds this sentiment
                  to a future that “dares to forget the past.” The inevitability of this binding has
                  already been expressed in the words through which the sorrow of the “sad Hour” is
                  to teach its own sorrow to its “obscure compeers”: “with me / Adonais died.” In this
                  phrase, the time of mourning and the time of the event it addresses are made contiguous
                  by means of a spatial and temporal metonymy. In this metonymy, two unreconciled senses
                  of time are forced to stand in balance with one another: the moment of an event (Adonais’s
                  death) and the experience of that event. Together these form the emotional affect
                  from which Shelley’s elegy proceeds.</p>
               <p>What already surfaces through the figure of the “sad Hour” is taken up by the second
                  figure Shelley invokes, except on this occasion the focus is no longer <em>time</em> but shifts to <em>place</em> in relation to Adonais’s death. Shelley asks at the beginning of the second stanza:
                  </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               </blockquote>
               <p> Repeated here is the disjunction in which the elegy originates and to which one of
                  its strongest thematic strains seeks to return: the coincidence of place and experience.
                  Also repeated is the obscurity of comparison evoked by reference to “compeers” in
                  the first stanza. This obscurity resurfaces here when the event that defines the elegiac,
                  death, is described as occurring “in darkness,” in what remains obscure because it
                  cannot be seen. Yet, the fate achieved in this darkness is also what is meant to become
                  “an echo and light unto eternity.” The disjunctive conjunction of the darkness of
                  the event with the assertion of a light that the future will at some point dare to
                  extinguish also extends to the solitary Echo who “rekindles faint melodies” in this
                  passage. This rekindling, as a form of repetition, not only recalls the imperative
                  to teach that Shelley gives to the “sad Hour” in the first stanza; it is also present
                  when Shelley answers here his own question, “Where was Urania when Adonis died?” and
                  tells us where she was as well as what she was doing: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               </blockquote>
               <p> With veiled eyes, Urania is surrounded by Echoes who, contrary to their name, are
                  not being listened to but are themselves the listeners. By reversing the expected
                  order, the lawful calculation that defines the place of an echo, Shelley not only
                  separates the echo from the event of a sound in which it originates, but also puts
                  these Echoes in the position of waiting to have a sound to echo. But, no such sound
                  occurs. Instead, one Echo repeats already-heard sounds, “fading melodies,” that mask
                  the arrival of death which comes, not with sound or visibility (the shaft that kills
                  flies in darkness), but with “bulk,” the “bulk of death.” The clash between sound—its
                  lightness of breath, its repetitions, and its melodiousness—with the bulk of death
                  not only brings a condition that cannot be repeated into a scene filled with repetitions
                  that are given no origin, but it also sets up this scene as one that already mocks—“like
                  flowers that mock the corse beneath”—the event that is about to arrive.</p>
               <p>The disjunction fuelled by this mockery will later force Urania to the recognition
                  that her mourning is driven by an identification to which she is doubly bound and
                  to which she gives voice in her address to the dead Adonais: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="indent4">I would give</div>
                     <div class="l">All that I am to be as thou now art!</div>
                     <div class="l">But I am chained to Time and cannot thence depart. (232-34)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The time to which Urania is chained contains both the demand for identification as
                  well as its denial. To become Adonais is to become the bulk that no sound, no word,
                  and no name can achieve without first relinquishing the meaning and destroying the
                  intention of that identification. The effect of this situation on the task of elegy
                  is already recognized by Shelley when, in one of his few direct interjections into
                  this poem, he remarks: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Alas! That all we loved of him should be,</div>
                     <div class="l">But for our grief, as if it had not been,</div>
                     <div class="l">And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!</div>
                     <div class="l">Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene</div>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Only in the echo of grief does the past have a time in which to be present; otherwise,
                  as Shelley observes, the living will be as if they had not been. Shelley goes on to
                  note that this present, this grief, is bound by the same condition that makes grief
                  possible in the first place: mortality. The result of this condition is that the address
                  expressed in grief is separated from what it would address by the presence of a mortality
                  within that same address. The “I” who weeps at the very beginning of <em>Adonais</em> now becomes the source and object of the suffering as it fails to find its proper
                  destination in a name that has always kept its impropriety. On the heels of this recognition,
                  there then arrives the arrest of knowledge Hölderlin locates in the wrath of Oedipus:
                  “Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene the actors or spectators?” Bereft of
                  a place of departure and bereft of a reason to guard the possibility of such a place,
                  Shelley can only account for the past as a scene, a performance that allows no decision
                  as to whether one is its actor or spectator. Such a decision presumes a knowledge
                  that can be grasped and calculated in the form of a history that can be repeated and
                  purified in that repetition.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When such purification or catharsis is not possible, the question of who mourns and
                     for what comes to the fore. It does so precisely because the elegy mourns for the
                     scene it produces as if it were a past that could be reenacted or translated into
                     another place, another time. Here, the full force of the name of Shelley’s elegy is
                     felt but not simply for its challenge to the critical demand that has taken hold of
                     genre: whence is it and why? What is at stake in this name, Adonais, is that it is
                     more flower than “corse.”

                     </div> To read Adonais as more “corse” than “flower” would be, according to Benjamin’s account
                     of mourning, to remain unnamed since it is only from the name that mourning can arise
                     (“To be named [. . .] remains perhaps always a presentiment of mourning”). To demand
                     the body of Keats as the subject of this elegy’s name is to misunderstand that we
                     mourn for the name that remains, for the name whose meaning is granted by the death
                     of what it names in its act of naming. Such naming points to an experience of death
                     in the only form that this experience can take: a presentiment of mourning. As another
                     poet, this time one who takes the name of Adonis, writes in a poem addressing yet
                     another unnamed poet, such a death is always preceded by a word, its name. It is for
                     the name of such a word that we mourn and, as these lines by Adonis recognize, it
                     is in the necessity of that mourning that the tragic remains, as long as we do not
                     forget McCall’s admonition and mistake the painting for a mirror:</p>

               The second epigraph to this paper is the concluding sentence of McCall’s “Wrathful
               Translation.” McCall had first written about Hölderlin’s translations in his doctoral
               thesis at Yale. This thesis, “Allegories of Translation: Hölderlin’s Translations
               of Sophocles,” was completed in 1987 under the direction of J. Hillis Miller. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">This return occurs in Chapter 14 of the <em>Poetics</em> when Aristotle states that pity and fear are experienced through the mimetic portrayal
               of the facts of Oedipus’ history—a result, Aristotle claims, that is true even if
               one does not see the play but only hears the history of Oedipus (“it is what anyone
               who hears the story of Oedipus would feel” [14.53b6-7]). This embedding of pity, fear
               and suffering in the facts of the Oedipus story makes the mimetic portrayal of those
               facts become the source of such emotions for Aristotle. As a result, they are already
               experienced in a manner of presentation, mimesis, which, from almost the very beginning
               of the <em>Poetics</em>, is defined in terms of producing pleasure. Aristotle speaks of pleasure as a universal
               effect of mimesis: “everyone takes joy in what is mimetic” (<span class="foreign">to khairen tois mimēmasi pantas</span>) (4.48b8-9). In this respect, the mimetic account of tragedy has already purged such
               emotions as pity and fear, leaving only the introduction and identification of a formal
               moment (the Aristotelian <span class="foreign">katharsis</span>) to authorize this purification as a structural device.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Aristotle is clear that what <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> does is purge emotional states that are considered destructive so that the pleasure
               resulting from this purification of the tragic is alone what remains. He refers to
               both pity (<span class="foreign">eleos</span>) and fear (<span class="foreign">phobos</span>) as <span class="foreign">pathēmata</span> (<em>Poetics </em>6.49b28). More significantly, in relation to Hölderlin’s remark that Oedipus “suffers
               in wrathful unmeasure” (discussed below), Aristotle not only defines these emotions
               in his <em>Rhetoric</em> as painful to the body (<span class="foreign">lupē</span>) but, in the case of <span class="foreign">phobos</span>, he uses a word to characterize this pain, <span class="foreign">tarakhē</span>, that signifies something which is out of order with respect to the body and to the
               mind (<span class="foreign">Estō dē ho phobos lupē tis ē tarakhē</span>) (<em>Ars Rhetorica </em>2.5).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">In the “Remarks on Oedipus,” Hölderlin speaks of a similar moment in terms of the
               caesura which, within the succession of representations within a work, allows representation
               itself to appear in the form of an “empty transport” (<em>FHA</em> 16.250).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">McCall’s main remarks focus on time in Hölderlin’s translation of “Zeus” as “<span class="foreign">Vater der Zeit</span>” (“Wrathful Translation,” 4-20), and do so in order to indicate that “by treating
               the proper name (Greek ‘Zeus’) as a common name that must be translated (‘<span class="foreign">Vater der Zeit</span>’), Hölderlin’s example undoes a fundamental linguistic distinction and shows that
               even the god—that most proper of all entities—has to be re-denominated again and again”
               (7).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Hölderlin’s account of this “lawful calculation” occurs at the beginning of his “Remarks
               on Oedipus” and it provides the example of what tragedy both embodies and against
               which it asserts a counter-measure: “The law, the calculation, the way in which a
               feeling-system, man in his entirety, develops as if under the influence of the elemental,
               and how representation, sensation and reason appear in different successions yet always
               according to a certain law, exists in tragedy more as a state than as a succession.”
               (<em>FHA</em> 16.250; translation mine).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">This work will subsequently be referred parenthetically using the abbreviation <em>OGT</em>. Benjamin does go on to observe that “modern aesthetics has often believed itself
               to have grasped a feeling in the concept of the tragic itself” but this feeling is
               then clarified to be the “emotional reaction [<span class="foreign">Gefühlsreaktion</span>] to tragedy and the mourning-play” (118; translation modified). What Benjamin points
               to here is that this removal of mourning in Aristotle is not corrected in modern aesthetics,
               since all the latter has done is to impose the emotional reaction of the audience
               onto the tragic, and then confuse this reaction with what occurs in the events of
               the drama. This appropriation of the tragic by modern aesthetics does not therefore
               grasp the place of mourning in the tragic. As Benjamin subsequently observes with
               respect to the <span class="foreign">Trauerspiel</span>, whose name invokes mourning, “these are not so much the plays which cause mourning
               as plays in which mournfulness finds satisfaction: plays [that take place] before
               the mournful” (119).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">In Hölderlin’s words: “<span class="foreign">Daher in der Scene mit Kreon nachher der Argwohn, weil der unbändige, und von traurigen
                  Geheimnissen beladene Gedanke unsicher wird, und der treue gewisse Geist im zornigen
                  Unmass leidet, das, zerstörungsfroh, der reiβenden Zeit nur folgt</span>” (<em>FHA</em> 16.253).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">The shift away from the purification of Aristotelian tragedy is completed here. <span class="foreign">Katharsis</span>, as purification, does away with the enormity (Hölderlin’s word) of the emotions.
               But here, what Hölderlin invokes as purification is precisely what produces such an
               emotion and does so without check; it is boundless whereas Aristotelian purification
               is the establishment of boundary and measure as the source of meaning so that the
               human is no longer out of step with natural force. This understanding is emphatically
               underscored by Hölderlin when he changes a citation from the tenth-century Byzantine
               encyclopedia, the <em>Suda</em>, in which it is stated “that Aristotle was nature’s scribe, dipping the quill into
               meaning” (<span class="foreign">Hoti Aristotelēs tēs phuseōs grammateus ēn, ton kalamon apobrekhōn </span> <em><span style="text-decoration:underline">eis noun</span></em>). In Hölderlin’s version, Aristotle is omitted, and the act that links meaning to
               nature (and which is directly relevant to what Hölderlin says immediately prior this
               phrase when he speaks of natural force and what is most inner to the human) becomes
               a well-intentioned act: “Nature’s scribe, dipping the well-meaning quill” (<span class="foreign">ton kalamon apobrekhōn </span> <em><span style="text-decoration:underline">eunoun</span></em>) thus relieving Aristotle of his reputation as the one who unites nature and meaning
               in language. The original phrase from the <em>Suda</em> is cited in <em>FHA </em>16.257n. Hölderlin also addressed the relation of anger and purification in the poem,
               “Ganymede”; Hölderlin writes, “<span class="foreign">Im Zorne reinigt aber / Sich der Gefesselte nun, nun eilt er</span>” (But now in anger the restrained one purifies itself, now hurries).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">A later critical-historical interpretation of <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> will emphasize the significance of knowledge to <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> in the form of clarification. Thus Leon Golden: “it is only katharsis in the sense
               of ‘intellectual clarification’ that can provide a telos for tragedy that is in harmony
               with the general argument of the Poetics” (447). Although Golden champions this sense
               of <span class="foreign">katharsis</span>, he also points out that he is not the first to advance it, but is rather the most
               recent in a long tradition. Golden provides a summary of prior accounts of the interpretation
               of <span class="foreign">katharsis</span> (447-449).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Rachel Wetzsteon observes that Auden’s preference in elegy appears to run toward a
               language that is “subdued in tone and matter of fact in subject-matter” (114n.25)—if
               the examples of elegies he includes in <em>A Certain World</em> are any indication of elegies that do not fail.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">The following remarks on the opening lines of Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em> form part of larger study of both this poem and the elegiac in general—forthcoming
               under the title, <em>Taking Leave: Exile and the Modern Elegy</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">See Earl Wasserman’s <em>The Subtler Language </em>(285-361) and <em>Shelley: A Critical Reading</em> (462-502).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">See, H.J. Jackson’s “The ‘ai’ in Adonais.” Jackson argues for a “dislodging” of the
               Hebrew <span class="foreign">adonai</span> from “its current domination of the field” (782) by isolating two elements: the Greek
               word for nightingale, “<span class="foreign">adōn</span>” [sic] and the presence of the Greek sound of lament, “ai,” used by Shelley in other
               works, notably <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. Having done so, Jackson calls in the plural form of the Greek word “<span class="foreign">adōn</span>es” thus handily accounting for the stray “s” that comes after “ai” sound of lamentation:
               adon-ai-s/adon-e-s. If we disregard the philological inexactitude of eliding the Greek
               spelling of the word for nightingale from <span class="foreign">aēdōn</span> to <span class="foreign">adōn</span> then perhaps this would be, as Jackson says, the “least controversial of the other
               suggestions” (meaning one suggestion in particular, the Hebrew “adonai”). A more measured
               account of the presence of the nightingale in the name Adonais is given by Kelvin
               Everest in “Shelly’s <em>Adonais</em> and John Keats.” Everest rightly notes that the presence of <span class="foreign">aēdōn</span> in Adonis is more in the manner of a pun and cites Socrates’ etymologies in Plato’s
               <em>Cratylus</em> in order to show how similarity in sound is confused with etymological relation.
               The connection between Keats and the name Adonais on the basis of <span class="foreign">aēdōn</span> remains a thematic argument that requires either the general association of poetry
               with the song of the nightingale, or else the evocation of Keats’s famous ode, which,
               beyond its title, does not address the nightingale again by its name—an aspect of
               the ode that draws attention to the question of naming posed by the title of Shelley’s
               elegy for Keats. Beyond this ode, the word “nightingale” occurs thirteen times in
               the whole of Keats’s poetry, and mostly does so in poems which are less than memorable.
               Only in <em>Endymion</em> does the word occur more than once.
