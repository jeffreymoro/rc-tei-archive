               <p>The writings and distinctive philosophical approach of Stanley Cavell have garnered
                  an increasing amount of sustained attention in edited collections over the past several
                  years.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Viewed as a whole, this scholarship takes stock of Cavell’s career in helpfully descriptive
                  and evaluative terms, surveying the astonishing range of his thought in discrete chapters
                  of interpretive overview. An important trend one can sense in this work is literary
                  studies’ collective act of redress. By contrast to an earlier generation of literary
                  responses to Cavell still left ungathered, if not exactly repressed, there has been
                  a belatedly full recognition not only of Cavell’s role in the survival of a subjective
                  voice in twentieth-century philosophy where it once stood in danger of being lost,

                  </div> but also of Cavell’s truly major existing and potential contributions to literary
                  studies as such—his dedication to a project of thinking toward the fundamental “claim”
                  of the literary in (and on) all rational conceptual thinking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In an important essay published in 2009 in the journal <em>New Literary History</em>, Toril Moi contends that “[t]he poststructuralist understanding of language, meaning,
                  and interpretation has become the unspoken doxa of the humanities” (802). And because
                  of this disciplinary preference for treating language as a “concept” rather than as
                  a practice via examples (818), Moi holds, “it is no coincidence that almost all the
                  books on Cavell that have appeared since 1989 have been written by philosophers and
                  not by literary critics” (802).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In their introduction to Stanley Cavell and Literary Studies, Eldridge and Rhie also
                           remark on the neglect of Cavell’s thought by literary critics (2). They attribute
                           such ambivalence toward, or overlooking of, Cavell, to misconceptions about the meaning
                           of “ordinary language” and to widespread theoretical resistance to his unreconstructed
                           humanism (4); I take up the second of these issues toward the end of my essay in this
                           collection.</span></div>
                  </div> Literary scholars may not have yet produced many of the books. But is the absence
                  of single-author studies headlined by Cavell in fact due to our poststructuralist
                  antipathy to his mode of proceeding? I don’t think so. A handful of significant recent
                  books by literary scholars of British Romantic studies (primarily among “theory”-heavy
                  Romanticists at home in Saussure’s realm of language-as-“concept”) evince closeness
                  to Cavell by dropping at seemingly any point into the out-of-school genre of the sudden,
                  urgent dialogue with his thought for a run of key pages. Often these conversations
                  take place in the conceptually meaty introductions; and sometimes, as it were, they
                  come nearer to the bone by virtue of lying outside the study proper, in the acknowledgments.
                  I suspect there are many lines of inquiry in current British Romantic studies that
                  without Cavell would not only not <em>mean</em> in just the same way, but would not have come to <em>be</em>. We cannot recall and test all the ideas and durable impulses in our scholarly life
                  for their ultimate source, but, to steal from Wordsworth’s non-calculating acknowledgement
                  of debt in <em>The Prelude</em>, a lot of the water—way downstream now, fanning out in all directions—comes from
                  yon fountain.

               <p>I am not the first commentator to note a basic alignment—in many ways, in effect,
                  post-Kantianism—discernible between Cavell’s deployment of Romanticism and the critical-philosophical
                  project of Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy in <em>The Literary Absolute</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           ‘romanticism’ (his inverted commas) found in Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, and questions
                           Cavell’s Emersonian Romanticism as an expression of privileged American exceptionalism.
                           For a very different judgment of (Cavell’s) Emerson, see Arsic; Ong shares a different
                           approach to Cavell’s America—“unleavened” (as in a condition of migration or exile)
                           and “broken” (as is bread)—through his recounting of the experience of his father.</span></div>
                  </div> Yet beyond his major American subjects of Thoreau and Emerson, there still is little
                  published scholarship that engages Cavell’s thought at extended, close range with
                  Romanticism as the moment that matters so much to him: the “perfectionist” moment
                  that comes after religion, but before philosophy.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Exceptions to this characterization can be found in Desmond, Duffy, and Rudrum. Gerald
                           L. Bruns, On Ceasing to be Human, is organized around Cavellian questions in connection
                           with continental theory, and takes an approach companionate with mine here.</span></div>
                  </div> This gap involves, too, at another related level of critical reception, the need for
                  future literary-critical studies based in British Romanticism as a historical body
                  of literature on which Cavell has performed several bravura readings to date. The
                  present collection attempts to provide a hinge, moving between the record of Cavell’s
                  engagement with British Romantic texts and newly staged speculations and interventions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The field for such encounters is rich, due to the staggering ability of Cavell’s writing
               at once to generate ideas and to give pause. For Romanticists, the many interests
               of Cavell’s work include not only the pervasive concern with knowing and modern skepticism
               across all his books, but also topics as divergent as understanding and incomprehensibility,
               acknowledgment, denial, withholding and secrecy, responsibility, forgiveness, gender,
               melodrama, horror, monstrousness, therapy, cinematic ontology, religion, secularity,
               and spectatorship. Yet two points of emphasis are persistent to any reader across
               his books: these are the idea of skepticism as an unappeasable predicament one does
               not solve but <em>lives</em> (skepticism as a problem whose “answer does not consist in denying the conclusion
               of skepticism but in reconceiving its truth” [<em>The Senses of Walden</em> 133]); and the discovery that acknowledgement and avoidance are primary human orientations
               (often to be construed through their equally human denial), with regard to which knowledge
               and ignorance (the more visible and epistemologically privileged terms) offer themselves
               rather as secondary formalizations—or even as evasions. There is a methodological
               culture of self-resistance that insinuates its way into those who dwell long with
               Cavell and serves broadly to unite the six contributions to <em>Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism</em> in terms of their tone. Four of the contributors here (Fry, François, Wilner, and
               Lindstrom) presented early versions of their essays as part of the “Stanley Cavell
               and Romanticism” panel, organized by Joshua Wilner and myself, at the 2010 International
               Conference on Romanticism (ICR), held in Lubbock, Texas. We would all like to thank
               the unusually engaged audience present on that occasion.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">*</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At one point in the Preface to his book about Emersonian perfectionism,<em>Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome</em> (1990), Stanley Cavell tellingly divides his great American theme from Anglo-European
                  configurations by evoking the difference between perpetually starting afresh, and
                  unshakeable—one might say melancholy, Romantic—memory: “It is as if [Heinrich von]
                  Kleist will neither accept nor refuse the Emersonian vision, an excruciating one for
                  those who can call for it but who cannot imagine themselves shaking their memories
                  and starting again; call them Europeans” (xxi).

                           attitude about “the three revolutions most resonant for his time”: the American and
                           French revolutions, as well as the protestant foment behind them. “Of the Puritan
                           revolution [Thoreau] says that it was ‘almost the last significant scrap of news’
                           from England” (The Senses of Walden 6).</span></div>
                  </div> Cavell’s working definitions of Romanticism evince, similarly, the mood of a restive
                  admission of intimacy in place of a forthright identification with the subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At a climactic point in Part Four of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (1979), Cavell arrives at the striking conclusion that “romanticism opens with the
                  discovery of the problem of other minds, or with the discovery that the other is a
                  problem, an opening of philosophy” (<em>Claim</em> 467). There, his textual positioning (in the midst of Rousseau, with overtones of <em>Frankenstein </em>and <em>Faust</em> still lingering from the preceding discussion) yields a statement of dispossession
                  one is tempted to make paradoxically central to the topic of <em>Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism</em>: “I am so far in a position merely to rummage among such texts, not to possess them”
                  (<em>Claim </em>467). The admission of use without lawful right or patrimony, from a writer whose
                  first job after all was in his father’s pawn shop,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> is preceded by the evocation of Romanticism found in his 1971 film study <em>The World Viewed</em>: “To speak of our subjectivity as the route back to our conviction in reality is
                  to speak of Romanticism. Perhaps Romanticism can be understood as the natural struggle
                  between the representation and the acknowledgment of our subjectivity” (22). Slightly
                  earlier in <em>The Claim of Reason </em>we also find this: “So both the wish for the exceptional and for the everyday are
                  foci of Romanticism. One can think of Romanticism as the discovery that the everyday
                  is an exceptional achievement. Call it the achievement of the human. —I believe I
                  know something of the impatience such ideas can inspire” (463). Why the “impatience”?
                  Cavell may be offering a little (slightly rebarbative) sympathy for the “average”
                  reader who finds his manner digressive. In similar contexts, Cavell defends the greenness
                  of youth against the normative imperatives of philosophical maturity—a development
                  to which he nonetheless complexly relents. Perhaps Cavell says “impatience” here,
                  too, out of the same logic through which David Rudrum, in an incisive essay on Cavell
                  and the Wordsworthian ordinary of the 1800 Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, has been led to ask: “How, then, to reconcile these two conceptions of the ‘common’,
                  the ‘ordinary’? Can it be both the thing which is lost, mourned, searched for, quested
                  after—and simultaneously the area the quester must search through for the thing which
                  is lost? If the ‘common’ and the ‘ordinary’ are to be thought of as <em>both</em> the needle and the haystack, then how could any quest ever get under way?” (169)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>All of Cavell’s major intellectual endeavors <em>start out</em> from this admission of being at a loss for orientation, a condition in which he is
                  disappointed, equally, with the questions and ways of proceeding readily available
                  to philosophy—but unseduced too by prefabricated “literary” means of recovery. For
                  Cavell’s “creative philosopher,” then, there are “two tasks: to oppose skepticism
                  and to oppose false answers to skepticism” (“Questions and Answers” 227). The “quest”
                  gets under way because this sense of finding oneself and one’s language stymied, or
                  not yet (or no longer) fully available, is so generative for Cavell. As he sets forth
                  in his Preface to the Beckman Lectures of 1983, assembled as roughly the first half
                  of the book <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> (1988), the most well-known, powerful trajectory Cavell has offered to British Romantic
                  studies so far could be outlined as “the theme of a romantic call for the unity of
                  philosophy and poetry precipitated in the aftermath of Kant’s revolution in philosophy,
                  traced strategically with respect to a limited collection of Romantic texts” (<em>Quest</em> xi).

                  </div> In two chapters from <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> (framed as a chiasmus in titling, “Emerson, Coleridge, Kant (Terms as Conditions)”
                  and “Texts of Recovery (Coleridge, Wordsworth, Heidegger . . .)” [<em>Quest</em> 27-75]), Cavell presents astonishing variations on the post-Kantian situation he finds
                  in reading the most famous products of Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetry and poetic
                  theory. Cavell charts “the Kantian bargain with skepticism (buying back knowledge
                  of objects by giving up things in themselves) and Romanticism’s bargain with the Kantian
                  (buying back the thing in itself by taking on animism)” (<em>Quest </em>65). In this account, British Romanticism represents both an abstractly necessary
                  schematic position and an absolutely concrete encounter with the words of texts and
                  their specific weights. It marks the moment “too late for religion, because nothing
                  is any longer common to our gods, and too soon for philosophy, because human beings
                  are not interested in their new lives” (<em>Quest </em>63).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Romantic poetry charts the experience of this crepuscular moment and provides a language
               for taking an interest—if need be, via a desperate-sounding, hyperbolic, and admittedly
               melodramatic register of the imagination “in which the stakes appear sometimes as
               the loss or gain of our common human nature, sometimes as the loss or gain of nature
               itself, as if the world were no more than one’s own—some such statement represents
               the general idea I have of what constitutes serious Romanticism’s self-appointed mission”
               (<em>Quest </em>43). This project elaborates for poetry, as for one of Cavell’s other recurrent genres
               of commentary, the Hollywood comedy of remarriage, a role without any justification
               external to itself: no overriding religious and metaphysical framework, juridical
               categories, or master narratives. The "Lines of Skepticism and Romanticism" from the
               book’s subtitle make their appearance in the way Cavell paradigmatically reads verse
               as a convergence and a test of philosophical energies: “Now this quest of poetry for
               the recovery of the world (which I am interpreting as a recovery of, or from, the
               thing in itself), this way of joining or paralleling the philosophical effort to recover
               from skepticism, will look to poetry very like the quest for poetry, as if the cause
               of poetry had become its own survival” (<em>Quest </em>45).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Even more pointedly, the promise to advance via “lines” forecasts the heralded analysis
                  of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner crossing a line: <em>the</em> line of the earth’s equator, which Cavell, in a tour de force of post-Kantian secular
                  mythmaking, recasts as poetry’s transgressive desire to get beyond (under, or, possibly,
                  inside?) the “architectonic [. . .] line or circle, closing off the region of the
                  thing in itself” (<em>Quest </em>47). The Mariner’s voyage plays out “the discovery that what presents itself upon
                  a skeptical repudiation of [. . .] attunement is another definite, as it were, frozen,
                  structure” (<em>Quest </em>48). Cavell deals with the vexed problem of motivation in the poem by “understand[ing
                  it] as the denial of some claim” to reciprocity upon the Mariner (<em>Quest </em>56).

                  register “what the Fall is itself an allegory of” (<em>Quest </em>48), Cavell revisits the theme of avoidance from his early essay on <em>King Lear</em>. Crucially, he then rewrites “what might be called the poem’s moral in something
                  like the reverse direction” from the message the Mariner shares himself, rather inconsequently
                  in the face of events. “[T]o let yourself <em>be loved</em> by all things both great and small” is for Cavell the <em>Rime</em>’s occluded insight (<em>Quest </em>56). However, the poem does not reach this spiritual landfall even upon return to
                  shore and the kirk’s goodly company.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Cavell’s reading masterfully explains why <em>The Rime</em>’s recitation competes with a wedding ceremony, and why Romantic poetry overall reinforces
               this anxiously close blind spot over representations of coupledom (see Walker 2009).
               The weight next shouldered in <em>Quest</em>, through Cavell’s rendering of Wordsworth’s “Intimations” Ode, connotes an imperative
               worth aligning to the impossible refrain of “go on” found in Wittgenstein or Beckett—or
               to Keats’s Moneta and the stunned need simply to get any movement off the spot of
               “frozen structure” where the poet-dreamer first stands. Punning at the expense of
               the dignity of the phrase, “strength in what remains behind,” to draw out the connotation
               of corpse-like remains (<em>Quest </em>76), Cavell’s discussion of the Ode starts in a Freudian analysis of youth and is
               stimulated by John Wisdom’s philosophical account of speaking flowers (<em>Quest</em> 68-70). But the core of his discussion arrives with a surprising articulation of
               anger, and the need (as a cause, not an effect, of anything else happening) to renounce
               the spirit of private vengeance. Since any tentative conclusions one might draw from
               the Wordsworth-Coleridge portions of <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> develop from this idea of renouncing vengeance—or better, of the relinquishing of
               vengeance as an unrationalized “evental” act of letting go (not in its form unlike
               the shooting of the bird)—the two paragraphs that follow are worth sharing in full:
               </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">We moderns are likely to imagine that the giving up of the ground of revenge is the
                  <em>effect</em> of therapy. I take the Intimations Ode to be saying on the contrary that this forgoing
                  is the <em>cause</em>, or say the condition, of change. We do not know where the inspiration to give up
                  revenge comes from. Much of its poet’s energy has to be spent in a kind of reseduction
                  (as does much of the energies of Heidegger, and of Wittgenstein, not to say Freud),
                  because our powers of being drawn from elsewhere (“we come from afar”), of being interested,
                  in heaven or in earth, are deadened. Otherwise we would not require birth, or poetry,
                  or philosophy.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">What remains of the “vision splendid” is that it “fades into the light of common day.”
                  Such is Wordsworth’s construction of the ordinary. Shall we take this, as I suppose
                  it commonly is taken, to be the same as a going out? But “fades into” does not <em>say</em> “fades out.” It may propose some other mode of becoming, a happier disillusionment,
                  so that the vision is preserved in the way in which it is forgone. Wordsworth’s construction
                  is to replace the ordinary in the light in which we live it, with its shades of the
                  prison-house closing upon us young, and its custom lying upon us deep almost as life,
                  a world of death, to which we are dead—replace it accordingly with freedom (“heaven-born
                  freedom”); and with lively origination, or say birth, with interest. How far can the
                  vision be preserved and lived? What remains of interest to us? What for us is remains?
                  We must turn to that. (<em>Quest </em>75)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> “‘Fades into’ does not <em>say</em> ‘fades out.’” Neither is it readable as a parallel to the famous ambiguity of the
               “light of sense” in <em>The Prelude</em> Book 6, in the common construction of “fades into” as either an excursive or darkening
               “going out.” Thanks to Cavell’s way of investing meaning in what another reader might
               downplay as the mere grammar of how the words are chosen (and even enunciated—in the
               sense of, “so long as the poet hasn’t actually <em>said</em> it [. . .],” admitted the fear and its depth; and such things matter), a critical
               space for transformation of “common day” and reinvestment in the ordinary remains.
               However, and equally, we are still on the floor with the question (a question that
               only makes grammatical sense if put instead as a constative declaration), “what is
               remains”?</p>
            <p>Cavell, like M.H. Abrams in<em>Natural Supernaturalism</em>, seldom if ever considers the poetry of Byron. However, the thoughts in the first
               paragraph of this long passage, on the prior “condition” of giving up grounds for
               “revenge,” indicate where Byron’s persona and defiant, stylized verbal gestures matter
               greatly in tension with Wordsworth. Never does Wordsworth enunciate as such, never
               does he formalize or close, the predicament of apartness (“a link reluctant in the
               fleshly chain”; <em>Childe Harold</em> III. 72), which crystallizes (fixes, “freezes”) the Romantic hero in the seductive
               pose of turning decisively away from community. In the poetry of Lord Byron, the Ode’s
               unexplainable inspiration to let go of revenge instead festers at one further remove
               of self-conscious representation, crafting terms for specifically literary, symbolic
               vengefulness by making Time itself a proxy “avenger” of the poet (<em>Childe Harold</em> IV. 130). Time “gets even” for Byron’s “odd” sense of harboring a prior wrong. The
               mediatic sheen of the Byronic poet-hero comes from his way of giving anger just a
               single unforgettable twist. This rhetorical dress makes Byron’s language often serve
               as a cutting redress for woundedness. “That curse shall be Forgiveness” (<em>Childe Harold</em> IV. 135) is the least Cavellian stylized verbal gesture of subjectivity that one
               can imagine. Yet, still, “[w]hat for us is remains?,” is the question on which Cavell
               ends the chapter on Wordsworth and Coleridge. One therefore must learn to figure a
               comparison between Wordsworth and the many Byronic “wrecks” of contemplation as a
               “ruin amidst ruins” (<em>Childe Harold</em> IV. 25).</p>

               <p>Acknowledgement of intersubjectivity, the irreducibly plural nature of being, offers
                  the only way out of the melancholy conceit of the (in)quest. Cavell’s Romantic literary
                  “event” pursues the opening-out of what it would mean to inhabit a repertoire of meaningful
                  individual and public responses, as part of what Kenneth Burke once called “equipment

                  Friends and Lovers: Perfectionism’s Recounting of Romanticism,” Emily Sun aptly conveys
                  the interpersonal quality of Cavell’s thinking on Romanticism and shares in his (Romantic
                  perfectionist’s) critique of the overall Romantic tendency to contrast solitude to
                  animist universalism, with the latter as a mode of “intimacy at large.” In privileging
                  (or at first seeming only to emphasize) the experiences of “genuine privacy” and “genuine
                  publicness,” the discourse of Romanticism threatens to repress the “counting” of many
                  “conditioned forms of intimacy,” beginning with friendship and marriage. But not only
                  friendship and marriage, as Sun shows in unfolding her remarkably lucid discussion
                  of Cavell, Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “conversation” poem “Julian and Maddalo,” and Shakespeare’s <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>. In her reply to the climactic Shelleyan question, "Then, what is life?," Sun offers
                  an array of concepts and concerns, and effectively invites scholars of Romanticism
                  of all stripes to explore Cavell’s relevance—but particularly those interested in
                  psychoanalysis and the connections between literature and the political philosophy
                  of biopower: “it is breeding, issuing, multiplying, dividing, replicating, separating.
                  The fact of natality is itself a process of division” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.sun.html">par. 30</a>), Sun (after Cavell) finely enumerates (see <em>Quest</em> 88).</p>
            </div>
            <p>By treating diurnal friendship and the conjugal pair as something of a constitutive
               blind spot of the stereotypically bipolar “clouds and crowds” Romantic vision, Sun’s
               approach builds from the important work of Eric C. Walker in his book <em>Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism</em> (2009). Her essay also stages an important (critical yet non-reductive) intervention
               in the way it models the deeply textured economic language and thought incident to
               what Cavell calls Romantic forms of spiritual “recovery.” Hence Sun writes: <span class="quote">‘If such genuine publicness is one that needs re-establishment, if the intimacy-at-large
                  Romanticism seeks is one that needs <em>re</em>covery, properly speaking, rather than just discovery, then, Cavell asks, ‘How did
                  it get loose, as if disinvested? And why does friendship demand it, as well as marriage?
                  Or does it?’ (<em>Quest </em>65). The recovery of intimacy within the contexts of friendship and marriage, according
                  to Cavell’s economic simile above, involves a re-investment in the ordinary conceived
                  as a complex network of interests and interconnections. (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.sun.html">par. 19</a>)’</span></p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To my mind as editor, one of the meanings of Romantic studies perhaps finally reaching
                  a post-New Historicist vantage is that we can consider the possibility that the “recoveries,”
                  “investments,” “credit” sought, and forms of “interest” available to Romantic discourse
                  aren’t all necessarily falsifications. Yet incorporating Cavell’s thought more deeply
                  than heretofore into the mainstream of Romantic studies might actually prove—and not
                  even in a very oblique sense—a sort of hybrid means to keep the charismatic, at times
                  painful, urgency of 1980s New Historicist scholarship in play. Even scholars unsympathetic
                  to and scorched by the New Historicism must, I think, come to appreciate the moving
                  and tough asseveration of Marjorie Levinson in the Afterword to her controversial
                  chapter on “Tintern Abbey.” In that final section of her essay—a peroration, basically—which
                  moves from Wordsworth in the realm of the poetic spirit to Adorno in philosophical
                  and cultural critique, she holds that we as the poem’s reading community now must
                  “refuse the transcendence [the poem offers] until such time as we can trace its source
                  and explain its character. Then we too are liberated; we share in the poem’s ecstasies,
                  or recover them in a meaningful form” (<em>Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems</em> 57). It is a stunning conclusion, and leads me to the question: How different is this
                  from what Cavell means by establishing the contested grounds of recovering meaning
                  through a conditioning human “claim”? Levinson’s Afterword reads as the Marxian inflection
                  of Cavell. And reciprocally, Cavell’s defense of skepticism as an unquenched, un-disavowed
                  impulse never wholly cuts free from the twentieth century’s literary-theoretical “hermeneutics
                  of suspicion.” It remains important to his skepticism that hollow victories <em>do</em> threaten, and are not brought in from an external foe but are the signs of an irreducible,
                  internal division. In this framework Sun identifies the analytical opening for her
                  discussion in Cavell’s own committed skepticism toward Romantic impulses—a skepticism
                  which is not demonstrably opposed in key ways to Levinson’s stance in her “Tintern
                  Abbey” Afterword, except perhaps in its fuller recognition of limits: that is, not
                  only the “Wordsworthian” inhumanity, but the Humean and poststructuralist theoretical
                  impossibility, alike, of tracing eloquence to the “source.” Sun writes that Cavell’s <span class="quote">‘critique, presented in broad but deft strokes, consists principally of the charge
                     that Romanticism accepts too readily ‘something like animism’ or what Ruskin terms
                     the ‘pathetic fallacy’ in its efforts at re-animation (<em>Quest</em> 53). This hastiness suggests a ‘bargain’ with the ‘concept of knowledge and the threat
                     of skepticism’—which Cavell situates specifically in relation to Kant’s division of
                     the claims of knowledge of the world between the subjective and the objective, the
                     sensible and the intelligible (<em>Quest</em> 53). Cavell’s prose evokes, in the articulation of this critique, a hypothetical ‘philosopher’
                     who ‘may feel’ that Romanticism ‘gives up the game’ too quickly of the claim of reason
                     in enacting its task of recovery (<em>Quest</em> 53). The proverbial ‘life of the world’ Romanticism seeks to bring back would seem
                     to this philosopher to be one in need of a more qualified parsing or accounting.”

                  once its end and its anticipation,” in “our habit, or habitat” (<em>Quest</em> 9). To make “that very inhabitation [. . .] from time to time perceptible,” as Cavell
                  goes on to maintain on the same page, is in good measure the accomplishment of Paul
                  Fry’s essay in this volume, also on Percy Shelley, which keenly and intricately recalibrates
                  the twin skeptical lines being pursued when romantics both “conceive that some place
                  elsewhere, or this place otherwise” (<em>Quest</em> 9). Fry reasons that if “life can be conceived as dead or insubstantial, as Shelley
                  says [in the Conclusion to his poem “The Sensitive Plant”] and as Cavell says it is
                  in the moment of Romantic skepticism,” “[i]t could follow then that death, which certainly
                  does seem at least different from life, if not opposite, may be the alternative habitation
                  Cavell or Shelley seeks” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 8</a>) Given the wonderful philosophical freedom of movement shown by the playfully-toned
                  poems which Fry primarily reads, the skeptical inversions of Shelley on death emerge
                  as a new, counter- and post-Wordsworthian mode in which a counterfactual ordinary
                  plays extraordinary variations. A question one might feel inclined to linger upon
                  after Fry’s discussion of Shelley as an urbane, essentially “probabilistic” skeptic
                  before <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is, How does Shelley’s demonic impulse to appeal to death for final a settlement in
                  his “last” days (even if this is just a mood, not a fate), relate to Cavell’s perfectionist
                  interest in the perpetual quotidian reconfigurations of a “next” life, his commitment
                  to imagining a philosopher in the Nietzschean terms of “a man of tomorrow and the
                  day after tomorrow”? (Cavell, <em>Philosophy </em>117)

               <p>An important distinction running through all Cavell’s writings, and particularly made
                  visible by Fry’s essay, is that which holds between the categories Cavell terms “other
                  minds” skepticism and “material-object skepticism”: in other words, solipsism and
                  skeptical “doubt in the existence of the material world”; or yet more curtly, solipsism
                  and skepticism (<em>Quest</em> 55). A question shades over the choice of “route” (<em>Quest</em> 4) in his project of extending therapy to skepticism by way of its acknowledgment.
                  Fundamentally, does this claim have an epistemological or an ontological standing?
                  In what philosophical mode, toward which enterprise, should we address a possible
                  recovery? Part of the challenge in following Cavell’s thinking here—and possibly an
                  answer to our indecision about whether knowing or being is most at stake—I suspect
                  lies in the recurrently transcritical movement through which Kant’s rigorously delimited
                  settlements are made to secure a “critical” epistemological frame, a frame the poets
                  are compelled to break so as to re-open a field for any possible dynamic “literary
                  event” to occur.

                  epistemology cannot be at once substantial and self-legislating: “A reasonable moral
                  to draw from these lines is that we do not know what constitutes living our skepticism”

            <p>In this sense the Romantic subject always finds herself, as Herman Melville’s deserting
               narrator says when becalmed near the start of the interminable <em>Mardi</em>, in “a state of existence where existence itself seems suspended [Coleridge?],” in
               barren crossings and recrossings of a line in the unyielding presence of which a landsman
               [Wordsworth of the Lakes? But also Kant of Königsberg?] would be “tempted to recant
               his belief in the eternal fitness of things” (669). But, giving food for thought—since
               my own approach and sense of Cavell’s gravity of investment puts the ontological character
               of doubt at the center of his Romanticism—in his essay here Paul Fry presses a different
               strategy: "It seems to me that at times Cavell’s argument would be more clearly delimited
               if he would distinguish more emphatically between ontological skepticism (doubt as
               to whether things and other minds exist at all, an emergent modern anxiety that Cavell
               associates with Descartes and Shakespeare) and epistemological skepticism. It is the
               latter, epistemological skepticism, that clearly emerges from the Kantian ‘settlement’
               as the concern of Romanticism" (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 13</a>). Fry goes on to remark, “Cavell argues in any case that the First Generation’s response
               to the Kantian settlement was animism” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 14</a>). “Thanks for nothing” (<em>Quest</em> 31), the Romantic responds to the Kantian settlement. Conversely, “No thanks for
               everything” (<em>Quest</em> 31, 53) is how someone may feel with “his or her Kantian conscience in tact." (<em>Quest </em> 53)</p>

                  following his “Texts of Recovery” essay in the collection <em>Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism</em>, Cavell has tended to present his debts to Romantic critical theory as if they had
                  a pre-critical birth. But his stated admiration for a previous, ecumenical moment
                  of Romantic literary criticism should not be allowed to obscure the contemporaneous
                  project that Cavell—as a matter of ongoing preoccupation, rather than as the narrative

                  by deconstruction.

                  </div> My own contribution to this volume understands the autobiographical register of Cavell’s
                  writing (and, to a lesser extent, of his often-remarked-upon prose style) alongside
                  similar but tensional features of Derridean deconstruction. Cavellian skepticism and
                  deconstruction have long shared the history of a comparable misreading, in which readers
                  have attributed a relativistic <em>denial</em> of knowledge to these approaches, as if both projects betrayed an animus toward certainty.
                  The topic is, needless to say, far too vast to broach here in a short introduction,
                  but there exist basic and still endless ties between Cavell’s work and deconstruction,
                  relating back to a shared intensiveness and performativity around themes of writing
                  and reading one finds at least as far back as <em>The Senses of Walden</em> (1972). I want to take Paul Fry’s schematically useful contrast between what he calls
                  “Cavell’s understanding of the liberating power of skepticism” and the apparent “linguistic
                  determinism” evinced by the late Shelley in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> as a fair word of warning, yet proceed into slightly less hedged comparisons between
                  Cavell and deconstruction nevertheless. In a fascinating note found in the first chapter
                  of <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, Cavell plays out a sort of Aesop’s tale with the event that deconstruction introduces
                  to the timing of his career; he casts himself as a tortoise (“the turtle”) to the
                  Yale School hare: <span class="quote">‘It is, I trust, somewhat understandable why, in 1987, revising the present chapter,
                     I have added this footnote and parenthetical observation [on ideas of writing and
                     reading in <em>The Senses of Walden</em>] to which it attaches. I do not wish to seem unteachable, or unresponsive to the
                     demand to relate what I do to the practice and theory of deconstruction. But those
                     who wish me well, and I hope some others will appreciate that 1972 (and the years
                     preceding, during which the work that goes into <em>The Senses of Walden</em> was in preparation), is at yet an immeasurable distance in American time. Naturally
                     I am aware of the possibility that intellectual events of the past two decades may
                     have preempted the fields I find myself in; but it is my fortune, good or bad, to
                     imagine otherwise. I was early enough so that it was quickly too late for me for a
                     different start. If this were a race, I would bet on the hare every time. But if it
                     is not, if there is not just one course, and if indeed we are not on the ground but
                     at sea, the turtle may make sense. (<em>Quest </em>17n)’</span> Anxiety about being “preempted” coaxes out a version of the famous Emersonian <em>Nachträglichkeit</em> of reading “our” original thoughts in the words of others. As he insists, despite
                  the fairly exact alignment of dates, on a kinked, out-of-joint timing, Cavell writes
                  simultaneously to claim his earliness and belatedness over against the moment of impact
                  of deconstruction: “I was early enough so that it was quickly too late for me for
                  a different start.”

                           I explicitly gave an account of the relation between my work and the work of Derrida”

                  </div> In his compelling remarks on Blanchot in <em>Little Did I Know</em>, similarly, Cavell evinces a proportionately intense interest in broadly deconstructive

                  literature (see 522-30). He proves characteristically both drawn to and wary of Blanchot’s
                  poststructuralist style as exhibiting a “horror of understanding” (525). In his not-to-be-missed
                  Afterword to the present collection, Joshua Wilner therefore <em>can</em> align Cavell insightfully with Derrida and deconstruction at a stimulatingly broad
                  view—but only once he observes a signal shift in the latter from the early grammatology
                  to a concern with the role of language in literature as a performative event. Wilner
                  concludes: “Here again, the shift from emphasis on the irreducibly figural dimension
                  of propositional language to an emphasis on an irreducibly <em>performative</em> dimension has played a central role” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.wilner.html">par. 12</a>)</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">*</p>
            <p>With the decision to write on Jane Austen’s novels in his 2005 book <em>Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</em>, Cavell revisits a remarkably fruitful and provocative engagement with British Romantic
               Literature that had begun in his work decades before in a different key. He turns
               from a nearly impossible communication of poetic election—the sort of “glory” that
               can only be brought to knowledge under the stars of duress, loss, and alienation in
               Wordsworth’s "Ode"—toward a contrasting starting place in sociality, communication,
               and inclusion. Yet this sociable change brings with it the tension that these are
               not only generic conventions in “polite” Austenian literature, but ideological norms
               held at the risk of the merely compulsory, coercive, and meaningless.</p>
            <p>If the Wordsworth-Coleridge frame of Romanticism from Cavell’s <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> positions the urge toward animism against the threat of skepticism that this affirmation
               belies, at stake in his reading of Austen is something like a hidden point of balance
               just under the six novels’ “renowned surface of containment” (Cavell, <em>Philosophy</em> 124). How should one respond to Cavell’s paradoxical elaboration of an “unconstrained”
               interest (<em>Philosophy</em> 126) in Austen’s characteristic style and social world, as determined by that “containment”?
               Cavell in his comments on Austen follows a radically different economy of utterance
               than that which his brilliantly hyperbolic investment in Romantic poetry pursues.
               In discussing her novelistic treatment of a dynamic of “vulnerable conformity,” Cavell
               sees the pedagogical lesson in Austen—“to exemplify instances in which the soul can
               learn not to be crushed by compromise”—as part of an ethical account of global modernity
               in which the crises stem from a less vocal drama than poetic world-making or -losing.
               The drama of Austen heroines and readers is that “one senses one’s consent to be elicited”
               by the exceedingly imperfect existing world (<em>Philosophy</em> 123).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A question emerges possessing what seems like a retrospective scope over Cavell’s
                  whole career, but its contour follows specifically from the engaged reading of Jane
                  Austen: How exhaustive is a public communication ethic to the project Cavell calls
                  “rational transformation,” the spiritual renewal of Austen’s heroines in a perfectionist
                  democratic society (<em>Philosophy </em>189)?

                  </div> Alternately, how much like a tragic sign of election does the fate of an “unshareable”
                  consciousness remain (<em>Philosophy </em>128)? And then, Cavell pointedly wonders, could “women, of [George] Eliot’s, let alone
                  Jane Austen’s time, [. . .] have afforded” such a “cost of a great separation” (<em>Philosophy </em>129)? Thus, in a penetrating footnote concerning a cinematic theme—the melodrama of
                  the unknown woman—which in several books precedes Cavell’s interest in Austen’s novels
                  and anticipates that subject thematically, Michael Fischer has observed: “Cavell links
                  Wittgenstein’s concentration on pain in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> to the fascination of psychoanalysis and cinema with the sufferings of women. By the
                  turn of the century, [according to Cavell] ‘psychic reality, the fact of the existence
                  of mind, has become believable primarily in its feminine (you may say passive) aspect’”
                  (Fischer 152n). Cavell’s reading of Austen figures this gendered instantiation of
                  “the existence of mind” and registers the conviction in (or problem of) “other minds,”
                  as he treats different, character-specific versions of the passion and suffering incident
                  to the intellectual tragedy of separation. Risks of nullification and exposure emerge
                  for characters such as Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny Price, and Emma Woodhouse, oscillating
                  along the extremes of a criterial dimension Cavell has repeatedly discussed in Wittgenstein
                  over the years: a fantasized rift between total privacy and utter, transparent, rule-following
                  convention. For Cavell, in taking up the conditions of secrecy and utter conventionality
                  that are typically forced upon discussions of the possibility of private language
                  in Wittgenstein, it is “as if the ordinary is the perfectly open secret” (<em>Contesting Tears</em> 157).

                  </div> Placed in terms of the discussion that François’s essay provides (whose title itself
                  may allude to the Cavell text on Wittgenstein, “Declining Decline”), we might ask
                  in what sense Cavell’s extended project of developing a legacy of “moral perfectionism”
                  is at least as intimate, all along, with what she calls the gesture of “passing” on
                  the urge toward judgment, or “conceding” and declining perfection? Is there an outlet
                  in Cavell’s thought to release us from the alternate instrumentalism that his “literary”
                  philosophy demands to be undertaken as a course of therapy? François’s reading of
                  the figure of “decline” is one about which she herself performs a deft excuse, allowing
                  that her essay has taken the “inconsequent” turn that such things often do between
                  the prospectus (promise) and the event of a piece of writing. François’s gesture opens,
                  too, upon another aspect of Cavell’s work: the subject of “diurnal” marriage, to which
                  Eric Walker devotes his attention. Walker’s essay demonstrates at a convincing depth
                  that Jane Austen’s <em>Persuasion</em> offers the very model of Cavellian “remarriage.” His linked discussion of adoption
                  in <em>Emma</em> then conveys—through Cavell’s own themes of self-adoption and diurnal re-marriage—a
                  philosophical framework in which cultural categories, not the naturalization of biological
                  ties and tropes, go all the way down as they decline “settlement.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>In we step back, then, to view overall these writings on Romantic-era prose fiction,
               two decades on from his engagement with the British Romantic poets in <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, we can understand Austen to represent a further moment of what Cavell had called
               “the domestication of the fantastic and the transcendentalizing of the domestic” (<em>Quest </em>27). Through changes in gender and genre, it is possible to take Cavell to imply that
               the perfectionist ordinary of an Austen novel looks more like the experiential conditions
               where “remarriage,” if the quester is to find happiness at all, has got to take place.
               In <em>Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</em>, remarriage is not “sublimed into metaphor when the really serious poetic business
               of uttering truths about our happiness [is] attempted” (Sutherland 11). A primary
               feature, which many readers will feel to be a benefit of Cavell’s refocusing on Austen
               for the latest act of his great theme of remarriage, is that such a construction of
               conjugality and the ordinary never abstracts itself to the plane of a figurative promise.
               It resists a Wordsworthian or Kantian quasi-formalistic, purposive “fit” between the
               categories of mind and the world, but emerges instead as an improvised diurnal task
               (“perfectionism” as a Nietzschean convalescence pitched toward affirming a <em>next</em> form of life, not pursuit of the <em>last</em>). To revisit the language just quoted from <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, this task offers a domestication of fantasy that may constitute an appeal from “criterial”
               societal norms, but without any transcendence to compensate.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">*</div>
            <p>I end this introduction with a brief discussion of a major British Romantic poet whose
               writings are not organized—whether that be figuratively, or referentially and “realistically”—around
               the question of marriage. During the course of Section IV of Part One of <em>The Claim of Reason</em>—a section that deals with the dissatisfaction implicit in Cavell’s responding to
               Wittgenstein’s use of criteria, called “What a Thing Is (Called)”—there occurs this
               sudden swerve from philosophy as such to literary particulars, focusing on Keats.
               Cavell has been talking about the notorious example from Wittgenstein having to do
               with the feeling and expression of pain, the so-called impossibility of there being
               a private language, et cetera, and he turns to the example of a physician’s way of
               knowing pain:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">But why couldn’t it be that a doctor’s knowledge of the subject of pain is just what
                  is expressed in what he or she does—not merely with his trained hands, but in the
                  very distance of his reactions to me? He trusts his hands and training to show his
                  response; if I trust his knowledge and his reactions, I may feel more known by them
                  than by a more apparently warm or constant response to what I feel. Not just because
                  they give me hope [. . .]. But because I, as it were, learn a new response to my pain;
                  not a refuge from it, but a place for it, a proportion to its presence. The distance
                  comforts as truth can. (Naturally I do not deny that truth can be used as a weapon;
                  especially when it comes in fragments.)</p> 
               <p class="noCount">And then sometimes the words of response get very particular:</p> 
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">My dear Reynolds—I cannot write about scenery and visitings . . . . One song of Burns
                     is of more worth to you than all I could think for a whole year in his native country.

                     it—to drink a Toddy without any Care—to write a merry sonnet; it won’t do . . . .

               <p>At the end of this excerpt we learn that the letter’s addressee, the poet and parodist
                  John Hamilton Reynolds, is about to marry and settle down into contented bourgeois
                  life (indeed, this was the main reason Reynolds later cited for not accompanying the
                  dying Keats to Rome); and Cavell’s focalization of perfectionism in Keats—an outsider
                  but not a mocker of that rather snug “happiness to come” in the Reynolds household—indicates
                  the degree to which Romanticism’s negativity matters to Cavell. Similarly, that “[t]he
                  distance comforts as truth can” almost sounds the same note as Paul de Man’s 1966
                  introduction to Keats’s poetry, where the presence of philosophy comes to announce
                  itself by the impersonal effort get to clear to see ourselves—not recover anything—by
                  poetic knowledge. “There are moments of straightforward escape in Keats” (de Man 541),
                  de Man says of some of the early poetry, but “[t]he power which forces a man to see
                  himself as he really is, is also called ‘philosophy’ in the later Keats” (de Man 545).
                  Eric Idsvoog has remarked to me in personal conversation that Cavell’s turn here—which
                  involves the move from showing interest in a physician’s way of knowing pain to Keats’s,
                  as a type both of physician and patient—offers an extraordinary gloss on the long
                  passage from <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> about the poet as “A humanist, physician to all men” (l.190). Keats’s most relevant
                  passage from <em>The Fall</em> reads: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">‘None can usurp this height,’ returned that shade,</div>
                        <div class="l">‘But those to whom the miseries of the world </div>
                        <div class="l">Are misery, and will not let them rest.</div>
                        <div class="l">All else who find a haven in the world,</div>
                        <div class="l">Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        <div class="l">If by a chance into this fane they come,</div>
                        <div class="l">Rot on the pavement where thou rotted’st half.’ (ll. 147-153) </div>
                     </div>
                  </blockquote> At the same time, the allusion Keats makes to <em>King Lear</em> fuses damaged, vengeful, yet nevertheless somehow forgiving words from the last act
                  to the melancholy example of Robert Burns
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note22" id="Note22_return"><sup class="super">

                           in the summer of 1818. She quotes the same letter that interests Cavell, retaining
                           an outburst of misogynistic language Cavell puts under ellipses. </span></div>
                  </div> (“We can see horribly clear, in the works of such a man, his whole life, as if we
                  were God’s spies”) (compare to <em>King Lear</em> V.iii.17). The intense literary double vision of <em>King Lear</em> and Burns presents an occasion of another of Cavell’s staggering moments. Transitioning
                  from <em>Lear</em>’s political theology of confessional surveillance, to finitude and particularity,
                  Cavell answers the letter: <span class="quote">‘Burns made himself clear; the rest is up to whoever is there, and can. I don’t say
                     you have to rise to Keats’s response. (I don’t mean rise to being able to write like
                     him, but up to responding like that; allowing room for another’s misery to be unforgettable.)
                     But to know the subject, that it is pain, is to respond <em>to </em>it; and if other things are on your mind, and your sensations are sometimes deadened
                     for weeks together, then to know that <em>that</em> is a response, and yet leaves you freedom for a further response. (<em>Claim</em> 82).’</span> Cavell writes here to reinvest something like <em>the</em> meaning (not the authoritative final word, but the sponsoring possibility of any “next”
                  meaning) into a field of inquiry and re-investment. He works at the minimal degree
                  of a possible sustaining response. The generous outward gesture, which he extends
                  not only to future readers of this letter, but to the dead Burns and the soon to be
                  dying Keats, and toward the unforthcoming register of himself, too, lies in disburdening
                  the (near) affective nullity from its added burden of pressing and disabling shame,
                  in order to allow space to experience both “another’s misery [as] unforgettable” and
                  for “freedom for a further response.” Cavell’s Romantic perfectionism offers itself
                  as an allowance for the fluctuating (non-) succession to this realm of further responsiveness.
                  Just as Cavell’s claim is addressed to an unspecified “you”—that response might come,
                  democratically, but also in a formal sense, “lyrically,” from anyone anywhere.</p>
            </div>
            <p>But who else would have recognized the opportunity for taking an interest in just
               this way? And who else would have placed a hand upon life just there, after the model
               of affective investment in Keats, but where he flatly concedes he has no amplitude
               (no force, no pulse) of feeling to share—not enough thoughts in a whole year to match
               the one song? In his passage of response to Keats, Cavell demonstrates his remarkable
               capacity to welcome under-explained and unforthcoming responses, to meet the radical
               condition of passivity in its own form of an appropriate, negatively capable analysis.
               There will be more readings that take stock of what it could have meant for Keats
               to allude to <em>Lear</em> and Burns in a letter, and more opportunities to model the sympathetic responding
               to pain. But <em>this</em> language—an act of extraordinary promise and a difficult prognosis—exemplifies Cavell’s
               writing well on at least two fronts: by its inimitable, layered realization of that
               very capacity for an individual “further response”; and in its perhaps yet more signal
               capacity to allow time and space for the responses of others, conditions that Cavell’s
               writing regards as external to itself, but not as indifferent or claimless.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Like several other important thinkers in the theoretical humanities in recent years—among
                  them Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, and Alain Badiou—Cavell brings
                  philosophy and literature into contact and forms a distinctive attitude about the
                  performative “event” of literary language as such.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note23" id="Note23_return"><sup class="super">
                           (23)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For two further points of reference in Cavell’s treatment of major texts and thinkers
                           as “events,” see his response to George Kateb, “What is the Emersonian ‘Event’?,”
                           in Emerson’s Transcendental Etudes, and the chapter “The Wittgensteinian Event” in
                           Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow (192-212).</span></div>
                  </div> Eschewing the violence and dismissal of Romanticism found at least in Badiou, among
                  the major figures above, Cavell in his deeply textured relation to speech-act theory
                  nonetheless advances an “evental” claim on and through British Romantic literature.
                  The issues of skepticism and acknowledgement are the recurrent and great ones for
                  Cavell. Yet in Coleridge’s <em>Rime</em>, in Wordsworth’s "Ode," and now in Keats’s letter we have seen a critical theme in
                  Cavell’s work as that of the “literary event” of Romanticism. Godlike at times, but
                  by contrast finite and fragile, the form of investment through which Cavell comes
                  to understand this event is that of an unrationalized act of allowing and of relinquishment,
                  the releasing of one’s hold over of the grounds of anger, or even of an adequate affective
                  “response” at all, in the case of Keats’s example. The quality of Cavell’s attention
                  to this Romantic claim of literature in the literary "event" is attested to by his
                  fundamental gesture to acknowledge a constitutive space outside his reach.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">These collections include Eldridge and Rhie; Loxley and Taylor; Saito and Standish.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">In their introduction to <em>Stanley Cavell and Literary Studies</em>, Eldridge and Rhie also remark on the neglect of Cavell’s thought by literary critics
               (2). They attribute such ambivalence toward, or overlooking of, Cavell, to misconceptions
               about the meaning of “ordinary language” and to widespread theoretical resistance
               to his unreconstructed humanism (4); I take up the second of these issues toward the
               end of my essay in this collection.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">For just a few significant interventions over the terms and stakes of Cavell’s work
               lately, which acknowledge in turn his role as a pioneer opening modes of thought,
               see Khalip 17-19; Favret 154-158; François (<em>Open Secrets</em>) 82-83 and 150-151; Miller 81-83; 112-116; and 134-137; Sun 15 and 41-42; Terada
               2-5 and 69-71; and Walker (<em>Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism</em>) 21-24 and 39-45.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Critchley’s response to Cavell in <em>Very Little . . . Almost Nothing</em> affirms the fragmentary ‘romanticism’ (his inverted commas) found in Lacoue-Labarthe
               and Nancy, and questions Cavell’s Emersonian Romanticism as an expression of privileged
               American exceptionalism. For a very different judgment of (Cavell’s) Emerson, see
               Arsic; Ong shares a different approach to Cavell’s America—“unleavened” (as in a condition
               of migration or exile) and “broken” (as is bread)—through his recounting of the experience
               of his father.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Exceptions to this characterization can be found in Desmond, Duffy, and Rudrum. Gerald
               L. Bruns, <em>On Ceasing to be Human</em>, is organized around Cavellian questions in connection with continental theory, and
               takes an approach companionate with mine here.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>The Senses of Walden</em> speaks from something like this spirit in recording Thoreau’s attitude about “the
               three revolutions most resonant for his time”: the American and French revolutions,
               as well as the protestant foment behind them. “Of the Puritan revolution [Thoreau]
               says that it was ‘almost the last significant scrap of news’ from England” (<em>The Senses of Walden</em> 6).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">See the account of Cavell’s experiences in his father’s Sacramento pawnshop in <em>Little Did I Know</em> (24-27).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Cavell volunteers his suspicion elsewhere that canonical poets are or are in constant
               danger of being “monsters of fame”; “Remains to be Seen” (262). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Duffy is a forerunner to my account of <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Cavell writes “motive,” keeping in mind the Mariner has “murdered to connect” (<em>Quest</em> 56, 60)</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">See Kenneth Burke, “Literature as Equipment for Living” in <em>The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Discussion of animism and the pathetic fallacy also features in Joshua Wilner’s essay,
               “‘Communicating with Objects’: Romanticism, Skepticism, and the ‘Specter of Animism’
               in Cavell and Wordsworth” (Eldridge and Rhie 152-162). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">Though elsewhere Cavell is more sanguine way with representative ambitions: “If what
               I say about romanticism is false to these texts [of Wordsworth and Coleridge], then
               for my purposes here it is false to romanticism, period. If what I say is true but
               confined to just the texts I consider, I shall be surprised but not abashed; I know
               very well that there is in any case work ahead of me.” (<em>Quest</em> 6)</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">I loosely borrow the idea of a “transcritical” movement, against the resolution of
               philosophical structure, from Karatani. See Wilner’s essay in the Eldridge and Rhie
               collection for a discussion of how “other minds” skepticism underlies “external object”
               skepticism for Cavell. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">See Kates 12; and, more broadly, Ziarek. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>Little Did I Know</em>, Cavell admits to feeling “hopeless” in response to the recurrent comment of some
               sympathetic readers that “I could not expect to get a hearing until I explicitly gave
               an account of the relation between my work and the work of Derrida” (472).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">See Nazar for insightful judgments on the reach of “communicative ethics” into analysis
               of Austen’s novels and their interpersonal texture. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note20"><span class="noteLabel">20. </span><span class="noteBody">In the long Postscript to <em>Contesting Tears</em>, Cavell explicitly engages with Eve Sedgwick’s trope of queer closeting in terms
               of the scene of the philosophical closet: a location found recurrently in first-person
               accounts of the skeptic’s reflective position and “orientation” to the world in the
               act of trying to bring the world to knowledge.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note21"><span class="noteLabel">21. </span><span class="noteBody">Within a larger context of convivial agreement, Cavell’s points of departure from
               Shoshana Felman in his foreword to the new English edition of <em>The Scandal of the Speaking Body</em> reflect this arguably “Habermasian” turn, which—ironically—he invokes there to suggest
               the drift of profound and not fully voiced differences (the opposite of communicative
               transparency) between his own alignment to Austin and Felman’s reading.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note22"><span class="noteLabel">22. </span><span class="noteBody">Stafford, 107-109, expands on the context of Keats’s travel to Burns country in Scotland
               in the summer of 1818. She quotes the same letter that interests Cavell, retaining
               an outburst of misogynistic language Cavell puts under ellipses. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note23"><span class="noteLabel">23. </span><span class="noteBody">For two further points of reference in Cavell’s treatment of major texts and thinkers
               as “events,” see his response to George Kateb, “What is the Emersonian ‘Event’?,”
               in Emerson’s <em>Transcendental Etudes</em>, and the chapter “The Wittgensteinian Event” in <em>Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</em> (192-212).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note23_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
