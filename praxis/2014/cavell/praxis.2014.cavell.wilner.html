All inaugural books, all challenging their disciplines from within but in

                           attracted to and resistant of something like the route of response deconstruction
                           was to pursue. Because I see Cavell’s work as intimately exposed to the attraction
                           of what it resists (and which he figures as “skepticism”), I also see it as articulating
                           (one mode of) theory’s resistance to itself, thus not simply countering it from t…</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By and large, of course, this did not happen. In the years and decades following that
                  late sixties moment there has been no lack of discrete responses by individual literary
                  scholars and theorists to Cavell’s work—as Eric Lindstrom discusses in his introduction—and
                  even the occasional institutional overture.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I am thinking in particular of the effort in the mid-seventies, in which, if I am
                           not mistaken, Bloom, de Man, and Hartman all participated, to bring Cavell to Yale’s
                           Department of Philosophy. </span></div>
                  </div> But it is only comparatively recently that something approaching a collective response
                  by the field of literary studies and of a kind comparable to that elicited by any
                  number of contemporary continental figures, not to mention Derrida and de Man, has
                  begun to organize itself. Nor by collective response do I mean that the “field” as
                  a whole has found it necessary to engage with Cavell’s writing and thinking in a systematic
                  way, but only that an interest has emerged in organizing occasions, whether conferences,
                  sessions, or collaborative publications like the present, whose form more or less
                  ensures that at least some literary critical responses to Cavell’s work will be <em>collected</em> rather than remain dispersed, gathered together in the hope that something like a
                  critical mass will be reached. The apparent historical, geographical, and thematic
                  circumscription of its topic notwithstanding then (though one could argue that the
                  word “Romanticism” and the name “Cavell,” especially when considered in conjunction,
                  all but guarantee this result), the present collection is symptomatic both of the
                  reopening—or perhaps better the resuscitation—of possibilities of exchange one might
                  have thought foreclosed or moribund, and, in its heterogeneity, of an ongoing uncertainty
                  as to whether and how they are to be sustained.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Since my own involvement with Cavell began in 1966, more or less at the same time
               that I began studying with Paul de Man as an undergraduate at Cornell, and just as
               I was beginning to hear about someone named Jacques Derrida doing exciting work in
               France (all of this scored to the drumbeat of bombardments half a world away and growing
               calls to bring the war home), Eric Lindstrom’s invitation to write this afterword
               naturally leads me to reflect on two closely related questions: first, what hindered
               theory’s reception of Cavell’s work; and second, what, if anything, has changed to
               make that work more available for engagement?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To speak briefly to the first question, and to forestall the suggestion that the difficulty,
                  alluded to briefly by Lindstrom, has been the idiosyncracies of Cavell’s style, or
                  (more complexly) his (parochial?) concern with the fate of philosophy in America and
                  its repression of Emerson as its founder: the real stumbling block has always seemed
                  to me Wittgenstein or, not to speak in proper names, the appeal to the authority of
                  ordinary language.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Austin comes in here too, of course, though not to the same extent, if only because
                           Austin had his own use for technical language.</span></div>
                  </div> While one can imagine Derrida and Cavell alike finding use for Lacan’s dictum, “il
                  n’y a pas de métalangage,” no transcendental standpoint from which language might
                  be apprehended in its totality and critiqued, for deconstruction this entails as its
                  dialectical counterpart the idea that everyday language is conditioned through and
                  through by metaphysical oppositions, and the difficult task (“immense labeur,” as
                  Derrida would say) of undoing and displacing them from within a syntax and lexicon
                  they intimately inform. From such a perspective, Wittgenstein’s remark that “what
                  we do is bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use” (<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> 116), a remark which surely provides the subtext for Cavell’s characterization of
                  the work of Romanticism as “the task of bringing the world back, as to life” (<em>Quest</em> 52), will seem at best an evasion of the problem, at worst an invitation to complacency,
                  a pastoralizing appeal to normative contexts of usage that turns a blind eye to the
                  destabilizing critical potential of literary language, while from a Wittgensteinian
                  perspective, deconstruction perpetuates the mirage of a totalizing linguistic edifice
                  that holds us captive—an edifice which Wittgenstein could dismiss as “houses of cards”
                  (<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> 118)—through the very project of undertaking to dismantle it.</p>

               <p>It is not surprising then that Paul Fry’s finely argued piece on “Saving Skepticism
                  in Shelley and Cavell,” which explicitly characterizes Cavell’s work as mediating
                  between two “traditions of philosophy” (2) and whose reading of Shelley is shaded
                  in various ways by de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured” essay,

                           chiasmic handling of the relationship between life and death in the epilogue to “The
                           Sensitive Plant” and elsewhere is reminiscent of de Man’s discussion in that essay
                           of the relation between sleeping and waking in “The Triumph of Life.” </span></div>
                  </div> originally published in the 1979 <em>Deconstruction and Criticism </em>(Fry himself having arrived at Yale as an assistant professor in 1971), essentially
                  has to bracket Cavell’s “primary interest [. . .] in the recovery of the quotidian”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 6</a>) in order to conduct its argument. What remains is Cavell’s other signature preoccupation
                  (to the extent they can be separated from one another), the problematic of skepticism,
                  whose subversion, in Fry’s reading of Shelley, of the categories of truth and error
                  (as of those of life and death) gives poetry its chance, at least in the pre-1820
                  Shelley. Fry finds in this “grounding of poetry in skepticism,” in particular in its
                  critical, “constructive” potential, common ground with Cavell’s insistence, early
                  and late, on the skeptic’s “insight [. . .] that certainty is not enough” (<em>Must We</em> 258).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That “the skeptic’s insight” is integral to Cavell work; that his concomitant rejection
                  of a Cartesian epistemology of certainty makes common cause in this regard with what
                  came to be known as post-structuralist theory; that this rejection is further concomitant
                  with an openness to literature as an originary mode of human knowing and thus as a
                  contestant of or partner in philosophy’s claims; that this rejection and openness
                  are hallmarks of Romantic writing and thought and what Cavell’s diagnoses as its “disappointment
                  with the Kantian settlement” with skepticism; that Cavell’s work therefore involves
                  from the start an original relation to Romanticism (prior to its channeling through
                  the pivotal figure of Emerson): all these propositions Fry’s discussion of Cavell
                  and Shelley demonstrates, either directly or by implication, in exemplary fashion.
                  At the same time, that Fry speaks of “Cavell’s understanding of the liberating power
                  of skepticism” (which Fry sets off against a “linguistic determinism” to which he
                  sees the late Shelley turning and that he associates with the “Yale School” and its
                  impact on literary studies), gives me pause. In my reading, the importance Cavell
                  accords skepticism is not a function of its “liberating power” but of the irrepressibility
                  of the impulse to which it gives expression and access, an impulse Cavell identifies
                  with the all-too-human wish to escape the human and finds articulated in, for example,
                  the first sentence of the first edition of Kant's <em>First Critique</em>.

            <p>Of the other contributions, it is Eric Lindstrom’s—which is also the essay most concerned
               (particularly in its first half) with claiming for Cavell an original relation to
               Romanticism—whose way of construing that relationship most resembles Fry’s. Again
               it is skepticism, or more precisely what Cavell calls “living one’s skepticism,” which
               Lindstrom understands as the task of “bridg[ing]” “isolation and [. . .] community,”
               as the uncertain possibility of self- or world- “renewal by way of our skepticism,”
               which is seen as constituting “Cavell’s Romanticism” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 6, passim</a>) Both find touchstones for their arguments in cognate passages from <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>: for Fry, Cavell’s interpretation of “Romanticism’s work [. . .] as the task of bringing
               the world back, as to life. This may present itself as the quest for the return to
               the ordinary, or of it, of a new creation of our habitat; or as the quest away from
               that, for the creation of a new inhabitation” (<em>Quest</em> 53); for Lindstrom, Cavell’s presentation of the thought “that the world could be—or
               could have been—so remade, or I in it, that I would want it, as it would be, or I
               in it” as “an idea that Emerson or any Romantic would be lost without” (<em>Quest</em> 35).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is understandable that such words might be construed as a warrant for skepticism,
                  understood as a thorough-going questioning of what I take as given in my relation
                  to the world and others, and Lindstrom is certainly not alone in taking Cavell’s words
                  about “living one’s skepticism” to involve an ethical injunction (though he is careful
                  to describe its possibility as in question). For myself, however, I take away a different
                  understanding of this issue, and therefore a different understanding of Cavell’s relation
                  to Romanticism on this score. The theme of “living one’s skepticism” arises initially
                  in <em>The Claim of Reason</em> in the context of Cavell’s extended comparison of the classical philosophical problem
                  of material objects skepticism, reaching its definitive formulation in Hume, and the
                  more peculiarly modern problem of other minds skepticism. With regard to the former,
                  Hume famously observes that “when we leave our closet and engage in the common affairs
                  of life, its conclusions vanish.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                           (7)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The sentence I cite is from the opening of the third book of Hume’s Treatise of Human
                           Nature and is said with reference to all “abstruse reasoning.” Its specific application
                           to skepticism is developed in the concluding section of the same book.</span></div>
                  </div> Or, as Cavell phrases it, “[W]ith respect to the external world an initial sanity
                  requires recognizing that I cannot live my skepticism”—and then continues, “whereas
                  with respect to others a final sanity requires recognizing that I can, I do” (<em>Claim</em> 451).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Particularly when considered within the context of this latter acknowledgement, the
               “Romantic” idea over which Lindstrom lingers—“that the world could be—or could have
               been—so remade, or I in it, that I would want it, as it would be, or I in it” (<em>Quest</em> 35-36)—reads to me as formulated in resistance to the draw of a skeptical half-heartedness
               that repeated experience (hence, “a final sanity”) all but requires us to share, and
               that manifests above all (and here my line of thought rejoins Lindstrom’s) as “our
               distance from [. . .] the language we routinely use” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 11</a>). Whether this distance, to again echo Lindstrom glossing Cavell, is understood in
               terms of “the finitude of ‘where we stand’ in questioning use of our own and others’
               language” (ibid) or in terms of an absolute demand that no remaking of the world or
               imagining of the world remade could satisfy, seems to me precisely where the issue
               of skepticism in its relation to Romanticism’s transformative aspirations is lodged
               for Cavell.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But what is “the finitude of where we stand” in questioning our use of language? Consider
                  the following passage from Arthur Eddington’s 1929 <em>The Nature of the Physical World</em>, recognizably a latter-day version of (and conceivably reflecting familiarity with)
                  Hume’s portrayal of the situation of the skeptical philosopher: <span class="quote">‘I am standing on the threshold about to enter a room. It is a complicated business

                     be wiser that he should consent to be an ordinary man and walk in rather than wait
                     till all the difficulties involved in a really scientific egress are resolved. (324)’</span> In a well-known 1938 letter to Scholem, Walter Benjamin famously wrote of Eddington’s
                  conceit, which he cites in translation at greater length, “In all of literature I
                  know of no printed passage that exhibits the Kafkaesque-<em>gestus</em> to the same extent.” That it does so is because this “most recent of experiential
                  worlds”—which “is projected theoretically, for example, in modern physics and practically
                  in the technology of warfare” and which Benjamin also associates with “the experience
                  of the modern city dweller”—“was conveyed to [Kafka] precisely by the mystical tradition,”
                  with which it exists in “tremendous tension” but whose powers had to be appealed to
                  in order to confront a “reality [that] can scarcely be experienced by an <em>individual</em>” (Benjamin 563-4).

               <p>Less well known, at least by students of literature, are some remarks in Wittgenstein’s <em>Blue Book</em> (1933-34) which may as well (and might in fact) be responding to the same passage
                  in Eddington: <span class="quote">‘We have been told by popular scientists that the floor on which we stand is not solid,
                     as it appears to common sense, as it has been discovered that the wood consists of
                     particles filling space so thinly that it can almost be called empty. [. . .] To say,
                     on this latter ground, that the floor is not solid is to misuse language. For even
                     if the particles were as big as grains of sand, and as close together as these are
                     in a sandheap, the floor would not be solid if it were composed of them in the sense
                     in which a sandheap is composed of grains. Our perplexity was based on a misunderstanding
                     [. . .] the word “solidity” was used wrongly [. . .] in a typically metaphysical way,
                     namely without an antithesis. (Wittgenstein 45-46)’</span> These things are a parable. In Benjamin’s reading, although Eddington’s explicit subject
                  is the constitutive role of uncertainty in quantum mechanics’ displacement of classical
                  mechanics, the passage expresses something more general, an immobilizing anxiety—"Shall
                  I not slip through?"—in the face of what Dickinson could still name “that precarious
                  Gait/Some call Experience,”

                  and Austin, is presented by Cavell as simultaneously the “return of a voice to philosophy”
                  and “giving me a voice in philosophy” (<em>Pitch</em> 69).

                           remains the crucial investigation of the problem of voice in Cavell’s work. In the
                           present context, it is worth noting that Cavell’s relation to Romanticism is one of
                           Gould’s running concerns, and his relation to deconstruction a recurrent one.</span></div>
                  </div> Since that unembarrassed, if exquisitely complex, appeal to voice went directly against
                  the grain of the deconstructive critique of phonocentrism, confirming it in its suspicions,
                  as it were, of appeals to the ordinary, it is notable that the second half of Lindstrom’s
                  essay on “Cavell, Derrida and the Literary Animal” should look for the grounds of
                  a <em>rapprochement </em>in “Derrida’s [. . .] raising the profile of embodied voice of his text, so that at
                  times he parallels Cavell in a precise, yet diffusely lively, vocal inflection” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 17</a>) The possibility of such an approach attests not only to what Lindstrom accurately
                  describes as “Derrida’s [. . .] turn to autobiographical writing from the 1980s onward”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 17</a>) and, with surehandedness, asks us to consider in relation to the even more marked
                  and earlier initiated tendency in Cavell. It is also grounded in the increasing importance
                  accorded by Derrida to the “idiomatic,” marker of the singularity and multiplicity
                  of languages, and closely allied as a linguistic category, I would argue, with the
                  “ordinary” and the “everyday.” Finally it attests to the easing of a degree of censorship
                  attaching to invocations of “voice” whose imposition was the inevitable if not sought
                  as such consequence of the deconstructive program of undoing metaphysics’ foundational
                  repression of “l’errance joyeuse du <em>graphein</em>” (Derrida, “Éllipse” 429; Derrida’s emphasis). Here again, the shift from emphasis
                  on the irreducibly figural dimension of propositional language to an emphasis on an
                  irreducibly <em>performative</em> dimension has played a central role.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Thus Lindstrom is careful to stipulate, in initiating his comparative investigation
               of Derrida’s and Cavell’s "strain[s] of philosophy moving both against and [. . .]
               arching back toward the conditions of song,” that what he is inquiring into “is not
               at all a centering of logos as metaphysical 'presence' in voice,” but rather, in his
               suggestive if elusive formulation, “an inflection of thought by the tensional body
               of performed language” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 20</a>) Although one may ask whether such a recasting of voice in terms of embodied performance
               (here dependent on an equivocation as to whether the “body of performed language”
               is the body doing the performing or the “body” of the language performed) does not
               reproduce the anchoring of language in a relation of self-presence that is the target
               of Derrida’s critique, I prefer to examine for a moment one figuration of that “tensional
               body” on which he dwells in developing his related thinking about the relation to
               animality in Cavell’s and Derrida’s comparably mobile, improvisatory inhabitations
               of language, the following stanza from Wordsworth’s “Lines Written in Early Spring”:
               </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">The birds around me hopped and played</div>
                  <div class="l">Their thoughts I cannot measure,</div>
                  <div class="l">But the least motion which they made,</div>
                  <div class="l">It seem’d a thrill of pleasure.</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Lindstrom’s attention is rightly drawn to Wordsworth’s play with “measure”: “Surpluses
               of feeling nearly built into the pseudo-cognitive structure of the ‘measured’ verse
               ballad lightly and non-insistently countermand [. . .] Newtonian [. . .] or Cartesian
               [. . .] paradigms of measurement” ("Introduction" par. 23). But there is another less
               evident but more piercing play of words involved in the way “thrill” channels “trill”
               (as de Man would, in fact, have pronounced it), an association by means of which Wordsworth
               connects the vibratory intensifications, the “trills” of poetic voice to the birds’
               “least motion,” and which anticipates, in the unfolding of Lindstrom’s essay, his
               closing citation of Derrida (referencing the myth of the cicadas in <em>The Phaedrus</em>): “‘I philosophize’ can mean that as a man I am a cicada, I recall what I am, a cicada
               who remembers having been a man. To remind myself of myself is to recall myself to
               singing and music” (<em>Animal</em> 53; qtd. in Lindstrom). The writings of Cavell, Derrida, and Wordsworth alike make
               something—and ask us to make something—of this tremulous excess.</p>

               <p>Turning from Fry’s and Lindstrom’s essays to the contributions of François and Walker,
                  what strikes me most immediately is the degree to which questions about the relationship
                  of self and world yield place in both to intersubjective dramas of relationship, with
                  marriage the dominant figure and Austen the preeminent writer to be interrogated.
                  While it might seem that François provides the theoretical context for this difference
                  in emphasis, drawing on yet another Cavellian account of Romanticism as “the ‘process
                  of secularization,’ whereby finite individuals are asked to play ‘God’ to one another
                  by verifying and bearing witness to one another’s separate existences” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 3</a>), this is only partially the case since the wedding of “the discerning intellect
                  of man [. . .] to this goodly universe” of which Wordsworth “would chant [. . .] the
                  spousal verse” (“Prospectus" to <em>The Recluse</em> ll. 52-3) offers a competing pattern of secularization and figuration of marriage,
                  a complication to which I return below.

                           remarks that “are content to stop at broad agreement with the longstanding idea of
                           romanticism as a substitute for, or afterlife of, religion” (personal communication).
                           My essay “Romanticism and the Internalization of Scripture” was intended as a critique
                           of that idea as expounded in Abrams’ Natural Supernaturalism (and, more fleetingly,
                           De la grammatologie), though the copula of my title has sometimes been mistaken for

            <p>Walker observes with admirable economy, “A cornerstone of Cavell’s work is the claim
               that marriage marks the recalcitrant sites where narratives wrestle with skepticism”
               (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.walker.html">par. 4</a>) Correlatively, both he and François lay stress on what the latter calls “marriage
               as a daily or <em>diurnal</em> event” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 6</a>; my emphasis). For François, Cavellian marriage is “incapable of definitive achievement
               because it consists of the precarious sustaining (or not) of a conversation over time,
               one felicitous instance of which can never absolutely guarantee the dawn of another”
               (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 6</a>) while Walker identifies as “[a] hallmark of Cavell’s work on marriage [. . .] that
               there is no such thing as marriage: there is only remarriage, day after day” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.walker.html">par. 12</a>) In short, marriage is also a figure of the everyday, the ordinary. This way of associating
               marriage with the diurnal cuts two ways (at least). On the one hand, as the preceding
               quotations make clear, it exposes in its structure the marriage bond and everything
               figured by that bond to the condition of separateness it is conventionally imagined
               to allay, a move at once desentimentalizing and dramatizing. On the other hand, that
               marriage (which is to say, remarriage) should be the privileged figure for this (condition
               of) commitment to the everyday accentuates the risk of conflating the ordinary with
               the normative, and, still today, specifically, the heteronormative. In this respect,
               Emily Sun’s treatment of marriage and friendship as virtually interchangeable “conditioned
               forms of intimacy,” while eliding the specifically institutional nature of marriage
               (as Cavell observes, “If marriage is the emblem of intimacy, it is equally the emblem
               of institutions”), has the virtue of making room within a discussion of Cavellian
               marriage for the homoerotic intensities of Shelley’s “Julian and Maddalo.”</p>
            <p>Sun’s essay is also distinctive in locating in Cavell’s account of Romanticism a <em>critique </em>of its “defects” or “defaults”: more specifically, Romanticism’s disappointment with
               the Kantian “settlement” or bargain with skepticism (relinquishment of knowledge of
               the thing-in-itself, in exchange for an intelligible phenomenal world) as leading
               for Cavell to its own problematic bargaining with “animism” (thus seeming, as Cavell
               remarks at one point—though speaking, in the first instance, of himself—to “exchange
               one form of craziness for another”). To pursue this reading of Cavell, Sun has to
               disregard his explicit statement that “[t]he matter of animism is not going to be
               easy to state, because it has been badly misconceived (though perhaps it no longer
               is) as something Romantics embrace” (<em>Quest </em>53), but it is useful to be reminded that Cavell’s relationship with Romanticism is
               indeed shadowed by a philosophical uneasiness vis-à-vis the claims of literature that
               does not enter into his relationship with, say, Shakespeare.</p>
            <p>It is thus indeed telling, as Sun emphasizes, that the last of the 1983 Beckman Lectures,
               which form the first part of <em>In Quest of the Ordinary </em>and constitute Cavell’s most sustained explicit engagement with British Romanticism,
               in fact turns to a reading of <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, for something like a dramatization in its final scene of a solution to the problems
               Romanticism poses “in its efforts at re-animation of the world and recovery of (interest
               in) the ordinary” (Sun par. 2). Accordingly the last third of Sun’s essay is likewise
               devoted to tracking this reading, while the first half reads “Julian and Maddalo”
               and in particular the fate of Julian, as “an unconnected man,” as dramatizing “a forfeit
               of the quest for the ordinary” (Sun par. 9). The theoretical hinge of Sun's argument,
               however, turns on Cavell's concern with how the Ancient Mariner “takes his tale to
               compete with the prospect of marriage” (<em>Quest</em> 64). Since the burden of that tale is, of course, "to love and reverence...all things
               that God made and loveth," and moreover to find the celebration of such love and reverence
               "far sweeter than the marriage feast," one may well understand that concern as a further
               moment in a critique of Romantic animism. In turning towards what Sun, borrowing a
               phrase from Cavell, calls "intimacy at large" (think Schiller's sloppy "<em>Kuss der ganzen Welt</em>"), Romanticism turns away from the "conditioned intimacies" of our shared criteria
               in language, without which nothing, and no one, can count (a further aspect of Sun's
               essay, as Eric Lindstrom notes, being its careful attention to Cavell's use of economic
               metaphors—of which Romanticism’s “bargain” with skepticism or animism would be yet
               another instance).</p>
            <p>The phrase "intimacy at large" occurs in the course of what Cavell calls his "way
               of figuring" the Mariner's moral: "To marry now is to be willing to have a further
               adventure of aloneness...as if marriage is a further investment of our narcissism....
               [F]or that very reason this intimacy cannot be celebrated, or sanctified; there is
               no outside to it.... Then the Mariner's may in this way be a message of romanticism
               as such, that there is an intimacy at large, and that poetry is responsible for giving
               it expression" (<em>Quest</em> 55-6). The originality of Sun's reading is to hear in these words a "critique of
               Romanticism," rather than, as I find myself inclined to take them, a possible critique
               of what it is "to marry now." In fact, Cavell's "way of figuring" does not, I think,
               quite allow us to locate where his investment lies, as though there is "an intimacy
               at large" in his prose, not in the sense of embracing everything at once, but in the
               sense in which we may speak of a fugitive being "at large," evading the detection
               of the authorities.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Perhaps what gets pinned down as Romanticism's "animism" also involves an "intimacy
                  at large" in this sense. Consider these lines from "To My Sister," written while William
                  and Dorothy were keeping house at Alfoxden and caring for the illegitimate child of
                  a friend (thus the original title, "Lines Written at a small distance from my House

                  </blockquote> Someone might say these lines are guilty of animism in the sense of attributing feeling
                  to the world "at large." But if love is here “stealing” across boundaries, what passes
                  between earth and man is continuous with the vows which pass unspoken in the lines
                  the poet writes for his sister’s reading (“Some silent laws our hearts may make/ Which
                  they shall long obey” [ll. 29-30]), and which make of the poem a kind of epithalamion,
                  but an epithalamion celebrating a moment and a form of relationship for which there
                  precisely were not and could not be publically established forms of consecrations
                  and which it thus becomes the task and raison d’être of the poem to create.

               <p>This brings me back to the issue of intersubjectivity as the sphere in which the acknowledgement
                  of relationship and separateness is to be played out. As the varying emphases of these
                  five essays bear witness, Cavell’s work, like Romanticism itself, moves between questions
                  about my relationship to the world and questions about my relation to others. While
                  there is plenty of reason to construe this movement as a development—thus <em>The Claim of Reason </em>passes from “Skepticism and the Existence of the World” in Part II to “Skepticism
                  and the Problem of Others” in Part IV, as <em>The Prelude </em>seeks to pass “From Love of Nature to Love of Man”—in the end that crossing seems
                  to me no more decided, nor would one want it to be, in Cavell than it is in Wordsworth.
                  Having explored the way in which Austen’s use of free indirect style frees her protagonists
                  from the “burden that Cavell takes as the mark of secular individuals—that of making
                  themselves known and accepting to be known by one another” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 11</a>), Anne-Lise François is led to ask, “What would it mean to reimagine marriage as
                  something occurring between novelist/narrator and protagonist, rather than according
                  to heteronormative assumptions, between hero and heroine” (<a class="link_ref" href="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 14</a>)? Perhaps nothing more, I am inclined to surmise, than to imagine a child wed to
                  its doll or its truck. This is to suggest, first of all, that the oscillation in Cavell’s
                  stagings of skepticism as between what I will call the problem of object relations
                  and “the problem of others” should be thought of as continuing to underwrite his thinking
                  about marriage (which is not to say that they are simply analogues of one another
                  since, to begin with, the one predicates asymmetry while the other symmetry); and
                  secondly, and more crucially for me, that this oscillation is intimately involved
                  in experiences of reading and writing and the pre-verbal processes of symbol-formation
                  that precede them.

                           for whom “in writing the lines mean roads and the letters ride on motor-bicycles—on
                           the pen—upon them. For instance, ‘i’ and ‘e’ ride together on a motor-bicycle that
                           is usually driven by the ‘i’ and they love each other with a tenderness quite unknown
                           in the real world” (317, Klein’s emphasis).</span></div>
                  </div> In his “Afterword” to <em>The End of the Line</em>, Neil Hertz observes how “because the frame separating the author/reader from the
                  work is permeable—and has to be, if the work is to be read at all—a play develops
                  between author/reader and text, regardless of the degree of autobiographical likeness
                  with which a particular surrogate is represented” (220), thus elaborating on his preceding,
                  more schematic, analysis of how “a differential play between subject and object can
                  find its echo and emblem ‘within’ the nominal object” (218). The lightly ethical cast
                  of François’ interest in how the play of free indirect style "frees characters from
                  the work of...making themselves legible to others" invites consideration in the context
                  of such reflections and may justifiably be seen as declining Cavell's "conception
                  of marriage as a kind of shorthand for the ongoing and difficultly evinceable project
                  of acknowledgment" (par. 7). That she should be led, however, to locate these degrees
                  of freedom at least partially in response to Cavell’s writings on Romanticism, acknowledgement,
                  and marriage speaks to just how continuously Cavell’s working of these themes and
                  wooings of his reader leaves itself open to perpetual interruption.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In what follows I use the word “theory” idiomatically and without precise definition,
               but always with the understanding that literary studies has functioned as its primary
               institutional base of operations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Cavell’s early work did not of course develop in response to deconstruction, but it
               did develop in response to a shared set of problems about the relationship of language
               and subjectivity inherited from Romanticism, and may usefully be thought of as simultaneously
               attracted to and resistant of something like the route of response deconstruction
               was to pursue. Because I see Cavell’s work as intimately exposed to the attraction
               of what it resists (and which he figures as “skepticism”), I also see it as articulating
               (one mode of) theory’s resistance to itself, thus not simply countering it from the
               “outside.” Here I have in mind Paul de Man’s statement at the end of “The Resistance
               to Theory,” “Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory since theory <em>is</em> itself this resistance” (19). One way in which deconstruction may be seen as having
               enacted this relation of self-resistance is in its transition from a predominantly
               topological model, organized around the inversion and displacement of inside-outside
               (and thus center-periphery) oppositions, to a performative model concerned with, to
               borrow again from de Man, “the disruptive intertwining of trope and performance” (<em>Allegories</em> ix) I find it notable that this development occurs in part through an engagement
               with Austin’s distinction between constative and performative utterances (a distinction,
               it is often forgotten, that Austin blurs in the same talk where he initially draws
               it [246ff]), while Wittgenstein (whom de Man curiously styles a “philosopher of science”
               [<em>Allegories</em> 17] in one of two explicit references I’m aware of, the other being to the <em>Tractatus </em>as “scientific rather than literary” [<em>Allegories</em> 111) remained off-limits, notwithstanding the occasional effort to promote a dialogue,
               such as Henry Staten’s <em>Derrida and Wittgenstein</em>. Motivated in part by my desire to stimulate a “conversation” between Derrida and
               Cavell, I recall asking Derrida in the early eighties whether he didn’t think that
               deconstruction might enter into a productive engagement with Wittgenstein. His answer
               was a decided no, though he went on to allow that with Austin “il y’a quelque chose
               à faire.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               part by Eddington himself. The title of the chapter from which the passage is drawn
               is “Science and Mysticism” (a title which undoubtedly attracted Benjamin’s attention),
               while the chapter’s theme is that “The physicist now regards the external world in
               a way which I can only describe as more mystical, though not less exact and practical,
               than that which prevailed some years ago, when it was taken for granted that nothing
               could be true unless an engineer could make a model of it” (344). The cited passage
               itself is immediately preceded by the statement that “the deepest philosophical researches
               as to the nature of the Deity may give a conception equally out of proportion for

               present context, it is worth noting that Cavell’s relation to Romanticism is one of
