               <h1><span class="head">“A Modest Creed”: Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>A neglected book by D. G. James, <em>Scepticism and Poetry</em> (1937), works out a systematic argument in keeping with T. E. Hulme’s pronouncement
               that Romanticism is spilt religion. James argues, thinking mainly of Wordsworth, that
               the Romantic imagination is a secular negation of religion—in other words, that the
               visionary life of poetry fundamentally opposes the tenets of received religion. Yet
               further, the Romantic imagination as James views it arises from a necessary basis
               in skepticism, not just from the antinomian heresies (emphasized by T. S. Eliot) that
               moved Harold Bloom to call Romanticism “protestant” in the Introduction to the second
               edition of <em>The Visionary Company</em> (Bloom xvii-xxi). The argument goes that when you invent gods or even interpret them,
               you don’t believe in one, just as when you invent objects, worlds, and other minds
               or recognize that you need to construct such things through interpretation, you’re
               uncertain about their existence, or their exact nature in and of themselves. James
               does not address what Stanley Cavell calls “object skepticism and other minds skepticism”
               (or “skepticism and solipsism” [<em>Quest</em> 55]), and Cavell for the most part does not emphasize religious skepticism. It still
               seems to me, however, that if we transvalue James’s critique of the Romantic imagination
               into something like simple description, we point directly forward to Cavell’s concerns
               and back to Shelley’s—including, incidentally, his announced “necessity of atheism.”</p>
            <p>Cavell, similarly, sees skepticism as a necessary point of departure whenever he confronts
               the wholly secular dispute between the two traditions of philosophy he works with,
               and between which he hopes in some respects to mediate. From among many possible moments
               of this sort I single out the anecdote in his recent autobiography, <em>Little Did I Know</em>, about a sneering positivist teaching assistant he encountered when he was at UCLA:
               <span class="quote">‘As I approached the group the teaching assistant was saying [to Hans Meyerhoff]:
                  “We know now that every assertion is either true or false or else neither true nor
                  false; in the former case the assertion is meaningful, in the latter case cognitively
                  meaningless. If you go on saying to me that this line of Rilke’s is cognitively meaningful,
                  I smile at you.” (<em>Little Did I Know</em> 252-53)’</span> Cavell says Meyerhoff, in an unguarded moment, was then drawn into a dispute on the
               positivist’s turf—that is, within the roped-off echo chamber of the verifiable and
               the falsifiable that has caused so many philosophers and nearly all scientists to
               turn a deaf ear to poetry. But Cavell, in questioning the true and false as a sufficient
               condition for knowledge (“certainty is not enough,” he says in the early <em>Must We Mean What We Say?</em> [258]), clearly saw this moment as a spot of time, his morning of election: “To discover
               a different mode of response to such an assault,” he writes, “became as if on the
               spot an essential part of my investment in what I would call philosophy” (<em>Little Did I Know</em> 253).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We can see how Shelley puts this dispute, clearly a version of what Socrates called
                  the ancient quarrel between the poets and the philosophers, in the facetiously complex
                  opening genealogy of the witch in <em>The Witch of Atlas</em>:

                  </blockquote> Error and Truth are interdependent concepts rendered foundationless by change and
                  time; yet change and time themselves beget error and truth because flux makes fixity
                  seem desirable. And then, once they are empowered as permanent dictators of thought,
                  error and truth leave poetry nothing to say. Up to a point, this is the argument of
                  the<em>Defence of Poetry</em> writ small: far from being even the verifiable and the falsifiable, error and truth
                  are merely the hardening of the arteries of metaphor into the large codes of fraud
                  and woe that govern human thought. Here is where skepticism plays its role. As Stuart
                  Curran says, “the point of skepticism is to free one from those external forms that
                  settle questions by tyrannizing the mind” (Curran 205
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div>). Poetry is not superseded once and for all by science and political economy, as
                  the proto-positivist Peacock had argued in the pamphlet that provoked Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>, <em>The Four Ages of Poetry</em>. To the contrary, poetry is, through change and time, not only the origin but the
                  perpetual renewal and reinvigoration of science. As Emerson says in “Fate” (echoing
                  Shelley and quoted by Cavell), “We are lawgivers” (qtd. in <em>Quest</em> 40).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Or rather, as Shelley concludes in <em>The Witch of Atlas</em>, poetry <em>would</em> have continued to breathe the life of metaphor back into the death-in-life of equationality
               if it hadn’t sequestered itself, like Shelley’s witch, from all things mortal. If
               this had not happened, in other words, poetry would have made possible the paradigm
               shifts altering Thomas Kuhn’s “normal science.” It is to be feared, Shelley says in
               the proleptic stanza I have quoted, that the Malthusian triumph of enlightenment (or
               triumph of light) is so complete that error and truth have swept the field and left
               nothing for “learned rhyme” to revitalize. From the couplings of equationality—from
               all those sterile a = b’s—nothing can be <em>born</em>. Malthus’s proposed birth control is realized as the very essence of normal science
               itself, in contrast with the Shelleyan metaphor proclaiming that <em>love</em> is metaphor because both love and metaphor involve endlessly renewed perceptions
               of similitude in dissimilitude, always in studied opposition to political economy
               (Cf. Pulos, “Shelley and Malthus,” esp. 115.) In <em>Defence of Poetry </em>the great secret of morals is love (517; cf. Fry, “Shelley’s <em>Defence of Poetry</em> in Our Time”; Hogle, “Shelley’s Poetics” 188; Keach 1-41). Cavell would sometimes
               call the great secret of morals love as well, and sometimes “acknowledgment.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The trouble is, though, that in <em>The Witch of Atlas</em> there is no amorous procreativity, as the witch and her hermaphrodite are scarcely
                  in a position to give birth to anything. By 1820, Shelley’s thinking about poetry
                  as a happy consequence of that skepticism that subverts error and truth is beginning
                  to be less confident than Cavell’s. Cavell warns, in the Introduction to <em>Disowning Knowledge</em>, against “the application of some philosophically independent problematic of skepticism”
                  to the very literature that discloses the problematic (1). I hope not to violate this
                  warning, but for a clearer sense of what might best be called a mutual reading of
                  Shelley and Cavell, I shall find it necessary to go back a year or two in Shelley’s
                  work, and of course to explore Cavell’s understanding of Romanticism as well. But
                  I shall come back to Shelley’s latest works in the end.

                           criticism, the arguing point that rescued him from his dismissal—by Arnold following
                           through to Leavis and beyond—as an ineffectual and muddle-headed idealist. One increasingly
                           hears (skeptical) impatience with the acceptance of skepticism in Shelley as a given,
                           but it has not yet been dislodged. The pioneering work was that of Pulos, The Deep
                           Truth. Since then the most sustained research aimed at pinning down the exact nature
                           of Shelley’s skepticism has been that of Rubin, Reiman (see Intervals of Inspiration,

            <p>In <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, Cavell’s interest in British Romanticism is confined chiefly to Wordsworth and Coleridge,
               but it is helpful to begin with his one mention of Shelley, introduced in contrast
               with the other two: <span class="quote">‘Romanticism’s work [. . .] interprets itself [. . .] as the task of bringing the
                  world back, as to life. This may, in turn, present itself as the quest for a return
                  to the ordinary, or of it, a new creation of our habitat; or as the quest, away from
                  that, for the creation of a new habitation: Wordsworth and Coleridge would represent
                  the former alternative; Blake and Shelley, I believe, the latter. (<em>Quest</em> 52-53)’</span> This passage explains Cavell’s confinement of his argument to Wordsworth and Coleridge.
               Such is Cavell’s primary interest throughout his career—inclusive of the film and
               Shakespeare criticism—in the recovery of the quotidian; but it nonetheless identifies
               clearly the moment of crisis turned to advantage from which Shelley’s poetry arises.</p>
            <p>Our hope to inhabit another world can only derive from our uncertainty about whether
               or how we inhabit this one. “The Sensitive-Plant,” for example, describes the death
               and putrefaction of this world, a garden, which follows upon the sudden death of the
               Lady who has tended it—one of Shelley’s many figures for inspiration, or Intellectual
               Beauty. Within the body of the poem no apparent reversal of this decay seems possible:
               If winter’s here no spring can be expected. But then in his so-called “Conclusion”
               (and the first-time reader may feel surprised that such a conclusive poem would need
               a surplus conclusion), in the same facetious and self-effacing tone that comes and
               goes in <em>The Witch of Atlas</em>, Shelley announces an article of faith. He does not know what became of the Sensitive-Plant
               or the Lady, he says, but still,</p>

               <p>It is the obverse of this speculation that provides its logic. If we were certain
                  about what life is, if we placed all our confidence in some semblance of the real
                  as truth, then our thinking would be <em>conditioned</em> by certainty, by the dogmatic finality of error and truth. In that case, accordingly,
                  we would be certain that death is, as it certainly seems to be, the opposite or absence
                  of life. There would be no scope or opening for conjecture, hopeful or otherwise.
                  But suppose life could be conceived as dead or insubstantial, as Shelley says here
                  and as Cavell says it is in the moment of Romantic skepticism. It could follow then
                  that death, which certainly does seem at least different from life, if not opposite,
                  may be the alternative habitation Cavell or Shelley seeks, where the plant and the
                  Lady realize an existence that in life was only conjectural.

            <p>This turn of thought exhibits the necessary grounding of poetry in skepticism of which
               D. G. James felt obliged to disapprove. In more than one sense, <em>certainty closes the subject</em>. Shelley makes the same move again in <em>Adonais</em>. Here he contrives to reconcile the rhetoric of faith-based consolation in Christian
               elegy with the liberatory moment of skepticism. The despicable Quarterly Reviewer
               is one of the “carrion kites that scream below” (335), kites that soon become carrion
               themselves. This dead vulture, whose “cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame”
               (342), raises, in his very mode of being, the question whether <em>anything</em> here on earth is alive. In doing so he proves—proves unfalsifiably, that is—that

            <p> In a more fully political register the inversion of life and death enabled by skepticism
               becomes the proto-Marxist dialectic epitomized in “England in 1819,” where leeches
               “drop, blind in blood, without a blow,” and all the evils of the Regency are “graves
               from which a glorious Phantom may/ Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day” (6, 13-14).
               The political dialectic is worked through again as a complex figure of longing in
               the “Ode to the West Wind.” It is only in urbane and colloquial poems like the “Letter
               to Maria Gisborne” that the death-in-life premise is openly acknowledged as a hyperbole
               to which exceptions may or may not prove the rule. In that poem, Leigh Hunt is “one
               of those happy souls/ Who are the salt of the Earth, and without whom/ This world
               would smell like what it is, a tomb” (210-11). It is not clear whether Hunt is alive
               in his role as a preservative of dead meat, but at least he may be.</p>
            <p>The notion that those who are dead in soul are also somehow lifeless in body and spread
               death by contagion is present in Shelley’s poetry from the beginning, as in “To the
               Emperors of Russia and Austria” from the Esdaile Notebook: “No, cowards! Ye are calm
               and still, / Keen frosts that blight the human bud” (11-12). Here, though, not all
               the tyrants are in suspended animation, as Napoleon is very much alive. Also, the
               dialectical implications of this moment, which is Shelley’s socialized version of
               Coleridge’s death-in-life, are not in play: no future life follows in speculation
               from present death. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A fuller and more subtle version of this idea in the later verse, only seemingly undialectical,
                  does arrive at a conjecture about eternal life by detaching the principle of life
                  from its evanescent material manifestations. The Cloud in the poem of that name is
                  sometimes both visible and tangible, sometimes invisible and latent, but always and
                  forever, as an allegory of the soul, alive: “I change, but I cannot die” (76). Both
                  the evidence of the senses and the premises of scientific “error and truth” insist
                  on the ephemerality of living being, as in an organic process world. Shelley however
                  insists on another way of reading science itself, in this case meteorological science.
                  In a mechanized world like that of Holbach, “the” cloud can persist only as the persistence
                  of substance, chemical or otherwise, and “cannot die” only because it has never lived.
                  Shelley for his part does not necessarily disagree with Holbach in this poem; for
                  him it is not finally the Lucretian persistence of organic matter that defies death,
                  but rather the cloud as <em>idea</em>—as the necessity governing the cycle of clouds—that is alive. In lending the cloud
                  reflection and the power of speech Shelley is not just making an object conscious,
                  like a talking animal. (This is never what he does, for example, with his many choruses
                  of elements, nor for that matter with the West Wind.) Rather he metonymically conceives
                  the expressiveness of thinking as the expressiveness of what is thought—the idea—as
                  though the idea were itself consciousness, hence vital. Skepticism in this case, although
                  it allows a passage from the material to the immaterial, is revealed through the necessary
                  bridge of metonymy from thinking to what is thought. Yet if the thought thus enabled
                  turns out to consist in saying that vitality is not an attribute of organic substance
                  but somehow transcends it, this metonymy actually corresponds to the dialectic of
                  Shelley’s moral and social metaphors. The living death, again (frozen, “calm,” and
                  so on), of flawed human subjects lends plausibility to the conjecture about life elsewhere.
                  Surely it is reasonable, Shelley supposes, that life must be somewhere.

                           paper. </span></div>
                  </div> Romanticism is an expression of disappointment at Kant’s “settlement” with skepticism.
                  We can build up the world through the senses in a reliable way, Kant says, but reason
                  discovers itself in its unconditioned autonomy precisely through the realization that
                  we cannot ever know the thing in itself. About this Cavell says, by now rather famously:
                  “You don’t—do you—have to be a Romantic to feel sometimes about that settlement: Thanks
                  for nothing” (<em>Quest </em>31). As I’ve already suggested, Shelley, by contrast, arguably sees his opening, his
                  chance, in this very settlement, even though he and his philosophical mentor, Sir
                  William Drummond, disliked Kant (cf. <em>Peter Bell the Third</em> 518-32). Certainly, however, Cavell in his view of the matter has identified the structure
                  of the Romantic quest in a Shelleyan way. That form of Romantic irony which is a vacillation
                  between desire for unmediated intimacy and desire for transcendence—the problematic,
                  likewise, of Faust’s two souls—can be understood as an opening for effective dialectical
                  negation. Shelley sees this moment as <em>sheer</em> negation. Mont Blanc is “remote, serene, and inaccessible” (97), a whiteness or a
                  Wordsworthian blank. Volcanic as he may be (cf. Matthews in Reiman and Fraistat 558),
                  Demogorgon is still a formless darkness mounting the chariot of the appointed Hour
                  not as an agent but as an allegorical expression of the simple fact that Jupiter’s
                  time has come. It is against this blankness or darkness, this denial of agency, meaning,
                  causation, or creative origination, that as an act of defiance “the human mind’s imaginings,”
                  as Shelley puts it at the end of “Mont Blanc” (143), autonomously and groundlessly
                  create meanings, including a meaning even for Mont Blanc itself. As Tillotama Rajan
                  says, “[the mountain’s] very existence as a form which is physically present yet spiritually
                  vacant provokes the mind into constantly constructing and deconstructing its ideals”
                  (Rajan 87). “The deep truth,” according to Demogorgon, “is imageless” (<em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, II, iv, 116). The indescribable being-what-they-are of things-as-they-are that Shelley
                  after Hobbes and Godwin also calls Necessity, is the “vacancy” (cf. Shelley, “On Life”
                  507) that skeptical philosophers must sometimes leave us with. It is a useful vacancy
                  that opens up unlimited space for the positings of the imagination.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It seems to me that at times Cavell’s argument would be more clearly delimited if
               he would distinguish more emphatically between ontological skepticism (doubt as to
               whether things and other minds exist at all, an emergent modern anxiety that Cavell
               associates with Descartes and Shakespeare) and epistemological skepticism. It is the
               latter, epistemological skepticism, which clearly emerges from the Kantian “settlement”
               as the concern of Romanticism. Kant makes it evident in the passage Cavell quotes
               from the <em>Prolegomena</em> that there is really no ontological stumbling block to pause over, at least for pre-critical
               thought: “The understanding therefore,” says Kant, “by assuming appearances, grants
               the existence of things in themselves also, and so far we may say, that the representation
               of such things as form the basis of phenomena, consequently of mere creations of the
               understanding, is not only admissible, but unavoidable” (qtd. in <em>Quest</em> 30). None of the Romantic authors Cavell treats in <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> doubt the existence of the world. They only wonder what its nature is, particularly
               whether it is alive or dead, and whether the imagination can bring it to life, or
               back to life. It is true that as a boy Wordsworth needed to hug a tree to be sure
               it existed, but we are likely to agree that that is <em>not</em> a characteristic moment, any more than the Intimations Ode is a characteristic poem.
               Wordsworth’s childhood idealism vertigo does not in fact play a role in Cavell’s consideration
               of that poem. As for Shelley, he is emphatic as early as 1813: “I have examined Hume’s
               reasonings with respect to the non-existence of external things [. . .]. What am I
               to think of a philosophy which conducts to such a conclusion?” (<em>Letters</em>, I, 380) The apothegm one finds in “On Life” and elsewhere (with something like it
               in the Conclusion to “The Sensitive-Plant”), “nothing exists but as it is perceived”
               (506), is quite often read as though existence itself were at issue. But Shelley is
               here simply agreeing with the whole skeptical tradition, not just Kant, that it is
               the <em>nature</em> of things’ existence that depends on perception. The Romantic worry, I think it fair
               to generalize, concerns not the nonexistence of things but their intrinsic insignificance.
               Let us assume, then, that the skepticism that matters for present purposes, as would
               not necessarily be the case if one were a Cartesian or a Shakespearian (in Cavell’s
               view: I take Hamlet to be in Shelley’s camp), is epistemological, not ontological.</p>
            <p>Cavell argues, in any case, that the First Generation’s response to the Kantian settlement
               was animism (cf., <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Quest</em> 69). Josh Wilner’s Cavellian reading of “Tintern Abbey” builds on that claim until
               he reaches his linguistic turn. There is no doubt that as a matter of intellectual
               history, still best documented by H. W. Piper in <em>The Active Universe</em>, animism as sanctioned in science by Priestley, Erasmus Darwin, and others was indeed
               a temporary investment for the authors of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. By the time of Coleridge’s response to Wordsworth in “Dejection,” however, this
               belief has faltered. In our life alone, says Coleridge, does nature live. I myself
               would argue, in any case, that the animism even of “Tintern Abbey” is expressed at
               best ambiguously and can just as easily be read as a shockingly radical materialism.
               My reading of Wordsworth’s quest for the unmediated objecthood of the world, wholly
               in agreement as I am with Cavell about Wordsworth’s desire to find common ground between
               consciousness and realia, inclines me to believe that the reunion is not noumenal
               but phenomenal. Our “widest commonalty” is not with a responsive life in things but
               rather the widest <em>somatic</em> commonalty, or community, of the poet’s embodied being with the being of other bodies.
               Not animated bodies, that is, but bodies as things in the world. Hence the need in
               Wordsworth to reduce consciousness to a moment of almost impercipient marginality,
               idiocy, senility, or emptying out such that “‘all is tranquil as a dreamless sleep’”
               (Fry, <em>Wordsworth</em>, <em>passim</em>).</p>
            <p>In any case, even if one refuses the premise of animism while retaining the logic
               of its desire, that does not alter the problematic of skepticism as Cavell presents
               it—for example as follows: <span class="quote">‘but since [our very inhabitation of the ordinary] is from time to time perceptible
                  to us—we who have constructed it—as extraordinary, we conceive that some place elsewhere,
                  or this place otherwise constructed, must be what is ordinary to us, must be what
                  Romantics [. . .] call “home.” (<em>Quest</em> 9)’</span> For Shelley in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, the ordinary (in Cavell’s sense, that from which the large codes of fraud and woe
               have estranged us) is “this place” otherwise constructed, “somewhat changed” (III,
               iv, 71). For the Shelley of “Sensitive-Plant” or “Adonais,” on the other hand, it
               is “some place elsewhere.” The painted veil which those who live call life is the
               skeptical ground for any construction of homecoming, here or elsewhere. It is well,
               therefore, to pause for a moment over what Cavell means by “construction,” as that
               will bring me to the threshold of another way of understanding construction, a view
               in agreement with Wilner’s and one implicit in this paper, no doubt, from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The first part of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> is devoted to reflections on “criteria” in Wittgenstein, distantly related to what
               J. L. Austin calls “conditions” governing the effectiveness of utterances. It is importantly
               true, as Cavell points out, that “the fate of criteria, or their limitation, reveals
               [. . .] the truth of skepticism” (<em>Claim</em> 7ff.). He additionally insists, however, that for Wittgenstein and Austin such markers
               of skepticism (if either philosopher is really prepared to call them that) are what
               establish a community of understanding, ensuring the avoidance of interpretive misfire
               among all who share the criteria relevant to a given communication. This is an implicitly
               communitarian or political idea that Shelley enters into wholeheartedly. The claim
               of reason is that to know myself, to understand why I am saying something and what
               are the stakes of my utterance, is to know shared criteria. By this means I understand
               myself politically, as someone who belongs in a community of minds (cf. <em>Claim</em> 25). As in Blake and Shelley, to achieve individuation, which is to abandon the mere
               given-ness of truth and error as certainty, is not just to share criteria (that would
               still perhaps partake of certainty) but to know that they <em>are</em> criteria. In that case they are at once “ordinary”—effective with or without reflection—and
               also <em>poetized</em>, constructively emergent from skepticism.</p>
            <p>The limiting power of criteria (you can’t move your king into check or move a pawn
               backward, for example), which discloses their arbitrary function, highlights the importance
               of agreement about them precisely as a consequence of their groundlessness. Their
               <em>shared</em> coherence is enabled by the absence of correspondence, about which all and sundry
               might disagree. Thus when we acknowledge the conditioning of what can be thought and
               said, even if we are Romantic visionaries, there can be no danger of solipsism or
               private language, not even the danger of wild deviation among those who are positively
               certain of “the facts.” This is clearest when our criteria misfire. Fascinated by
               Austin’s example of the goldfinch at the bottom of the garden in the essay called
               “Other Minds,” Cavell, following Austin, states in more than one place that goldfinches
               have red heads (cf., e. g., <em>Claim</em> 132). But what we agree to call a goldfinch in the United States has a black head.
               Only the European goldfinch has a red head, or more precisely a red face. We do not
               invoke this or any other trait of the bird (That particular bird? The species?—the
               American females of which, by the way, have grayish-yellow heads)—we do not invoke
               this trait as evidence of the bird’s existence as a thing in itself or even that of
               the species or the male of the species. We invoke it as a limiting criterion that
               distinguishes this bird from other birds; hence, in this case, a geographical context
               is necessary for the criterion to work. <em>If criteria are truly markers of skepticism, in other words, they need to be recognized
                  as semiotic, not semantic</em>. The likelihood that neither Wittgenstein nor Cavell would agree with this conclusion
               perhaps raises the question just how firmly <em>their</em> arguments are rooted in the necessity of skepticism. But Shelley in any case would,
               I think, agree, following Locke among others. Even though his “almost” in the following
               passage may imply that he only accepts the weak form of the argument, he still does
               say: “almost all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others”
               (“On Life” 507).</p>
            <p>One thing is clear, though. For Saussure as much as for Wittgenstein or Cavell, there
               is no private language. And likewise for Shelley. Limitation is fate, for Shelley
               as much as for Emerson. Limitation can also be called Necessity, as in the “necessity
               of atheism,” which does not mean that God does not exist but rather that our limited
               nature does not enable us to posit God’s existence. Contrary to appearance, this mode
               of limitation is a guarantor of freedom. It is not in the nature of water to flow
               uphill; hence, it feels unnatural when the boat of the Witch of Atlas is piloted uphill
               by the hermaphrodite. That is the limitation, the necessity governing the behavior
               of water, as one might say; yet when water is free to flow downhill it realizes its
               nature. When a dam is put across it, its nature is inhibited, revealing the politically
               crucial distinction in Shelley between <em>necessity</em> as freedom, the self-actualizing nature of things, and <em>power</em> as constraint, the coercive denaturing of things. The individual, in sum, is in and
               of itself already the political, just as Cavell argues in <em>The Claim of Reason</em>; and that is how the Shelley of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> can join Blake and Hegel in writing the great novel of individual consciousness and
               the history of the human mind in society simultaneously.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The medium of this allegorical possibility (possible because after all ontogeny does
                  recapitulate phylogeny), and likewise the domain of limiting criteria, is language.
                  Language in turn contributes to the necessity, the limitation, of human being. It
                  is just here that we may find the later Shelley straying from Cavell’s understanding
                  of the liberating power of skepticism and moving closer to a form of linguistic determinism
                  that has had a more signal influence on literary studies than Cavell has had to date.
                  This emergent idea in Shelley must evidently have moved the colleagues who banded
                  together in the book called <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em> to take <em>The Triumph of Life</em> for their common subject matter.

                  </div> Shelley introduces his own linguistic turn of thought twice in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> itself, and likewise in the <em>Defence of Poetry</em>, but manages in those texts to shield himself from its unsettling consequences.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The <em>Defence</em> repeatedly follows eighteenth-century speculation (together with recent interest
               in the Homeric cycle) in calling language at its origin a “cyclic poem” (e.g., 523),
               a database of dynamic metaphors that all poets access in writing their individual
               fragments. Consider Shelley’s telltale revision in saying that the muse Urania dictated
               to Milton nightly his unpremeditated verse, given that Milton actually says she “<em>inspires easie</em>, or dictates nightly” his unpremeditated verse (532, 532n.). Milton leaves open the
               possibility that inspiration is non-verbal, pre-verbal—in short, that thought precedes
               language—whereas Shelley’s revision insists that inspiration is language itself. The
               “Spirit” that speaks for most of the “Ode to Liberty” is said by the speaker to offer
               the same sort of dictation: “there came / A voice out of the deep: I will <em>record</em> the same” (14-15; italics mine). Comparably, when Asia in Act Two of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> recounts the gifts of Prometheus to man, she says “He gave man speech, and speech
               created thought, / Which is the measure of the universe” (II, iv, 73-74). Earth returns
               to the theme in Act Four when she says “Language is a perpetual Orphic song/ Which
               rules with daedal harmony a throng / Of thoughts and forms, which else senseless and
               shapeless were” (IV, 415-17).</p>
            <p>Shelley under this emergent semiotic outlook is no longer confirming the possibility
               of belief in the way he might have managed when he really <em>could</em> imagine skepticism to be a sort of mulchification of dead leaves that promises a
               coming spring. Such signs of linguistic determinism as those I have just enumerated
               do not help Shelley to believe that mere wind can be through his lips the trumpet
               of a prophecy, any more than Hobbes believed it when he said that to be inspired is
               to be blown up like a bagpipe. In <em>The Triumph of Life</em> inspiration comes by shapes all light in whatever form has become destructive at
               relentlessly repeated intervals. As John Hodgson puts it, “the triumph of life is
               the failure of imagination” (Hodgson 619). This misfortune occurs not because inspiration
               doesn’t arrive, just as it always did, in the form of a dictating Intellectual Beauty
               (“herself a poet,” as Shelley said as early as <em>Alastor</em> [161]). The muse of light has still arrived. The misfortune occurs because what Shelley
               seems now to conceive as the <em>Nachträglichkeit</em> or supplementarity of language constantly erases successive traces of itself in a
               loop or “fold” (<em>Triumph</em> 547) of repetition-with-a-difference that feels like a Dantesque punishment. As Shelley’s
               Rousseau says in the complex figures (or “disfigurations”) canonized by Paul de Man
               (“Shelley Disfigured” 99): first, “And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune
               / To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot / The thoughts of him who gazed
               on them, and soon / All that was seemed as if it had been not” (382-85); and again,
               having drunk the cup of Nepenthe offered by the beautiful but already dissolving shape
               all light, Rousseau says: </p>

            <p> Yet even as early as “Ozymandias” the lone and level sands stretch far away, obliterating
               any form of confident knowledge (that of art as well as tyranny) that can be inscribed.
               The arbitrariness of language never would have emerged as what Saussure considers
               the essential fact of language as long as the referents of signs continued to be known
               in themselves with certainty. This arbitrariness can be accepted in relation to “error
               and truth” as long as it can be cordoned off as a preventable liability or trivial
               crux; but when viewed as the fundamental property of language it is disclosed both
               by and as skepticism. This “strong” conception of the semiotic works well enough for
               Shelley—and perhaps implicitly for Cavell—as long as it can be seen to enable constructive
               speculation. But when signifiers become traces that endlessly erase traces, Shelley’s
               “Life,” itself the animation here or elsewhere about which he had hitherto speculated
               hopefully, simply pulverizes the imagination, so that “[d]eath cannot liberate Rousseau
               from Life” (Dawson 281). The whole process begins when Shelley says, in launching
               his account of Life’s triumphal chariot, “A vision on my brain was rolled” (40).</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">*</p>
            <p>It is important to acknowledge those places in Shelley that would appear at least
               to bracket skepticism. The “Ode to Liberty,” a poem that seems especially ambivalent
               when revisiting Shelley’s typical patterns of thought, puts into linguistic terms,
               again in the optative mode, the famous assertion of the <em>Defence</em>. The mind in creation is a fading coal, reversing the premise that language precedes
               thought and rhetorically implying that thoughts are closer (at least) to realities
               than words: “O, that the words which make the thoughts obscure / From which they spring
               [. . .] / Were stript of their thin masks and various hue” (234-37). Yet language
               deracinated from thought and language productive of thought lead unfortunately to
               the same doubtful result, still leaving it unclear (if, after all, everything else
               is unclear) whether language or thought came first. When hope itself, as a mere word,
               becomes one of the “passions” that destroy hope (as in “Ozymandias” or <em>Triumph</em>), skepticism is no longer constructive but turns grimly pyrrhonic. It is then subject
               to the charge of inadvertent certainty—falling back into the arms of error and truth—to
               which critiques of skepticism have always resorted. “O Heart and Mind and Thoughts
               what thing do you/ Hope to inherit in the grave below?” (“Sonnet: ‘Ye hasten to the
               grave!’” 13-14) The only trace of skepticism here, as Shelley turns against the hope
               of “Sensitive-Plant” and “Adonais,” lies in the improbable notion that rhetorical
               questions are put as questions just in case they may have a surprising answer.</p>
            <p>Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, there is the passage in Shelley’s second Note
               to <em>Hellas</em> (in relation to 197ff.) in which he seems to acknowledge that skepticism is not a
               necessary condition of perception but is itself a conditioned form of perception:
               “That there is a true solution of the riddle [of a supreme being in this context],
               and that in our present state the solution is unattainable by us are propositions
               which may be regarded as equally certain” (462). In our <em>present</em> state? As opposed to some future state enabled by science, or by poetry as science?
               How are we to read this very different sort of profession of hope—different, that
               is, from that which is itself enabled by skepticism? It would appear perhaps that,
               through this “present” qualifier, error and truth have been here restored to Shelley’s
               good graces, and that therefore when the “true solution” is revealed, Peacock will
               turn out to have been right and there will be nothing further for poetry to do after
               all. If the truth is known, why should the atavistic yearnings of poetry be dragged
               in to embellish or undermine it?</p>
            <p>Any sort of special pleading to square this passage with Shelley’s views as set forth
               in the argument of this paper will seem awkward, no doubt, but this much at least
               can be said: If the “true solution” were something comparable to phlogiston or galvanism
               or the elixir vitae, the “secret of life” that many today still patiently seek, then
               Shelley could in this passage be convicted of having failed to learn the lesson from
               adventurers in speculative science that he might have learned best from Swift’s Projectors.
               As with the anecdote of Gertrude Stein’s last words, and as Cavell argues continuously
               in <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, <em>to know what the solution is you have to know what the riddle is</em>. You have to know that riddles, the presumed fundamental questions, are as much conditioned
               by “criteria” as their answers are. We might have thought that Shelley of all people
               would understand that caveat and respond to the dilemma constructively, as he and
               Cavell for the most part attempt to do.</p>
            <p>So if we risk forthwith supposing Shelley not to mean what he says, honoring what
               we take to be his more circumspect outlook, what can Shelley possibly mean in this
               surprising passage from the apparatus to <em>Hellas</em>? What he might mean, and elsewhere says, is that things undoubtedly are what and
               as they are, this state of affairs being what he has always called “necessity.” (The
               far looser sense of the necessary as the self-identity of things is nowadays enshrined
               in the street wisdom of “it is what it is.”) In that case the solution to the “riddle”
               is that only doctrinaire thought supposes there to be either a solution <em>or</em> a riddle. But “our present state”—even Shelley’s own present state—prevents us from
               resting content with this awareness because of what Cavell calls the Romantic impatience
               with Kant’s settlement. As a multitude unarmed with skepticism (hence immersed in
               what Shelley so often bitterly calls “human thought” [e. g., “Hymn to Intellectual
               Beauty” 15]), we seek and nearly always find solutions in ideology. But even as poets,
               Shelley far more sympathetically argues (and Cavell would argue too), in the face
               of that “vacancy” which is not so much a riddle as, simply, “silence and solitude”
               (“Mont Blanc” 144), we express defiance and hope with the aid of the intellectual
               beauty that at the end of “Mont Blanc” Shelley calls “the human mind’s imaginings.”</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Skepticism is often considered the key concept to have emerged in postwar Shelley
               criticism, the arguing point that rescued him from his dismissal—by Arnold following
               through to Leavis and beyond—as an ineffectual and muddle-headed idealist. One increasingly
               hears (skeptical) impatience with the acceptance of skepticism in Shelley as a given,
               but it has not yet been dislodged. The pioneering work was that of Pulos, <em>The Deep Truth</em>. Since then the most sustained research aimed at pinning down the exact nature of
               Shelley’s skepticism has been that of Rubin, Reiman (see <em>Intervals of Inspiration</em>, ch. 5), and Hoagwood. I am encouraged by Hoagwood’s well-informed contention that
               Shelley’s skepticism is dialectical and—to some extent in disagreement with Pulos—epistemological
               rather than ontological. As Hoagwood puts it, cuttingly but I think fairly, “the influential
               accounts of Shelley’s skepticism were written when literary critics were still being
               told that Berkeley and Hume engaged in dogmatic denials” (Hoagwood 20). Skepticism
               can also function as the hesitation in judgment that inhibits moral and political
               agency. See, e. g., Jewett 135-64.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               that life was “nothing,” i.e., not a substance (17-18). In general, supporters of
