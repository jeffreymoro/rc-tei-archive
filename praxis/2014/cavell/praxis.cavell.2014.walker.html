               <h1><span class="head">Austen and Cavell</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In <em>Emma</em>, Frank Churchill begins life as Frank Weston. Jane Austen’s brother, Edward Knight,
               started life as Edward Austen. Closer to home, Stanley Cavell spent the first two
               decades of his life as Stanley Goldstein. In<em>Little Did I Know</em> (2010), Cavell tells the story of how the late adolescent Stan Goldstein performed
               “the wish to name myself” in wartime California: <span class="quote">‘Family names were irrelevant to the neither serious nor nonserious encounters that
                  made up the seascape with girls the world had become. Stan was all that had been called
                  for. But soon after my inward leave-taking from home [. . .] I introduced myself to
                  a young woman as Stan Cavell. The first two syllables of the family’s original Russian
                  name Kavelieruskii [. . .] broke away as cleanly as if I had flawlessly cut a diamond.
                  (200)’</span> As he navigates this passage with perplexed parents and the legal bureaucracy, Cavell
               interprets his action as “declaring the search for a life I could want, not merely
               endure, in America” (202). He thereby understands it, or offers it to our understanding,
               as a perfectionist moment or impulse, posing identity on the cusp of the desire for
               a new life evermore about to be.</p>
            <p>Cavell also unpacks this episode under the sign of adoption, “this adolescent’s way
               of adopting himself” (203). This self-representation as an adoptee builds on an earlier
               moment in the autobiography, where Cavell reports a sense of himself as an “unfound
               foundling” (179), as an unclaimed stranger. Cavell thus pinpoints himself on Freud’s
               map of the family romance, the child for whom identity means inhabiting an adoption
               fantasy of originating elsewhere, of belonging elsewhere or to someone else. Because
               skepticism—the ground bass of Cavell’s work—frames humans as strangers to their own
               circumstances, adoption offers a template for human identity in which there are no
               natives, always already at home. To be human, from this angle, is to experience selfhood
               as adopted. In his recent study of transracial adoption, Mark Jerng foregrounds adoption
               as “the disjunctive act of being taken up into another history and another set of
               conditions and relationships” (xxi). In Cavell’s episode, adopting the identity “Stan
               Cavell” is the outward sign of a corresponding act of estrangement, “my inward leave-taking
               from home.” To leave home is to come home to the homeless condition of being human,
               what Cavell refers to in his primary texts on Romanticism as “our worldlessness or
               homelessness” (<em>Quest </em>32). To exchange Stan Goldstein for Stan Cavell is not to trade a false self for a
               true self, but to embrace the necessary distance between selfhood and absent origin.
               Very much like the unsettling ways the marriage settlement circulates in Cavell’s
               work, adoption beckons in this late autobiographical text as a primary sign of human
               disjunctiveness and estrangement.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Such a model of the human subject calls out Cavell’s comments on “separation” and
                  “parturition” in <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>: “As if all disseverings are invoked in each; as if to say that life no less than
                  death is a condition and process of dissevering; as if to see each of us ‘demanding
                  and answering to our part’ means seeing ourselves as apart from everything of which
                  we are a part, always already dissevered” (<em>Quest</em> 89). Explicitly yoked to his readings of exemplary Romantic texts, Cavell’s essay
                  on <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> interprets Shakespeare’s manifold figures of separation and parturition under the
                  sign of marriage, as he reads the final scene “as, among other things, a wedding ceremony”
                  (97): “Then let us emphasize that this ceremony of union takes the form of a ceremony
                  of separation, thus declaring that the question of two becoming one is just half the
                  problem; the other half is how one becomes two” (100). Here is a way to think about
                  marriage that underwrites Cavell’s resonantly condensed description of marriage as
                  “the mutual acknowledgment of separateness” (178). Cavell’s reading of the problematic
                  of skepticism in <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> assembles themes of doubt, separation, estrangement, dissevering, and parturition
                  to prepare his ultimate claim that a remarkable idea of marriage is at stake in the
                  ultimate scene. But to understand the primary stakes of the play to be marriage is
                  to elide the ways in which those same themes of separation foreground questions about
                  parents and children as well as spouses. My point is that <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> is also a play about adoption, although that term or its cognates never appear in
                  Cavell’s extensive but subordinated attention to the play’s manifold debates about
                  blood issue, bastardy, and the care of children.

                  </div> Because marriage and adoption are intricately interwoven in this Shakespeare text
                  that preoccupies Cavell, and especially because Cavell has lately troped a transformative
                  moment in his own life history under the sign of adoption, I propose to track the
                  traffic between marriage and adoption in the context of Cavell’s peculiar traffic
                  with the Romantic writer most notoriously preoccupied with marriage, Jane Austen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>After a review of Cavell’s own recent engagements with texts of Austen, I turn to
                  two novels in particular: <em>Persuasion</em>, which I read as a book about a foundational Cavellian conjugal trope, remarriage,
                  and<em>Emma</em>, which I read as a book about adoption.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           who organized and chaired that session for the English Romantic division.</span></div>
                  </div> Students of Cavell or Austen will not be surprised that marriage is everywhere at
                  issue in these pages. What is new is an emphasis on an Austen novel that Cavell nowhere
                  mentions—<em>Persuasion</em>—and my focus on adoption, whereby I argue that marriage and adoption are twinned
                  events where normative patterns of pairing and kinship are first unstitched and then
                  rewoven in the necessarily elusive forms of Cavellian perfectionism. Especially because
                  Cavell himself—a devoted interpreter of film—has limited his remarks on Austen to
                  the novels alone, I pay particular attention to how a set of Austen films inflect
                  adoption and marriage.

                           Altman’s Gosford Park, which he specifies as “a brilliant reenactment of the conditions
                           of glamorous joylessness depicted in Austen’s Mansfield Park” (126).</span></div>
                  </div> A cornerstone of Cavell’s work is the claim that marriage marks the recalcitrant sites
                  where narratives wrestle with skepticism, and I shape this essay to explore what happens
                  when we extend that large claim to include the unsettling settlements of adoption.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cavell’s Austen emerges belatedly: “I should confess that I came somewhat late to
                     an unconstrained fascination with Jane Austen” (126). This 2005 observation, in the
                     title essay of the volume <em>Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</em>, speaks to what for many years seemed a curious gap or a missed opportunity, given
                     Cavell’s long preoccupation with marriage in Shakespeare and in film. Cavell himself
                     flags the untimely sequence, remarking on “the encouraging pertinence of [Austen]
                     to a further region of the work I do, a pertinence I have not felt prepared to broach
                     previously [. . .]. [Her novels] are clear precursors of the preoccupations of the
                     two genres of film that I have devoted books to—genres I name the Hollywood comedy
                     of remarriage and the melodrama of the unknown woman” (119). Whereas Blake was a key
                     figure in Cavell’s early invocations of British Romanticism (as in the final sentences
                     of <em>The Claim of Reason</em>), Austen has become a touchstone in later Cavell.

                              in his work most directly in the (edited) transcript of “Questions and Answers” appended
                              to the version of the essay “In Quest of the Ordinary” in the Eaves and Fisher volume.
                              In that Q&amp;A, Cavell confesses that “I feel seduced by Blake as well as threatened
                              by him. If I ever leave the ordinary for his high prophecies and mythology—I am speaking
                              here of the later Blake—I am not sure that I will ever find my way back” (232). Cavell’s
                              unwritten work on Blake thus takes up company with his speculation about an unwrit…</span></div>
                     </div> In the 2010 autobiography, for example, Blake is absent from the index, whereas Austen
                     often assumes a very privileged spot in the roster of Cavell’s lifelong intellectual
                     interests, as in this genealogy of “a specific register of the moral life, one I relate
                     to moral perfectionism, a register running, if largely unheralded, throughout Western
                     philosophy and literature, from Plato and Aristotle through Dante and Montaigne and
                     Jane Austen and Emerson and George Eliot and Nietzsche and Mill to Heidegger and Wittgenstein”
                     (259). At a later moment in the autobiography, Cavell remarks again the special temporality
                     of Austen in his intellectual life: “I do not understand why it was only after philosophy
                     became identifiable for me that after years of all due respect to them, I fell in
                     love with the writings of Jane Austen and of George Eliot” (460).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cavell’s phrasing of his late return to Austen as “unconstrained fascination” prompts
                     the question of a prior category of constraints, of enforced limits and boundaries.
                     Something there is in Austen that now speaks powerfully to Cavell of the unsettlingly
                     closeted nature of human experience, which is also signified in the way Cavell then
                     proceeds to foreground “distress” (to be pressed upon, unpleasantly) as defining her
                     writing. Nearly all of the commentary on Austen appears in the title essay of the
                     2005 volume, <em>Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</em>, where Cavell pairs Austen with Nietzsche: “The spiritual distress registered in
                     Nietzsche, and characteristic of his writing, is not inaccurate to something to be
                     felt in Jane Austen’s prose. You might say that her prose seeks incessantly to minimize
                     (hence maintain) the expression of distress in everyday existence no less drastically
                     than Nietzsche’s seeks to maximize it” (124).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In Philosophy, Cavell turns to Austen very briefly in one other essay (“Performative
                              and Passionate Utterance”), pinpointing a passage in Austen (an excerpt from the exchange
                              between Emma and Mr. Elton in the carriage ride home from the Christmas dinner at
                              the Westons) as an example of a range of “perlocutionary conditions” that index “a
                              pressure for change” (188-91). In the “pedagogical letters” in Cities (2004), Cavell
                              invokes the example of Austen in a few instances which are altogether consonant with
                              the remarks in Philosophy.</span></div>
                     </div> Cavell works out this unusual pairing with brief comments on three novels, <em>Emma</em>, <em>Mansfield Park</em>, and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>: <span class="quote">‘What invites novels such as Jane Austen’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, <em>Mansfield Park</em>, and <em>Emma</em>, together with George Eliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> and <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, to this discussion is, in contradiction to much of philosophy, their devotion to
                        the life of the everyday, while at the same time they share, in the texture and turn
                        of every scene, their knowledge of, their craving for, a life lived from what Emerson
                        and Nietzsche call the further self, glimpsed from the perspective of what they picture
                        as life’s higher moments—perfectionist moments. The lives depicted can seem, from
                        a philosophical perspective, too confined or aloof to provide moral inspiration or
                        instruction for a rough world. The experience of the novels is, for many, for me,
                        otherwise. (122)

                                 the “possibilistic” in Austen.</span></div>

                     that can appear “too confined” lines up with Cavell’s subsequent observation that
                     one of the features of Austen’s fiction that long kept him at arm’s length was “Austen’s
                     narrator’s renowned surface of containment” (124). Constraint, confinement, containment,
                     distress: these are the clouded headings under which Cavell organizes his reading
                     in Austen (and Nietzsche, Emerson, and Eliot) of the “unrelieved routine or fixation
                     of ordinariness” (122), which yields a “state of vulnerable conformity,” a human condition

                     pitching a wedding as a funeral, as an occasion of distress, of vulnerability. As
                     Emma and her father grieve the passing of Miss Taylor into Mrs. Weston, the narrator
                     remarks that this is a moment when “Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance”
                     (I.1.4). Here is Cavell’s gloss: <span class="quote">‘I find that I am unsure whether this meditation means that she is vexed not to have
                        her friend to continue their happy mode of existence; or whether it suggests that
                        she is so grief-stricken that she cannot imagine wanting her own existence to continue;
                        or whether, as mostly seems to me the case, that Emma herself cannot tell the difference.
                        (124)’</span> If I ever paused previously at the phrase “mournful thought of any continuance,” I
                     understood it as a jab at the unlikely prospect that Emma’s thoughts of any kind (even
                     grief) might exhibit duration. But I had certainly never before understood this moment
                     as Emma entirely halted in her tracks, where “continuance” itself is substantively
                     at stake. Lest a reader object that Cavell is overreading “continuance,” here is a
                     sentence from the final chapter of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. Edward Ferrars, previously cut off by his mother, is gingerly returning to life:
                     “In spite of being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance
                     of his existence secure, till he had revealed his present engagement” (III.14.423).
                     Whereas “continuance” is explicitly at stake in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (in both comic and serious registers, as typical in Austen), the fine tuning of Cavell’s
                     ear catches (indeed, brings to our attention) the radical vulnerability of Emma’s
                     new form of confinement and distress.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As Cavell underscores, the wedding that falls on the Woodhouse home like a funeral
                     pitches the stakes of this marriage novel extraordinarily high from the outset. Recalling
                     his reading of “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” two decades earlier, Cavell unpacks <em>Emma</em> in its opening moments as a narrative poised to unfold, among other possibilities,
                     as what he calls an antithalamion, although he doesn’t put the term into play on this
                     occasion (<em>Quest</em> 65). Cavell is not taken in by Emma’s bluff throughout Volume One that she can exist
                     without marriage, that she can continue her life perfectly well as a single woman
                     and a daughter, a sister, a friend. Compulsory conjugality is not so readily taken
                     off the table under the Hegelian dispensation, wherein marriage is “life in its totality”
                     (Hegel 161).

                     and repackage Austen the commodity, the novel Jane Austen wrote opens by foregrounding
                     the dire constraints and confinements of marriage, as if marriage were, in Adam Phillips’s
                     formulation (quoted below in its entirety), a threat instead of a promise (Phillips
                     98).</p>
               </div>
               <p>These bad consequences include the risk run by Emma, in a few additional words of
                  Austen's spotlighted by Cavell, to be “in great danger of suffering from intellectual
                  solitude” (qtd. in <em>Philosophy</em> 125). In his reading of Austen, Cavell tags the distressing forms of “vulnerable
                  conformity” with multiple figures of limits, boundaries, and enclosures. Those figures
                  also line up with a complementary set of figures of solitude, isolation, separation,
                  and unshareability. Cavell juxtaposes his foregrounded image of Emma Woodhouse at
                  risk with Elizabeth Bennet, focused in a reply Elizabeth makes to Darcy early in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, when Darcy has challenged the narrowness (the confinements and constraints) of her
                  social circle: “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to
                  be observed in them for ever” (I.9.47). Cavell’s gloss: <span class="quote">‘Now to see something new for ever in the singular persons within an unvarying society—to
                     see, let’s say, from the heightened perspective of an over-morning—is an accurate
                     description of what a writer such as Jane Austen has learned to provide for the world.
                     But this implication of a certain genius reflected in Elizabeth at the same time serves
                     more threateningly to seal her isolation (or loneliness), to show her consciousness
                     to risk being unshareable. (128)’</span> To be sealed up or sealed off is to suffer the distress of enclosure and constraint,
                  now figured additionally as solitary confinement, as isolation. In these brief comments
                  on Elizabeth Bennet and Emma Woodhouse, Cavell points to the “danger” they everywhere
                  confront in plots busy with the task of “confronting everyday life with itself” (123),
                  as the “perfectionist path exacts the cost of a great separation” (129). The “certain
                  genius reflected in Elizabeth” is Austen herself, and Cavell thus signals that, like
                  many, he reads these two (distressed and vulnerable) heroines as surrogate figures.
                  But unlike the constructions of the Janeite herd, this Austen is no fantasy figure,
                  no light, bright, and sparkling adornment. To locate these characters’ struggles with
                  confinement and the risk of unshareable solitude in the authorial subject is to construct
                  Austen herself as enclosed and closeted.</p>

                     </div> Both understand Austen’s own identity to be crucially at stake in the fiction. But
                     a key difference between Cavell and Miller comes into focus in how they approach <em>Mansfield Park</em>, the third of the three Austen texts Cavell attends to. In Cavell’s account, Fanny
                     Price joins Emma and Elizabeth in an imperiled trio when he turns briefly to consider
                     slavery in <em>Mansfield Park</em>, “the most lurid of the compromises with an imperfect (to say the least) society
                     shown in Austen’s six major novels” (<em>Philosophy</em> 126). Emphasizing the “economy of horror sustaining the main house of <em>Mansfield Park</em>” (127), Cavell understands Fanny Price under the sign of “Nietzschean convalescence,”
                     a character by design “imperfectly fit for the world as it is because in preparation
                     for a further constitution” (126). Miller, on the other hand, corrals Emma and Elizabeth
                     not with Fanny but with Mary Crawford, in the agon of the unrepresentable authorial
                     subject and her surrogate “stylothetes”: “Though Austen’s typical heroines—Elizabeth
                     Bennet, Mary Crawford, Emma Woodhouse—are all stylists, we are ceaselessly directed
                     to observe the excesses, the failures, even the evils in their performance of style,
                     as though the stylothete were a queen bee who would tolerate no rivals” (<em>Style</em> 42). Cavell understands Emma, Elizabeth, and Fanny as watchful observers rather than
                     high-wire performers. When, following Miller, the motive quest of Austen’s career
                     is enclosed absolutely in the distressed constraints of the (closed) biography, the
                     confinements painfully manifest in Fanny become an unprofitable dead end, especially
                     when Mary Crawford beckons with her “saucy, playful smile” (III.16.531). But to understand
                     Fanny with Cavell as undergoing “convalescence” aims a narrative arc at recovery,
                     however difficult or remote.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In a late section of <em>Monogamy</em>, a set of aphoristic mini-essays about marriage, Adam Phillips poses conjugality
                  not in its positive Hegelian form—to marry is to be born again—but in its negative
                  form, as threat: not to marry is to court death, in two ways: <span class="quote">‘The opposite of monogamy is not just promiscuity, but the absence or the impossibility
                     of relationship itself. Indeed, one reason monogamy is so important to us is that
                     we are so terrorised by what we imagine are the alternatives to it. The other person
                     we fear most is the one who does not believe in the universal sacredness of—usually
                     heterosexual—coupledom. As homophobia, xenophobia, all the phobias tell us: if we
                     don’t choose monogamy our fate will be isolation or the chaos of impersonality. A
                     threat, that is to say, not a promise. Abandonment and exclusion, or getting too mixed
                     up with, and by, other people. In unguarded circulation, or stranded. In other words,
                     we do not know whether we want monogamy, but we do know that we fear excess: an excess
                     of solitude and an excess of company. (98)’</span> <em>Monogamy </em>throughout frames the Cavellian couple who are willing to gamble on a perfectionist
                  quest that is fraught all the way down, navigating again and again the uncertain daily
                  passages between the terrors of the only other ways to try to be human: alone or lost
                  in a crowd. Cavell pinpoints such perils, such distress, in the worlds of Emma Woodhouse,
                  Elizabeth Bennet, and Fanny Price, constrained and confined, risking isolation, separation,
                  and solitude.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. <em>Persuasion</em> and (Re)marriage</span></h2>
               <p>A hallmark of Cavell’s work on marriage is that there is no such thing as marriage:
                  there is only remarriage, day after day. Here is Cavell’s 1985 summary of his concept
                  of “remarriage,” in the wake of his book-length readings of the idea in Hollywood
                  films and Shakespeare: “The central idea is that the validity or bond of marriage
                  is no longer assured or legitimized by church or state or sexual compatibility or
                  children but by something I call the willingness for remarriage, a way of continuing
                  to affirm the happiness of one’s initial leap, as if the chance of happiness exists
                  only when it seconds itself” (“Capra” 3). Although the word “remarriage” was available
                  in her culture’s lexicon, Austen never uses the term, but she does address this Cavellian
                  inflection of marriage by means of the phrases “first attachment” and “second attachment.”
                  These terms gesture in Austen toward a post-Romantic understanding of marriage as
                  a mode of what Kierkegaard calls repetition and what Cavell invites us to think of
                  as the problem and challenge of the ordinary. In temporal terms, whereas “marriage”
                  traditionally bids to be a lifetime milestone (even if, as now, undertaken in serial
                  instances), Cavellian “remarriage” is a quotidian marker, occurring day after day.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The two novels in which Austen explicitly takes up the question of second attachments
                     are <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> and <em>Persuasion</em>, ironically the two major novels about which Cavell is silent.

                     </div> In these foregrounded instances of literal second marriages, Austen directs attention
                     to a pressure that everywhere bears upon marriage; as Cavell puts the case, in another
                     context, “the world must be regained every day, in repetition, regained as gone” (<em>Quest </em>172). In <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, Austen rigs an elaborate joke at Marianne Dashwood’s expense. Marianne, a devoted
                     romantic, claims that there is no such thing as a second attachment, which elicits
                     her sister Elinor’s wry account of the theory, in a conversation with Colonel Brandon:
                     “How she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had
                     himself two wives, I know not” (I.11.66). Because Elinor and Marianne are children
                     of the second marriage, the joke is at Marianne Dashwood’s expense: if she is right
                     and second attachments are “impossible to exist” (I.11.66), Marianne herself is an
                     existential impossibility. From Cavell’s point of view, she has it just backwards—not
                     only are second attachments possible, but they are all there is. Marianne Dashwood
                     is a Cavellian heroine <em>manqué</em>.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>Persuasion</em> everywhere recasts the question of marriage as the question of remarriage. Of Anne
                     Elliot, the narrator early in the novel observes, “No second attachment, the only
                     thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible
                     to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits
                     of the society around them” (I.4.30-31). The sentence brims with Cavellian markers:
                     the “small limits” of Anne’s world (the confinement, constraint, and containment that
                     distress Emma, Elizabeth, and Fanny); Anne’s “fastidiousness” and “nice tone of mind”
                     (a certain genius reflected in Anne); and the quest evermore for always elusive perfectionist
                     “cure” (Cavellian “recovery”).

                              Austen never employs).</span></div>
                     </div> A remarkably large number of characters in <em>Persuasion</em> are on the far side of attachment: Anne Elliot has loved and lost; Sir Walter Elliot
                     is a widower; Lady Russell is a widow; Captain Wentworth has loved and lost; William
                     Elliot is a widower; Mrs. Smith is a widow; Mrs. Clay has returned, mysteriously,
                     “from an unprosperous marriage” (I.2.17); Captain Benwick, unluckily, has even been
                     widowed before marriage. When in Volume Two Anne Elliot heads for Bath, she does not
                     make a new friend but busies herself “renewing” an old friendship, with the crippled
                     Mrs. Smith. The language describing this rehabilitated friendship emphasizes repetition:
                     “The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other
                     more than re-kindled” (II.5.166). Having renewed, reestablished, and rekindled their
                     friendship, Anne then revisits Mrs. Smith: “In the course of a second visit she talked
                     with great openness, and Anne’s astonishment increased” (II.5.167). In the world of <em>Persuasion</em>, there are always only second attachments.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although Cavell’s chief interest in Austen is the way in which her novels render the
                  obstacles to and the risks of the perfectionist quest, he also remarks what he calls
                  “the elation of her novel’s [sic] conclusions” (<em>Philosophy</em> 126). Andrew Miller makes a similar claim at the close of his Cavellian-inflected
                  reading of how Austen’s novels “amplify” narratively the tension between a perfectionist
                  dynamic (through free indirect discourse, we are invited to sympathize with characters
                  who just might be able to accomplish change) and a counter-measure that he calls the
                  “optative” (these characters are locked in a past before which we as readers of an
                  objective narrative are helpless). Miller points to the conclusion of <em>Persuasion</em> as an exemplary instance of how an Austen text points toward a release from the constraints
                  that everywhere define it, remarking “the redemptive exhilaration I find under the
                  otherwise leaden skies of <em>Persuasion</em>: its suggestion that our past can be changed or its effects, at any rate, undone,
                  even as Anne is allowed to undo her past, her refusal of Wentworth, and elicit a second
                  proposal” (135). Cavell and Miller offer a different model for how to read the endings
                  of Austen’s novels: not as the conventionally epithalamic endorsements of normative
                  heterosexual coupling they are so easily taken to be, but as markers of risky, elusive
                  possibilities grounded in a model of the human pair that continues to bear the burdens
                  of distress, a “mutual acknowledgement of separateness” (<em>Quest </em>178). Because Miller and Cavell similarly testify to how an Austen novel, both in
                  spite of and because of its burdens, can achieve at its end “elation” or “exhilaration,”
                  and because Miller quite rightly (in my judgment) tethers this accomplishment to <em>Persuasion</em> in particular and its constitutive structure of Cavellian secondariness, I want to
                  turn to a privileged Cavellian form and inspect how two recent films adapt the very
                  puzzling final paragraphs of the novel.</p>
               <p>One of the abiding oddities of <em>Persuasion</em> is the opaque ending, where it is altogether unclear where the (re)married Wentworth
                  pair will settle down—or perhaps only come to a pause, again and again? (Austen typically
                  does not leave the settlement spot unsettled in the other novels, regardless of their
                  many celebrated exit ironies—what we might call the Pemberley effect demanded of her
                  endings.) The only glancing reference to such a generic close in the final paragraphs
                  of <em>Persuasion</em> is the casual observation that Anne’s old friend Mrs. Smith was “their earliest visitor
                  in their settled life” (II.12.274), a phrase which begs more questions than it answers:
                  settled where? And in what sense “settled”? What’s missing, of course, is an estate
                  name, the force of which formulaic detail is to lock down the couple in a fixed system,
                  a dynamic at odds with an inflection of marriage as remarriage, as reengaged and reinvented,
                  a renewed creation day after day.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The stakes of such endings come into useful focus in two very different film adaptations
                     of <em>Persuasion</em>, the 2007 ITV production directed by Adrian Shergold and the 1995 BBC production
                     directed by Roger Michell. The 2007 Shergold <em>Persuasion</em> offers an arrestingly fumbled re-reading of the conclusion. Wentworth takes a blindfolded
                     Anne (not a good sign) to her new married home, which is—impossibly—the Elliot ancestral
                     home, Kellynch Hall, and the film’s final image is their wedded dance in the forecourt
                     of the (mysteriously) recovered family estate.

                  <p>In contrast, the conclusion of the 1995 Michell <em>Persuasion</em> locates the Wentworth couple on board a ship, which is as smart a guess as any concerning
                     their “settled life”—if a guess is required. This image of a seafaring couple is also
                     consonant with another key structure in the novel, the unconventional Croft marriage
                     as an ideal for the Wentworth pair: the Croft marriage, much of which has been spent
                     at sea, is chronically on the move. This (re)married couple gaze not at one another
                     (nor do they twirl in embrace about a fixed spot), but they gaze, separately, in different
                     directions. The rigging upon which they lean picks up one of Austen’s navy jokes in
                     the novel (“the little knot of the navy”), for it is the notable skill of this branch
                     of the military—Austen’s favorite branch, as a loyal sibling—to tie knots, and this
                     remarriage knot is tied in new ways that open upon new futures, possible and perfectionist.

                  now replaces the landed estate as a new mobile form of the fixed settlement spot.</p>

               <p>The risk of this narrative strategy is to freeze the ship’s motion at anchor in an
                  apparently new settlement system, but a system that offers distinction without difference.
                  A prevailing understanding of <em>Persuasion</em> is that the Croft and Wentworth marriages refigure in a postwar mode of emergent
                  bourgeois professionalism the residual landed virtues of Pemberley. Marriage and virtue,
                  once fixed, are now free to wander. But I want to suggest that Austen shapes <em>Persuasion</em> to contest the epithalamic mandate on several fronts. To substitute mobility for
                  fixity as the foundation of marriage is to continue to insist upon an unshifting foundation.
                  To understand the Wentworth marriage as a postwar Pemberley-to-go is to continue to
                  credit the centripetal force of the marriage refuge. In its elaborate counterpoint
                  of motion and stasis, <em>Persuasion</em> the novel instead works toward a style of marriage writing that inclines marriage
                  toward remarriage, attachment toward reattachment, over and over, day after day, sentence
                  after sentence. It unsettles the marriage settlement. The 1995 Michell film at its
                  end verges upon this Cavellian dynamic of the novel, before pulling back and away.
                  The ending of a different film, the 2009 BBC <em>Emma</em>, approaches more closely a perfectionist Cavellian period.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. <em>Emma</em>, Adoption, and Marriage</span></h2>
               <p>The 2009 BBC <em>Emma</em>, directed by Jim O’Hanlon from a screenplay by Sandy Welch, is a remarkable adaptation
                  in any number of ways, but especially in its framing moments, at opening and close.
                  Instead of launching the film in lockstep with the novel (the aftershocks at Hartfield
                  of the marriage of Miss Taylor to Mr. Weston, which registers on Emma and Mr. Woodhouse
                  as a funeral—those moments that Cavell finds so telling), O’Hanlon foregrounds in
                  his opening images a set of very different and very dark events from the novel’s various
                  backstories: the death of Emma’s mother, the death of the first Mrs. Weston, and the
                  death of Jane Fairfax’s mother. At the other end of the film, O’Hanlon again plays
                  fast and loose with one of the novel’s most famous structures, the supremely self-contained
                  world of Highbury. In the film, the spatial surround of the Emma Woodhouse-George
                  Knightley marriage settlement is not tethered to the intensely local question of whether
                  the couple will live at Donwell Abbey or at Hartfield, as in the novel. Instead, O’Hanlon
                  closes by taking the married couple on the road on their wedding trip to the sea,
                  breaking the celebrated narrative frame that is Highbury. I propose that both of these
                  framing revisions adapt <em>Emma</em> as a narrative with noteworthy Cavellian inflections, pointing toward a human world
                  in which adoption and marriage are isomorphic forms available, however elusively,
                  to the perfectionist quest.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>I have elsewhere argued that <em>Emma</em> is usefully read as a novel about adoption.

                              on UK television in the fall of 2009 (and in the US early in 2010). That Chawton paper

                     untethered from their birth families, and this unusual surplus gives redundancy signifying
                     force: surrogate families rival consanguineous sets in the world of this novel. The
                     contingencies of adoptive families run unsettlingly counter to the constraints of
                     the closed systems of blood kinship that underwrite identity and power in manifold
                     ways in Austen’s world.

                              we hope to foster an alternative to its traditional linkage between biology, heterocentrism,

                     </div> Bastards (Harriet Smith), orphans (Jane Fairfax), and semi-orphans (Frank Churchill)
                     line up as a disruptive adoptive set with other creatures on the margins of Highbury:
                     old maids (Miss Bates), widows (Mrs. Bates), governesses (Miss Taylor), yeoman farmers
                     (Robert Martin), and threatening bands of gypsies. Although all three adoptive narratives
                     in <em>Emma</em> take their origins in deaths (Frank and Jane) or the mysterious shadows of illegitimacy
                     (Harriet Smith), these haunted plots also mark spaces where new futures might be imagined
                     in perfectionist glimpses. In short, I want to line up adoption in <em>Emma</em> with how Cavell as autobiographer understands his decision to change his own name
                     as a form of adoption, as a “search for a life I could want.”</p>

               <p>The O’Hanlon <em>Emma</em> narrates these three opening moments as scenes of separation and parturition, as
                  leavetakings from home. Instead of a wedding that falls upon Hartfield as a funeral,
                  the film opens with the death of Emma’s mother. The young Emma Woodhouse is posed
                  beside her mother’s coffin:</p>

               <p>Fast on the heels of this foundational sorrow, the film cuts to the first image of
                  adoption. Mr. Weston is at the bedside of his dead wife, and their son Frank is at
                  the door with his aunt, Mrs. Churchill (the sister-in-law of Mrs. Weston), who will
                  now, in the language of the novel, “take the whole charge of” Frank (I.2.14), who

                  <p>Instead of foregrounding this tale of adoption, the novel offers it as backstory information

                     from Highbury: the young Mr. Weston is serving in the military in Yorkshire when he
                     marries a Miss Churchill, and Yorkshire is where Frank grows up at his new adoptive
                     home, Enscombe, the Churchill family seat.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It is significant that Mrs. Churchill, who famously jerks Frank around throughout
                              the novel, is not his blood relative (Mr. Churchill is instead the biological brother
                              of Frank’s birth mother). Although Frank’s adoption is a kinship transfer (like the
                              transformation of Austen’s brother Edward from Austen to Knight), the Emma narrative
                              does not claim blood as definitive of family. For adoption in the period, see Walker
                              (“Place”).</span></div>
                     </div> But the O’Hanlon film locates the adoption episode in Highbury itself, and these narrative
                     rearrangements work to yoke more directly than does the novel the fates of two young
                     citizens of Highbury who have both lost their mothers. The effect of this pairing
                     is to locate under the sign of adoption the marriage plot that will soon entangle
                     both these characters. As Frank Weston disappears into the carriage in which he exits
                     Highbury to take up his new identity as Frank Churchill, the camera frames his face
                     staring through a rain-drenched back window at his tearful father bidding him farewell,
                     Frank’s hand raised to steady himself as the carriage lurches forward and to reach
                     back toward the brief opening chapter of his life that has already closed, an echo
                     of the young Emma’s hand on her mother’s coffin.</p>

               <p>Immediately following the death of Emma’s mother and the death of Frank Churchill’s
                  mother, the O’Hanlon film turns to foreground a third piece of the novel’s backstory,
                  the death of Jane Fairfax’s mother. The novel delays this narrative background until
                  much later, the second chapter of Volume Two, when Colonel Campbell makes the offer
                  “of undertaking the whole charge of her education” (II.2.175), which translates into
                  a <em>de facto</em> adoption of Jane from her Highbury kin, Miss Bates (her aunt) and Mrs. Bates (her
                  grandmother). Once again we see the adoptive child conveyed away from Highbury in
                  a carriage, and Frank Weston and Jane Fairfax are now joined visually by the occasions
                  and modes of their leave-takings.</p>

               <p>As the marriage plot driving the narrative enlarges its net to include Jane, the O’Hanlon
                  film continues to signpost the first stirrings of that plot with scenes of adoption,
                  a primary means whereby Austen’s culture manages parental deaths and the care of children.
                  There is no better anchor in the novel itself for these cinematic rearrangments than
                  that early phrase descriptive of Emma that catches Cavell’s attention, “mournful thought
                  of any continuance” (I.1.4). For these children, the future itself is immediately
                  and grimly at stake: after such deaths, what continuance? The contingencies of adoptive
                  identity—not only its dire necessities but also its fragile possibilities—will fall
                  upon them a second time as adults in the contingencies of marriage.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At the other end of the film, O’Hanlon offers another dramatic departure from the
                     book’s narrative template. <em>Emma</em> the novel is by design an experiment in how Austen’s famous narrative boundaries,
                     “3 or 4 Families in a Country Village” (<em>Letters</em> 275), can help a plot achieve escape velocity precisely to the extent that those boundaries
                     are sharply drawn and unbroken, reflecting what Cavell calls their “surface of containment.” <em>Emma</em> begins and ends in Highbury and takes its being therein. The famous final phrase,
                     “the perfect happiness of the union” (III.19.528), brings the marriage plot to its
                     perfected close and simultaneously snaps the gate shut on the small world that is
                     Highbury, by which paradoxical means the novel becomes an available world. O’Hanlon
                     breaks this frame and takes the film on the road in its closing shots, following Emma
                     and Knightley on a wedding trip to the sea.

                              while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight’s absence
                              in a tour to the sea-side, which was the plan” (III.19.527). The O’Hanlon film foreshadows
                              the trip to the sea with several invented conversations about young Emma’s ignorance
                              that such a thing exists, with a heavy-handed debt to Emma Thompson’s screenplay for
                              Margaret Dashwood in the early scenes of the Ang Lee Sense and Sensibility.</span></div>
                     </div> I was startled at first viewing because the narrative costs on this score are so high,
                     but I now view these images as abundant recompense, especially as they open the film
                     into the contingent Cavellian territory of perfectionist possibilities.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Post-Highbury, Emma and Knightley in the film are first framed together in a carriage.
                  In terms of both the novel and the film, this image most readily invites understanding
                  as a triumphant revision of Emma’s vexed carriage ride with Mr. Elton at the close
                  of Volume One.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/cavell/images/100000000000028000000168A4BAE7BD.jpg" alt="Emma, screenplay by Sandy Welch, directed by Jim O’Hanlon, BBC 2009. Emma and Knightley, married, in a carriage headed for the sea." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>But in O’Hanlon’s full cinematic setting, the image also stretches back to the carriages
                  that convey Frank Weston and Jane Fairfax to their adoptive futures, lining up adoption
                  and marriage as twinned vessels of the perfectionist quest, as both forms wrestle
                  to free themselves from necessity in order to face the fearful risks of contingency.</p>
               <p>Freed from the carriage, the next image offers Emma and Knightley, backs to the camera,
                  hand in hand, walking over the downs toward the sea. </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/cavell/images/1000000000000280000001688E8773D2.jpg" alt="Emma, screenplay by Sandy Welch, directed by Jim O’Hanlon, BBC 2009. Penultimately, Emma and Knightley over the downs to the sea." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>I return to Cavell for a gloss on this image. Several years after the publication
                  of his major work on “comedies of remarriage,” <em>Pursuits of Happiness</em> (1981), Cavell published a short essay, “A Capra Moment,” returning to one of the
                  exemplary films in that book, Frank Capra’s <em>It Happened One Night</em>, but on this occasion singling out a “moment whose apparent commonplaces and evanescence
                  found no place in my long and difficult chapter on the film” (3). That “moment” is,
                  simply, this: “a man and a woman are walking away from us down an empty country road”
                  (3). Cavell then reads this Capra moment as a compound of four key markers, “away
                  from us / together / walking / on the road,” which together compose, for Cavell, a
                  “wedding photo,” with the special inflections by which Cavell understands (re)marriage:
                  “the centered walk away down the road [. . .] does also feel like something is ending,
                  hence like something is beginning, some border being crossed. It is this undefined
                  openness, as if leaving the past behind them, that marks this particular inflection
                  of vulnerability, of thoughtful anticipation” (5). I find these dynamics reproduced
                  in O’Hanlon’s penultimate image of Emma and Knightley, moving away from us, together,
                  walking, on the road. The “particular inflection of vulnerability” in the film at
                  large is the vulnerability not only of the risk known as marriage but also the risk
                  known as adoption.</p>
               <p>Before turning to the final image in O’Hanlon’s <em>Emma</em>, I want to contrast another late image in a recent film of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> in order to foreground the ways in which the ultimate <em>Emma</em> image smartly refigures signposts of the marriage empire. In the 2007 BBC adaptation
                  of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, the director John Alexander and screenwriter Andrew Davies pose Elinor Dashwood
                  alone by the sea, seated on a bench, with her back to the viewer.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/cavell/images/100002010000028000000168E62607CF.png" alt="Sense and Sensibility, screenplay by Andrew Davies, directed by John Alexander. BBC 2007. Late in the film; Elinor Dashwood by the sea at Barton, after Marianne’s recovery and before Edward’s revelatory arrival." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This image is staged after the return to Barton, after Marianne’s recovery but before
                     Edward Ferrars arrives to stumble toward marriage. Elinor is seated on the bench ever
                     so slightly off center, inviting the thought of what absent other might fill an empty
                     spot close beside her in a composition of balanced symmetry. Post-Sedgwick, reading
                     the vectors of desire in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> can never again fixate on heterosexual marriage as sole available telos. Like Elinor
                     herself in the image, Elinor’s desire, autocentric and allocentric, faces elsewhere,
                     elusively. And were she standing there alone, the scene would be a wrap, on these
                     notes. But she is not entirely alone, and that’s my point: there is the bench to account
                     for. Unremarkably, the bench marks the grounded and settled spot where the marriage
                     empire summons identity to take seated place, with room for one other.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note18" id="Note18_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Unremarkably, a bench also marks widely and deeply in the language the weight of communal
                     and judicial authority, signifying here the foundational regime of coupledom that
                     arranges the solitary Elinor in a position that demands a paired companion. Edward
                     Ferrars will soon fill that spot, although the final paragraph of the novel has great
                     sport with the thought that Marianne and Brandon crowd their way on the bench as well.</p>
               </div>
               <p>To close O’Hanlon’s <em>Emma</em>, Knightly and Emma, walking away from the viewer, clear the dunes and arrive, like
                  Elinor, by the sea. The final image is a long shot from behind of the pair gazing
                  out over the coast.</p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/cavell/images/100000000000028000000168C65AB8E3.jpg" alt="Emma, screenplay by Sandy Welch, directed by Jim O’Hanlon, BBC 2009. The final image; Emma and Knightley, backs to the camera, gaze out over the sea." class="graphic"/></figure>
               <p>It is a place manifestly not without vulnerability, without risk—those cliffs!—but
                  the scene is simultaneously suffused with the calm of the (momentarily) untroubled
                  expanse of water. As in the image in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, the bench on the right marks the fixed settlement spot, but in this image it is,
                  remarkably, empty. The faint track across the field to that bench confirms the power
                  of the marriage empire, but the image also offers, disruptively, vanished traffic
                  and an empty destination. The human pair to the left are set apart from that authoritative
                  anchor, not seated of necessity (or by birth) in the old order but standing together
                  in a shared difference, gazing away from the viewer into an unwritten future. In a
                  different context, Cavell will define their attitude as “the mutual acknowledgement
                  of separateness” (<em>Quest </em>178). In <em>Emma</em>—the novel and especially the O’Hanlon film—separateness is a characteristic of the
                  human condition that is located under the sign of adoptive identity. The novel and
                  the film offer a human world in which adoption and marriage are isomorphic forms suffered
                  by and available to, however elusively, the perfectionist quest. I take that thought
                  as license to superimpose a different narrative on this final image: to the right,
                  we see a fixed place benchmarked for someone named by others Stanley Goldstein. To
                  the left, standing aside, there is a place for someone who names himself, adoptively,
                  Stan Cavell. It is the human fate of both the California ephebe and the Regency couple—adopted,
                  (re)married—to remain apart from everything of which they are a part.</p>

               of “Questions and Answers” appended to the version of the essay “In Quest of the Ordinary”
               in the Eaves and Fisher volume. In that Q&amp;A, Cavell confesses that “I feel seduced
               by Blake as well as threatened by him. If I ever leave the ordinary for his high prophecies
               and mythology—I am speaking here of the later Blake—I am not sure that I will ever
               find my way back” (232). Cavell’s unwritten work on Blake thus takes up company with
               his speculation about an unwritten work on the <em>Biographia Literaria</em>: “I propose one day—even alerted to the folly in being, or remaining, promising—to
               write something about this book based on the assumption that it is composed essentially

               Emma and Mr. Elton in the carriage ride home from the Christmas dinner at the Westons)
               as an example of a range of “perlocutionary conditions” that index “a pressure for
               change” (188-91). In the “pedagogical letters” in <em>Cities</em> (2004), Cavell invokes the example of Austen in a few instances which are altogether
               consonant with the remarks in <em>Philosophy</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               in <em>Epistemology of the Closet</em> with “an alternative interpretation of closeting” (181). One of the reasons I rue
               Cavell’s silence on <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is the missed opportunity to put such a reading in conversation with Sedgwick’s influential
               “Masturbating Girl” essay and D. A. Miller’s reading of Robert Ferrars and “unheterosexuality”
               (<em>Style</em> 16); I gesture toward Sedgwick’s essay at the end of this essay, in comments on an
               image from the 2007 film of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               conference at Chawton in the summer of 2009; the new BBC <em>Emma</em> was first broadcast on UK television in the fall of 2009 (and in the US early in
               2010). That Chawton paper is now published online (Walker, “Place”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">For an account of how gay adoption functions to contest the model of the nuclear family,
               see Elfenbein and Watkins: “Rather than trying to model ourselves on the nuclear family,
               we hope to foster an alternative to its traditional linkage between biology, heterocentrism,
               and nationalism” (310).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">It is significant that Mrs. Churchill, who famously jerks Frank around throughout
               the novel, is not his blood relative (Mr. Churchill is instead the biological brother
               of Frank’s birth mother). Although Frank’s adoption is a kinship transfer (like the
               transformation of Austen’s brother Edward from Austen to Knight), the <em>Emma</em> narrative does not claim blood as definitive of family. For adoption in the period,
               see Walker (“Place”).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               before the conclusion: “They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded
               while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight’s absence
               in a tour to the sea-side, which was the plan” (III.19.527). The O’Hanlon film foreshadows
               the trip to the sea with several invented conversations about young Emma’s ignorance
               that such a thing exists, with a heavy-handed debt to Emma Thompson’s screenplay for
               Margaret Dashwood in the early scenes of the Ang Lee <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
