               <p class="noCount">For Romanticists, the many interests of Stanley Cavell’s work include not only the
                  pervasive concern with skepticism across all his books, but topics as divergent as
                  understanding and incomprehensibility, acknowledgment, denial, withholding and secrecy,
                  responsibility, forgiveness, gender, melodrama, horror, monstrousness, therapy, cinematic
                  ontology, religion, secularity, and spectatorship. Two points of emphasis are maintained
                  across his books. These are: the idea of skepticism as an unappeasable predicament
                  one does not solve but lives (skepticism as a problem whose “answer does not consist
                  in denying the conclusion of skepticism but in reconceiving its truth” [<em>The Senses of Walden</em> 133]); and the discovery that acknowledgement and avoidance are primary human orientations
                  (often experienced through their equally human denial), with regard to which certainty
                  and ignorance (the more visible and epistemologically-privileged terms of knowing)
                  are evasions.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Four of the contributors to Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism (François,
                  Fry, Wilner, and Lindstrom) presented early versions of their essays as part of the
                  “Stanley Cavell and Romanticism” panel, organized by Joshua Wilner and Eric Lindstrom,
                  at the 2010 International Conference on Romanticism (ICR) held in Lubbock, Texas.

                     “'A Modest Creed': Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Shelley and Cavell share the view that the imagination, visionary or otherwise, arises
                  from a necessary basis in skepticism. What Shelley calls “Error and Truth” are historical;
                  they are shaped by change and time. Only poetry, perpetually reconstituting veridical
                  propositions as metaphor, can prevent the arteries of knowledge from hardening. Skepticism
                  enables hope: our uncertainty about what life is (it is figured as death in <em>Adonais</em>) makes it possible to wonder whether death may not really be life. Apparently in
                  contrast, Cavell emphasizes romantic disappointment with Kant’s “settlement” with
                  skepticism, whereas for Shelley our inability to know the thing in itself is the very
                  opening required for imaginative hope. Yet Shelley does not doubt the existence of
                  things, only their identity, and also their “life,” and here he anticipates the argument
                  of Cavell in <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>. For Shelley, as for Cavell, the visionary does not replace the ordinary but recognizes
                  it anew. They differ from each other finally, however, in that whereas Cavell understands
                  what Wittgenstein calls “criteria” for knowledge in semantic terms, Shelley sees them
                  as typically semiotic: “almost all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves
                  but for others” (“On Life”). The darker skepticism of <em>The Triumph of Life</em> anticipates deconstruction.</p>

                     “Austen and Cavell”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Taking its departure from Stanley Goldstein’s adoption of himself as Stan Cavell,
                  this essay argues that marriage and adoption are twinned locations where normative
                  patterns of pairing and kinship are first unstitched and then rewoven in the necessarily
                  elusive forms of Cavellian perfectionism. After a review of Cavell’s own belated engagements
                  with Austen’s fiction, the essay offers, first, a reading of a central Cavellian trope,
                  remarriage, in a novel he ignores, <em>Persuasion</em>; and, second, a reading of <em>Emma</em> as a novel preoccupied with adoption. Because Cavell does not attend to cinematic
                  Austen, I pay special attention to the 2009 Jim O’Hanlon film of <em>Emma</em> and argue that both the novel and the film offer a human world in which adoption
                  and marriage are isomorphic forms suffered by and available to, however elusively,
                  the perfectionist quest.</p>

                     “Your Friends and Lovers: Perfectionism’s Recounting of Romanticism”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Stanley Cavell famously defines the work of Romanticism in <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> as “the task of bringing the world back, as to life.” This essay examines how Cavell
                  turns to Shakespeare’s <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> as a text that anticipates Romanticism’s preoccupation with reanimation; in his analysis
                  of the play’s language of economy and computation, Cavell parses “life” as a process
                  of division and branching that is denied or overlooked by skepticism. According to
                  such an understanding, Romantic efforts to reanimate “life” in its generality fall
                  short of a genuine recounting of and reckoning with the ordinary. The essay reads
                  Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Julian and Maddalo” as staging the several characters’ failure
                  to recover the world and bring it back to life.</p>

                     “Passing Judgment, Conceding Perfection: Third-Person Narration and Versions of the
                     Cavellian Secular”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay reviews the tensions between the hard work that the Cavellian figure of
                  “acknowledgment” is supposed to perform in guaranteeing recognition between secular
                  individuals, and the movements of “decline,” “lapse,” and “concession” by which acknowledgment
                  happens. Cavell’s comments on perlocutionary utterances as acts whose happening cannot
                  be definitively concluded, similarly leave open the question of what is to count as
                  a “final word” between people. For a possible answer, the essay turns toward free
                  indirect style in third-person narration as literature’s own performance of the finality,
                  passiveness and non-assertiveness of acknowledgment, and offers sentences from Austen
                  and Stendhal as instances of “passing judgment.” What light can a narrative style
                  that enacts a split between the subject of experience and the agent of its verbalization
                  shed on the Cavellian figures of conceded recognitions, withdrawn questions, and final
                  judgments? </p>

                     “Cavell’s Romanticism and the Autobiographical Animal”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay discusses the implications of Cavell’s performative act to “confess” a
                  Romantic attitude toward the claims of experience. “To be interested [. . .] in the
                  costs of knowing to the knowing creature, I suppose one will have to take an interest
                  in certain preoccupations of romanticism,” Cavell admits near the end of the second
                  part of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (242). I read Cavell’s habitual sense of Romanticism, in the languages of economic
                  exchange and animal life, as “the cost of knowing to the knowing creature.” The last
                  half of this essay discusses Cavell’s complex, sometimes prickly relationship with
                  Jacques Derrida and the relation of both to autobiographical modes of Romanticism.
                  Cavell’s topic, I argue, is the “recall,” his reclaiming, via Romantic poetry as well
                  as through so much else, of what it means to be responsive to the human animal by
                  other standards besides a rehearsal of self-possession in our measures of knowledge.</p>

                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Starting out from a consideration of the more or less contemporaneous emergence of
                  Cavell's work and deconstruction, this afterword responds to the other contributions
                  to the collection. In doing so, it also emphasizes the importance of Wittgenstein
                  and the idea of "bring[ing] words back to their everyday use" in understanding Cavell's
                  engagement with Romanticism; examines the Cavellian problematic of "living one's skepticism"
                  as entailing something other than an ethical recommendation; and, taking a cue from
                  François' contribution, asks whether marriage in Cavell is to be considered only in
                  terms of intersubjectivity.</p>
