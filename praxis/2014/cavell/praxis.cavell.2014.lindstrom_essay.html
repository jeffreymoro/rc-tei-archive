               <h2><span class="head">I. Acknowledging Romanticism: Adolescence and “the Choice of Finitude” </span></h2>
               <p>A useful premise from which to approach the “Romantic” position of Stanley Cavell’s
                  thought is that we only ever “confess” to a romantic attitude toward the claims of
                  experience, and that skepticism and idealism are two tensional poles of the same predicament.
                  “To be interested [. . .] in the costs of knowing to the knowing creature, I suppose
                  one will have to take an interest in certain preoccupations of romanticism,” Cavell
                  admits near the end of the second part of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (242). As he rounds the bend on a particularly tortuous stretch of argumentation,
                  Cavell’s purchase on reason in this book—which began as a Harvard dissertation in
                  1961 and yet still (even before the newly written Part Four) contains what are his
                  most important and enduring lines of discussion— can barely afford to mention his
                  Romantic preoccupations. Alongside the study’s venture over the abyss of a young philosopher’s
                  professional legitimacy, Cavell knows the wise tactic is to hold to other frameworks
                  besides the Romantic. Yet the misstep he at first seems to fear, then eventually and
                  more hospitably welcomes, need not represent any greater fall than, as he puts it,
                  the “implication that such a one [the narcissist or “passive” skeptic figured as adolescent]
                  just ought to grow up” (<em>Claim</em> 464).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And yet to say that he responsively prolongs—or even that he re-describes as metaphysical—the
                     heady and disorienting interval between pure childhood and adulthood, innocence and
                     knowledge, isolation and sociality, is one way to characterize Cavell’s and <em>The Claim of Reason</em>’s central achievement. Paired with autobiography, “adolescent desire” is also the
                     term Derrida reaches for in his interview “This Strange Institution Called Literature”
                     in the effort to place his joint commitment to literature and philosophy, settling
                     on “neither the one nor the other.” Rousseau’s <em>Confessions </em>provides the immediate context of Cavell's remark about growing up—offered at a crucial
                     point of transition between the informally marked sections “Narcissism” and “Proving
                     the existence of the human”—in <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, Part Four (464).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>My discussion is shadowed by two other foundational texts of a Romantic enlightenment
                              and the oscillations of privacy and community so critical to Cavell: Kant’s 1784 essay,
                              “An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?,” and Wordsworth’s “Intimations”
                              Ode. </span></div>
                     </div> The earlier moment I cite to begin this essay takes its cue from an important text
                     of Enlightenment skepticism: Hume’s <em>Dialogues on Natural Religion</em> (Section IX), and Demea’s long-echoing question, “<em>What was it</em> [. . .] which determined <em>something</em> to exist rather than <em>nothing</em>, and bestowed being on a particular possibility, exclusive of the rest?” (qtd. in <em>Claim</em> 242). In joint response to Hume’s skepticism and to Kant’s transcendental construction
                     of the possibility of experience in <em>The Critique of Pure Reason</em> (together dubbed “the onslaughts of Hume and Kant” [465]), Cavell concludes <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, Part Two, with a resonant and vivid statement of the impulse behind the Romantic
                     crisis lyric: <span class="quote">‘If we can’t <em>decide</em> that [. . .] the things of our world exist, shall we say that we <em>believe</em> they exist? That is something a philosopher will say in the course of that rehearsal
                        of our beliefs with which he begins his investigation of their validity as a whole.
                        But that rehearsal does not <em>express</em> belief in anything; it contains no claims. Or shall we say that we have <em>faith</em> that the things of our world exist? But how is that faith achieved, how expressed,
                        how maintained, how deepened, how threatened, how lost? (243)’</span></p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is worth noting that Cavell’s points of orientation when he finds himself located
                     in Romanticism nevertheless remain accessible to some of our broader culture’s most
                     common and even cliché norms of usage, when claiming offhandedly that a person or
                     representation is “romantic” as a throwaway expression. In his book about youth culture
                     in twentieth-century poetry, Stephen Burt lines up the Romantic stereotypes to serve
                     the purpose of historical overview: <span class="quote">‘The modern adolescent is not the green youth of early modern writing; nor is he (much
                        less she) the Romantic child. “Before the Romantic” period, claimed William Empson,
                        “the possibilities of not growing up had never been exploited so far as to become
                        a subject for popular anxiety.”...The idea that immaturity might be preferable to
                        maturity per se, that incompletion of any sort might be better than completion, that
                        remaining outside society indefinitely might be better than joining it, that irrational,
                        instinctive, excessive, emotion-driven speech and behavior might have more value than
                        rational, considered action and thought—these are all, of course, Romantic ideas;
                        they inform, but predate, modern adolescence, which acts them out and represents them
                        often. (8-9) ’</span> Criticism like this reflects one popular way of thinking about Romanticism (often
                     strategically, as a staging ground to some other argument) as the umbrella term for
                     a diagnostic but more or less revisable list of traits. But for better or worse, Cavell
                     responds to Romanticism existentially, as a non-localized challenge impossible to
                     put in its place with a list. For my purposes in this essay, the key situations rehearsed
                     by Cavell’s use of Romanticism will be existential: these include the rejection of
                     the world often charged to adolescence and the celebration of a first world through
                     narrating its loss as the autobiographical fiction of childhood.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>I re-invest in the possibilities of a “Romantic” adolescence in this essay. However,
                              the term brings its own risks. See Beckwith for extended discussion of the theatricalization
                              of acknowledgment, and Anne-Lise François’s essay in the present collection for the
                              temptation to heroism as a hyperbolic mode of investment and struggle. </span></div>
                     </div> Throughout I will also be considering the Romanticism of his thought’s form: the in-between
                     status of the professional expertise (and genre) in which Cavell writes (about) literature
                     and philosophy (“neither the one nor the other. What [is] it?”).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Though our contemporary understanding of adolescence would be anachronistic to apply
                     in strictly empirical terms to tturn-of-the-nineteenth-century writings, Cavell uses
                     it anyway precisely to locate a metaphysical impasse in Wordsworthian Romanticism.
                     He writes as if scouting the ground ahead: “If Rousseau can be said to have discovered
                     the fact of childhood in human growth, and Wordsworth the loss of childhood, then
                     Romanticism generally may be said to have discovered the fact of adolescence, the
                     task of wanting and choosing adulthood, along with the impossibility of this task”
                     (<em>Claim</em> 464). As at once a “fact” that the Romantics are said historically to have “discovered,”
                     as well as an impossible “task,” Cavell imagines adolescence as interminable and contrary;
                     far more than a period phase of “normal” individual human development—say, the time
                     when most people in modernized countries attend school and test peer identities—for
                     Cavell the project of adolescence <em>is</em> these things <em>and</em> opens onto an unending horizon for individual development through “serious adult”
                     transformation. Cavell’s quasi-conceptual use of the “adolescent” stage explains in
                     the fullest sense why he thinks of philosophy altogether as “grownup” (lifetime) education.
                     For Cavell, then—in a turn of thought I make more use of below—what we might call
                     the overall claim of Romanticism is not saturated by its description as a discovered
                     “fact” of a certain phase in individual or cultural life; Romanticism, rather, is
                     voiced through something like the Derridean idiom of an imperative-impossible task.
                     The Wordsworthian sobriety of dutifully wanting to want adulthood, and to sing its
                     endurance, in this sense keeps faith with the child and honors youth’s testimony of
                     resistance, but only under the aegis of a Romanticism that proscribes adulthood as
                     an impossible state to will (autonomously) or to desire (realistically). Kant’s figural
                     understanding of the state of minority as a lack of self-reliance at any age, and
                     his redefinition of maturity as epistemological courage (to <em>dare</em> to know), from this point of view offer surprisingly little traction for approaching
                     Cavell’s attitude toward Romanticism.

                     </div> Romanticism instead features in Cavell’s writing as a challenge (accepting a different
                     kind of <em>dare</em> than Kant proposes? [compare <em>Philosophy</em> 160]) to “express” rather than merely “rehearse” our faith, to weigh what we often

                     which makes youth and “the impossibility” of “choosing adulthood” its very subject.
                     Encountering what Cavell in the same passage calls the “choice of finitude” (<em>Claim</em> 464), however, Romanticists in 2014 are far less likely to be put off than most philosophers
                     were when <em>The Claim of Reason</em> was first published (1979). Instead of being taken as a concession, Cavell’s remark
                     (“I suppose one will have to take an interest”) might be understood better to belie
                     deep affinities with a project he does not wish lightly to expose in its pre-formative

                        in our assertions, of the illusion of meaning something, of claims to impossible privacies)
                        suggestive of madness. (I will go further along certain trails of this suggestion
                        in Part Four.) And in both the cost is the loss, or forgoing, of identity or of selfhood.
                        To be interested in such accounts as accounts of the cost of knowing to the knowing
                        creature, I suppose one will have to take an interest in certain preoccupations of
                        romanticism. (<em>Claim</em> 241-42)’</span> To use a different sort of therapeutic metaphor, rather than Cavell’s graphemic idea
                     above of the “trail” or trace, this passage strikes off in the direction upon which
                     Part Four of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> achieves its “breakthrough.” Cavell owns his version of Romanticism explicitly after
                     this moment, as what he means by the challenge of living one’s skepticism alongside
                     the simultaneous impossibility of living one’s skepticism.</p>

                  <p>The body of Cavell’s work can be understood as enacting the challenge to acknowledge
                     each of these words, “living” and “skepticism,” seriously enough together. It is through
                     his relentlessly focused and inventive <em>carrying on</em> with that problem that Cavell departs so bravely from his teachers. The double imperative
                     distinguishes his project from the rejection of private language found in different
                     ways in J.L. Austin and Wittgenstein. As unlike as their approaches are, Austin and
                     Wittgenstein together leave the very recognition of a gulf between (idiosyncratic)
                     isolation and (coercively “transparent”) community to the effort that only a peculiarly
                     Romantic, aporetic, sort of architecture would ever dare attempt to bridge, or formulate
                     as its constitutive problem.

                              to my account elaborates a sense of dissatisfaction with expressive Romanticism and
                              prefers “Wittgenstein’s wariness” (71). Altieri shares perceptive concerns about the

                     </div> Cavell needs his deployments of Romanticism to project that sort of bridge, which
                     (as Derrida shrewdly declares of Kant) is not “<em>an</em> analogy” so much as “the recourse” to analogy in itself to move “between two heterogeneous
                     worlds, a third term to cross the abyss” (<em>The Truth in Painting</em> 36). This is a job for the reflective judgment, to be sure. But is it also an urging
                     of adolescence? If the task of ordinary language is to lead philosophy back from the
                     metaphysical brink through better knowledge of what we are saying, to engage with
                     “certain preoccupations of romanticism” involves assuming the risks of emptiness,
                     the illusions about meaning, and the unshareable privacies “suggestive of madness.”
                     Yet prior even to this list of deficiencies, a Romantic condition mobilizes Cavell’s
                     anti-Kantian claim “to be interested” at all. In that spirit, an early essay from <em>Must We Mean What We Say</em> (“A Matter of Meaning It” [1969]) appeals so far back as Martin Luther to establish
                     the “guiding ambition of Romanticism” not as the Kantian limit-concept of critical
                     philosophy, but as an effort toward self-critical renewal: a dauntless critique of
                     sacraments in order to make “[a]ll our experience of life [. . .] baptismal in character”
                     (229).

               <p>Moving on chronologically in Cavell’s writing from there, another essential Romantic
                  proposition appears in the middle of Chapter Two of <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, with the notion of “an idea that Emerson and any Romantic would be lost without,
                  that the world could be—or could have been—so remade, or I in it, that I could want
                  it, as it would be, or I in it” (35). There is much to be said about this passage
                  in its turn. The changes it rings take the stakes of this “idea” ever higher and make
                  its grounds increasingly shifty. Who’s judging what or whom? How much of this is really
                  available for judgment and self-possession? Here active and passive modes, affirmation
                  and rejection, and the melodramatic, theatrical roles of a spurning subject and the
                  spurned object are all repeatedly turned over and then put back into play. Remaking,
                  affirming, or rejecting <em>the world</em> altogether is interchangeably woven into and haltingly recombined with the imaginative
                  syntax of creating and accepting <em>the self</em>.</p>
               <p>Or not—one may reply; Here Cavell phrases an insight about the fundamental intersubjectivity
                  of a shared world instead as a mutually isolated performance of self and world, concretely
                  affirming “neither the one nor the other.” The very possibility of self- and world-renewal
                  by way of our skepticism is just what’s at stake in the question when it is posed
                  in this way, our reply to which may not be fully available, or may be available at
                  the time only through affects that are flat or numb, or delayed indeterminately. If
                  Cavell acknowledges that judgment precedes and makes available the so-called fact(s)
                  of the world, he thus might also be taken to suggest a self-directed culture of disengagement
                  that one might align with the Hegelian “beautiful soul.” The passage wants all the
                  drama of decisiveness packed into equivocal phrasing, so as both to mark and to resist
                  the predicament analyzed in Hegel. Between <em>Must We Mean What We Say?</em> and <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em>, one can see Cavell’s Romanticism shift from the convenient shorthand name for an
                  epoch before modern alienation, to a set of attitudes and texts that must “prove”
                  what it means for philosophical thinking to depart from and reclaim the horizon of
                  an existence only felt through literary conditions as subjective autobiography. The
                  pulse of that experience is taken through measuring intervals of departure (deadness,
                  if not death) and re-enlivening confirmation. To offer that the world could have been
                  different so that I could have wanted it, refines the terms not so much of confirmation
                  as of, again, an adolescent withholding. Voiced now by the Emersonian spiritual “sovereignty”
                  of youth, instead of by politically sovereign old age, this is the threat that Cavell
                  calls “avoidance” in his pairing with “acknowledgment,” so crucial to his work beginning
                  with the famous <em>King Lear</em> essay collected in <em>Must We Mean What We Say?</em> and then in <em>Disowning Knowledge</em>.</p>
               <p>The assertion begins with a stunningly negative given—that something is unacceptable
                  “as it is”; by saying “the world,” Cavell enlarges this to no less than everything.
                  And the sentence deliberately hedges about whether the self or the world (first?)
                  needs to be remade. An activism of world-making and, or as, a project for fashioning
                  the self “works” at the same time as the neutralizing renunciation one hears in Cavell’s
                  menu of options. These propositional “terms” are really what in the same essay he
                  thinks of as forms of life, signaled by the parenthetical “Terms as Conditions” in
                  the title. If terms are declarative and factive in their ontological grammar, conditions
                  are value-laden and modal (see <em>Claim</em> 323): <em>That the world could be remade so that I could want it</em>; <em>that I might be different so as actually to be in the world</em>; or that either of these merely <em>could have been true</em>, or even just that we may feel ourselves positioned to <em>say</em> so.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The last phrasing suggests there is another level of opacity to deal with, one worth
                     calling Cavell’s <em>humanist</em> version of the linguistic turn. Cavell’s persistent measurement of our distance from
                     even the language we routinely use (on, as he puts it, our words having turned away
                     from us [<em>Little Did I Know</em> 523]) means that the drama of acknowledgment and avoidance never takes place only
                     as a first-order event, but also as a taking place and a testing of language. A section
                     in <em>The Claim of Reason </em>on moral thinking, for instance, concludes by emphasizing the finitude of “where we
                     stand” in questioning the use of our own and others’ language (<em>Claim</em> 312). (He evokes the seeming lack of response to the three books before <em>The Claim of Reason</em> as a phatic “Hello” without reply in <em>Little Did I Know</em> [523].)

                     the last decade,

                     excitement without release, silence without serenity” (<em>Must We Mean?</em> 229): an Eliotic list of failed attachments and hollow consummation. With distressingly
                     little struggle, these conditions are said to be “just facts—facts of life, of art
                     now. But it should also be said that they are grammatical facts: they tell us what

                     </div> Cavell’s productive response to this litany suggests he finds its counterweight stimulating.
                     Whatever else it may be, Romanticism as a condition means keeping imaginative possibility
                     open, despite (or, by negation, propelling itself away from) such allegedly “given”
                     facts of modernity. In such a framework, any recourse to envisioning a world otherwise
                     comes across as appealing and even celebratory. Jonathan Culler has sharply identified
                     the “bad writing” in the “good philosophy” of Cavell (<em>The Literary in Theory</em> 211-21); yet an oblique, resourceful courage to accept at least some features of adolescent
                     response is not the least of Cavell’s gifts to the practice of Romantic studies.</p>
               </div>
               <p>A key sentence from Cavell’s new autobiography, <em>Little Did I Know</em>, reproduces the effect Culler takes to task from the start of <em>The Claim of Reason</em>. “By the end of college I had come to realize that music was not my life,” Cavell
                  soberly states, before moving on from the grammatically preconditioning <em>that</em> to the experiential and educative <em>how</em>, by means of which he recalls the shape of his life in one seemingly endless autobiographical
                  coil of a sentence: <span class="quote">‘How that crisis eventually produced the conviction that a life of study and writing
                     growing out of philosophy was for me to discover, and how that was affected by being
                     rejected for military service during the Second World War because of an ear damaged
                     when at age six I was struck by an automobile (a trauma inextricable from the trauma
                     of leaving music), and how that rejection was an essential element in my motivation
                     to spend two weeks of the Freedom Summer in 1964 lecturing at Tougaloo College, a
                     black school outside Jackson, Mississippi, and why I changed my name in the months
                     before I left for Berkeley, having just turned seventeen years old, and what it meant
                     to me finally to leave teaching at Berkeley to teach at Harvard, and to have encountered
                     the work and presence of such figures as Ernest Bloch and J.L. Austin, and to have
                     known deeply gifted friends, some renowned, and eminent colleagues who modified my
                     life, and to have worked over decades on doctoral dissertations with students of the
                     most superb promise, some about to be, or who deserve to be, famous, others still
                     struggling to write as well as they think and as they imagine, and from the beginning
                     of my professional life having lived with children whose inescapable, if not always
                     convenient, expectations of me were an essential protection of me against less loving
                     expectations that might have destroyed my hopes, are registers of the rest of the
                     story. (<em>Little</em> 4)’</span> The passage offers what one can only assume is a deliberate mimesis of life’s contingencies.
                  Yet in his transition from the “that” to the “how,” Cavell performs the very way in
                  which an impersonal (Humean) causal contingency becomes a philosophical “grammar”
                  of life in all its intersubjective plenitude of interests—how the everlasting universe
                  of things flows through a life, constituting Cavell’s unique life as it collides with
                  or spins it on different paths through post-war, Civil-Rights-Era America.</p>

                     is interested in becomes patent in context when he opens the paragraph from <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> about the Romantic: “But I think I know by now what the man of fifty finds distasteful

                     The sense of such a project as mature yet green further comes through in Cavell’s

                     assume the original literary concern of Stanley Cavell’s thought is the pioneering
                     American “Transcendentalists,” Thoreau and Emerson—of course this isn’t true. Moreover,
                     it is not just different interests, but a specifically English sequence of concerns
                     that comes to matter, like the “other” before the “I” in psychoanalytic thought, before
                     Cavell’s writings on the philosophical inheritance of “his” America. Cavell’s choice
                     of J.L. Austin as a philosophical “father” (and his choice of “ordinary language”
                     philosophy as an approach) at the expense of the tradition of William James (and the
                     pragmatism from which Cavell often maintains a wary distance) is made palpable by
                     the fact that Austin’s <em>How to Do Things With Words</em> was first delivered as Harvard’s William James Lecture for 1955.

                     </div> The early essays of <em>Must We Mean What We Say?</em> develop a tone and set of questions designed to connect readings of Shakespeare, J.L.
                     Austin, and Beckett. After the formative engagement with Wittgenstein’s thought, British
                     and European Romantic “intellectual tragedies” undergird the structure of <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, especially through Cavell’s discussions, in Part Four, of the master-slave dialectic, <em>Frankenstein</em>, and <em>Faust</em>. Predating his seemingly “foundational” reading of Emerson—and, in the one essay
                     from which I have already cited, “Emerson, Coleridge, Kant (Terms as Conditions),”
                     actually helping to give rise to it at a point when basic ideas still needed “follow[ing]
                     out” (<em>Quest</em> 27)—Cavell’s engagement with Romanticism stands behind his career-long project of
                     troubling philosophy with its suppressed “literary” occasions and voices. British
                     Romanticism, for its part, lies at the bottom of his simultaneously generous and nettlesome
                     practice of taking up literary texts with a reflexively “philosophical” seriousness—a
                     fact to which Cavell’s large subset of exasperated readers continues to bear witness.

                     of an interest in British Romantic Poetry, in both its less forthcoming and most explicit

                     of revenge is the <em>effect </em>of therapy. I take the Intimations Ode to be saying on the contrary that this forgoing
                     is the <em>cause</em>, or say the condition, of change” (<em>Quest</em> 75). For perspective on the distance that Wordsworth has traveled in this crucial
                     area for Cavell, one can page forward through <em>In Quest of the Ordinary</em> and recall that the “next” chapter in the chronological literary and philosophical
                     history roughly traced in that book—“Being Odd, Getting Even,” on Poe—is not a deepening
                     of this therapeutic cure from the impulse to revenge, but a regression to the thesis
                     that “the idea of thinking about individuality (or the loss of it) [comes] under the
                     spell of revenge, of getting even for oddness” (<em>Quest </em>106). Cavell’s Romantic preoccupations and his confession to reckon by “certain” Romantic
                     “costs” cannot then be absorbed into a progressive account of the psyche in literary
                     history.</p>

                     Derrida and the relation of both to autobiographical modes of Romanticism. This comparison
                     goes hand-in-hand with the diversity of interests evident in Cavell’s recent work.
                     Having already written books on cinematic ontology, the “remarriage” plot in golden-era
                     Hollywood films, and opera, in the last decade Cavell has written also on Jane Austen
                     and—at least by invitation—on animals. <em>Little Did I Know </em>might not only be fruitfully read as a sort of Victorian novel like <em>David Copperfield</em>, but also compared to Derrida’s moving and almost as prolific turn to autobiographical
                     writing from the 1980s onward, up to his last interview, <em>Learning to Live Finally</em>.

                     </div> Derrida’s very willingness to give so many important interviews has the effect of
                     aerating his prose and raising the profile of embodied voice of his text, so that

                     at some unspecified length, Derrida in a sufficiently meaningful sense has not <em>heard through </em>the full implications of Austin’s voice, allowed himself to be reoriented by that
                     voice’s deft crosscurrents and deep soundings. Further, the missed dimension of response
                     is not at all a centering of <em>logos</em> as metaphysical “presence” in voice but an inflection of thought by the tensional
                     body of performed language: an attitude, and, in short, a praxis of teaching. The
                     reading I offer below elaborates a sense that such testing of the “force” of language
                     by more language is surely as much Derrida’s as it is Cavell’s and Austin’s project,
                     surely not a metaphysical domain but a kind of bodily (and hence finite) strain of
                     philosophy moving both against and (at a certain late point) arching back toward the

                     a “brave acceptance of the sufficiency of human finitude,” few of the overtly philosophical
                     productions of the British Romantic Era sustain a commensurable depth of interest.
                     Even Cavell’s proposed and unwritten “proper dissertation” on the “concept of human
                     action” makes reference to a visibly British Romantic-Era topic (Hazlitt had written
                     his first book on such a principle) only to swerve powerfully away (<em>Claim</em> xv). That project was jolted out of its course permanently when Austin came to Harvard
                     for a term in 1955. William Godwin comes across as a prim builder of systems, as opposed
                     to the “ruggedness” and “zaniness” of Emerson and the film characters Cavell explores
                     (<em>Conditions</em> 101). And where Godwin <em>is </em>zany, his fanaticism takes on further excesses of rationalism that amount to the ultimate
                     denial of finitude as its condition.

                     of omnipotence, and Godwin’s later novels, including <em>Fleetwood</em> and <em>St Leon</em>, tend to confirm this. Wordsworth thus narrates his rejection of Godwinism in <em>The Prelude</em> as an abstractedly self-blinded and deaf space “Where passions had the privilege to
                     work, / And never hear the sound of their own names—” (1805 <em>Prelude</em>, 10.812-813). In an appendix to the 1798 Third Edition of <em>Political Justice</em>, Godwin presents a teleology by which even the motions of the blood eventually submit
                     to willful control. He audaciously holds that human “perfectibility” (<em>not</em> akin to Cavell’s perfectionism) involves a movement from the domain of autonomous
                     body systems into voluntary domains, leading individuals not only to regulate but
                     to “despise the mere animal function” (Godwin 776).</p>

               <p>Because of this gap in major British Romantic philosophical achievement as such, the
                  challenge becomes that of properly assessing the philosophical work of knowing born
                  out distinctively by Romantic poetry and poetics. In contrast to what Cavell (surely
                  correctly) admires in the resolutely immanent model of Blake’s vision of spirituality,
                  none of the overtly philosophical productions of the British Romantic Era bear up
                  to his admiration of Emerson for the ability to jolt and chagrin the official discourse,
                  to rouse philosophical thinking by means of the very force of a motile linguistic
                  responsiveness it disowns. The impetus of Cavell’s engagement with Emerson has everything
                  to do with the latter's of philosophical meaning through modes of thinking decertified
                  by the official discipline (or, alternately, marked in hindsight as central but cripplingly
                  “genteel”). Yet the challenge in reading the Romantic poets through Cavell appears
                  to be something like the reverse of his recovery of Emerson. Their assured “canonical”
                  standing makes it difficult to trouble, and thereby renew, the living stakes of the
                  poetry. In order to re-open that poetry as a field of both dubiety and potential,
                  one would have to renounce so much canonical learning about literature. Learning is
                  so much easier simply to use as a foil by mastering so as to revise in scholarly output.
                  In order to develop a material phenomenology of Romantic poetry and poetic thought,
                  Cavell would have us shrug off institutional memory as much as that project is ever
                  possible, <em>not </em>accrue another level of sophistication in an ideologically overburdened hermeneutics
                  of suspicion.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cavell’s Romanticism is a process of departure and return to the ordinary. And insofar
                     as <em>Romanticism</em> acts as a name for the draining and restoring of a charged distance to language—language
                     thereby still capable to inspire, jolt, and discomfit actual readers— its relation
                     to critical activity becomes a project for renewal at any moment. I’d like to turn
                     Godwin’s philosophical failure to accept not just the body, but also the human animal,
                     to account, by juxtaposing recent Cavell with late Derrida in terms of their parallel
                     reflections on animality. One might call this relation to autobiography, as Cavell
                     seems to do at a key juncture on Austin in <em>Little Did I Know</em>, the “movement” of an animal-like mobility found even in spending a life deskbound
                     in reading, writing, and teaching (364). A kind of thinking that won’t sit still for
                     fixed concepts suggests the animal-like habits of a daily or seasonal range, a migratory
                     or hunting track, a tracing of the patterns of tagged experimental subjects, and perhaps
                     finally a sedentary local haunt.

                     </div> holds to a kind of broadly humanist stance over and against the animal—for instance,
                     one of Cavell’s main concerns there is to confront himself as a willing subject who
                     eats meat—he nonetheless sustains the important discussion throughout that book of
                     the state of “exposure,” the violability, or uncanny ontological openness, that can
                     at times be a non-domineering measure of animal otherness. The theme of “exposure”
                     also dates back to <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (432). This is as close as Cavell allows himself to come to Derrida’s universalizing
                     claim, <em>il faut bien manger</em>. For Derrida, of course, against the humanist idea of Man this category of the Animal
                     triggers a repeat of the move he makes against Austin, to insist on the other as “internal”
                     and constitutive yet never itself forming a new center; hence the reliance on outrageous
                     puns like <em>animots</em> and <em>je suis</em> not as “I am” but as “I follow” the animal in <em>The Animal That Therefore I Am</em> (2008). The animal encounter Derrida finds internal to the <em>cogito</em> retraces an admission from his interview “This Strange Institution Called Literature,”
                     in which he admits that even literature, as “the most interesting thing in the world,”
                     carries the minimal precondition of a safe dwelling and place to sleep: <span class="quote">‘I’m well aware that this involves an immense forbidden desire, an irrepressible need—but

                     or animal existence before, or external to, the discretionary time afforded by culture
                     is also figured here as another kind of den, or retreat, for non-appearances to hide

                     organized a dwelling-place.” The precondition of literary appearances is the “clear[ing]”
                     of a site for the secret, an “organized” refuge of non-appearing. That ontological
                     cover shelters the creature as much <em>from</em> the clearing of Being as cozily within its frame. But the unclothed, unhoused animal
                     is paradoxically even more secret—it would refuse to show itself at all. At once exposed
                     (abandoning anything like a defensive position <em>or</em> productive, functional rationale) and sheltered nevertheless (tucked away in a space
                     of retreat), the “irrepressible need” Derrida articulates occurs by way of a skin-like
                     or hair-like simile of what also “suits” the animal. The criterion of what’s proper
                     (<em>propre</em>) to the animal (a gathering of what is “suited to the animal”) stands in place of
                     a broader theory of figuration as the basis of literary associations. The very conditions
                     of literature in the account from which Derrida speaks—passivity toward action and

                  poem as a paradigm for further reflection in those areas where Derrida intersects
                  with Cavell. At the end of another dense section of <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, Cavell offers a definition of what he means by skepticism—even “the moral of skepticism”—as
                  the idea that “the human creature’s basis in the world as a whole, its relation to
                  the world as such, is not that of knowing, anyway not what we think of as knowing”
                  (<em>Claim</em> 241). This embrace of “nescience” (Bennett 27) opens to the question of animal life,
                  whose otherness the “pantheistic” Romantics particularly invoke and acknowledge. Romantic
                  “pantheism” troubles the status of reflection as the basis of knowledge, while reconfiguring
                  the minimal conditions of knowing in experiences of pleasure.</p>

                     intertwines with the poet’s curiosity about the availability and grounds of a new
                     epistemological attitude about pleasure: a linking of the “human soul” to nature’s
                     “fair works” at once enables associative thinking and sets off the melancholy background
                     of the project of human thought (ll. 5-7). The poem seems to shift the enabling premises
                     of knowledge, and to offer a poetic method of receptive testing for just where the
                     knowable world takes its preconditions and finds its limits. Hence the lyric, in its
                     way, follows Kant in the genre of critique. But it also renders a kind of performative
                     answer to how experience nevertheless continues, opaquely, beyond regulative critical
                     limitations placed upon the epistemological endeavor as such. The consonance of mourning
                     with moaning—which Robert Burns had heard in the poem from the 1780s which undeniably
                     lies behind this one, “Man was made to Mourn”—in “Lines written in early spring” becomes
                     a pleasurable, complexly purposive texture of rhyming associations (Crawford 193).
                     Well-rehearsed by now (<em>Claim</em> 329-32) is Cavell’s “new” philosophical drama of acknowledgment and avoidance as an
                     alternative to those “old” criteria of epistemological validation and certainty. Might
                     Wordsworth’s criterion for testing his knowledge be located in his own reconfiguration
                     of both cognitive and non-cognitive measure with pleasure? Despite the “dismay” voiced
                     at man-made suffering later in the “Lines” (Stafford 103), the poem suggests that
                     pleasure nevertheless enables and conditions the very experience of place, of having
                     a “there...there” (“Lines Written in Early Spring” l.20). A regulative but open commitment
                     to the purposive experience of pleasure allies Wordsworth to the indeterminate, Kantian
                     concept of natural beauty. In this spirit, Simon Jarvis’s keen emphasis on something
                     Wordsworth captures as the “sentiment of being”—not the egotistical sublime—in lines
                     from <em>The Pedlar</em> (“I felt the sentiment of being spread / O’er all that moves, and all that seemeth
                     still” [qtd. in Jarvis, <em>Wordsworth’s Philosophic Song</em> 29]) does honor to the ear of Cavell, and could be mistaken for an instance of Cavell’s
                     own language. “What else can this mean,” writes Jarvis in a sentence that feels somehow
                     already there in <em>The Claim of Reason</em>, “but that before this feeling a sentiment of nothing was spread over all that moves
                     and all that seemeth still: that nothing, precisely, which goes under the name of
                     ‘being,’ whenever being is understood as no more than the bare predicative cement
                     in a proposition?” (<em>Wordsworth’s</em> 29).

                     and what for day, origins and ends, are for us to measure; that, perhaps one could
                     say, the natural history of the human essentially contains the unnatural, contests

                  <p>Even as one of most tenderly green effusions of the “vernal poet” (As Shelley dubbed
                     Wordsworth) in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, “Lines Written in Early Spring” models remarkable technique for living out skepticism.
                     The poem’s key methodological terms—thinking, reason, and pleasure, elaborate themselves
                     as if in response via the most simple of cognitive prompts. Nature’s apparent givenness
                     is always putting to us the question, What do you make of it? Famously, at the end,
                     “Lines” points back with added bewilderment to the destruction of fraternity (“What
                     man has made of man” [“Lines” l.24]). But because of the lines’ tenacious resistance
                     to understanding the non-human environment in terms <em>only</em> of knowledge, the end of the poem offers a striking and de-constructive vantage on
                     modern technicity. Its subject is the historical production of Man alike with the
                     processing of the animal and vegetal worlds. Like those whom Stanley Cavell deems
                     “creative philosophers,” Wordsworth in this poem and many other comparable ones then
                     has “two tasks: to oppose skepticism and to oppose false answers to skepticism” (Cavell,
                     “Questions” 227). The failure of all conceptual attempts to “measure” another being’s
                     “thoughts”—much less the significance of a bird’s or a twig’s movements—nonetheless
                     is at the same moment met by a “pleasure” repeating its force of a conceptually weakened
                     personification. Surpluses of feeling nearly built into the pseudo-cognitive structure
                     of the “measured” verse ballad lightly and non-insistently countermand a supposedly
                     unfilled Newtonian space or Cartesian coordinate grid as the paradigms of measurement.

                     and literature—and specifically, measured verse.

                              calls “the lease of the voice” and the “pawn of the voice.” Cavell’s early training
                              and performing life as a musician retain their formative influence. He situates the
                              new preface to the paperback (1998) edition of The Claim of Reason in terms of a repertoire
                              of musical familiarity one might compare to the phenomenological experience of verse:
                              “It is familiar to musicians, indeed to those concerned with the fate of the arts

                     </div> As it reaches back to pre-Socratic Greek paideia, the educative role of the musical
                     poem exceeds any idea of “didactic” verse in the transmission of knowledge. Yet in
                     the unattributed Platonic dialogue <em>Ion</em>, Socrates carries the day largely by converting the rhapsode’s bodily performance
                     of sung speech into the contrasting assumption that knowledge instead must require
                     a thematic and content-driven reference; that is, it must be representational knowledge <em>about </em>the subject matter adduced by the poem. In the case of Homer, that might be medicine,
                     horsemanship, war strategy. This signal move in the history of the philosophy of art
                     is so important, though enforced in an argumentative dialogue, it is in all essential
                     ways left unargued as a precondition; it marks a pre-conceptual shift between two
                     incompatible regimes of truth. The rhapsode performs with a lyre, the inspired instrument
                     of Apollo, in depictions before this intervention, and thereafter bears a staff, the
                     sign of the discursive office of Hermes. A culture of performance of ecstatic, mythically
                     “efficacious,” sung speech becomes a culture of prestigious, legitimate, “dialogically”
                     reasoning philosophy.

               <p>Writing much later in the day of Western artistic culture, Cavell is focused on the
                  inverse process by which a highly professionalized philosophy held at the risk of
                  depletion may learn its prompt and gain its voice back from literature. “But can philosophy
                  become literature and still know itself?,” he asks famously in the final sentence
                  of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (496). What had become philosophy’s disarming of literary knowledge in <em>Ion</em>, its stripping away of any knowing <em>about</em> the world absorbed with poetic resonance, now reverses direction and returns to philosophy—but
                  only as a choice bearing the difficult challenge to accept a revived knowledge back
                  from literature’s hands. Philosophy’s fear of not consciously knowing itself remains
                  present in Cavell’s suggestive way of aligning the condition of literature with the
                  unself-conscious and unexamined, with animal life.</p>
               <p>In the Preface to <em>Poems, 1815</em>, Wordsworth discusses without nostalgia the relation of the modern lyric as a genre
                  or sub-genre to the classical idea of musical accompaniment. Consonant with Cavell’s
                  post-musical commitment to a “pitch” of the philosophical voice, Wordsworth's belief
                  is that, though poets “have been in the practice of feigning that their works were
                  composed to the music of the harp or lyre,” the modern lyric’s musicality “require[s]
                  nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation, adapted to the subject” <em>Prose</em> 375-76). Wordsworth as a poet is able to affirm both that the loss of music to his
                  art’s formal-historical materiality is not really a loss, and that it is the modern
                  poet’s affectation to retain a <em>non</em>-cognitive musical prestige that amounts to a craft of “feigning.” It is a deft reversal
                  of Plato, insofar as Wordsworth claims music, not conceptual knowledge, proves an
                  object of envy. The move keeps its force as a turning of tables on philosophy even
                  if that is not how Wordsworth himself claims to feel. By comparison, Cavell’s transition
                  from the life of a jazz musician and Julliard piano student to that of a professional
                  philosopher actually seems more plangent in tone than Wordsworth’s poetic theory.
                  The idea behind the gathering of essays in <em>Emerson’s Transcendental Etudes</em> (2003) is Cavell’s “desire to think of Emerson’s essays as transcendental musically
                  as well as philosophically,” just as wonderful and “alarming[ly] difficult” as the
                  pages of a score by Liszt (<em>Emerson's</em> 1-2).</p>

                     one “again,” Cavell begins the account of himself in <em>Little Did I Know</em> under the sign of a loss of musicianship (“By the end of college I had come to realize
                     that music was not my life”; “the trauma of leaving music” [4]), imagining, as an
                     entryway to his writing life, what it means to practice conceptual thinking as a form

                              loss does not apply to music alone among arts for Cavell. He writes in the Preface
                              to The World Viewed: “ A book thus philosophically motivated ought to account philosophically
                              for the motive in writing it. What broke my natural relation to movies? What was that

                     verse and the bodily performance of music in verse what Cavell says about the loss
                     of insupportable poetic feeling in the Ode: “But ‘fades into’ does not <em>say</em> ‘fades out’” (<em>Quest</em> 75).

                     could Derrida write/talk about the Muse, music, and song so as to aspire to a myth

                     itself; to teach students properly is to respond live to their questions (<em>Animal</em> 52). But “the <em>Phaedrus</em> is also a sort of animal dialogue,” Derrida continues, one based on <span class="quote">‘the myth of the cicadas, who used to be men and were so intent on singing that they
                        were capable of dying, having forgotten to eat and drink. When they came to report

                     identifiable as Man, autonomous or otherwise. In Plato’s dialogue, the cicadas are
                     both a kind of chorus “carrying on” with their nonhuman “conversations [. . .] above
                     [the] heads” of Socrates and Phaedrus’ talk (259b); and they are also those “human

                     that they forgot food and drink and wasted away (259c). “After they die,” says Socrates,
                     “they go to the Muses and tell each one of them which mortals have honored her” (259d).
                     The singers die and come to know the passage of death through the ground, then metamorphose
                     into the cicada chorus whose cyclical existence derives from earth. And while doubtless

                     whom the cicadas “report those who honor their special kind of music by leading a
                     philosophical life” (259d). The <em>Phaedrus</em> parable also keenly marks what Derrida has called “autoimmunity,” the exposure that

                  his Preface (qtd. in <em>Quest </em>71)? <em>Phaedrus</em>’ cicadas bring to mind how Cavell’s own “Immortality” Ode—the renunciation that we
                  are told launches his vocation as a writer— will not have been written in verse about
                  the memory of our birth “trailing” clouds of transcendence. (Anyway, does that mean
                  we are lingering back? Or born on with the “glory” streaming behind?) Rather, Cavell
                  imparts his series of interests through a modeling of prose that is a constant witness
                  to a maturity whose condition is not entirely <em>to lack</em>, but to sustain intimacy by accepting a condition of <em>going on without</em>, to continue to be discomposed by, youth’s music. “‘[H]aving been a child’ is a condition
                  that none of us—no matter how different our happy or unhappy stories may be—can ever
                  overcome, grow out of” (Marrati 957). Cavell’s topic is the “recall,” his reclaiming,
                  via Romantic poetry as well as through so much else, of what it means to be responsive
                  to the human animal by other standards besides a rehearsal of self-possession in our
                  measures of knowledge.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">My discussion is shadowed by two other foundational texts of a Romantic enlightenment
               and the oscillations of privacy and community so critical to Cavell: Kant’s 1784 essay,
               “An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?,” and Wordsworth’s “Intimations”
               Ode. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">I re-invest in the possibilities of a “Romantic” adolescence in this essay. However,
               the term brings its own risks. See Beckwith for extended discussion of the theatricalization
               of acknowledgment, and Anne-Lise François’s essay in the present collection for the
               temptation to heroism as a hyperbolic mode of investment and struggle. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">I say this despite the Emersonian overtones of “tuition” versus “intuition” in Kant’s
               “An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">In the introductory chapter of <em>This New Yet Unapproachable America</em>, Cavell thus offers that “[t]he idea of romanticism as calling for a new relation,
               a kind of union or completion of work between philosophy and literature, orients my
               remarks” (6, 4).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Cavell similarly cites T.S. Eliot’s comment that Blake “knew what interested him”
               as an epigraph to Part Four (<em>Claim </em>327).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Emily Sun comments on how “Cavell so often figures the voice as, paradoxically, transcendently
               emergent in a context of economic exchange” (personal communication).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">The ambiguity of what it means to “trail” a concern will recur at the end of this
               essay.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">See Charles Altieri, “Cavell and Wittgenstein on Morality: The Limits of Acknowledgment,”
               for a discussion of Cavell’s relation to Wittgenstein and criteria, which by contrast
               to my account elaborates a sense of dissatisfaction with expressive Romanticism and
               prefers “Wittgenstein’s wariness” (71). Altieri shares perceptive concerns about the
               possible re-grounding of an “imperious authority to the language of knowledge with
               regard to selves” in relation to the major theme of acknowledgment in Cavell (76).
               His essay articulates the risks internal to Cavell’s approach, which Altieri deems
               more assertively (and in appropriately Cavellian language) to be its “cost”: “What
               Cavell loses by this allegorical bent is the richness of a literary text’s powers
               for sheer display, for articulating the capacity of particular situations to elicit
               values like intimacy, intensity, and wonder without soliciting psychological and moral
               explanation”; in Eldridge and Rhie 62-77. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Beckwith (<em>passim</em>) brilliantly discusses the revolution in early modern ritual theory that leaves this
               sacramental poetics to the Romantics (and to Cavell) as an improvised diurnal task,
               not a social inheritance.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">An example that brings all these issues together is Cavell’s essay on Fred Astaire’s
               dancing and the American historical performance of race; <em>Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</em> 61-82.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody"><em>Little Did I Know</em> is likely to contextualize a lot of things for this kind of frustrated reader, but
               not to relieve her suspicion that the voice begs a patience that amounts to special
               consideration.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">“Like many other people, I’ve learned a lot, I hope, from having read M.H. Abrams,
               Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, and Harold Bloom on these topics. I’m not talking about
               some of their recent work so much as the work in the sixties and the early seventies
               when they lived and died with Romanticism” (“Questions and Answers,” 230). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">Cavell’s remarks in “Skepticism and a Word Concerning Deconstruction” set out certain
               limits for my assertion (see <em>Quest</em> 130-36).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">Mikics unhelpfully links Derrida to potboiler skepticism throughout his recent intellectual
               biography, which leads to fatuous sentences like his claim that, for the skeptic,
               “[t]he world begins to seem a realm of illusion, where we have tricked ourselves into
               supposing that we are real” (2). For more subtle thought on the linked skeptical approaches
               (and common misreadings) of Cavell and deconstruction, see Kates 12, and more broadly,

               violence and deconstructive violence work hand in hand to empty woman of herself,

               event of <em>Limited Inc</em>, but also the unparalleled, yet more sustaining and nuanced, and more deliberative
               account of Rousseau, J.L. Austin, and Paul de Man in the long essay “Typewriter Ribbon:
               Limited Inc (2)(‘within such limits’).” In this text (written <em>after</em> Cavell’s relevant replies to Derrida, but showing no sign of direct response to Cavell)
               Derrida attends to Austin more generously as a way above all of honoring Paul de Man:
               “Among all the remarkable merits of de Man’s great reading [of the “textual event”
               of Rousseau’s <em>Confessions</em> (see 315)] there is first of all this reckoning with the works of Austin. I say purposely,
               and vaguely, the “works” of Austin because one value of these works is to have not
               only resisted but marked the line of resistance to the systemic work, to philosophy
               as a formalizing theorization, absolute and closed, freed of its adherences to ordinary
               language and to so-called natural languages” (325). Overall, though, I find Cavell’s
               response to Derrida on Austin quite acute, since Cavell in effect reads Derrida’s
               approach as still caught up <em>in structuralism</em> (see <em>Philosophy</em> 168).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
