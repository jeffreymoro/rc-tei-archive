<head>Introduction: Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism</head>

</byline>
<p>The writings and distinctive philosophical approach of Stanley Cavell have garnered an increasing amount of sustained attention in edited collections over the past several years.<note place="foot" resp="editors">These collections include Eldridge and Rhie; Loxley and Taylor; Saito and Standish.</note> Viewed as a whole, this scholarship takes stock of Cavell’s career in helpfully descriptive and evaluative terms, surveying the astonishing range of his thought in discrete chapters of interpretive overview.  An important trend one can sense in this work is literary studies’ collective act of redress.  By contrast to an earlier generation of literary responses to Cavell still left ungathered, if not exactly repressed, there has been a belatedly full recognition not only of Cavell’s role in the survival of a subjective voice in twentieth-century philosophy where it once stood in danger of being lost,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Fischer, Gould.</note> but also of Cavell’s truly major existing and potential contributions to literary studies as such—his dedication to a project of thinking toward the fundamental “claim” of the literary in (and on) all rational conceptual thinking. </p>
<p>In an important essay published in 2009 in the journal <title level="m">New Literary History</title>, Toril Moi contends that “[t]he poststructuralist understanding of language, meaning, and interpretation has become the unspoken doxa of the humanities” (802).  And because of this disciplinary preference for treating language as a “concept” rather than as a practice via examples (818), Moi holds, “it is no coincidence that almost all the books on Cavell that have appeared since 1989 have been written by philosophers and not by literary critics” (802).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In their introduction to <title level="m">Stanley Cavell and Literary Studies</title>, Eldridge and Rhie also remark on the neglect of Cavell’s thought by literary critics (2). They attribute such ambivalence toward, or overlooking of, Cavell, to misconceptions about the meaning of “ordinary language” and to widespread theoretical resistance to his unreconstructed humanism (4); I take up the second of these issues toward the end of my essay in this collection.</note> Literary scholars may not have yet produced many of the books.  But is the absence of single-author studies headlined by Cavell in fact due to our poststructuralist antipathy to his mode of proceeding?  I don’t think so. A handful of significant recent books by literary scholars of British Romantic studies (primarily among “theory”-heavy Romanticists at home in Saussure’s realm of language-as-“concept”) evince closeness to Cavell by dropping at seemingly any point into the out-of-school genre of the sudden, urgent dialogue with his thought for a run of key pages. Often these conversations take place in the conceptually meaty introductions; and sometimes, as it were, they come nearer to the bone by virtue of lying outside the study proper, in the acknowledgments.  I suspect there are many lines of inquiry in current British Romantic studies that without Cavell would not only not <emph>mean</emph> in just the same way, but would not have come to <emph>be</emph>.  We cannot recall and test all the ideas and durable impulses in our scholarly life for their ultimate source, but, to steal from Wordsworth’s non-calculating acknowledgement of debt in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, a lot of the water—way downstream now, fanning out in all directions—comes from yon fountain.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For just a few significant interventions over the terms and stakes of Cavell’s work lately, which acknowledge in turn his role as a pioneer opening modes of thought, see Khalip 17-19; Favret 154-158; François (<title level="m">Open Secrets</title>) 82-83 and 150-151; Miller 81-83; 112-116; and 134-137; Sun 15 and 41-42; Terada 2-5 and 69-71; and Walker (<title level="m">Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism</title>) 21-24 and 39-45.</note>
</p>
<p>I am not the first commentator to note a basic alignment—in many ways, in effect, post-Kantianism—discernible between Cavell’s deployment of Romanticism and the critical-philosophical project of Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy in <title level="m">The Literary Absolute</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Critchley’s response to Cavell in <title level="m">Very Little . . . Almost Nothing</title> affirms the fragmentary ‘romanticism’ (his inverted commas) found in Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, and questions Cavell’s Emersonian Romanticism as an expression of privileged American exceptionalism.  For a very different judgment of (Cavell’s) Emerson, see Arsic; Ong shares a different approach to Cavell’s America—“unleavened” (as in a condition of migration or exile) and “broken” (as is bread)—through his recounting of the experience of his father.
               </note> Yet beyond his major American subjects of Thoreau and Emerson, there still is little published scholarship that engages Cavell’s thought at extended, close range with Romanticism as the moment that matters so much to him: the “perfectionist” moment that comes after religion, but before philosophy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Exceptions to this characterization can be found in Desmond, Duffy, and Rudrum. Gerald L. Bruns, <title level="m">On Ceasing to be Human</title>, is organized around Cavellian questions in connection with continental theory, and takes an approach companionate with mine here.
               </note>  This gap involves, too, at another related level of critical reception, the need for future literary-critical studies based in British Romanticism as a historical body of literature on which Cavell has performed several bravura readings to date. The present collection attempts to provide a hinge, moving between the record of Cavell’s engagement with British Romantic texts and newly staged speculations and interventions.  </p>
<p>The field for such encounters is rich, due to the staggering ability of Cavell’s writing at once to generate ideas and to give pause.  For Romanticists, the many interests of Cavell’s work include not only the pervasive concern with knowing and modern skepticism across all his books, but also topics as divergent as understanding and incomprehensibility, acknowledgment, denial, withholding and secrecy, responsibility, forgiveness, gender, melodrama, horror, monstrousness, therapy, cinematic ontology, religion, secularity, and spectatorship.  Yet two points of emphasis are persistent to any reader across his books: these are the idea of skepticism as an unappeasable predicament one does not solve but <emph>lives</emph> (skepticism as a problem whose “answer does not consist in denying the conclusion of skepticism but in reconceiving its truth” [<title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> 133]); and the discovery that acknowledgement and avoidance are primary human orientations (often to be construed through their equally human denial), with regard to which knowledge and ignorance (the more visible and epistemologically privileged terms) offer themselves rather as secondary formalizations—or even as evasions. There is a methodological culture of self-resistance that insinuates its way into those who dwell long with Cavell and serves broadly to unite the six contributions to <title level="m">Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism</title> in terms of their tone.  Four of the contributors here (Fry, François, Wilner, and Lindstrom) presented early versions of their essays as part of the “Stanley Cavell and Romanticism” panel, organized by Joshua Wilner and myself, at the 2010 International Conference on Romanticism (ICR), held in Lubbock, Texas.  We would all like to thank the unusually engaged audience present on that occasion.</p>
<ab rend="center">*</ab>
<p>At one point in the Preface to his book about Emersonian perfectionism,<title level="m"> Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome</title> (1990), Stanley Cavell tellingly divides his great American theme from Anglo-European configurations by evoking the difference between perpetually starting afresh, and unshakeable—one might say melancholy, Romantic—memory: “It is as if [Heinrich von] Kleist will neither accept nor refuse the Emersonian vision, an excruciating one for those who can call for it but who cannot imagine themselves shaking their memories and starting again; call them Europeans” (xxi).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> speaks from something like this spirit in recording Thoreau’s attitude about “the three revolutions most resonant for his time”: the American and French revolutions, as well as the protestant foment behind them.  “Of the Puritan revolution [Thoreau] says that it was ‘almost the last significant scrap of news’ from England” (<title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> 6).
               </note> Cavell’s working definitions of Romanticism evince, similarly, the mood of a restive admission of intimacy in place of a forthright identification with the subject.  </p>
<p>At a climactic point in Part Four of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (1979), Cavell arrives at the striking conclusion that “romanticism opens with the discovery of the problem of other minds, or with the discovery that the other is a problem, an opening of philosophy” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 467). There, his textual positioning (in the midst of Rousseau, with overtones of <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>and <title level="m">Faust</title> still lingering from the preceding discussion) yields a statement of dispossession one is tempted to make paradoxically central to the topic of <title level="m">Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism</title>: “I am so far in a position merely to rummage among such texts, not to possess them” (<title level="m">Claim </title>467). The admission of use without lawful right or patrimony, from a writer whose first job after all was in his father’s pawn shop,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the account of Cavell’s experiences in his father’s Sacramento pawnshop in <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> (24-27).
               </note> is preceded by the evocation of Romanticism found in his 1971 film study <title level="m">The World Viewed</title>: “To speak of our subjectivity as the route back to our conviction in reality is to speak of Romanticism. Perhaps Romanticism can be understood as the natural struggle between the representation and the acknowledgment of our subjectivity” (22).  Slightly earlier in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason </title>we also find this: “So both the wish for the exceptional and for the everyday are foci of Romanticism. One can think of Romanticism as the discovery that the everyday is an exceptional achievement. Call it the achievement of the human. —I believe I know something of the impatience such ideas can inspire” (463). Why the “impatience”?  Cavell may be offering a little (slightly rebarbative) sympathy for the “average” reader who finds his manner digressive. In similar contexts, Cavell defends the greenness of youth against the normative imperatives of philosophical maturity—a development to which he nonetheless complexly relents. Perhaps Cavell says “impatience” here, too, out of the same logic through which David Rudrum, in an incisive essay on Cavell and the Wordsworthian ordinary of the 1800 Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, has been led to ask: “How, then, to reconcile these two conceptions of the ‘common’, the ‘ordinary’? Can it be both the thing which is lost, mourned, searched for, quested after—and simultaneously the area the quester must search through for the thing which is lost?  If the ‘common’ and the ‘ordinary’ are to be thought of as <emph>both</emph> the needle and the haystack, then how could any quest ever get under way?” (169)</p>
<p>		All of Cavell’s major intellectual endeavors <emph>start out</emph> from this admission of being at a loss for orientation, a condition in which he is disappointed, equally, with the questions and ways of proceeding readily available to philosophy—but unseduced too by prefabricated “literary” means of recovery. For Cavell’s “creative philosopher,” then, there are “two tasks: to oppose skepticism and to oppose false answers to skepticism” (“Questions and Answers” 227). The “quest” gets under way because this sense of finding oneself and one’s language stymied, or not yet (or no longer) fully available, is so generative for Cavell.  As he sets forth in his Preface to the Beckman Lectures of 1983, assembled as roughly the first half of the book <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> (1988), the most well-known, powerful trajectory Cavell has offered to British Romantic studies so far could be outlined as “the theme of a romantic call for the unity of philosophy and poetry precipitated in the aftermath of Kant’s revolution in philosophy, traced strategically with respect to a limited collection of Romantic texts” (<title level="m">Quest</title> xi).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Cavell volunteers his suspicion elsewhere that canonical poets are or are in constant danger of being “monsters of fame”; “Remains to be Seen” (262).  
               </note> It is this formulation of the topic of Cavell and Romanticism with which the reader is most likely to be familiar.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Duffy is a forerunner to my account of <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>.
               </note>  In two chapters from <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> (framed as a chiasmus in titling, “Emerson, Coleridge, Kant (Terms as Conditions)” and “Texts of Recovery (Coleridge, Wordsworth, Heidegger . . .)” [<title level="m">Quest</title> 27-75]), Cavell presents astonishing variations on the post-Kantian situation he finds in reading the most famous products of Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetry and poetic theory.  Cavell charts “the Kantian bargain with skepticism (buying back knowledge of objects by giving up things in themselves) and Romanticism’s bargain with the Kantian (buying back the thing in itself by taking on animism)” (<title level="m">Quest </title>65). In this account, British Romanticism represents both an abstractly necessary schematic position and an absolutely concrete encounter with the words of texts and their specific weights. It marks the moment “too late for religion, because nothing is any longer common to our gods, and too soon for philosophy, because human beings are not interested in their new lives” (<title level="m">Quest </title>63).  </p>
<p>	Romantic poetry charts the experience of this crepuscular moment and provides a language for taking an interest—if need be, via a desperate-sounding, hyperbolic, and admittedly melodramatic register of the imagination “in which the stakes appear sometimes as the loss or gain of our common human nature, sometimes as the loss or gain of nature itself, as if the world were no more than one’s own—some such statement represents the general idea I have of what constitutes serious Romanticism’s self-appointed mission” (<title level="m">Quest </title>43).  This project elaborates for poetry, as for one of Cavell’s other recurrent genres of commentary, the Hollywood comedy of remarriage, a role without any justification external to itself: no overriding religious and metaphysical framework, juridical categories, or master narratives.  The "Lines of Skepticism and Romanticism" from the book’s subtitle make their appearance in the way Cavell paradigmatically reads verse as a convergence and a test of philosophical energies: “Now this quest of poetry for the recovery of the world (which I am interpreting as a recovery of, or from, the thing in itself), this way of joining or paralleling the philosophical effort to recover from skepticism, will look to poetry very like the quest for poetry, as if the cause of poetry had become its own survival” (<title level="m">Quest </title>45). </p>
<p>	Even more pointedly, the promise to advance via “lines” forecasts the heralded analysis of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner crossing a line: <emph>the</emph> line of the earth’s equator, which Cavell, in a tour de force of post-Kantian secular mythmaking, recasts as poetry’s transgressive desire to get beyond (under, or, possibly, inside?) the “architectonic [. . .] line or circle, closing off the region of the thing in itself” (<title level="m">Quest </title>47). The Mariner’s voyage plays out “the discovery that what presents itself upon a skeptical repudiation of [. . .] attunement is another definite, as it were, frozen, structure” (<title level="m">Quest </title>48). Cavell deals with the vexed problem of motivation in the poem by “understand[ing it] as the denial of some claim” to reciprocity upon the Mariner (<title level="m">Quest </title>56).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Cavell writes “motive,” keeping in mind the Mariner has “murdered to connect” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 56, 60)
               </note>  Addressing the shooting of the albatross not as a poeticization of original sin (as Robert Penn Warren had done to famous effect), not as the Fall but as an attempt to register “what the Fall is itself an allegory of” (<title level="m">Quest </title>48), Cavell revisits the theme of avoidance from his early essay on <title level="m">King Lear</title>. Crucially, he then rewrites “what might be called the poem’s moral in something like the reverse direction” from the message the Mariner shares himself, rather inconsequently in the face of events. “[T]o let yourself <emph>be loved</emph> by all things both great and small” is for Cavell the <title level="m">Rime</title>’s occluded insight (<title level="m">Quest </title>56). However, the poem does not reach this spiritual landfall even upon return to shore and the kirk’s goodly company. </p>
<p>		Cavell’s reading masterfully explains why <title level="m">The Rime</title>’s recitation competes with a wedding ceremony, and why Romantic poetry overall reinforces this anxiously close blind spot over representations of coupledom (see Walker 2009).  The weight next shouldered in <title level="m">Quest</title>, through Cavell’s rendering of Wordsworth’s “Intimations” Ode, connotes an imperative worth aligning to the impossible refrain of “go on” found in Wittgenstein or Beckett—or to Keats’s Moneta and the stunned need simply to get any movement off the spot of “frozen structure” where the poet-dreamer first stands. Punning at the expense of the dignity of the phrase, “strength in what remains behind,” to draw out the connotation of corpse-like remains (<title level="m">Quest </title>76), Cavell’s discussion of the Ode starts in a Freudian analysis of youth and is stimulated by John Wisdom’s philosophical account of speaking flowers (<title level="m">Quest</title> 68-70).  But the core of his discussion arrives with a surprising articulation of anger, and the need (as a cause, not an effect, of anything else happening) to renounce the spirit of private vengeance.  Since any tentative conclusions one might draw from the Wordsworth-Coleridge portions of <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> develop from this idea of renouncing vengeance—or better, of the relinquishing of vengeance as an unrationalized “evental” act of letting go (not in its form unlike the shooting of the bird)—the two paragraphs that follow are worth sharing in full:
         <quote>
<p rend="noCount">	We moderns are likely to imagine that the giving up of the ground of revenge is the <emph>effect</emph> of therapy.  I take the Intimations Ode to be saying on the contrary that this forgoing is the <emph>cause</emph>, or say the condition, of change. We do not know where the inspiration to give up revenge comes from. Much of its poet’s energy has to be spent in a kind of reseduction (as does much of the energies of Heidegger, and of Wittgenstein, not to say Freud), because our powers of being drawn from elsewhere (“we come from afar”), of being interested, in heaven or in earth, are deadened. Otherwise we would not require birth, or poetry, or philosophy.</p>
<p rend="noCount">	What remains of the “vision splendid” is that it “fades into the light of common day.”  Such is Wordsworth’s construction of the ordinary.  Shall we take this, as I suppose it commonly is taken, to be the same as a going out?  But “fades into” does not <emph>say</emph> “fades out.” It may propose some other mode of becoming, a happier disillusionment, so that the vision is preserved in the way in which it is forgone.  Wordsworth’s construction is to replace the ordinary in the light in which we live it, with its shades of the prison-house closing upon us young, and its custom lying upon us deep almost as life, a world of death, to which we are dead—replace it accordingly with freedom (“heaven-born freedom”); and with lively origination, or say birth, with interest.  How far can the vision be preserved and lived?  What remains of interest to us?  What for us is remains? We must turn to that. (<title level="m">Quest </title>75) </p>
</quote>
         “‘Fades into’ does not <emph>say</emph> ‘fades out.’” Neither is it readable as a parallel to the famous ambiguity of the “light of sense” in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> Book 6, in the common construction of “fades into” as either an excursive or darkening “going out.”  Thanks to Cavell’s way of investing meaning in what another reader might downplay as the mere grammar of how the words are chosen (and even enunciated—in the sense of, “so long as the poet hasn’t actually <emph>said</emph> it [. . .],” admitted the fear and its depth; and such things matter), a critical space for transformation of “common day” and reinvestment in the ordinary remains.  However, and equally, we are still on the floor with the question (a question that only makes grammatical sense if put instead as a constative declaration), “what is remains”? </p>
<p>Cavell, like M.H. Abrams in<title level="m"> Natural Supernaturalism</title>, seldom if ever considers the poetry of Byron.  However, the thoughts in the first paragraph of this long passage, on the prior “condition” of giving up grounds for “revenge,” indicate where Byron’s persona and defiant, stylized verbal gestures matter greatly in tension with Wordsworth. Never does Wordsworth enunciate as such, never does he formalize or close, the predicament of apartness (“a link reluctant in the fleshly chain”; <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> III. 72), which crystallizes (fixes, “freezes”) the Romantic hero in the seductive pose of turning decisively away from community. In the poetry of Lord Byron, the Ode’s unexplainable inspiration to let go of revenge instead festers at one further remove of self-conscious representation, crafting terms for specifically literary, symbolic vengefulness by making Time itself a proxy “avenger” of the poet (<title level="m">Childe Harold</title> IV. 130).  Time “gets even” for Byron’s “odd” sense of harboring a prior wrong. The mediatic sheen of the Byronic poet-hero comes from his way of giving anger just a single unforgettable twist. This rhetorical dress makes Byron’s language often serve as a cutting redress for woundedness. “That curse shall be Forgiveness” (<title level="m">Childe Harold</title> IV. 135) is the least Cavellian stylized verbal gesture of subjectivity that one can imagine. Yet, still, “[w]hat for us is remains?,” is the question on which Cavell ends the chapter on Wordsworth and Coleridge. One therefore must learn to figure a comparison between Wordsworth and the many Byronic “wrecks” of contemplation as a “ruin amidst ruins” (<title level="m">Childe Harold</title> IV. 25). </p>
<p> 	Acknowledgement of intersubjectivity, the irreducibly plural nature of being, offers the only way out of the melancholy conceit of the (in)quest.  Cavell’s Romantic literary “event” pursues the opening-out of what it would mean to inhabit a repertoire of meaningful individual and public responses, as part of what Kenneth Burke once called “equipment for living,”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Kenneth Burke, “Literature as Equipment for Living” in  <title>The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends</title>.</note> together and with ourselves.  Indeed, in the opening essay of this collection, “Your Friends and Lovers: Perfectionism’s Recounting of Romanticism,” Emily Sun aptly conveys the interpersonal quality of Cavell’s thinking on Romanticism and shares in his (Romantic perfectionist’s) critique of the overall Romantic tendency to contrast solitude to animist universalism, with the latter as a mode of “intimacy at large.”  In privileging (or at first seeming only to emphasize) the experiences of “genuine privacy” and “genuine publicness,” the discourse of Romanticism threatens to repress the “counting” of many “conditioned forms of intimacy,” beginning with friendship and marriage.  But not only friendship and marriage, as Sun shows in unfolding her remarkably lucid discussion of Cavell, Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “conversation” poem “Julian and Maddalo,” and Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>. In her reply to the climactic Shelleyan question, "Then, what is life?," Sun offers an array of concepts and concerns, and effectively invites scholars of Romanticism of all stripes to explore Cavell’s relevance—but particularly those interested in psychoanalysis and the connections between literature and the political philosophy of biopower: “it is breeding, issuing, multiplying, dividing, replicating, separating.  The fact of natality is itself a process of division” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.sun.html">par. 30</ref>), Sun (after Cavell) finely enumerates (see <title level="m">Quest</title> 88).  </p>
<p>By treating diurnal friendship and the conjugal pair as something of a constitutive blind spot of the stereotypically bipolar “clouds and crowds” Romantic vision, Sun’s approach builds from the important work of Eric C. Walker in his book <title level="m">Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism</title> (2009).  Her essay also stages an important (critical yet non-reductive) intervention in the way it models the deeply textured economic language and thought incident to what Cavell calls Romantic forms of spiritual “recovery.”  Hence Sun writes: 
            <quote>If such genuine publicness is one that needs re-establishment, if the intimacy-at-large Romanticism seeks is one that needs <emph>re</emph>covery, properly speaking, rather than just discovery, then, Cavell asks, ‘How did it get loose, as if disinvested? And why does friendship demand it, as well as marriage? Or does it?’ (<title level="m">Quest </title>65).  The recovery of intimacy within the contexts of friendship and marriage, according to Cavell’s economic simile above, involves a re-investment in the ordinary conceived as a complex network of interests and interconnections. (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.sun.html">par. 19</ref>)</quote>
</p>
<p>To my mind as editor, one of the meanings of Romantic studies perhaps finally reaching a post-New Historicist vantage is that we can consider the possibility that the “recoveries,” “investments,” “credit” sought, and forms of “interest” available to Romantic discourse aren’t all necessarily falsifications. Yet incorporating Cavell’s thought more deeply than heretofore into the mainstream of Romantic studies might actually prove—and not even in a very oblique sense—a sort of hybrid means to keep the charismatic, at times painful, urgency of 1980s New Historicist scholarship in play.  Even scholars unsympathetic to and scorched by the New Historicism must, I think, come to appreciate the moving and tough asseveration of Marjorie Levinson in the Afterword to her controversial chapter on “Tintern Abbey.” In that final section of her essay—a peroration, basically—which moves from Wordsworth in the realm of the poetic spirit to Adorno in philosophical and cultural critique, she holds that we as the poem’s reading community now must “refuse the transcendence [the poem offers] until such time as we can trace its source and explain its character. Then we too are liberated; we share in the poem’s ecstasies, or recover them in a meaningful form” (<title level="m">Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems</title> 57). It is a stunning conclusion, and leads me to the question: How different is this from what Cavell means by establishing the contested grounds of recovering meaning through a conditioning human “claim”? Levinson’s Afterword reads as the Marxian inflection of Cavell. And reciprocally, Cavell’s defense of skepticism as an unquenched, un-disavowed impulse never wholly cuts free from the twentieth century’s literary-theoretical “hermeneutics of suspicion.” It remains important to his skepticism that hollow victories <emph>do</emph> threaten, and are not brought in from an external foe but are the signs of an irreducible, internal division. In this framework Sun identifies the analytical opening for her discussion in Cavell’s own committed skepticism toward Romantic impulses—a skepticism which is not demonstrably opposed in key ways to Levinson’s stance in her “Tintern Abbey” Afterword, except perhaps in its fuller recognition of limits: that is, not only the “Wordsworthian” inhumanity, but the Humean and poststructuralist theoretical impossibility, alike, of tracing eloquence to the “source.” Sun writes that Cavell’s
            <quote>critique, presented in broad but deft strokes, consists principally of the charge that Romanticism accepts too readily ‘something like animism’ or what Ruskin terms the ‘pathetic fallacy’ in its efforts at re-animation (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53). This hastiness suggests a ‘bargain’ with the ‘concept of knowledge and the threat of skepticism’—which Cavell situates specifically in relation to Kant’s division of the claims of knowledge of the world between the subjective and the objective, the sensible and the intelligible (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53). Cavell’s prose evokes, in the articulation of this critique, a hypothetical ‘philosopher’ who ‘may feel’ that Romanticism ‘gives up the game’ too quickly of the claim of reason in enacting its task of recovery (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53). The proverbial ‘life of the world’ Romanticism seeks to bring back would seem to this philosopher to be one in need of a more qualified parsing or accounting.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Discussion of animism and the pathetic fallacy also features in Joshua Wilner’s essay, “‘Communicating with Objects’: Romanticism, Skepticism, and the ‘Specter of Animism’ in Cavell and Wordsworth” (Eldridge and Rhie 152-162).

</p>
<p>	In his effort to explain why <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> as a book needed its final three chapters on largely American sources, the manner in which Cavell himself allows for this dissatisfaction is to say that in his dealings with Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> “too much seemed left without clear and useful ways of going on” (<title level="m">Quest</title> x);<note place="foot" resp="editors">Though elsewhere Cavell is more sanguine way with representative ambitions: “If what I say about romanticism is false to these texts [of Wordsworth and Coleridge], then for my purposes here it is false to romanticism, period. If what I say is true but confined to just the texts I consider, I shall be surprised but not abashed; I know very well that there is in any case work ahead of me.” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 6)
            </note> at the very head of the encounter being called a quest, we are allowed in on the ambiguity of the book’s title as “the discovery of false necessity,” <emph>inquest of the ordinary</emph>: “the sense that the ordinary is subject at once to autopsy and augury, facing at once its end and its anticipation,” in “our habit, or habitat” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 9).  To make “that very inhabitation [. . .] from time to time perceptible,” as Cavell goes on to maintain on the same page, is in good measure the accomplishment of Paul Fry’s essay in this volume, also on Percy Shelley, which keenly and intricately recalibrates the twin skeptical lines being pursued when romantics both “conceive that some place elsewhere, or this place otherwise” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 9).  Fry reasons that if “life can be conceived as dead or insubstantial, as Shelley says [in the Conclusion to his poem “The Sensitive Plant”] and as Cavell says it is in the moment of Romantic skepticism,” “[i]t could follow then that death, which certainly does seem at least different from life, if not opposite, may be the alternative habitation Cavell or Shelley seeks” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 8</ref>) Given the wonderful philosophical freedom of movement shown by the playfully-toned poems which Fry primarily reads, the skeptical inversions of Shelley on death emerge as a new, counter- and post-Wordsworthian mode in which a counterfactual ordinary plays extraordinary variations.  A question one might feel inclined to linger upon after Fry’s discussion of Shelley as an urbane, essentially “probabilistic” skeptic before <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is, How does Shelley’s demonic impulse to appeal to death for final a settlement in his “last” days (even if this is just a mood, not a fate), relate to Cavell’s perfectionist interest in the perpetual quotidian reconfigurations of a “next” life, his commitment to imagining a philosopher in the Nietzschean terms of “a man of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow”? (Cavell, <title level="m">Philosophy </title>117)<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ann Wroe, “Resolutions, Destinations: Shelley’s Last Year.”
               </note>
</p>
<p>		An important distinction running through all Cavell’s writings, and particularly made visible by Fry’s essay, is that which holds between the categories Cavell terms “other minds” skepticism and “material-object skepticism”: in other words, solipsism and skeptical “doubt in the existence of the material world”; or yet more curtly, solipsism and skepticism (<title level="m">Quest</title> 55).  A question shades over the choice of “route” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 4) in his project of extending therapy to skepticism by way of its acknowledgment.  Fundamentally, does this claim have an epistemological or an ontological standing? In what philosophical mode, toward which enterprise, should we address a possible recovery?  Part of the challenge in following Cavell’s thinking here—and possibly an answer to our indecision about whether knowing or being is most at stake—I suspect lies in the recurrently transcritical movement through which Kant’s rigorously delimited settlements are made to secure a “critical” epistemological frame, a frame the poets are compelled to break so as to re-open a field for any possible dynamic “literary event” to occur.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I loosely borrow the idea of a “transcritical” movement, against the resolution of philosophical structure, from Karatani.  See Wilner’s essay in the Eldridge and Rhie collection for a discussion of how “other minds” skepticism underlies “external object” skepticism for Cavell.  
               </note> Epistemological settlements are disavowed to address poetry’s drive for ontological force. The paragraph I have been responding to begins with “[t]he issue, or specter, of animism,” and ends with what I take to be Cavell’s admission that the conduct of epistemology cannot be at once substantial and self-legislating: “A reasonable moral to draw from these lines is that we do not know what constitutes living our skepticism” (<title level="m">Quest </title>55).  </p>
<p>		In this sense the Romantic subject always finds herself, as Herman Melville’s deserting narrator says when becalmed near the start of the interminable <title level="m">Mardi</title>, in “a state of existence where existence itself seems suspended [Coleridge?],” in barren crossings and recrossings of a line in the unyielding presence of which a landsman [Wordsworth of the Lakes? But also Kant of Königsberg?] would be “tempted to recant his belief in the eternal fitness of things” (669).  But, giving food for thought—since my own approach and sense of Cavell’s gravity of investment puts the ontological character of doubt at the center of his Romanticism—in his essay here Paul Fry presses a different strategy: "It seems to me that at times Cavell’s argument would be more clearly delimited if he would distinguish more emphatically between ontological skepticism (doubt as to whether things and other minds exist at all, an emergent modern anxiety that Cavell associates with Descartes and Shakespeare) and epistemological skepticism.  It is the latter, epistemological skepticism, that clearly emerges from the Kantian ‘settlement’ as the concern of Romanticism" (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 13</ref>).  Fry goes on to remark, “Cavell argues in any case that the First Generation’s response to the Kantian settlement was animism” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 14</ref>). “Thanks for nothing” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 31), the Romantic responds to the Kantian settlement. Conversely, “No thanks for everything” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 31, 53) is how someone may feel with “his or her Kantian conscience in tact." (<title level="m">Quest </title> 53) </p>
<p>		In places of crucial bibliographical note, including the Question and Answer session following his “Texts of Recovery” essay in the collection <title level="m">Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism</title>, Cavell has tended to present his debts to Romantic critical theory as if they had a pre-critical birth. But his stated admiration for a previous, ecumenical moment of Romantic literary criticism should not be allowed to obscure the contemporaneous project that Cavell—as a matter of ongoing preoccupation, rather than as the narrative he himself cites—shares much more deeply with practices of writing and reading advanced by deconstruction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Kates 12; and, more broadly, Ziarek. 
               </note> My own contribution to this volume understands the autobiographical register of Cavell’s writing (and, to a lesser extent, of his often-remarked-upon prose style) alongside similar but tensional features of Derridean deconstruction. Cavellian skepticism and deconstruction have long shared the history of a comparable misreading, in which readers have attributed a relativistic <emph>denial</emph> of knowledge to these approaches, as if both projects betrayed an animus toward certainty. The topic is, needless to say, far too vast to broach here in a short introduction, but there exist basic and still endless ties between Cavell’s work and deconstruction, relating back to a shared intensiveness and performativity around themes of writing and reading one finds at least as far back as <title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> (1972).  I want to take Paul Fry’s schematically useful contrast between what he calls “Cavell’s understanding of the liberating power of skepticism” and the apparent “linguistic determinism” evinced by the late Shelley in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> as a fair word of warning, yet proceed into slightly less hedged comparisons between Cavell and deconstruction nevertheless. In a fascinating note found in the first chapter of <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, Cavell plays out a sort of Aesop’s tale with the event that deconstruction introduces to the timing of his career; he casts himself as a tortoise (“the turtle”) to the Yale School hare:
        <quote> It is, I trust, somewhat understandable why, in 1987, revising the present chapter, I have added this footnote and parenthetical observation [on ideas of writing and reading in <title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title>] to which it attaches.  I do not wish to seem unteachable, or unresponsive to the demand to relate what I do to the practice and theory of deconstruction.  But those who wish me well, and I hope some others will appreciate that 1972 (and the years preceding, during which the work that goes into <title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> was in preparation), is at yet an immeasurable distance in American time.  Naturally I am aware of the possibility that intellectual events of the past two decades may have preempted the fields I find myself in; but it is my fortune, good or bad, to imagine otherwise.  I was early enough so that it was quickly too late for me for a different start.  If this were a race, I would bet on the hare every time.  But if it is not, if there is not just one course, and if indeed we are not on the ground but at sea, the turtle may make sense. (<title level="m">Quest </title>17n)  </quote>
         Anxiety about being “preempted” coaxes out a version of the famous Emersonian <title level="m">Nachträglichkeit</title> of reading “our” original thoughts in the words of others.  As he insists, despite the fairly exact alignment of dates, on a kinked, out-of-joint timing, Cavell writes simultaneously to claim his earliness and belatedness over against the moment of impact of deconstruction: “I was early enough so that it was quickly too late for me for a different start.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title>, Cavell admits to feeling “hopeless” in response to the recurrent comment of some sympathetic readers that “I could not expect to get a hearing until I explicitly gave an account of the relation between my work and the work of Derrida” (472).
         </note> In his compelling remarks on Blanchot in <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title>, similarly, Cavell evinces a proportionately intense interest in broadly deconstructive and poststructuralist (“French”) modes of exposing philosophy to the event of (Romantic) literature (see 522-30). He proves characteristically both drawn to and wary of Blanchot’s poststructuralist style as exhibiting a “horror of understanding” (525). In his not-to-be-missed Afterword to the present collection, Joshua Wilner therefore <emph>can</emph> align Cavell insightfully with Derrida and deconstruction at a stimulatingly broad view—but only once he observes a signal shift in the latter from the early grammatology to a concern with the role of language in literature as a performative event.  Wilner concludes: “Here again, the shift from emphasis on the irreducibly figural dimension of propositional language to an emphasis on an irreducibly <emph>performative</emph> dimension has played a central role” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.wilner.html">par. 12</ref>)</p>
<ab rend="center">*</ab>
<p>With the decision to write on Jane Austen’s novels in his 2005 book <title level="m">Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</title>, Cavell revisits a remarkably fruitful and provocative engagement with British Romantic Literature that had begun in his work decades before in a different key. He turns from a nearly impossible communication of poetic election—the sort of “glory” that can only be brought to knowledge under the stars of duress, loss, and alienation in Wordsworth’s "Ode"—toward a contrasting starting place in sociality, communication, and inclusion. Yet this sociable change brings with it the tension that these are not only generic conventions in “polite” Austenian literature, but ideological norms held at the risk of the merely compulsory, coercive, and meaningless. </p>
<p>If the Wordsworth-Coleridge frame of Romanticism from Cavell’s <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> positions the urge toward animism against the threat of skepticism that this affirmation belies, at stake in his reading of Austen is something like a hidden point of balance just under the six novels’ “renowned surface of containment” (Cavell, <title level="m">Philosophy</title> 124). How should one respond to Cavell’s paradoxical elaboration of an “unconstrained” interest (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 126) in Austen’s characteristic style and social world, as determined by that “containment”? Cavell in his comments on Austen follows a radically different economy of utterance than that which his brilliantly hyperbolic investment in Romantic poetry pursues. In discussing her novelistic treatment of a dynamic of “vulnerable conformity,” Cavell sees the pedagogical lesson in Austen—“to exemplify instances in which the soul can learn not to be crushed by compromise”—as part of an ethical account of global modernity in which the crises stem from a less vocal drama than poetic world-making or -losing. The drama of Austen heroines and readers is that “one senses one’s consent to be elicited” by the exceedingly imperfect existing world (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 123). </p>
<p>A question emerges possessing what seems like a retrospective scope over Cavell’s whole career, but its contour follows specifically from the engaged reading of Jane Austen: How exhaustive is a public communication ethic to the project Cavell calls “rational transformation,” the spiritual renewal of Austen’s heroines in a perfectionist democratic society (<title level="m">Philosophy </title>189)?<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Nazar for insightful judgments on the reach of “communicative ethics” into analysis of Austen’s novels and their interpersonal texture. 
               </note>  Alternately, how much like a tragic sign of election does the fate of an “unshareable” consciousness remain (<title level="m">Philosophy </title>128)?  And then, Cavell pointedly wonders, could “women, of [George] Eliot’s, let alone Jane Austen’s time, [. . .] have afforded” such a “cost of a great separation” (<title level="m">Philosophy </title>129)? Thus, in a penetrating footnote concerning a cinematic theme—the melodrama of the unknown woman—which in several books precedes Cavell’s interest in Austen’s novels and anticipates that subject thematically, Michael Fischer has observed: “Cavell links Wittgenstein’s concentration on pain in the <title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> to the fascination of psychoanalysis and cinema with the sufferings of women.  By the turn of the century, [according to Cavell] ‘psychic reality, the fact of the existence of mind, has become believable primarily in its feminine (you may say passive) aspect’” (Fischer 152n). Cavell’s reading of Austen figures this gendered instantiation of “the existence of mind” and registers the conviction in (or problem of) “other minds,” as he treats different, character-specific versions of the passion and suffering incident to the intellectual tragedy of separation. Risks of nullification and exposure emerge for characters such as Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny Price, and Emma Woodhouse, oscillating along the extremes of a criterial dimension Cavell has repeatedly discussed in Wittgenstein over the years: a fantasized rift between total privacy and utter, transparent, rule-following convention. For Cavell, in taking up the conditions of secrecy and utter conventionality that are typically forced upon discussions of the possibility of private language in Wittgenstein, it is “as if the ordinary is the perfectly open secret” (<title level="m">Contesting Tears</title> 157).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the long Postscript to <title level="m">Contesting Tears</title>, Cavell explicitly engages with Eve Sedgwick’s trope of queer closeting in terms of the scene of the philosophical closet: a location found recurrently in first-person accounts of the skeptic’s reflective position and “orientation” to the world in the act of trying to bring the world to knowledge. 
               </note>
</p>
<p>Cavell’s prompting to take up Austen—ostensibly in order to introduce a more “sensible” temper into the discussion than his prior encounters with the lyric poets had done—can make him sound almost Habermasian in emphasis, as Anne-Lise François in her essay here sharply points out. As a performative speech act, the pledge of allegiance, to be comprehensible to the group, needs to go on running the risk of turning out infelicitously at every turn, since this apparently contingent failure is a fate that underlines the pleasures of language conducive to happiness.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Within a larger context of convivial agreement, Cavell’s points of departure from Shoshana Felman in his foreword to the new English edition of <title level="m">The Scandal of the Speaking Body</title> reflect this arguably “Habermasian” turn, which—ironically—he invokes there to suggest the drift of profound and not fully voiced differences (the opposite of communicative transparency) between his own alignment to Austin and Felman’s reading. 
               </note> Placed in terms of the discussion that François’s essay provides (whose title itself may allude to the Cavell text on Wittgenstein, “Declining Decline”), we might ask in what sense Cavell’s extended project of developing a legacy of “moral perfectionism” is at least as intimate, all along, with what she calls the gesture of “passing” on the urge toward judgment, or “conceding” and declining perfection?   Is there an outlet in Cavell’s thought to release us from the alternate instrumentalism that his “literary” philosophy demands to be undertaken as a course of therapy?  François’s reading of the figure of “decline” is one about which she herself performs a deft excuse, allowing that her essay has taken the “inconsequent” turn that such things often do between the prospectus (promise) and the event of a piece of writing.  François’s gesture opens, too, upon another aspect of Cavell’s work: the subject of “diurnal” marriage, to which Eric Walker devotes his attention.  Walker’s essay demonstrates at a convincing depth that Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Persuasion</title> offers the very model of Cavellian “remarriage.” His linked discussion of adoption in <title level="m">Emma</title> then conveys—through Cavell’s own themes of self-adoption and diurnal re-marriage—a philosophical framework in which cultural categories, not the naturalization of biological ties and tropes, go all the way down as they decline “settlement.”</p>
<p>In we step back, then, to view overall these writings on Romantic-era prose fiction, two decades on from his engagement with the British Romantic poets in <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, we can understand Austen to represent a further moment of what Cavell had called “the domestication of the fantastic and the transcendentalizing of the domestic” (<title level="m">Quest </title>27). Through changes in gender and genre, it is possible to take Cavell to imply that the perfectionist ordinary of an Austen novel looks more like the experiential conditions where “remarriage,” if the quester is to find happiness at all, has got to take place.  In <title level="m">Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</title>, remarriage is not “sublimed into metaphor when the really serious poetic business of uttering truths about our happiness [is] attempted” (Sutherland 11). A primary feature, which many readers will feel to be a benefit of Cavell’s refocusing on Austen for the latest act of his great theme of remarriage, is that such a construction of conjugality and the ordinary never abstracts itself to the plane of a figurative promise. It resists a Wordsworthian or Kantian quasi-formalistic, purposive “fit” between the categories of mind and the world, but emerges instead as an improvised diurnal task (“perfectionism” as a Nietzschean convalescence pitched toward affirming a <emph>next</emph> form of life, in pursuit of the <emph>last</emph>). To revisit the language just quoted from <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, this task offers a domestication of fantasy that may constitute an appeal from “criterial” societal norms, but without any transcendence to compensate.</p>
<ab rend="center">*</ab>
<p>I end this introduction with a brief discussion of a major British Romantic poet whose writings are not organized—whether that be figuratively, or referentially and “realistically”—around the question of marriage. During the course of Section IV of Part One of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>—a section that deals with the dissatisfaction implicit in Cavell’s responding to Wittgenstein’s use of criteria, called “What a Thing Is (Called)”—there occurs this sudden swerve from philosophy as such to literary particulars, focusing on Keats. Cavell has been talking about the notorious example from Wittgenstein having to do with the feeling and expression of pain, the so-called impossibility of there being a private language, et cetera, and he turns to the example of a physician’s way of knowing pain:</p>
<quote>
<p rend="noCount">But why couldn’t it be that a doctor’s knowledge of the subject of pain is just what is expressed in what he or she does—not merely with his trained hands, but in the very distance of his reactions to me? He trusts his hands and training to show his response; if I trust his knowledge and his reactions, I may feel more known by them than by a more apparently warm or constant response to what I feel. Not just because they give me hope [. . .]. But because I, as it were, learn a new response to my pain; not a refuge from it, but a place for it, a proportion to its presence. The distance comforts as truth can. (Naturally I do not deny that truth can be used as a weapon; especially when it comes in fragments.)</p>
<p rend="noCount">     And then sometimes the words of response get very particular:</p>
<quote>
<p rend="noCount">My dear Reynolds—I cannot write about scenery and visitings . . . . One song of Burns is of more worth to you than all I could think for a whole year in his native country. His misery is a dead weight upon the nimbleness of one’s quill. I tried to forget it—to drink a Toddy without any Care—to write a merry sonnet; it won’t do . . . . We can see horribly clear, in the works of such a man, his whole life, as if we were God’s spies . . . . My sensations are sometimes deadened for weeks together—but believe me I have more than once yearned for the time of your happiness to come . . . . [from John Keats, Maybole, July 11, 13, 1818]</p>
</quote>
</quote>
<p>At the end of this excerpt we learn that the letter’s addressee, the poet and parodist John Hamilton Reynolds, is about to marry and settle down into contented bourgeois life (indeed, this was the main reason Reynolds later cited for not accompanying the dying Keats to Rome); and Cavell’s focalization of perfectionism in Keats—an outsider but not a mocker of that rather snug “happiness to come” in the Reynolds household—indicates the degree to which Romanticism’s negativity matters to Cavell.  Similarly, that “[t]he distance comforts as truth can” almost sounds the same note as Paul de Man’s 1966 introduction to Keats’s poetry, where the presence of philosophy comes to announce itself by the impersonal effort get to clear to see ourselves—not recover anything—by poetic knowledge.  “There are moments of straightforward escape in Keats” (de Man 541), de Man says of some of the early poetry, but “[t]he power which forces a man to see himself as he really is, is also called ‘philosophy’ in the later Keats” (de Man 545).  Eric Idsvoog has remarked to me in personal conversation that Cavell’s turn here—which involves the move from showing interest in a physician’s way of knowing pain to Keats’s, as a type both of physician and patient—offers an extraordinary gloss on the long passage from <title level="m">The Fall of Hyperion</title> about the poet as “A humanist, physician to all men” (l.190).  Keats’s most relevant passage from <title level="m">The Fall</title> reads: 
        <quote>
<lg>
<l>‘None can usurp this height,’ returned that shade,</l>
<l>‘But those to whom the miseries of the world </l>
<l> Are misery, and will not let them rest.</l>
<l>All else who find a haven in the world,</l>
<l>Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,</l>
<l>If by a chance into this fane they come,</l>
<l>Rot on the pavement where thou rotted’st half.’  (ll. 147-153) </l>
</lg>
</quote>
         		At the same time, the allusion Keats makes to <title level="m">King Lear</title> fuses damaged, vengeful, yet nevertheless somehow forgiving words from the last act to the melancholy example of Robert Burns<note place="foot" resp="editors">Stafford, 107-109, expands on the context of Keats’s travel to Burns country in Scotland in the summer of 1818.  She quotes the same letter that interests Cavell, retaining an outburst of misogynistic language Cavell puts under ellipses. 
         		</note> (“We can see horribly clear, in the works of such a man, his whole life, as if we were God’s spies”) (compare to <title level="m">King Lear</title> V.iii.17).  The intense literary double vision of <title level="m">King Lear</title> and Burns presents an occasion of another of Cavell’s staggering moments.  Transitioning from <title level="m">Lear</title>’s political theology of confessional surveillance, to finitude and particularity, Cavell answers the letter: 
         <quote>Burns made himself clear; the rest is up to whoever is there, and can.  I don’t say you have to rise to Keats’s response.  (I don’t mean rise to being able to write like him, but up to responding like that; allowing room for another’s misery to be unforgettable.) But to know the subject, that it is pain, is to respond <emph>to </emph>it; and if other things are on your mind, and your sensations are sometimes deadened for weeks together, then to know that <emph>that</emph> is a response, and yet leaves you freedom for a further response.  (<title level="m">Claim</title> 82).</quote>
         Cavell writes here to reinvest something like <emph>the</emph> meaning (not the authoritative final word, but the sponsoring possibility of any “next” meaning) into a field of inquiry and re-investment.  He works at the minimal degree of a possible sustaining response.  The generous outward gesture, which he extends not only to future readers of this letter, but to the dead Burns and the soon to be dying Keats, and toward the unforthcoming register of himself, too, lies in disburdening the (near) affective nullity from its added burden of pressing and disabling shame, in order to allow space to experience both “another’s misery [as] unforgettable” and for “freedom for a further response.” Cavell’s Romantic perfectionism offers itself as an allowance for the fluctuating (non-) succession to this realm of further responsiveness. Just as Cavell’s claim is addressed to an unspecified “you”—that response might come, democratically, but also in a formal sense, “lyrically,” from anyone anywhere.  </p>
<p>But who else would have recognized the opportunity for taking an interest in just this way? And who else would have placed a hand upon life just there, after the model of affective investment in Keats, but where he flatly concedes he has no amplitude (no force, no pulse) of feeling to share—not enough thoughts in a whole year to match the one song? In his passage of response to Keats, Cavell demonstrates his remarkable capacity to welcome under-explained and unforthcoming responses, to meet the radical condition of passivity in its own form of an appropriate, negatively capable analysis.  There will be more readings that take stock of what it could have meant for Keats to allude to <title level="m">Lear</title> and Burns in a letter, and more opportunities to model the sympathetic responding to pain. But <emph>this</emph> language—an act of extraordinary promise and a difficult prognosis—exemplifies Cavell’s writing well on at least two fronts: by its inimitable, layered realization of that very capacity for an individual “further response”; and in its perhaps yet more signal capacity to allow time and space for the responses of others, conditions that Cavell’s writing regards as external to itself, but not as indifferent or claimless.</p>
<p>Like several other important thinkers in the theoretical humanities in recent years—among them Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, and Alain Badiou—Cavell brings philosophy and literature into contact and forms a distinctive attitude about the performative “event” of literary language as such.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For two further points of reference in Cavell’s treatment of major texts and thinkers as “events,” see his response to George Kateb, “What is the Emersonian ‘Event’?,” in Emerson’s <title level="m">Transcendental Etudes</title>, and the chapter “The Wittgensteinian Event” in <title level="m">Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</title> (192-212).
         </note>  Eschewing the violence and dismissal of Romanticism found at least in Badiou, among the major figures above, Cavell in his deeply textured relation to speech-act theory nonetheless advances an “evental” claim on and through British Romantic literature. The issues of skepticism and acknowledgement are the recurrent and great ones for Cavell.  Yet in Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime</title>, in Wordsworth’s "Ode," and now in Keats’s letter we have seen a critical theme in Cavell’s work as that of the “literary event” of Romanticism. Godlike at times, but by contrast finite and fragile, the form of investment through which Cavell comes to understand this event is that of an unrationalized act of allowing and of relinquishment, the releasing of one’s hold over of the grounds of anger, or even of an adequate affective “response” at all, in the case of Keats’s example.  The quality of Cavell’s attention to this Romantic claim of literature in the literary "event" is attested to by his fundamental gesture to acknowledge a constitutive space outside his reach.  </p>

<head> I. Acknowledging Romanticism: Adolescence and “the Choice of Finitude” </head>
<p>A useful premise from which to approach the “Romantic” position of Stanley Cavell’s thought is that we only ever “confess” to a romantic attitude toward the claims of experience, and
                  that skepticism and idealism are two tensional poles of the same predicament. “To be interested [. . .] in the costs of knowing to the knowing creature, I suppose one will have to take an
                  interest in certain preoccupations of romanticism,” Cavell admits near the end of the second part of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (242). As he rounds the bend on a
                  particularly tortuous stretch of argumentation, Cavell’s purchase on reason in this book—which began as a Harvard dissertation in 1961 and yet still (even before the newly written
                  Part Four) contains what are his most important and enduring lines of discussion— can barely afford to mention his Romantic preoccupations. Alongside the study’s venture over the
                  abyss of a young philosopher’s professional legitimacy, Cavell knows the wise tactic is to hold to other frameworks besides the Romantic. Yet the misstep he at first seems to fear,
                  then eventually and more hospitably welcomes, need not represent any greater fall than, as he puts it, the “implication that such a one [the narcissist or “passive” skeptic figured
                  as adolescent] just ought to grow up” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 464).</p>
<p>And yet to say that he responsively prolongs—or even that he re-describes as metaphysical—the heady and disorienting interval between pure childhood and adulthood, innocence and
                  knowledge, isolation and sociality, is one way to characterize Cavell’s and <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>’s central achievement. Paired with autobiography, “adolescent
                  desire” is also the term Derrida reaches for in his interview “This Strange Institution Called Literature” in the effort to place his joint commitment to literature and philosophy,
                  settling on “neither the one nor the other.” Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions </title>provides the immediate context of Cavell's remark about growing up—offered at a crucial
                  point of transition between the informally marked sections “Narcissism” and “Proving the existence of the human”—in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, Part Four
                     (464).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> My discussion is shadowed by two other foundational texts of a Romantic enlightenment and the oscillations of privacy and community so
                     critical to Cavell: Kant’s 1784 essay, “An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?,” and Wordsworth’s “Intimations” Ode. </note> The earlier moment I cite to begin this
                  essay takes its cue from an important text of Enlightenment skepticism: Hume’s <title level="m">Dialogues on Natural Religion</title> (Section IX), and Demea’s long-echoing question,
                  “<emph>What was it</emph> [. . .] which determined <emph>something</emph> to exist rather than <emph>nothing</emph>, and bestowed being on a particular possibility, exclusive of the
                  rest?” (qtd. in <title level="m">Claim</title> 242). In joint response to Hume’s skepticism and to Kant’s transcendental construction of the possibility of experience in <title level="m">The Critique of Pure Reason</title> (together dubbed “the onslaughts of Hume and Kant” [465]), Cavell concludes <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, Part Two,
                  with a resonant and vivid statement of the impulse behind the Romantic crisis lyric: <quote>If we can’t <emph>decide</emph> that [. . .] the things of our world exist, shall we say that we
                        <emph>believe</emph> they exist? That is something a philosopher will say in the course of that rehearsal of our beliefs with which he begins his investigation of their
                     validity as a whole. But that rehearsal does not <emph>express</emph> belief in anything; it contains no claims. Or shall we say that we have <emph>faith</emph> that the things of
                     our world exist? But how is that faith achieved, how expressed, how maintained, how deepened, how threatened, how lost? (243)</quote>
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Cavell’s points of orientation when he finds himself located in Romanticism nevertheless remain accessible to some of our broader culture’s most common and
                  even cliché norms of usage, when claiming offhandedly that a person or representation is “romantic” as a throwaway expression. In his book about youth culture in twentieth-century
                  poetry, Stephen Burt lines up the Romantic stereotypes to serve the purpose of historical overview: <quote>The modern adolescent is not the green youth of early modern writing; nor
                     is he (much less she) the Romantic child. “Before the Romantic” period, claimed William Empson, “the possibilities of not growing up had never been exploited so far as to become a
                     subject for popular anxiety.”...The idea that immaturity might be preferable to maturity per se, that incompletion of any sort might be better than completion, that remaining
                     outside society indefinitely might be better than joining it, that irrational, instinctive, excessive, emotion-driven speech and behavior might have more value than rational,
                     considered action and thought—these are all, of course, Romantic ideas; they inform, but predate, modern adolescence, which acts them out and represents them often. (8-9) </quote>
                  Criticism like this reflects one popular way of thinking about Romanticism (often strategically, as a staging ground to some other argument) as the umbrella term for a diagnostic but
                  more or less revisable list of traits. But for better or worse, Cavell responds to Romanticism existentially, as a non-localized challenge impossible to put in its place with a list.
                  For my purposes in this essay, the key situations rehearsed by Cavell’s use of Romanticism will be existential: these include the rejection of the world often charged to adolescence
                  and the celebration of a first world through narrating its loss as the autobiographical fiction of childhood.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I re-invest in the possibilities of a
                     “Romantic” adolescence in this essay. However, the term brings its own risks. See Beckwith for extended discussion of the theatricalization of acknowledgment, and Anne-Lise
                     François’s essay in the present collection for the temptation to heroism as a hyperbolic mode of investment and struggle. </note> Throughout I will also be considering the
                  Romanticism of his thought’s form: the in-between status of the professional expertise (and genre) in which Cavell writes (about) literature and philosophy (“neither the one nor the
                  other. What [is] it?”). </p>
<p>Though our contemporary understanding of adolescence would be anachronistic to apply in strictly empirical terms to tturn-of-the-nineteenth-century writings, Cavell uses it anyway
                  precisely to locate a metaphysical impasse in Wordsworthian Romanticism. He writes as if scouting the ground ahead: “If Rousseau can be said to have discovered the fact of childhood
                  in human growth, and Wordsworth the loss of childhood, then Romanticism generally may be said to have discovered the fact of adolescence, the task of wanting and choosing adulthood,
                  along with the impossibility of this task” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 464). As at once a “fact” that the Romantics are said historically to have “discovered,” as well as an
                  impossible “task,” Cavell imagines adolescence as interminable and contrary; far more than a period phase of “normal” individual human development—say, the time when most people in
                  modernized countries attend school and test peer identities—for Cavell the project of adolescence <emph>is</emph> these things <emph>and</emph> opens onto an unending horizon for
                  individual development through “serious adult” transformation. Cavell’s quasi-conceptual use of the “adolescent” stage explains in the fullest sense why he thinks of philosophy
                  altogether as “grownup” (lifetime) education. For Cavell, then—in a turn of thought I make more use of below—what we might call the overall claim of Romanticism is not saturated
                  by its description as a discovered “fact” of a certain phase in individual or cultural life; Romanticism, rather, is voiced through something like the Derridean idiom of an
                  imperative-impossible task. The Wordsworthian sobriety of dutifully wanting to want adulthood, and to sing its endurance, in this sense keeps faith with the child and honors youth’s
                  testimony of resistance, but only under the aegis of a Romanticism that proscribes adulthood as an impossible state to will (autonomously) or to desire (realistically). Kant’s figural
                  understanding of the state of minority as a lack of self-reliance at any age, and his redefinition of maturity as epistemological courage (to <emph>dare</emph> to know), from this
                  point of view offer surprisingly little traction for approaching Cavell’s attitude toward Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I say this despite the Emersonian overtones
                     of “tuition” versus “intuition” in Kant’s “An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?”</note> Romanticism instead features in Cavell’s writing as a challenge (accepting a
                  different kind of <emph>dare</emph> than Kant proposes? [compare <title level="m">Philosophy</title> 160]) to “express” rather than merely “rehearse” our faith, to weigh what we
                  often can’t help <emph>but</emph> know. </p>
<p>Before Part Four, <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> often leaps back and forth from enlightenment to modernist contexts in moody flashes that act out the very rejections
                  of that adolescence, via the brilliance of a Romanticism which makes youth and “the impossibility” of “choosing adulthood” its very subject. Encountering what Cavell in the same
                  passage calls the “choice of finitude” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 464), however, Romanticists in 2014 are far less likely to be put off than most philosophers were when <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> was first published (1979). Instead of being taken as a concession, Cavell’s remark (“I suppose one will have to take an interest”) might be
                  understood better to belie deep affinities with a project he does not wish lightly to expose in its pre-formative stages.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In the introductory
                     chapter of <title level="m">This New Yet Unapproachable America</title>, Cavell thus offers that “[t]he idea of romanticism as calling for a new relation, a kind of union or
                     completion of work between philosophy and literature, orients my remarks” (6, 4). </note> Coming soon after his close-range dealings with the academic positivism dominant through
                  the mid-twentieth century decades during which he was trained as a philosopher, the “interest” divulged in this moment previews a terrain that has become Cavell’s most familiar
                  intellectual haunt since.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cavell similarly cites T.S. Eliot’s comment that Blake “knew what interested him” as an epigraph to Part Four (<title level="m">Claim </title>327).</note>
</p>
<p>If pressed to answer the question, What is Cavell’s Romanticism?, with a more direct reply than those initiated above, the imaginative legacy of “skepticism” provides the widest
                  terms throughout his work through which to archive an answer. In particular I would locate Cavell’s habitual sense of Romanticism in the language of economic exchange as “the cost of
                  knowing to the knowing creature” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 242);<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Emily Sun comments on how “Cavell so often figures the voice as, paradoxically, transcendently emergent in a
                     context of economic exchange” (personal communication).</note> the concern of his skepticism, in other words, is less the foundational grounds of knowledge (the positivist dogma
                  of reducing meaning to true and false claims) than its “creaturely” situation: the availability of our responses to the many forms that questions about knowing can take (communal
                  criteria, and terms for their acceptance or denial). At the same time, this first intervention in Romanticism as such for Cavell engages with modernism’s two greatest philosophical
                  texts. Romantic concerns point not only to the winding “trails” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 242)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The ambiguity of what it means to “trail” a concern will recur at the end of this
                     essay.</note> of a socially-alert autobiographical range we have since grown accustomed to from Cavell's books, but also in direct lines to both Heidegger and Wittgenstein. According to
                  Cavell, as he provides a kind of autobiographical map of landmark philosophy in the twentieth century: <quote>
<title level="m">Being and Time</title> goes further than <title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> in laying out how to think about what the human creature’s relation
                     to the world as such is (locating, among others, that particular relation called knowing); but Wittgenstein goes further than Heidegger in laying out how to investigate the cost
                     of our continuous temptation to knowledge, as I would like to put it. In <title level="m">Being and Time</title> the cost is an absorption in the public world, the world of the
                     mass or average man. (I find Heidegger’s descriptions of such a world, especially in Chapter IV of <title level="m">Being and Time</title>, the least original and most superficial
                     passages in that uneven book.) In the <title level="m">Investigations </title>the cost is arrived at in terms (e.g. of not knowing what we are saying, of emptiness in our
                     assertions, of the illusion of meaning something, of claims to impossible privacies) suggestive of madness. (I will go further along certain trails of this suggestion in Part
                     Four.) And in both the cost is the loss, or forgoing, of identity or of selfhood. To be interested in such accounts as accounts of the cost of knowing to the knowing creature, I
                     suppose one will have to take an interest in certain preoccupations of romanticism. (<title level="m">Claim</title> 241-42) </quote> To use a different sort of therapeutic metaphor,
                  rather than Cavell’s graphemic idea above of the “trail” or trace, this passage strikes off in the direction upon which Part Four of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>
                  achieves its “breakthrough.” Cavell owns his version of Romanticism explicitly after this moment, as what he means by the challenge of living one’s skepticism alongside the
                  simultaneous impossibility of living one’s skepticism. </p>
<p>The body of Cavell’s work can be understood as enacting the challenge to acknowledge each of these words, “living” and “skepticism,” seriously enough together. It is through his
                  relentlessly focused and inventive <emph>carrying on</emph> with that problem that Cavell departs so bravely from his teachers. The double imperative distinguishes his project
                  from the rejection of private language found in different ways in J.L. Austin and Wittgenstein. As unlike as their approaches are, Austin and Wittgenstein together leave the very
                  recognition of a gulf between (idiosyncratic) isolation and (coercively “transparent”) community to the effort that only a peculiarly Romantic, aporetic, sort of architecture would
                  ever dare attempt to bridge, or formulate as its constitutive problem.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Charles Altieri, “Cavell and Wittgenstein on Morality: The Limits of
                     Acknowledgment,” for a discussion of Cavell’s relation to Wittgenstein and criteria, which by contrast to my account elaborates a sense of dissatisfaction with expressive
                     Romanticism and prefers “Wittgenstein’s wariness” (71). Altieri shares perceptive concerns about the possible re-grounding of an “imperious authority to the language of knowledge
                     with regard to selves” in relation to the major theme of acknowledgment in Cavell (76). His essay articulates the risks internal to Cavell’s approach, which Altieri deems more
                     assertively (and in appropriately Cavellian language) to be its “cost”: “What Cavell loses by this allegorical bent is the richness of a literary text’s powers for sheer display,
                     for articulating the capacity of particular situations to elicit values like intimacy, intensity, and wonder without soliciting psychological and moral explanation”; in Eldridge
                     and Rhie 62-77. </note> Cavell needs his deployments of Romanticism to project that sort of bridge, which (as Derrida shrewdly declares of Kant) is not “<emph>an</emph> analogy”
                  so much as “the recourse” to analogy in itself to move “between two heterogeneous worlds, a third term to cross the abyss” (<title level="m">The Truth in Painting</title> 36). This
                  is a job for the reflective judgment, to be sure. But is it also an urging of adolescence? If the task of ordinary language is to lead philosophy back from the metaphysical brink through
                  better knowledge of what we are saying, to engage with “certain preoccupations of romanticism” involves assuming the risks of emptiness, the illusions about meaning, and the
                  unshareable privacies “suggestive of madness.” Yet prior even to this list of deficiencies, a Romantic condition mobilizes Cavell’s anti-Kantian claim “to be interested” at all. In that
                  spirit, an early essay from <title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say</title> (“A Matter of Meaning It” [1969]) appeals so far back as Martin Luther to establish the “guiding
                  ambition of Romanticism” not as the Kantian limit-concept of critical philosophy, but as an effort toward self-critical renewal: a dauntless critique of sacraments in order to make
                  “[a]ll our experience of life [. . .] baptismal in character” (229).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Beckwith (<emph>passim</emph>) brilliantly discusses the revolution in early modern
                     ritual theory that leaves this sacramental poetics to the Romantics (and to Cavell) as an improvised diurnal task, not a social inheritance. </note>
</p>
<p>Moving on chronologically in Cavell’s writing from there, another essential Romantic proposition appears in the middle of Chapter Two of <title level="m">In Quest of the
                     Ordinary</title>, with the notion of “an idea that Emerson and any Romantic would be lost without, that the world could be—or could have been—so remade, or I in it, that I could
                  want it, as it would be, or I in it” (35). There is much to be said about this passage in its turn. The changes it rings take the stakes of this “idea” ever higher and make its
                  grounds increasingly shifty. Who’s judging what or whom? How much of this is really available for judgment and self-possession? Here active and passive modes, affirmation and
                  rejection, and the melodramatic, theatrical roles of a spurning subject and the spurned object are all repeatedly turned over and then put back into play. Remaking, affirming, or
                  rejecting <emph>the world</emph> altogether is interchangeably woven into and haltingly recombined with the imaginative syntax of creating and accepting <emph>the self</emph>. </p>
<p>Or not—one may reply; Here Cavell phrases an insight about the fundamental intersubjectivity of a shared world instead as a mutually isolated performance of self and world,
                  concretely affirming “neither the one nor the other.” The very possibility of self- and world-renewal by way of our skepticism is just what’s at stake in the question when it is
                  posed in this way, our reply to which may not be fully available, or may be available at the time only through affects that are flat or numb, or delayed indeterminately. If Cavell
                  acknowledges that judgment precedes and makes available the so-called fact(s) of the world, he thus might also be taken to suggest a self-directed culture of disengagement that one
                  might align with the Hegelian “beautiful soul.” The passage wants all the drama of decisiveness packed into equivocal phrasing, so as both to mark and to resist the predicament
                  analyzed in Hegel. Between <title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say?</title> and <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, one can see Cavell’s Romanticism shift from the convenient shorthand name for an epoch before modern alienation, to a set of attitudes and texts that must “prove” what it means for philosophical thinking
                  to depart from and reclaim the horizon of an existence only felt through literary conditions as subjective autobiography. The pulse of that experience is taken through measuring
                  intervals of departure (deadness, if not death) and re-enlivening confirmation. To offer that the world could have been different so that I could have wanted it, refines the terms
                  not so much of confirmation as of, again, an adolescent withholding. Voiced now by the Emersonian spiritual “sovereignty” of youth, instead of by politically sovereign old age, this
                  is the threat that Cavell calls “avoidance” in his pairing with “acknowledgment,” so crucial to his work beginning with the famous <title level="m">King Lear</title> essay collected in <title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say?</title> and then in <title level="m">Disowning Knowledge</title>. </p>
<p>The assertion begins with a stunningly negative given—that something is unacceptable “as it is”; by saying “the world,” Cavell enlarges this to no less than everything. And the
                  sentence deliberately hedges about whether the self or the world (first?) needs to be remade. An activism of world-making and, or as, a project for fashioning the self “works” at the
                  same time as the neutralizing renunciation one hears in Cavell’s menu of options. These propositional “terms” are really what in the same essay he thinks of as forms of life, signaled by the parenthetical “Terms as Conditions” in the title. If terms are declarative and factive in their ontological grammar, conditions are value-laden and modal (see <title level="m">Claim</title> 323):
                     <emph>That the world could be remade so that I could want it</emph>; <emph>that I might be different so as actually to be in the world</emph>; or that either of these merely
                     <emph>could have been true</emph>, or even just that we may feel ourselves positioned to <emph>say</emph> so.</p>
<p>The last phrasing suggests there is another level of opacity to deal with, one worth calling Cavell’s <emph>humanist</emph> version of the linguistic turn. Cavell’s persistent
                  measurement of our distance from even the language we routinely use (on, as he puts it, our words having turned away from us [<title>Little Did I Know</title> 523]) means that the drama of acknowledgment and avoidance
                  never takes place only as a first-order event, but also as a taking place and a testing of language. A section in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason </title>on moral thinking, for
                  instance, concludes by emphasizing the finitude of “where we stand” in questioning the use of our own and others’ language (<title level="m">Claim</title> 312). (He evokes the
                  seeming lack of response to the three books before <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> as a phatic “Hello” without reply in <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> [523].)
                  Though vexed conditions of praise have been Cavell’s predominant concern over the last decade,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An example that brings all these issues together is
                     Cavell’s essay on Fred Astaire’s dancing and the American historical performance of race; <title level="m">Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</title> 61-82. </note> rejection and
                  failure in some form could yet eventuate from the series of permutations from which I’ve excerpted. To revise a famous quip of Austin’s about the problems dogging the performative,
                  there is no end to the outrages that can happen to us in language—and through it, to the Wordsworthian-sounding collective “forms of life” that so preoccupied Wittgenstein. </p>
<p>Again I return to that page from “A Matter of Meaning It,” where the “modern” experience according to Cavell involves “reactions of disgust, embarrassment, impatience, partisanship,
                  excitement without release, silence without serenity” (<title level="m">Must We Mean?</title> 229): an Eliotic list of failed attachments and hollow consummation. With distressingly little struggle, these conditions are said to
                  be “just facts—facts of life, of art now. But it should also be said that they are grammatical facts: they tell us what kind of object a modern work of art is” (<title level="m">Must
                     We Mean</title>? 229).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Beckwith for more on Cavell’s approach to art and philosophical ethics as “grammar.” </note> Cavell’s
                  productive response to this litany suggests he finds its counterweight stimulating. Whatever else it may be, Romanticism as a condition means keeping imaginative possibility open,
                  despite (or, by negation, propelling itself away from) such allegedly “given” facts of modernity. In such a framework, any recourse to envisioning a world otherwise comes across as
                  appealing and even celebratory. Jonathan Culler has sharply identified the “bad writing” in the “good philosophy” of Cavell (<title level="m">The Literary in Theory</title> 211-21);
                  yet an oblique, resourceful courage to accept at least some features of adolescent response is not the least of Cavell’s gifts to the practice of Romantic studies. </p>
<p>A key sentence from Cavell’s new autobiography, <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title>, reproduces the effect Culler takes to task from the start of <title level="m">The Claim of
                     Reason</title>. “By the end of college I had come to realize that music was not my life,” Cavell soberly states, before moving on from the grammatically preconditioning <emph>that</emph> to
                  the experiential and educative <emph>how</emph>, by means of which he recalls the shape of his life in one seemingly endless autobiographical coil of a sentence: <quote>How that crisis eventually
                     produced the conviction that a life of study and writing growing out of philosophy was for me to discover, and how that was affected by being rejected for military service during
                     the Second World War because of an ear damaged when at age six I was struck by an automobile (a trauma inextricable from the trauma of leaving music), and how that rejection was
                     an essential element in my motivation to spend two weeks of the Freedom Summer in 1964 lecturing at Tougaloo College, a black school outside Jackson, Mississippi, and why I
                     changed my name in the months before I left for Berkeley, having just turned seventeen years old, and what it meant to me finally to leave teaching at Berkeley to teach at
                     Harvard, and to have encountered the work and presence of such figures as Ernest Bloch and J.L. Austin, and to have known deeply gifted friends, some renowned, and eminent
                     colleagues who modified my life, and to have worked over decades on doctoral dissertations with students of the most superb promise, some about to be, or who deserve to be,
                     famous, others still struggling to write as well as they think and as they imagine, and from the beginning of my professional life having lived with children whose inescapable, if
                     not always convenient, expectations of me were an essential protection of me against less loving expectations that might have destroyed my hopes, are registers of the rest of the
                     story. (<title level="m">Little</title> 4) </quote> The passage offers what one can only assume is a deliberate mimesis of life’s contingencies. Yet in his transition
                  from the “that” to the “how,” Cavell performs the very way in which an impersonal (Humean) causal contingency becomes a philosophical “grammar” of life in all its intersubjective
                  plenitude of interests—how the everlasting universe of things flows through a life, constituting Cavell’s unique life as it collides with or spins it on different paths through
                  post-war, Civil-Rights-Era America. </p>
<p>Yet there is no point in ignoring how the passage, too, assumes many risks typically run less convincingly by immature writing. The borderline maturity of the stance Cavell is
                  interested in becomes patent in context when he opens the paragraph from <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> about the Romantic: “But I think I know by now what the man
                  of fifty finds distasteful that made the boy of sixteen or seventeen ecstatic” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 35).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In “Typewriter Ribbon,” Derrida notices that sixteen marks the age
                     of the autobiographical act—a theft—for both Augustine and Rousseau (287). </note> Such adolescent impasse—the problematic of adapting to reality, reaching maturity, or
                  establishing the terms one might accede to as real, enough, or real enough— is a characterization to which Geoffrey Hartman gives room in his important essay on “Romanticism and
                  Anti-Self-Consciousness.” Romantic art, like Cavell’s style at its best, is a means to “resist the intelligence intelligently,” as Hartman says (47). The sense of such a project as
                  mature yet green further comes through in Cavell’s winning definition of “philosophy as the education of grown-ups” (<title level="m">Little</title> 9; also see <title level="m">Claim </title>125). </p>
<ab rend="center">*</ab>
<p>At a deliberate pace that could also have paused over passages on Blake and Keats in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> that are in one way or another definitional of Romanticism, together with the attempt to recuperate the role of adolescence in Cavell’s Romanticism, I’ve begun to provide textual coordinates for why retracing a British
                  trajectory through Cavell’s Romanticism proves an enterprise of value. Thus while it feels natural, when looking back, to assume the original literary concern of Stanley Cavell’s thought is
                  the pioneering American “Transcendentalists,” Thoreau and Emerson—of course this isn’t true. Moreover, it is not just different interests, but a specifically English sequence of
                  concerns that comes to matter, like the “other” before the “I” in psychoanalytic thought, before Cavell’s writings on the philosophical inheritance of “his” America. Cavell’s choice
                  of J.L. Austin as a philosophical “father” (and his choice of “ordinary language” philosophy as an approach) at the expense of the tradition of William James (and the pragmatism from
                  which Cavell often maintains a wary distance) is made palpable by the fact that Austin’s <title level="m">How to Do Things With Words</title> was first delivered as Harvard’s
                  William James Lecture for 1955.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Posnock, “Fathers and Sons.”</note> The early essays of <title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say?</title>
                  develop a tone and set of questions designed to connect readings of Shakespeare, J.L. Austin, and Beckett. After the formative engagement with Wittgenstein’s thought, British and
                  European Romantic “intellectual tragedies” undergird the structure of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, especially through Cavell’s discussions, in Part Four, of the master-slave dialectic, <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, and <title level="m">Faust</title>. Predating his seemingly “foundational” reading of Emerson—and, in the one essay
                  from which I have already cited, “Emerson, Coleridge, Kant (Terms as Conditions),” actually helping to give rise to it at a point when basic ideas still needed “follow[ing] out”
                     (<title level="m">Quest</title> 27)—Cavell’s engagement with Romanticism stands behind his career-long project of troubling philosophy with its suppressed “literary” occasions
                  and voices. British Romanticism, for its part, lies at the bottom of his simultaneously generous and nettlesome practice of taking up literary texts with a reflexively
                  “philosophical” seriousness—a fact to which Cavell’s large subset of exasperated readers continues to bear witness.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> is likely to contextualize a lot of things for this kind of frustrated reader, but not to relieve her suspicion that the voice begs a
                     patience that amounts to special consideration.</note>
</p>
<p>One senses that all the involvement concerning his prose over the years must relate to Cavell’s chronologically early, but quite personal, way of absorbing so many ideas about
                  linguistic address that a general reader would now call “poststructuralist.” Whereas Cavell himself once was happy enough to curtail his sense of Romanticism to the paradigms of
                  Abrams’s “natural supernaturalism” and Bloom’s quest myth, in addition to modes of critical attention practiced (in very different ways) by Hartman and Paul de Man,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Like many other people, I’ve learned a lot, I hope, from having read M.H. Abrams, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, and Harold Bloom on these topics. I’m not talking
                     about some of their recent work so much as the work in the sixties and the early seventies when they lived and died with Romanticism” (“Questions and Answers,” 230). </note> his
                  influence now is felt in the more theoretical realms of Romantic studies as an undoctrinaire practice of something like “late” or “ethical” deconstruction.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Cavell’s remarks in “Skepticism and a Word Concerning Deconstruction” set out certain limits for my assertion (see <title level="m">Quest</title> 130-36).</note> A
                  complex reckoning remains to be staged with Derrida, certainly on the level of Cavell’s prose style. Cavellian skepticism and deconstruction also have shared a similar historical and
                  conceptual trajectory as objects of popular misunderstanding. Readers have attributed to both a relativistic <emph>denial</emph> of knowledge, as if a celebration of the refusal, or
                  failure, of knowledge were these approaches very aim.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mikics unhelpfully links Derrida to potboiler skepticism throughout his recent intellectual
                     biography, which leads to fatuous sentences like his claim that, for the skeptic, “[t]he world begins to seem a realm of illusion, where we have tricked ourselves into supposing
                     that we are real” (2). For more subtle thought on the linked skeptical approaches (and common misreadings) of Cavell and deconstruction, see Kates 12, and more broadly, Ziarek.
                  </note> Meanwhile, Cavell’s careful engagement with the work of Shoshana Felman follows implicitly upon remarks others have made concerning the missing account of women theorists of
                  the so-called “Yale School.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Barbara Johnson, “Gender Theory and the Yale School.”</note> If the comparison to the practice of deconstruction in
                  Romantic studies proves apposite, one of the primary reflections one might take from Cavell’s writings in the long view would be their early and sustained commitment to questioning
                  the conditioning claims of ethical life. This context makes especially visible Cavell’s renunciation of the rhetorical violence that so often occurs both in the name of, and against,
                  claims of finitude whenever there is a turn to ethics.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Malabou offers one important such critique of poststructuralist violence: “anti-essentialist
                     violence and deconstructive violence work hand in hand to empty woman of herself, to disembowel her. In this sense, they match ordinary violence” (139).</note> His way of saying
                  this in “Texts of Recovery,” the essay most directly representative of an interest in British Romantic Poetry, in both its less forthcoming and most explicit aspects, is that “[w]e
                  moderns are likely to imagine that the giving up of the ground of revenge is the <emph>effect </emph>of therapy. I take the Intimations Ode to be saying on the contrary that this
                  forgoing is the <emph>cause</emph>, or say the condition, of change” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 75). For perspective on the distance that Wordsworth has traveled in this crucial area for Cavell, one can page forward through <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> and recall that the “next” chapter in the chronological literary and philosophical history
                  roughly traced in that book—“Being Odd, Getting Even,” on Poe—is not a deepening of this therapeutic cure from the impulse to revenge, but a regression to the thesis that “the idea
                  of thinking about individuality (or the loss of it) [comes] under the spell of revenge, of getting even for oddness” (<title level="m">Quest </title>106). Cavell’s Romantic
                  preoccupations and his confession to reckon by “certain” Romantic “costs” cannot then be absorbed into a progressive account of the psyche in literary history. </p>

</quote>
</epigraph>
<p>In the last half of this essay, I move on to discuss Cavell’s entanglement with Jacques Derrida and the relation of both to autobiographical modes of Romanticism. This comparison
                  goes hand-in-hand with the diversity of interests evident in Cavell’s recent work. Having already written books on cinematic ontology, the “remarriage” plot in golden-era Hollywood films, and
                  opera, in the last decade Cavell has written also on Jane Austen and—at least by invitation—on animals. <title level="m">Little Did I Know </title>might not only be fruitfully read 
                  as a sort of Victorian novel like <title level="m">David Copperfield</title>, but also compared to Derrida’s moving and almost as prolific turn to autobiographical writing from the 1980s
                  onward, up to his last interview, <title level="m">Learning to Live Finally</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Paola Marrati also draws the connection to Derrida, saying:
                     “Learning to live, not to die—which always takes care of itself—is the promise of philosophy” (961).</note> Derrida’s very willingness to give so many important interviews has the
                  effect of aerating his prose and raising the profile of embodied voice of his text, so that at times he parallels Cavell in a precise, yet diffusely lively, vocal inflection.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In terms that perhaps resonate unintentionally with Derrida’s approach to the subject in <title level="m">Otobiographies</title>, <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> at times reads not so much like an autobiography in all the definitiveness and prestige of that word, as like an <emph>autographed</emph> sequence of
                     journal entries or emails. </note> This is a surprising area of overlay, given the differences between these two thinkers’ willingness to “hear out” the voices of philosophy, as
                  Cavell reflects in his attempt to puzzle through the most notorious of Derrida’s interventions with speech act theory.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I reference debates around
                     literature and speech act theory associated with the publication event of <title level="m">Limited Inc</title>, but also the unparalleled, yet more sustaining and nuanced, and
                     more deliberative account of Rousseau, J.L. Austin, and Paul de Man in the long essay “Typewriter Ribbon: Limited Inc (2)(‘within such limits’).” In this text (written
                        <emph>after</emph> Cavell’s relevant replies to Derrida, but showing no sign of direct response to Cavell) Derrida attends to Austin more generously as a way above all of
                     honoring Paul de Man: “Among all the remarkable merits of de Man’s great reading [of the “textual event” of Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title> (see 315)] there is
                     first of all this reckoning with the works of Austin. I say purposely, and vaguely, the “works” of Austin because one value of these works is to have not only resisted but marked
                     the line of resistance to the systemic work, to philosophy as a formalizing theorization, absolute and closed, freed of its adherences to ordinary language and to so-called
                     natural languages” (325). Overall, though, I find Cavell’s response to Derrida on Austin quite acute, since Cavell in effect reads Derrida’s approach as still caught up <emph>in
                        structuralism</emph> (see <title level="m">Philosophy</title> 168). </note> In the books <title level="m">Philosophical Passages </title>and <title level="m">A Pitch of
                     Philosophy</title>, Cavell takes on the troubling question of “What Did Derrida Want of Austin?”—his own teacher.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A great deal of Michael
                     Fischer’s path-breaking book <title level="m">Stanley Cavell and Literary Skepticism</title> also meditates on the question of Cavell’s relation to Derrida and deconstructive
                     theory as the latter stood in the late 1980s. See Moi for further discussion of Cavell’s disheartening by Derrida, and for more on the larger friction (the near-miss of a
                     productive friction) between poststructuralism and ordinary language philosophy. Szafraniec (84-91) insightfully surveys the perceived disagreements and potentially shared ideas
                     of Cavell and Derrida. Coming as it does on the heels of his treatment of the performative in “Declarations of Independence,” Derrida’s handling of biography and autobiography in
                        <title level="m">The Ear of the Other</title> is also relevant to Cavell’s manner: “All will be listening to me with one or the other sort of ear (everything comes down to the
                     ear you are able to hear me with)” (4).</note> Lost in translation between cultures and academic tonalities, it becomes clear that Cavell thinks there has been a missed opportunity to
                  honor one school of serious philosophical play by means of the other; that even if he has had the encounter of reading Austin at some unspecified length, Derrida in a sufficiently
                  meaningful sense has not <emph>heard through </emph>the full implications of Austin’s voice, allowed himself to be reoriented by that voice’s deft crosscurrents and deep
                  soundings. Further, the missed dimension of response is not at all a centering of <emph>logos</emph> as metaphysical “presence” in voice but an inflection of thought by
                  the tensional body of performed language: an attitude, and, in short, a praxis of teaching. The reading I offer below elaborates a sense that such testing of the “force” of language
                  by more language is surely as much Derrida’s as it is Cavell’s and Austin’s project, surely not a metaphysical domain but a kind of bodily (and hence finite) strain of philosophy
                  moving both against and (at a certain late point) arching back toward the conditions of song. </p>
<p> This demand to test out philosophical meanings through the autobiographical body makes direct reference to Romantic philosophical writings per se difficult. For instance, in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, a brand of
                  rigid rational utopianism that makes “libels against the body” would seem to matter decisively against the perfectionist philosophical thought of William Godwin (471).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Vanessa Lemm’s characterization of Nietzsche’s perfectionist relation to the animal proves apt: “It is through
                     the return to and of their animality that human beings are led toward their humanity because it is the animal which withholds the secret of how to bring forth a relationship with
                     the past that disrupts and overturns the present in favor of future life to come. In this view, becoming overhuman depends on a return of and to animality as that force which
                     irrupts in humanity, exceeds it and tears it apart, so as to make room for its future (overhuman) becoming” (7). </note> In contrast to a Blakean celebration of embodiment that
                  Cavell on the same page calls a “brave acceptance of the sufficiency of human finitude,” few of the overtly philosophical productions of the British Romantic Era sustain a
                  commensurable depth of interest. Even Cavell’s proposed and unwritten “proper dissertation” on the “concept of human action” makes reference to a visibly British Romantic-Era topic
                  (Hazlitt had written his first book on such a principle) only to swerve powerfully away (<title level="m">Claim</title> xv). That project was jolted out of its course permanently
                  when Austin came to Harvard for a term in 1955. William Godwin comes across as a prim builder of systems, as opposed to the “ruggedness” and “zaniness” of Emerson and the film
                  characters Cavell explores (<title level="m">Conditions</title> 101). And where Godwin <emph>is </emph>zany, his fanaticism takes on further excesses of rationalism that amount to
                  the ultimate denial of finitude as its condition.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> With a similar emphasis on his occasional zany turns, Jenny Davidson offers a lively overview of
                     Godwin’s ideas on “perfectibility” in <title level="m">Breeding </title>(165-182). </note> At work in his perfectionist political philosophy one might suspect some kind of fantasy
                  of omnipotence, and Godwin’s later novels, including <title level="m">Fleetwood</title> and <title level="m">St Leon</title>, tend to confirm this. Wordsworth thus narrates his
                  rejection of Godwinism in <title level="m">The Prelude</title> as an abstractedly self-blinded and deaf space “Where passions had the privilege to work, / And never hear the sound of
                  their own names—” (1805 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, 10.812-813). In an appendix to the 1798 Third Edition of <title level="m">Political Justice</title>, Godwin presents a
                  teleology by which even the motions of the blood eventually submit to willful control. He audaciously holds that human “perfectibility” (<emph>not</emph> akin to Cavell’s perfectionism)
                  involves a movement from the domain of autonomous body systems into voluntary domains, leading individuals not only to regulate but to “despise the mere animal function” (Godwin
                  776).</p>
<p>Because of this gap in major British Romantic philosophical achievement as such, the challenge becomes that of properly assessing the philosophical work of knowing born out
                  distinctively by Romantic poetry and poetics. In contrast to what Cavell (surely correctly) admires in the resolutely immanent model of Blake’s vision of spirituality, none of the
                  overtly philosophical productions of the British Romantic Era bear up to his admiration of Emerson for the ability to jolt and chagrin the official discourse, to rouse philosophical
                  thinking by means of the very force of a motile linguistic responsiveness it disowns. The impetus of Cavell’s engagement with Emerson has everything to do with the latter's of
                  philosophical meaning through modes of thinking decertified by the official discipline (or, alternately, marked in hindsight as central but cripplingly “genteel”). Yet the challenge
                  in reading the Romantic poets through Cavell appears to be something like the reverse of his recovery of Emerson. Their assured “canonical” standing makes it difficult to trouble,
                  and thereby renew, the living stakes of the poetry. In order to re-open that poetry as a field of both dubiety and potential, one would have to renounce so much canonical learning
                  about literature. Learning is so much easier simply to use as a foil by mastering so as to revise in scholarly output. In order to develop a material phenomenology of
                  Romantic poetry and poetic thought, Cavell would have us shrug off institutional memory as much as that project is ever possible, <emph>not </emph>accrue another level of
                  sophistication in an ideologically overburdened hermeneutics of suspicion. </p>
<p>Cavell’s Romanticism is a process of departure and return to the ordinary. And insofar as <emph>Romanticism</emph> acts as a name for the draining and restoring of a charged distance to
                  language—language thereby still capable to inspire, jolt, and discomfit actual readers— its relation to critical activity becomes a project for renewal at any moment. I’d like to
                  turn Godwin’s philosophical failure to accept not just the body, but also the human animal, to account, by juxtaposing recent Cavell with late Derrida in terms of their parallel
                  reflections on animality. One might call this relation to autobiography, as Cavell seems to do at a key juncture on Austin in <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title>, the
                  “movement” of an animal-like mobility found even in spending a life deskbound in reading, writing, and teaching (364). A kind of thinking that won’t sit still for fixed concepts
                  suggests the animal-like habits of a daily or seasonal range, a migratory or hunting track, a tracing of the patterns of tagged experimental subjects, and perhaps finally a sedentary
                  local haunt.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Compare Derrida, <title level="m">The Beast and the Sovereign</title>, Vol. II, 240-41.</note> In this way, Cavell “trails” everywhere
                  the animal as a feature of autobiographical voice. Most broadly, the growing contemporary study of the “Literary Animal” might offer a place to stage Cavell’s and Derrida’s work
                  under a possibility of fuller mutual recognition— but fuller under the conditions of meeting through estrangement.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> With respect to the project of
                     reading Cavell athwart Derrida, that strangeness will only be further dramatized by thinking about the gender difference characteristically born by constructions of Man vs.

                  motive (and this much was shared by Austin) is to put the human animal back into language and therewith back into philosophy,” Cavell writes in the belly of the <title level="m">Claim of Reason</title> (207).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The observation continues, just as importantly but in a different key: “But he [Wittgenstein, where his thought
                     “is shared by Austin”] never, I think, underestimated the power of the motive to reject the human: nothing could be more human.” </note> Whereas Cavell’s chapter, “Companionable

                  humanist stance over and against the animal—for instance, one of Cavell’s main concerns there is to confront himself as a willing subject who eats meat—he nonetheless sustains the
                  important discussion throughout that book of the state of “exposure,” the violability, or uncanny ontological openness, that can at times be a non-domineering measure of animal
                  otherness. The theme of “exposure” also dates back to <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (432). This is as close as Cavell allows himself to come to Derrida’s
                  universalizing claim, <emph>il faut bien manger</emph>. For Derrida, of course, against the humanist idea of Man this category of the Animal triggers a repeat of the move he makes
                  against Austin, to insist on the other as “internal” and constitutive yet never itself forming a new center; hence the reliance on outrageous puns like <emph>animots</emph> and
                     <emph>je suis</emph> not as “I am” but as “I follow” the animal in <title level="m">The Animal That Therefore I Am</title> (2008). The animal encounter Derrida finds internal to
                  the <emph>cogito</emph> retraces an admission from his interview “This Strange Institution Called Literature,” in which he admits that even literature, as “the most interesting thing in the
                  world,” carries the minimal precondition of a safe dwelling and place to sleep: <quote>I’m well aware that this involves an immense forbidden desire, an irrepressible need—but one
                     forbidden, inhibited, repressed—to tell stories, to hear stories told, to invent (language and in language), but one which would refuse to show itself so long as it has not
                     cleared a space or organized a dwelling-place suited to the animal which is still curled up in its hole half asleep. (40)</quote> To
                  realize the impulse toward literature requires a different version of a room with a door; its precondition is a sort of den, which environs a figure “curled up in its hole half
                     asleep.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Compare Derrida’s hedgehog (<emph>hérisson</emph>) as the specifically <emph>poetic</emph> (not just literary) animal in “Che cos’è la
                     poesia?”: “the <emph>hérisson</emph>. It blinds itself. Rolled up in a ball, prickly with spines, vulnerable and dangerous, calculating and ill-adapted (because it makes itself
                     into a ball, sensing the danger of the autoroute, it exposes itself to an accident). No poem without accident, no poem that does not open itself like a wound, but no poem that is
                     not also just as wounding” (233). </note> Oddly and compellingly, the predicate “half asleep” characterizes at once the necessitous animal and the creature “half”-freed to dream.
                  The exposed condition of bare-life or animal existence before, or external to, the discretionary time afforded by culture is also figured here as another kind of den, or retreat, for
                  non-appearances to hide in: “one which would refuse to show itself so long as it has not cleared a space or organized a dwelling-place.” The precondition of literary appearances is
                  the “clear[ing]” of a site for the secret, an “organized” refuge of non-appearing. That ontological cover shelters the creature as much <emph>from</emph> the clearing of Being as cozily within its
                  frame. But the unclothed, unhoused animal is paradoxically even more secret—it would refuse to show itself at all. At once exposed (abandoning anything like a defensive position
                     <emph>or</emph> productive, functional rationale) and sheltered nevertheless (tucked away in a space of retreat), the “irrepressible need” Derrida articulates occurs by way of a
                  skin-like or hair-like simile of what also “suits” the animal. The criterion of what’s proper (<emph>propre</emph>) to the animal (a gathering of what is “suited to the animal”)
                  stands in place of a broader theory of figuration as the basis of literary associations. The very conditions of literature in the account from which Derrida speaks—passivity toward
                  action and non-appearance toward Being—mean that literature can only manifest itself or peek its head out of the den (like a burrowing, perhaps hibernating, mammal, “show
                     itself”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title level="m">The Price of Truth</title>, Marcel Hénaff reminds us that philosophical truth, <emph>aletheia</emph>, is “the
                     unveiling of the hidden,” the movement out (<emph>a-</emph>) of the hidden (<emph>letheia</emph>)” (6). Derrida’s certain awareness of this etymology deepens the play between
                     literature and philosophy in “This Strange Institution Called Literature.”</note>) <emph>when </emph>it can safely curl up in half sleep.</p>
<p>Somatic rather than symbolic—never amounting to a coded dreamwork whose key we are asked to insert—this is a logic of sleep to unsettle the binaries of public and private, active and
                  passive, literary activity and survival. One might follow these thoughts through Derrida’s striking commentary on nakedness, animals, and the Fall narratives that attend virtually
                  every aspect of Western metaphysics and religious tradition. Instead, however, I want to bring the discussion around to another feature of the mobile landscape that conjoins
                  animality and autobiography and offer a short Romantic poem as a paradigm for further reflection in those areas where Derrida intersects with Cavell. At the end of another dense
                  section of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, Cavell offers a definition of what he means by skepticism—even “the moral of skepticism”—as the idea that “the human
                  creature’s basis in the world as a whole, its relation to the world as such, is not that of knowing, anyway not what we think of as knowing” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 241).
                  This embrace of “nescience” (Bennett 27) opens to the question of animal life, whose otherness the “pantheistic” Romantics particularly invoke and acknowledge. Romantic “pantheism”
                  troubles the status of reflection as the basis of knowledge, while reconfiguring the minimal conditions of knowing in experiences of pleasure.</p>

<title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> 76</ab>
</quote> In this lyric, what Andrew Bennett calls the “gnoseological status of poetry” (25) intertwines with the
                  poet’s curiosity about the availability and grounds of a new epistemological attitude about pleasure: a linking of the “human soul” to nature’s “fair works” at once enables
                  associative thinking and sets off the melancholy background of the project of human thought (ll. 5-7). The poem seems to shift the enabling premises of knowledge, and to offer a
                  poetic method of receptive testing for just where the knowable world takes its preconditions and finds its limits. Hence the lyric, in its way, follows Kant in the genre of critique.
                  But it also renders a kind of performative answer to how experience nevertheless continues, opaquely, beyond regulative critical limitations placed upon the epistemological endeavor
                  as such. The consonance of mourning with moaning—which Robert Burns had heard in the poem from the 1780s which undeniably lies behind this one, “Man was made to Mourn”—in “Lines
                  written in early spring” becomes a pleasurable, complexly purposive texture of rhyming associations (Crawford 193). Well-rehearsed by now (<title level="m">Claim</title> 329-32) is Cavell’s “new” philosophical drama of
                  acknowledgment and avoidance as an alternative to those “old” criteria of epistemological validation and certainty. Might Wordsworth’s criterion for testing his knowledge be located
                  in his own reconfiguration of both cognitive and non-cognitive measure with pleasure? Despite the “dismay” voiced at man-made suffering later in the “Lines” (Stafford 103), the poem
                  suggests that pleasure nevertheless enables and conditions the very experience of place, of having a “there...there” (“Lines Written in Early Spring” l.20). A regulative but open commitment to the purposive experience of
                  pleasure allies Wordsworth to the indeterminate, Kantian concept of natural beauty. In this spirit, Simon Jarvis’s keen emphasis on something Wordsworth captures as the “sentiment of
                  being”—not the egotistical sublime—in lines from <title level="m">The Pedlar</title> (“I felt the sentiment of being spread / O’er all that moves, and all that seemeth still” [qtd. in Jarvis, <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Philosophic Song</title> 29]) does
                  honor to the ear of Cavell, and could be mistaken for an instance of Cavell’s own language. “What else can this mean,” writes Jarvis in a sentence that feels somehow already there in
                     <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, “but that before this feeling a sentiment of nothing was spread over all that moves and all that seemeth still: that nothing,
                  precisely, which goes under the name of ‘being,’ whenever being is understood as no more than the bare predicative cement in a proposition?” (<title level="m">Wordsworth’s</title> 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> If the “Romanticism” of Cavell’s relation to Kant leads him to say “Thanks for nothing” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 31, 53), Derrida brings fully to mind the peculiarity of how free play cannot have a stake in the existence of the object in the <title level="m">Third
                        Critique</title>: “What is it to exist, for Kant?” (<title level="m">The Truth in Painting</title> 49). </note> Thus we find the same configuration of birdsong, philosophical
                  “measure,” and everyday origination (the spring, the dawn) in Cavell on Thoreau’s sense of “philosophical wonder”: “Thoreau was interested that dawn does not, or should not, wake us
                  just as it wakes birds; that what is early and what is late, what is appropriate for night and what for day, origins and ends, are for us to measure; that, perhaps one could say, the
                  natural history of the human essentially contains the unnatural, contests itself” (<title level="m">Emerson’s</title> 8)</p>
<p>Even as one of most tenderly green effusions of the “vernal poet” (As Shelley dubbed Wordsworth) in <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, “Lines Written in Early Spring” models remarkable technique for living out skepticism. The poem’s key methodological terms—thinking, reason, and pleasure, elaborate themselves as if in response via the most
                  simple of cognitive prompts. Nature’s apparent givenness is always putting to us the question, What do you make of it? Famously, at the end, “Lines” points back with added
                  bewilderment to the destruction of fraternity (“What man has made of man” [“Lines” l.24]). But because of the lines’ tenacious resistance to understanding the non-human environment in terms
                     <emph>only</emph> of knowledge, the end of the poem offers a striking and de-constructive vantage on modern technicity. Its subject is the historical production of Man alike with
                  the processing of the animal and vegetal worlds. Like those whom Stanley Cavell deems “creative philosophers,” Wordsworth in this poem and many other comparable ones then has “two
                  tasks: to oppose skepticism and to oppose false answers to skepticism” (Cavell, “Questions” 227). The failure of all conceptual attempts to “measure” another being’s
                  “thoughts”—much less the significance of a bird’s or a twig’s movements—nonetheless is at the same moment met by a “pleasure” repeating its force of a conceptually weakened
                  personification. Surpluses of feeling nearly built into the pseudo-cognitive structure of the “measured” verse ballad lightly and non-insistently countermand a supposedly unfilled Newtonian
                  space or Cartesian coordinate grid as the paradigms of measurement.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Dimock; also Jarvis, “Thinking in Verse.”</note> The warm movement of an
                  embodied thinking in verse—already so like a feeling of “joy in widest commonalty spread” (<title level="m">Home at Grasmere</title> l. 968) in Wordsworth, as opposed, say, to Byron or Keats where but to think is to be full of
                  sorrow and near to freezing—replaces the thoughts of a subject bearing a determinate relation of form to content. </p>
<p>Though such “measure” is present in the movement and body of the verse, it is, however, the <emph>un</emph>availability of the lines’ “measure” as a cognitive matter of which we cannot lose sight here.
                  Reflecting on her favorite philosophical figure of Socrates, Hannah Arendt intriguingly picks up on Solon’s definition of concepts as “non-appearing measure” in her posthumous <title level="m">The Life of the Mind</title> (I, 170). Using this formulation, I want to end by touching on yet another major set of coordinates in Cavell’s “Romantic” career: the
                  interrelation of music, philosophy, and literature—and specifically, measured verse.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Composers of verse, and scholars of prosody, are sometimes
                     called “metricians.” <title level="m">A Pitch of Philosophy</title> offers extended reflections on what Cavell, in economic language, calls “the lease of the voice” and the “pawn
                     of the voice.” Cavell’s early training and performing life as a musician retain their formative influence. He situates the new preface to the paperback (1998) edition of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> in terms of a repertoire of musical familiarity one might compare to the phenomenological experience of verse: “It is familiar to
                     musicians, indeed to those concerned with the fate of the arts broadly, that a piece once thought to be awkward becomes quite manageable with time, sometimes too manageable” (xi).
                     See Potkay’s chapter, “Audition and Attachment,” in <title level="m">Wordsworth’s Ethics</title>, for one account of a musical and anti-iconic relation to Romantic poetry
                     (24).</note> As it reaches back to pre-Socratic Greek paideia, the educative role of the musical poem exceeds any idea of “didactic” verse in the transmission of knowledge. Yet in
                  the unattributed Platonic dialogue <title level="m">Ion</title>, Socrates carries the day largely by converting the rhapsode’s bodily performance of sung speech into the contrasting
                  assumption that knowledge instead must require a thematic and content-driven reference; that is, it must be representational knowledge <emph>about </emph>the subject matter adduced
                  by the poem. In the case of Homer, that might be medicine, horsemanship, war strategy. This signal move in the history of the philosophy of art is so important, though enforced in an
                  argumentative dialogue, it is in all essential ways left unargued as a precondition; it marks a pre-conceptual shift between two incompatible regimes of truth. The rhapsode performs with a lyre, the inspired instrument of Apollo, in depictions before this intervention, and thereafter bears a staff, the sign of the discursive office of Hermes. A culture of performance of ecstatic,
                  mythically “efficacious,” sung speech becomes a culture of prestigious, legitimate, “dialogically” reasoning philosophy.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Détienne.</note>
</p>
<p> Writing much later in the day of Western artistic culture, Cavell is focused on the inverse process by which a highly professionalized philosophy held at the risk of depletion may
                  learn its prompt and gain its voice back from literature. “But can philosophy become literature and still know itself?,” he asks famously in the final sentence of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (496). What had become philosophy’s disarming of literary knowledge in <title level="m">Ion</title>, its stripping away of any knowing <title level="m">about</title> the world absorbed with poetic resonance, now reverses direction and returns to philosophy—but only as a choice bearing the difficult challenge to accept a
                  revived knowledge back from literature’s hands. Philosophy’s fear of not consciously knowing itself remains present in Cavell’s suggestive way of aligning the condition of literature
                  with the unself-conscious and unexamined, with animal life.</p>
<p>In the Preface to <title level="m">Poems, 1815</title>, Wordsworth discusses without nostalgia the relation of the modern lyric as a genre or sub-genre to the classical idea of
                  musical accompaniment. Consonant with Cavell’s post-musical commitment to a “pitch” of the philosophical voice, Wordsworth's belief is that, though poets “have been in the practice of
                  feigning that their works were composed to the music of the harp or lyre,” the modern lyric’s musicality “require[s] nothing more than an animated or impassioned recitation, adapted
                  to the subject” <title level="m">Prose</title> 375-76). Wordsworth as a poet is able to affirm both that the loss of
                  music to his art’s formal-historical materiality is not really a loss, and that it is the modern poet’s affectation to retain a <emph>non</emph>-cognitive musical prestige that
                  amounts to a craft of “feigning.” It is a deft reversal of Plato, insofar as Wordsworth claims music, not conceptual knowledge, proves an object of envy. The move keeps its force as
                  a turning of tables on philosophy even if that is not how Wordsworth himself claims to feel. By comparison, Cavell’s transition from the life of a jazz musician and Julliard piano
                  student to that of a professional philosopher actually seems more plangent in tone than Wordsworth’s poetic theory. The idea behind the gathering of essays in <title level="m">Emerson’s Transcendental Etudes</title> (2003) is Cavell’s “desire to think of Emerson’s essays as transcendental musically as well as philosophically,” just as wonderful and
                  “alarming[ly] difficult” as the pages of a score by Liszt (<title level="m">Emerson's</title> 1-2).</p>
<p>I am tempted to frame a response to the status of what Jarvis in a series of recent essays<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Simon Jarvis's  “Prosody as Cognition” in <title level="j">Critical Quarterly</title>.</note> has called “verse melodics” in Romantic and modern poetry, by stealing the terms of
                  Cavell’s own brilliant reading of the ordinary sun in Wordsworth’s “Intimations” Ode. Like a modern poet who realizes it is impossible “ever” to be a bard or ever to be one “again,”
                  Cavell begins the account of himself in <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> under the sign of a loss of musicianship (“By the end of college I had come to realize that music
                  was not my life”; “the trauma of leaving music” [4]), imagining, as an entryway to his writing life, what it means to practice conceptual thinking as a form of “renunciation”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For Cavell’s musical training as a “reader” and the musical structure of his autobiographical reflection in <title level="m">Little Did I
                     Know</title>, see Richardson. This metaphysical autobiography of loss does not apply to music alone among arts for Cavell. He writes in the Preface to <title level="m">The World
                        Viewed</title>: “ A book thus philosophically motivated ought to account philosophically for the motive in writing it. What broke my natural relation to movies? What was that
                     relation, that its loss seemed to demand repairing, or commemorating, by taking thought?” (ix).</note> (330). Following two waves of response to loss that merge together without ever quite
                  harmonizing in Romanticism, we might then say about the status of both thinking in verse and the bodily performance of music in verse what Cavell says about the loss of
                  insupportable poetic feeling in the Ode: “But ‘fades into’ does not <emph>say</emph> ‘fades out’” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 75).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Fades into”
                     also suggests an openwork aesthetics of pleasure, as opposed to a principle of formal enclosure. Even though, as Kant writes in the Introduction to the <title level="m">Critique
                        of Judgment</title>, “we do not and cannot find in ourselves the slightest effect upon the feeling of pleasure” in the understanding, the discovery of purposive experience “is
                     the ground of a very marked pleasure, often even of an admiration, which does not cease.” Though “[w]e no longer find” it, Kant argues, “this pleasure has certainly been present
                     at one time, and it is only because the commonest experience would be impossible without it that it is gradually confounded with mere cognition and no longer arrests particular
                     attention” (§ VI). </note>
</p>
<p>The blend of restive and valedictory tones here isn’t quite right to end on, though, because it is actually <emph>not</emph> a lamentable fact for Cavell’s way of doing
                  philosophy—or, by extension, for the reigning media of what he calls “modernity”—that “music, such music, <emph>must</emph> be written” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 5). In this
                  area too he comes out nearer to Derrida in the end than one may have judged thinkable. Like the happy couple in an Austen novel or an embattled pair in one of the Hollywood
                  re-marriage comedies that Cavell also has taught us to read, in the last act the principles swap outlooks with giddy relentlessness, spontaneously expressing the other’s
                  long-rehearsed arguments on writing vis-à-vis the human voice, laying it on exuberantly against his “own.” How else, four decades after “Plato’s Pharmacy,” could Derrida
                  write/talk about the Muse, music, and song so as to aspire to a myth of the voice?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Derrida had written in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>
                     that “[s]ong is at the orient of music but it does not reduce itself to voice any more than voice reduces itself to noise” (196). </note> Going back to the <title level="m">Phaedrus</title>, Derrida reminds us in <title level="m">The Animal that Therefore I Am</title> of the Platonic irony, which Socrates condemns for not being present to
                  speak for itself; to teach students properly is to respond live to their questions (<title level="m">Animal</title> 52). But “the <title level="m">Phaedrus</title> is also a sort of
                  animal dialogue,” Derrida continues, one based on 
                  <quote>the myth of the cicadas, who used to be men and were so intent on singing that they were capable of dying, having forgotten to eat
                  and drink. When they came to report to Calliope and Urania, the cicadas remarked on the philosophers who spend their time doing honor to the music appropriate to those two Muses. ‘I
                  philosophize’ can mean that as a man I am a cicada, I recall what I am, a cicada who remembers having been a man. To remind myself of myself is to recall myself to singing and music.
                     (<title level="m">Animal</title> 53)</quote>
</p>
<p>In this dizzying perspectivist turn that passes so unthinkingly through the cicadas’ adolescent-type molting unto death, the “measure” of knowledge is no longer coherently
                  identifiable as Man, autonomous or otherwise. In Plato’s dialogue, the cicadas are both a kind of chorus “carrying on” with their nonhuman “conversations [. . .] above [the] heads” of
                  Socrates and Phaedrus’ talk (259b); and they are also those “human beings who lived before the Muses [. . .] so overwhelmed with the pleasure of singing” that they forgot food and drink and
                  wasted away (259c). “After they die,” says Socrates, “they go to the Muses and tell each one of them which mortals have honored her” (259d). The singers die and come to know the
                  passage of death through the ground, then metamorphose into the cicada chorus whose cyclical existence derives from earth. And while doubtless this makes for a strange picture in
                  which to recognize Cavell the unwavering humanist<note place="foot" resp="editors"> An example of both Cavell’s reception of and distance from the animal occurs in the essay
                     “Thinking of Emerson,” which he appended to the later expanded edition of <title level="m">The Sense of Walden</title>: “(Perhaps it helps if you think, as [Emerson] goes on to
                     say, that what carries us through this world is a divine animal. To spell it out, the human is the rational divine animal. It’s a thought—one, by the way, which Heidegger would
                     deny)” (“Thinking” 137).</note>—to see not even the animal but an insect stare out from his “picture of the mind” (“Tintern Abbey” l. 62)—the story comes back to Urania as the Muse of discourse, to whom
                  the cicadas “report those who honor their special kind of music by leading a philosophical life” (259d). The <title level="m">Phaedrus</title> parable also keenly marks what Derrida
                  has called “autoimmunity,” the exposure that both makes possible and infects—and here in a truly suicidal way—any system of autobiographical telling. </p>
<p>The myth about what these self-forgetting cicadas are singing, finally, presents a kind of analogy to the more “ordinary” but nonetheless staggering Wordsworthian mystery of what
                  inanimate or pre-animate objects might be able to bespeak for humanity. How are we to go about “communicating with objects,” the project Wordsworth intends in his Preface (qtd. in
                     <title level="m">Quest </title>71)? <title level="m">Phaedrus</title>’ cicadas bring to mind how Cavell’s own “Immortality” Ode—the renunciation that we are told launches his
                  vocation as a writer— will not have been written in verse about the memory of our birth “trailing” clouds of transcendence. (Anyway, does that mean we are lingering back? Or born on
                  with the “glory” streaming behind?) Rather, Cavell imparts his series of interests through a modeling of prose that is a constant witness to a maturity whose condition is not
                  entirely <emph>to lack</emph>, but to sustain intimacy by accepting a condition of <emph>going on without</emph>, to continue to be discomposed by, youth’s music. “‘[H]aving been a
                  child’ is a condition that none of us—no matter how different our happy or unhappy stories may be—can ever overcome, grow out of” (Marrati 957). Cavell’s topic is the “recall,” his reclaiming, via Romantic poetry as well as through so much else, of what it means to be responsive to the human animal by other
                  standards besides a rehearsal of self-possession in our measures of knowledge. </p>

<head>“A Modest Creed”: Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell</head>
<byline>

</byline>
<p>	A neglected book by D. G. James, <title level="m">Scepticism and Poetry</title> (1937), works out a systematic argument in keeping with T. E. Hulme’s pronouncement that Romanticism is spilt religion. James argues, thinking mainly of Wordsworth, that the Romantic imagination is a secular negation of religion—in other words, that the visionary life of poetry fundamentally opposes the tenets of received religion. Yet further, the Romantic imagination as James views it arises from a necessary basis in skepticism, not just from the antinomian heresies (emphasized by T. S. Eliot) that moved Harold Bloom to call Romanticism “protestant” in the Introduction to the second edition of <title level="m">The Visionary Company</title> (Bloom xvii-xxi). The argument goes that when you invent gods or even interpret them, you don’t believe in one, just as when you invent objects, worlds, and other minds or recognize that you need to construct such things through interpretation, you’re uncertain about their existence, or their exact nature in and of themselves. James does not address what Stanley Cavell calls “object skepticism and other minds skepticism” (or “skepticism and solipsism” [<title level="m">Quest</title> 55]), and Cavell for the most part does not emphasize religious skepticism. It still seems to me, however, that if we transvalue James’s critique of the Romantic imagination into something like simple description, we point directly forward to Cavell’s concerns and back to Shelley’s—including, incidentally, his announced “necessity of atheism.”	</p>
<p>Cavell, similarly, sees skepticism as a necessary point of departure whenever he confronts the wholly secular dispute between the two traditions of philosophy he works with, and between which he hopes in some respects to mediate. From among many possible moments of this sort I single out the anecdote in his recent autobiography, <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title>, about a sneering positivist teaching assistant he encountered when he was at UCLA:
         <quote>As I approached the group the teaching assistant was saying [to Hans Meyerhoff]: “We know now that every assertion is either true or false or else neither true nor false; in the former case the assertion is meaningful, in the latter case cognitively meaningless. If you go on saying to me that this line of Rilke’s is cognitively meaningful, I smile at you.” (<title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> 252-53)</quote>
         Cavell says Meyerhoff, in an unguarded moment, was then drawn into a dispute on the positivist’s turf—that is, within the roped-off echo chamber of the verifiable and the falsifiable that has caused so many philosophers and nearly all scientists to turn a deaf ear to poetry. But Cavell, in questioning the true and false as a sufficient condition for knowledge (“certainty is not enough,” he says in the early <title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say?</title> [258]), clearly saw this moment as a spot of time, his morning of election: “To discover a different mode of response to such an assault,” he writes, “became as if on the spot an essential part of my investment in what I would call philosophy” (<title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> 253). </p>
<p>	We can see how Shelley puts this dispute, clearly a version of what Socrates called the ancient quarrel between the poets and the philosophers, in the facetiously complex opening genealogy of the witch in <title level="m">The Witch of Atlas</title>:

</l>
</lg>
</quote>
        
        Error and Truth are interdependent concepts rendered foundationless by change and time; yet change and time themselves beget error and truth because flux makes fixity seem desirable. And then, once they are empowered as permanent dictators of thought, error and truth leave poetry nothing to say. Up to a point, this is the argument of the<title level="m"> Defence of Poetry</title> writ small: far from being even the verifiable and the falsifiable, error and truth are merely the hardening of the arteries of metaphor into the large codes of fraud and woe that govern human thought. Here is where skepticism plays its role. As Stuart Curran says, “the point of skepticism is to free one from those external forms that settle questions by tyrannizing the mind” (Curran 205<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">Ulmer for his part (11) wants to trace this point back to Pulos, <title level="m">The Deep Truth</title>
</note>). Poetry is not superseded once and for all by science and political economy, as the proto-positivist Peacock had argued in the pamphlet that provoked Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title>, <title level="m">The Four Ages of Poetry</title>. To the contrary, poetry is, through change and time, not only the origin but the perpetual renewal and reinvigoration of science. As Emerson says in “Fate” (echoing Shelley and quoted by Cavell), “We are lawgivers” (qtd. in <title level="m">Quest</title> 40). </p>
<p>Or rather, as Shelley concludes in <emph>The Witch of Atlas</emph>, poetry <title level="m">would</title> have continued to breathe the life of metaphor back into the death-in-life of equationality if it hadn’t sequestered itself, like Shelley’s witch, from all things mortal. If this had not happened, in other words, poetry would have made possible the paradigm shifts altering Thomas Kuhn’s “normal science.” It is to be feared, Shelley says in the proleptic stanza I have quoted, that the Malthusian triumph of enlightenment (or triumph of light) is so complete that error and truth have swept the field and left nothing for “learned rhyme” to revitalize. From the couplings of equationality—from all those sterile a = b’s—nothing can be <emph>born</emph>. Malthus’s proposed birth control is realized as the very essence of normal science itself, in contrast with the Shelleyan metaphor proclaiming that <emph>love</emph> is metaphor because both love and metaphor involve endlessly renewed perceptions of similitude in dissimilitude, always in studied opposition to political economy (Cf. Pulos, “Shelley and Malthus,” esp. 115.)  In <title level="m">Defence of Poetry </title>the great secret of morals is love  (517; cf. Fry, “Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title> in Our Time”; Hogle, “Shelley’s Poetics” 188; Keach 1-41). Cavell would sometimes call the great secret of morals love as well, and sometimes “acknowledgment.” </p>
<p>The trouble is, though, that in <title level="m">The Witch of Atlas</title> there is no amorous procreativity, as the witch and her hermaphrodite are scarcely in a position to give birth to anything. By 1820, Shelley’s thinking about poetry as a happy consequence of that skepticism that subverts error and truth is beginning to be less confident than Cavell’s. Cavell warns, in the Introduction to <title level="m">Disowning Knowledge</title>, against “the application of some philosophically independent problematic of skepticism” to the very literature that discloses the problematic (1). I hope not to violate this warning, but for a clearer sense of what might best be called a mutual reading of Shelley and Cavell, I shall find it necessary to go back a year or two in Shelley’s work, and of course to explore Cavell’s understanding of Romanticism as well. But I shall come back to Shelley’s latest works in the end.<note xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" resp="editors" n="3"> Skepticism is often considered the key concept to have emerged in postwar Shelley criticism, the arguing point that rescued him from his dismissal—by Arnold following through to Leavis and beyond—as an ineffectual and muddle-headed idealist. One increasingly hears (skeptical) impatience with the acceptance of skepticism in Shelley as a given, but it has not yet been dislodged. The pioneering work was that of Pulos, <title level="m">The Deep Truth</title>. Since then the most sustained research aimed at pinning down the exact nature of Shelley’s skepticism has been that of Rubin, Reiman (see <title level="m">Intervals of Inspiration</title>, ch. 5), and Hoagwood. I am encouraged by Hoagwood’s well-informed contention that Shelley’s skepticism is dialectical and—to some extent in disagreement with Pulos—epistemological rather than ontological. As Hoagwood puts it, cuttingly but I think fairly, “the influential accounts of Shelley’s skepticism were written when literary critics were still being told that Berkeley and Hume engaged in dogmatic denials” (Hoagwood 20). Skepticism can also function as the hesitation in judgment that inhibits moral and political agency. See, e. g., Jewett 135-64.</note>
</p>
<p>In <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, Cavell’s interest in British Romanticism is confined chiefly to Wordsworth and Coleridge, but it is helpful to begin with his one mention of Shelley, introduced in contrast with the other two: 
         <quote>Romanticism’s work [. . .] interprets itself [. . .] as the task of bringing the world back, as to life. This may, in turn, present itself as the quest for a return to the ordinary, or of it, a new creation of our habitat; or as the quest, away from that, for the creation of a new habitation: Wordsworth and Coleridge would represent the former alternative; Blake and Shelley, I believe, the latter. (<title level="m">Quest</title> 52-53)</quote>
         This passage explains Cavell’s confinement of his argument to Wordsworth and Coleridge. Such is Cavell’s primary interest throughout his career—inclusive of the film and Shakespeare criticism—in the recovery of the quotidian; but it nonetheless identifies clearly the moment of crisis turned to advantage from which Shelley’s poetry arises. </p>
<p>Our hope to inhabit another world can only derive from our uncertainty about whether or how we inhabit this one. “The Sensitive-Plant,” for example, describes the death and putrefaction of this world, a garden, which follows upon the sudden death of the Lady who has tended it—one of Shelley’s many figures for inspiration, or Intellectual Beauty. Within the body of the poem no apparent reversal of this decay seems possible: If winter’s here no spring can be expected. But then in his so-called “Conclusion” (and the first-time reader may feel surprised that such a conclusive poem would need a surplus conclusion), in the same facetious and self-effacing tone that comes and goes in <title level="m">The Witch of Atlas</title>, Shelley announces an article of faith. He does not know what became of the Sensitive-Plant or the Lady, he says, but still,</p>

</lg>
</quote>
<p>It is the obverse of this speculation that provides its logic. If we were certain about what life is, if we placed all our confidence in some semblance of the real as truth, then our thinking would be <emph>conditioned</emph> by certainty, by the dogmatic finality of error and truth. In that case, accordingly, we would be certain that death is, as it certainly seems to be, the opposite or absence of life. There would be no scope or opening for conjecture, hopeful or otherwise. But suppose life could be conceived as dead or insubstantial, as Shelley says here and as Cavell says it is in the moment of Romantic skepticism. It could follow then that death, which certainly does seem at least different from life, if not opposite, may be the alternative habitation Cavell or Shelley seeks, where the plant and the Lady realize an existence that in life was only conjectural.<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4"> For a sensitive reading of the Conclusion to this poem as inconclusive, see O’Neill (111-31).</note>
</p>
<p>This turn of thought exhibits the necessary grounding of poetry in skepticism of which D. G. James felt obliged to disapprove. In more than one sense, <emph>certainty closes the subject</emph>. Shelley makes the same move again in <title level="m">Adonais</title>. Here he contrives to reconcile the rhetoric of faith-based consolation in Christian elegy with the liberatory moment of skepticism. The despicable Quarterly Reviewer is one of the “carrion kites that scream below” (335), kites that soon become carrion themselves. This dead vulture, whose “cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame” (342), raises, in his very mode of being, the question whether <emph>anything</emph> here on earth is alive. In doing so he proves—proves unfalsifiably, that is—that Keats is now more alive than he ever was in life:
         <quote>
<lg>
<l>	Peace, peace! He is not dead, he doth not sleep—</l>
<l>	He hath awakened from the dream of life—</l>
<l>	’Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep</l>
<l>	With phantoms an unprofitable strife</l>
<l>	.     .     .     .—<emph>We</emph> decay</l>
<l>	Like corpses in a charnel. (343-49)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         In a more fully political register the inversion of life and death enabled by skepticism becomes the proto-Marxist dialectic epitomized in “England in 1819,” where leeches “drop, blind in blood, without a blow,” and all the evils of the Regency are “graves from which a glorious Phantom may/ Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day” (6, 13-14). The political dialectic is worked through again as a complex figure of longing in the “Ode to the West Wind.” It is only in urbane and colloquial poems like the “Letter to Maria Gisborne” that the death-in-life premise is openly acknowledged as a hyperbole to which exceptions may or may not prove the rule. In that poem, Leigh Hunt is “one of those happy souls/ Who are the salt of the Earth, and without whom/ This world would smell like what it is, a tomb” (210-11). It is not clear whether Hunt is alive in his role as a preservative of dead meat, but at least he may be.</p>
<p>The notion that those who are dead in soul are also somehow lifeless in body and spread death by contagion is present in Shelley’s poetry from the beginning, as in “To the Emperors of Russia and Austria” from the Esdaile Notebook: “No, cowards! Ye are calm and still, / Keen frosts that blight the human bud” (11-12). Here, though, not all the tyrants are in suspended animation, as Napoleon is very much alive. Also, the dialectical implications of this moment, which is Shelley’s socialized version of Coleridge’s death-in-life, are not in play: no future life follows in speculation from present death. </p>
<p>A fuller and more subtle version of this idea in the later verse, only seemingly undialectical, does arrive at a conjecture about eternal life by detaching the principle of life from its evanescent material manifestations. The Cloud in the poem of that name is sometimes both visible and tangible, sometimes invisible and latent, but always and forever, as an allegory of the soul, alive: “I change, but I cannot die” (76). Both the evidence of the senses and the premises of scientific “error and truth” insist on the ephemerality of living being, as in an organic process world. Shelley however insists on another way of reading science itself, in this case meteorological science. In a mechanized world like that of Holbach, “the” cloud can persist only as the persistence of substance, chemical or otherwise, and “cannot die” only because it has never lived. Shelley for his part does not necessarily disagree with Holbach in this poem; for him it is not finally the Lucretian persistence of organic matter that defies death, but rather the cloud as <emph>idea</emph>—as the necessity governing the cycle of clouds—that is alive. In lending the cloud reflection and the power of speech Shelley is not just making an object conscious, like a talking animal. (This is never what he does, for example, with his many choruses of elements, nor for that matter with the West Wind.) Rather he metonymically conceives the expressiveness of thinking as the expressiveness of what is thought—the idea—as though the idea were itself consciousness, hence vital. Skepticism in this case, although it allows a passage from the material to the immaterial, is revealed through the necessary bridge of metonymy from thinking to what is thought. Yet if the thought thus enabled turns out to consist in saying that vitality is not an attribute of organic substance but somehow transcends it, this metonymy actually corresponds to the dialectic of Shelley’s moral and social metaphors. The living death, again (frozen, “calm,” and so on), of flawed human subjects lends plausibility to the conjecture about life elsewhere. Surely it is reasonable, Shelley supposes, that life must be somewhere.<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="editors" n="5"> On this subject in relation to science, especially in relation to contemporary debates about whether life was intrinsic to matter, see Ruston, who points out that Shelley’s friend, the surgeon Sir William Lawrence, was accused by his opponents of believing that life was “nothing,” i.e., not a substance (17-18). In general, supporters of Lawrence were called “modern sceptics” (20). </note>
</p>
<p>Cavell’s way of securing the place of skepticism entails the same turn of thought. As Cavell argues and as Josh Wilner reminds us,<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="editors" n="6"> Here and below, I refer to Wilner’s paper, “ ‘Communicating with Objects’: Romanticism, Skepticism, and the ‘Specter of Animism’ in Cavell and Wordsworth” (see Eldridge and Rhie 152-162), which I heard first at a Cavell conference at Harvard on Oct. 15, 2010, then in a later version on a “Cavell and Romanticism” panel at the International Conference on Romanticism in Lubbock, Texas, Nov. 13, 2010, where I read a version of the present paper. </note> Romanticism is an expression of disappointment at Kant’s “settlement” with skepticism. We can build up the world through the senses in a reliable way, Kant says, but reason discovers itself in its unconditioned autonomy precisely through the realization that we cannot ever know the thing in itself. About this Cavell says, by now rather famously: “You don’t—do you—have to be a Romantic to feel sometimes about that settlement: Thanks for nothing” (<title level="m">Quest </title>31). As I’ve already suggested, Shelley, by contrast, arguably sees his opening, his chance, in this very settlement, even though he and his philosophical mentor, Sir William Drummond, disliked Kant (cf. <title level="m">Peter Bell the Third</title> 518-32). Certainly, however, Cavell in his view of the matter has identified the structure of the Romantic quest in a Shelleyan way. That form of Romantic irony which is a vacillation between desire for unmediated intimacy and desire for transcendence—the problematic, likewise, of Faust’s two souls—can be understood as an opening for effective dialectical negation. Shelley sees this moment as <emph>sheer</emph> negation. Mont Blanc is “remote, serene, and inaccessible” (97), a whiteness or a Wordsworthian blank. Volcanic as he may be (cf. Matthews in Reiman and Fraistat 558), Demogorgon is still a formless darkness mounting the chariot of the appointed Hour not as an agent but as an allegorical expression of the simple fact that Jupiter’s time has come. It is against this blankness or darkness, this denial of agency, meaning, causation, or creative origination, that as an act of defiance “the human mind’s imaginings,” as Shelley puts it at the end of “Mont Blanc” (143), autonomously and groundlessly create meanings, including a meaning even for Mont Blanc itself. As Tillotama Rajan says, “[the mountain’s] very existence as a form which is physically present yet spiritually vacant provokes the mind into constantly constructing and deconstructing its ideals” (Rajan 87). “The deep truth,” according to Demogorgon, “is imageless” (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, II, iv, 116). The indescribable being-what-they-are of things-as-they-are that Shelley after Hobbes and Godwin also calls Necessity, is the “vacancy” (cf. Shelley, “On Life” 507) that skeptical philosophers must sometimes leave us with. It is a useful vacancy that opens up unlimited space for the positings of the imagination.</p>
<p>It seems to me that at times Cavell’s argument would be more clearly delimited if he would distinguish more emphatically between ontological skepticism (doubt as to whether things and other minds exist at all, an emergent modern anxiety that Cavell associates with Descartes and Shakespeare) and epistemological skepticism. It is the latter, epistemological skepticism, which clearly emerges from the Kantian “settlement” as the concern of Romanticism. Kant makes it evident in the passage Cavell quotes from the <title level="m">Prolegomena</title> that there is really no ontological stumbling block to pause over, at least for pre-critical thought: “The understanding therefore,” says Kant, “by assuming appearances, grants the existence of things in themselves also, and so far we may say, that the representation of such things as form the basis of phenomena, consequently of mere creations of the understanding, is not only admissible, but unavoidable” (qtd. in <title level="m">Quest</title> 30). None of the Romantic authors Cavell treats in <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> doubt the existence of the world. They only wonder what its nature is, particularly whether it is alive or dead, and whether the imagination can bring it to life, or back to life. It is true that as a boy Wordsworth needed to hug a tree to be sure it existed, but we are likely to agree that that is <emph>not</emph> a characteristic moment, any more than the Intimations Ode is a characteristic poem. Wordsworth’s childhood idealism vertigo does not in fact play a role in Cavell’s consideration of that poem. As for Shelley, he is emphatic as early as 1813: “I have examined Hume’s reasonings with respect to the non-existence of external things [. . .].  What am I to think of a philosophy which conducts to such a conclusion?” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, I, 380) The apothegm one finds in “On Life” and elsewhere (with something like it in the Conclusion to “The Sensitive-Plant”), “nothing exists but as it is perceived” (506), is quite often read as though existence itself were at issue. But Shelley is here simply agreeing with the whole skeptical tradition, not just Kant, that it is the <emph>nature</emph> of things’ existence that depends on perception. The Romantic worry, I think it fair to generalize, concerns not the nonexistence of things but their intrinsic insignificance. Let us assume, then, that the skepticism that matters for present purposes, as would not necessarily be the case if one were a Cartesian or a Shakespearian (in Cavell’s view: I take Hamlet to be in Shelley’s camp), is epistemological, not ontological.</p>
<p>Cavell argues, in any case, that the First Generation’s response to the Kantian settlement was animism (cf., <emph>inter alia</emph>, <title level="m">Quest</title> 69). Josh Wilner’s Cavellian reading of  “Tintern Abbey” builds on that claim until he reaches his linguistic turn. There is no doubt that as a matter of intellectual history, still best documented by H. W. Piper in <title level="m">The Active Universe</title>, animism as sanctioned in science by Priestley, Erasmus Darwin, and others was indeed a temporary investment for the authors of <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>. By the time of Coleridge’s response to Wordsworth in “Dejection,” however, this belief has faltered. In our life alone, says Coleridge, does nature live.  I myself would argue, in any case, that the animism even of “Tintern Abbey” is expressed at best ambiguously and can just as easily be read as a shockingly radical materialism. My reading of Wordsworth’s quest for the unmediated objecthood of the world, wholly in agreement as I am with Cavell about Wordsworth’s desire to find common ground between consciousness and realia, inclines me to believe that the reunion is not noumenal but phenomenal. Our “widest commonalty” is not with a responsive life in things but rather the widest <emph>somatic</emph> commonalty, or community, of the poet’s embodied being with the being of other bodies. Not animated bodies, that is, but bodies as things in the world. Hence the need in Wordsworth to reduce consciousness to a moment of almost impercipient marginality, idiocy, senility, or emptying out such that “‘all is tranquil as a dreamless sleep’” (Fry, <title level="m">Wordsworth</title>, <title level="m">passim</title>).</p>
<p>In any case, even if one refuses the premise of animism while retaining the logic of its desire, that does not alter the problematic of skepticism as Cavell presents it—for example as follows: 
         <quote>but since [our very inhabitation of the ordinary] is from time to time perceptible to us—we who have constructed it—as extraordinary, we conceive that some place elsewhere, or this place otherwise constructed, must be what is ordinary to us, must be what Romantics [. . .] call “home.” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 9)</quote>
               For Shelley in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, the ordinary (in Cavell’s sense, that from which the large codes of fraud and woe have estranged us) is “this place” otherwise constructed, “somewhat changed” (III, iv, 71). For the Shelley of “Sensitive-Plant” or “Adonais,” on the other hand, it is “some place elsewhere.” The painted veil which those who live call life is the skeptical ground for any construction of homecoming, here or elsewhere. It is well, therefore, to pause for a moment over what Cavell means by “construction,” as that will bring me to the threshold of another way of understanding construction, a view in agreement with Wilner’s and one implicit in this paper, no doubt, from the beginning.</p>
<p>	The first part of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> is devoted to reflections on “criteria” in Wittgenstein, distantly related to what J. L. Austin calls “conditions” governing the effectiveness of utterances. It is importantly true, as Cavell points out, that “the fate of criteria, or their limitation, reveals [. . .] the truth of skepticism” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 7ff.). He additionally insists, however, that for Wittgenstein and Austin such markers of skepticism (if either philosopher is really prepared to call them that) are what establish a community of understanding, ensuring the avoidance of interpretive misfire among all who share the criteria relevant to a given communication. This is an implicitly communitarian or political idea that Shelley enters into wholeheartedly. The claim of reason is that to know myself, to understand why I am saying something and what are the stakes of my utterance, is to know shared criteria. By this means I understand myself politically, as someone who belongs in a community of minds (cf. <title level="m">Claim</title> 25). As in Blake and Shelley, to achieve individuation, which is to abandon the mere given-ness of truth and error as certainty, is not just to share criteria (that would still perhaps partake of certainty) but to know that they <emph>are</emph> criteria. In that case they are at once “ordinary”—effective with or without reflection—and also <emph>poetized</emph>, constructively emergent from skepticism.  </p>
<p>The limiting power of criteria (you can’t move your king into check or move a pawn backward, for example), which discloses their arbitrary function, highlights the importance of agreement about them precisely as a consequence of their groundlessness. Their <emph>shared</emph> coherence is enabled by the absence of correspondence, about which all and sundry might disagree. Thus when we acknowledge the conditioning of what can be thought and said, even if we are Romantic visionaries, there can be no danger of solipsism or private language, not even the danger of wild deviation among those who are positively certain of “the facts.” This is clearest when our criteria misfire. Fascinated by Austin’s example of the goldfinch at the bottom of the garden in the essay called “Other Minds,” Cavell, following Austin, states in more than one place that goldfinches have red heads (cf., e. g., <title level="m">Claim</title> 132). But what we agree to call a goldfinch in the United States has a black head. Only the European goldfinch has a red head, or more precisely a red face. We do not invoke this or any other trait of the bird (That particular bird? The species?—the American females of which, by the way, have grayish-yellow heads)—we do not invoke this trait as evidence of the bird’s existence as a thing in itself or even that of the species or the male of the species. We invoke it as a limiting criterion that distinguishes this bird from other birds; hence, in this case, a geographical context is necessary for the criterion to work. <emph>If criteria are truly markers of skepticism, in other words, they need to be recognized as semiotic, not semantic</emph>. The likelihood that neither Wittgenstein nor Cavell would agree with this conclusion perhaps raises the question just how firmly <emph>their</emph> arguments are rooted in the necessity of skepticism. But Shelley in any case would, I think, agree, following Locke among others. Even though his “almost” in the following passage may imply that he only accepts the weak form of the argument, he still does say:  “almost all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others” (“On Life” 507).</p>
<p>	One thing is clear, though. For Saussure as much as for Wittgenstein or Cavell, there is no private language. And likewise for Shelley. Limitation is fate, for Shelley as much as for Emerson. Limitation can also be called Necessity, as in the “necessity of atheism,” which does not mean that God does not exist but rather that our limited nature does not enable us to posit God’s existence. Contrary to appearance, this mode of limitation is a guarantor of freedom. It is not in the nature of water to flow uphill; hence, it feels unnatural when the boat of the Witch of Atlas is piloted uphill by the hermaphrodite. That is the limitation, the necessity governing the behavior of water, as one might say; yet when water is free to flow downhill it realizes its nature. When a dam is put across it, its nature is inhibited, revealing the politically crucial distinction in Shelley between <emph>necessity</emph> as freedom, the self-actualizing nature of things, and <emph>power</emph> as constraint, the coercive denaturing of things. The individual, in sum, is in and of itself already the political, just as Cavell argues in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>; and that is how the Shelley of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> can join Blake and Hegel in writing the great novel of individual consciousness and the history of the human mind in society simultaneously.</p>
<p>	The medium of this allegorical possibility (possible because after all ontogeny does recapitulate phylogeny), and likewise the domain of limiting criteria, is language. Language in turn contributes to the necessity, the limitation, of human being. It is just here that we may find the later Shelley straying from Cavell’s understanding of the liberating power of skepticism and moving closer to a form of linguistic determinism that has had a more signal influence on literary studies than Cavell has had to date. This emergent idea in Shelley must evidently have moved the colleagues who banded together in the book called <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism</title> to take <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> for their common subject matter.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" resp="editors" n="7"> While not wholly unsympathetic with the deconstructive turn in Shelley criticism, Clark raises the question of “anachronism,” pointing out the extent to which Shelley himself was conscious of anachronism, and enlists Tillotama Rajan in <title level="m">The Supplement of Reading</title> (1990), as follows: “[<title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>], while essentially deconstructive, does not present a process of pure erasure” (qtd. in Clark and Hogle 338).</note> Shelley introduces his own linguistic turn of thought twice in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> itself, and likewise in the <title level="m">Defence of Poetry</title>, but manages in those texts to shield himself from its unsettling consequences. </p>
<p>The <title level="m">Defence</title> repeatedly follows eighteenth-century speculation (together with recent interest in the Homeric cycle) in calling language at its origin a “cyclic poem” (e.g., 523), a database of dynamic metaphors that all poets access in writing their individual fragments. Consider Shelley’s telltale revision in saying that the muse Urania dictated to Milton nightly his unpremeditated verse, given that Milton actually says she “<emph>inspires easie</emph>, or dictates nightly” his unpremeditated verse (532, 532n.). Milton leaves open the possibility that inspiration is non-verbal, pre-verbal—in short, that thought precedes language—whereas Shelley’s revision insists that inspiration is language itself. The “Spirit” that speaks for most of the “Ode to Liberty” is said by the speaker to offer the same sort of dictation: “there came / A voice out of the deep: I will <emph>record</emph> the same” (14-15; italics mine). Comparably, when Asia in Act Two of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> recounts the gifts of Prometheus to man, she says “He gave man speech, and speech created thought, / Which is the measure of the universe” (II, iv, 73-74). Earth returns to the theme in Act Four when she says “Language is a perpetual Orphic song/ Which rules with daedal harmony a throng / Of thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapeless were” (IV, 415-17).</p>
<p>Shelley under this emergent semiotic outlook is no longer confirming the possibility of belief in the way he might have managed when he really <emph>could</emph> imagine skepticism to be a sort of mulchification of dead leaves that promises a coming spring. Such signs of linguistic determinism as those I have just enumerated do not help Shelley to believe that mere wind can be through his lips the trumpet of a prophecy, any more than Hobbes believed it when he said that to be inspired is to be blown up like a bagpipe. In <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> inspiration comes by shapes all light in whatever form has become destructive at relentlessly repeated intervals. As John Hodgson puts it, “the triumph of life is the failure of imagination” (Hodgson 619). This misfortune occurs not because inspiration doesn’t arrive, just as it always did, in the form of a dictating Intellectual Beauty (“herself a poet,” as Shelley said as early as <title level="m">Alastor</title> [161]). The muse of light has still arrived. The misfortune occurs because what Shelley seems now to conceive as the <emph>Nachträglichkeit</emph> or supplementarity of language constantly erases successive traces of itself in a loop or “fold” (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 547) of repetition-with-a-difference that feels like a Dantesque punishment. As Shelley’s Rousseau says in the complex figures (or “disfigurations”) canonized by Paul de Man (“Shelley Disfigured” 99): first, “And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune / To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot / The thoughts of him who gazed on them, and soon / All that was seemed as if it had been not” (382-85); and again, having drunk the cup of Nepenthe offered by the beautiful but already dissolving shape all light, Rousseau says:
         <quote>
<lg>
<l rendition="#indent2">	Suddenly my brain became as sand<lb/>
<lb/>
</l>
<l rendition="#indent2">	Where the first wave had more than half erased</l>
<l>The track of deer on desert Labrador,</l>

<l rendition="#indent2">	Until the second bursts—so on my sight</l>
<l>Burst a new Vision never seen before.—  (405-11)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            
         	It is possible to construe this imagery as an optative, holding at bay the destruction of change by repetition, as in the optative of the “Ode to Liberty”:
            
            <quote>
<lg>

<l rendition="#indent2">		Were as a serpent’s path, which the light air</l>
<l>	Erases, and the flat sands close behind!  (211-15)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         Yet even as early as “Ozymandias” the lone and level sands stretch far away, obliterating any form of confident knowledge (that of art as well as tyranny) that can be inscribed. The arbitrariness of language never would have emerged as what Saussure considers the essential fact of language as long as the referents of signs continued to be known in themselves with certainty. This arbitrariness can be accepted in relation to “error and truth” as long as it can be cordoned off as a preventable liability or trivial crux; but when viewed as the fundamental property of language it is disclosed both by and as skepticism. This “strong” conception of the semiotic works well enough for Shelley—and perhaps implicitly for Cavell—as long as it can be seen to enable constructive speculation. But when signifiers become traces that endlessly erase traces, Shelley’s “Life,” itself the animation here or elsewhere about which he had hitherto speculated hopefully, simply pulverizes the imagination, so that “[d]eath cannot liberate Rousseau from Life” (Dawson 281). The whole process begins when Shelley says, in launching his account of Life’s triumphal chariot, “A vision on my brain was rolled” (40).</p>
<ab rend="center">*</ab>
<p>It is important to acknowledge those places in Shelley that would appear at least to bracket skepticism. The “Ode to Liberty,” a poem that seems especially ambivalent when revisiting Shelley’s typical patterns of thought, puts into linguistic terms, again in the optative mode, the famous assertion of the <title level="m">Defence</title>. The mind in creation is a fading coal, reversing the premise that language precedes thought and rhetorically implying that thoughts are closer (at least) to realities than words: “O, that the words which make the thoughts obscure / From which they spring [. . .] / Were stript of their thin masks and various hue” (234-37). Yet language deracinated from thought and language productive of thought lead unfortunately to the same doubtful result, still leaving it unclear (if, after all, everything else is unclear) whether language or thought came first. When hope itself, as a mere word, becomes one of the “passions” that destroy hope (as in “Ozymandias” or <title level="m">Triumph</title>), skepticism is no longer constructive but turns grimly pyrrhonic. It is then subject to the charge of inadvertent certainty—falling back into the arms of error and truth—to which critiques of skepticism have always resorted. “O Heart and Mind and Thoughts what thing do you/ Hope to inherit in the grave below?” (“Sonnet: ‘Ye hasten to the grave!’” 13-14) The only trace of skepticism here, as Shelley turns against the hope of “Sensitive-Plant” and “Adonais,” lies in the improbable notion that rhetorical questions are put as questions just in case they may have a surprising answer.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, there is the passage in Shelley’s second Note to <title level="m">Hellas</title> (in relation to 197ff.) in which he seems to acknowledge that skepticism is not a necessary condition of perception but is itself a conditioned form of perception: “That there is a true solution of the riddle [of a supreme being in this context], and that in our present state the solution is unattainable by us are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain” (462). In our <title level="m">present</title> state? As opposed to some future state enabled by science, or by poetry as science? How are we to read this very different sort of profession of hope—different, that is, from that which is itself enabled by skepticism? It would appear perhaps that, through this “present” qualifier, error and truth have been here restored to Shelley’s good graces, and that therefore when the “true solution” is revealed, Peacock will turn out to have been right and there will be nothing further for poetry to do after all. If the truth is known, why should the atavistic yearnings of poetry be dragged in to embellish or undermine it? </p>
<p>Any sort of special pleading to square this passage with Shelley’s views as set forth in the argument of this paper will seem awkward, no doubt, but this much at least can be said: If the “true solution” were something comparable to phlogiston or galvanism or the elixir vitae, the “secret of life” that many today still patiently seek, then Shelley could in this passage be convicted of having failed to learn the lesson from adventurers in speculative science that he might have learned best from Swift’s Projectors. As with the anecdote of Gertrude Stein’s last words, and as Cavell argues continuously in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, <emph>to know what the solution is you have to know what the riddle is</emph>. You have to know that riddles, the presumed fundamental questions, are as much conditioned by “criteria” as their answers are. We might have thought that Shelley of all people would understand that caveat and respond to the dilemma constructively, as he and Cavell for the most part attempt to do. </p>
<p>So if we risk forthwith supposing Shelley not to mean what he says, honoring what we take to be his more circumspect outlook, what can Shelley possibly mean in this surprising passage from the apparatus to <title level="m">Hellas</title>? What he might mean, and elsewhere says, is that things undoubtedly are what and as they are, this state of affairs being what he has always called “necessity.” (The far looser sense of the necessary as the self-identity of things is nowadays enshrined in the street wisdom of “it is what it is.”) In that case the solution to the “riddle” is that only doctrinaire thought supposes there to be either a solution <emph>or</emph> a riddle. But “our present state”—even Shelley’s own present state—prevents us from resting content with this awareness because of what Cavell calls the Romantic impatience with Kant’s settlement. As a multitude unarmed with skepticism (hence immersed in what Shelley so often bitterly calls “human thought” [e. g., “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” 15]), we seek and nearly always find solutions in ideology. But even as poets, Shelley far more sympathetically argues (and Cavell would argue too), in the face of that “vacancy” which is not so much a riddle as, simply, “silence and solitude” (“Mont Blanc” 144), we express defiance and hope with the aid of the intellectual beauty that at the end of “Mont Blanc” Shelley calls “the human mind’s imaginings.”</p>

<head>About this Volume</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume of <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> includes an editor's introduction by <ref target="#LindstromAbout">Eric Lindstrom</ref>, with essays by <ref target="#FryAbout">Paul H. Fry</ref>, <ref target="#WalkerAbout">Eric C. Walker</ref>, <ref target="#SunAbout">Emily Sun</ref>, <ref target="#FrancoisAbout">Anne-Lise François</ref>, <ref target="#LindstromAbout">Eric Lindstrom</ref>, and an afterword by <ref target="#WilnerAbout">Joshua Wilner</ref>.</p>
<!-- Long volume abstract goes here -->
<p rend="noCount">At a climactic point in Part Four of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (1979), the American philosopher Stanley Cavell arrives at the striking conclusion that “romanticism opens with the discovery of the problem of other minds, or with the discovery that the other is a problem, an opening of philosophy.” Cavell’s account of how Romanticism opens is not historical in orientation, but rather offers a rich conceptual, aesthetic, and ethical site of concern that both interrupts and generates his life’s work— thus presenting an opening for scholars and students of the Romantic Period to think the subject of Romanticism anew in studying (with) Cavell. The essays in this volume seek to provide the fullest account to date of Cavell’s prompting by Romanticism in light of his powerful record of engagement with British and European Romantic texts: a body of literature on which Cavell has performed several bravura readings.   Cavell’s writings and distinctive philosophical approach have garnered an increasing amount of sustained attention over the past several years, particularly since the publication of <title level="m">Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</title> (2005) and <title level="m">Little Did I Know</title> (2010).  Yet beyond his major American subjects of Thoreau and Emerson, there is still little published scholarship that engages Cavell’s thought at extended, close range with Romanticism as the moment that matters so much him: the “perfectionist” opening that comes after religion, but before philosophy. The present collection—with essays (in suggested reading order) by Emily Sun, Paul Fry, Eric Lindstrom, Eric Walker, and Anne-Lise François, and a substantial Afterword by Joshua Wilner—hinges between the efforts to record Cavell’s engagement with British Romantic texts and to stage new interventions.</p>

<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by David Rettenmaier, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by David Rettenmaier. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

<head>About the <title level="s">Romantic Circles Praxis
					Series</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted to
					using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
					investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and
					theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
					Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge,
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world
					where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a
					period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
					the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the
					intellectual and theoretical discussions of today.
					<title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain with
					the best and most exciting critical writing of
					contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>

<title level="m">Must We Mean What We Say </title>was published in 1969, thus shortly after the publication of <title level="m">De la grammatologie</title> in 1967 and shortly before the appearance of <title level="m">Blindness and Insight</title> in 1971. All inaugural books, all challenging their disciplines from within but in relation to an encompassing sense of cultural and political crisis, all centrally concerned with the question of literature’s relation to philosophy. It is imaginable then that those entering the profession (but which one?) at this time and drawn toward theory<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> In what follows I use the word “theory” idiomatically and without precise definition, but always with the understanding that literary studies has functioned as its primary institutional base of operations.</note> might have found in Cavell’s writing and its sources in the late Wittgenstein a counterdiscourse to what was emerging as deconstruction.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> Cavell’s early work did not of course develop in response to deconstruction, but it did develop in response to a shared set of problems about the relationship of language and subjectivity inherited from Romanticism, and may usefully be thought of as simultaneously attracted to and resistant of something like the route of response deconstruction was to pursue. Because I see Cavell’s work as intimately exposed to the attraction of what it resists (and which he figures as “skepticism”), I also see it as articulating (one mode of) theory’s resistance to itself, thus not simply countering it from the “outside.” Here I have in mind Paul de Man’s statement at the end of “The Resistance to Theory,” “Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory since theory <emph>is</emph> itself this resistance” (19). One way in which deconstruction may be seen as having enacted this relation of self-resistance is in its transition from a predominantly topological model, organized around the inversion and displacement of inside-outside (and thus center-periphery) oppositions, to a performative model concerned with, to borrow again from de Man, “the disruptive intertwining of trope and performance” (<title level="m">Allegories</title> ix) I find it notable that this development occurs in part through an engagement with Austin’s distinction between constative and performative utterances (a distinction, it is often forgotten, that Austin blurs in the same talk where he initially draws it [246ff]), while Wittgenstein (whom de Man curiously styles a “philosopher of science” [<title level="m">Allegories</title> 17] in one of two explicit references I’m aware of, the other being to the <title level="m">Tractatus </title>as “scientific rather than literary” [<title level="m">Allegories</title> 111) remained off-limits, notwithstanding the occasional effort to promote a dialogue, such as Henry Staten’s <title level="m">Derrida and Wittgenstein</title>. Motivated in part by my desire to stimulate a “conversation” between Derrida and Cavell, I recall asking Derrida in the early eighties whether he didn’t think that deconstruction might enter into a productive engagement with Wittgenstein. His answer was a decided no, though he went on to allow that with Austin “il y’a quelque chose à faire.”</note>
</p>
<p>	By and large, of course, this did not happen. In the years and decades following that late sixties moment there has been no lack of discrete responses by individual literary scholars and theorists to Cavell’s work—as Eric Lindstrom discusses in his introduction—and even the occasional institutional overture.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> I am thinking in particular of the effort in the mid-seventies, in which, if I am not mistaken, Bloom, de Man, and Hartman all participated, to bring Cavell to Yale’s Department of Philosophy. </note> But it is only comparatively recently that something approaching a collective response by the field of literary studies and of a kind comparable to that elicited by any number of contemporary continental figures, not to mention Derrida and de Man, has begun to organize itself. Nor by collective response do I mean that the “field” as a whole has found it necessary to engage with Cavell’s writing and thinking in a systematic way, but only that an interest has emerged in organizing occasions, whether conferences, sessions, or collaborative publications like the present, whose form more or less ensures that at least some literary critical responses to Cavell’s work will be <emph>collected</emph> rather than remain dispersed, gathered together in the hope that something like a critical mass will be reached. The apparent historical, geographical, and thematic circumscription of its topic notwithstanding then (though one could argue that the word “Romanticism” and the name “Cavell,” especially when considered in conjunction, all but guarantee this result), the present collection is symptomatic both of the reopening—or perhaps better the resuscitation—of possibilities of exchange one might have thought foreclosed or moribund, and, in its heterogeneity, of an ongoing uncertainty as to whether and how they are to be sustained. </p>
<p>Since my own involvement with Cavell began in 1966, more or less at the same time that I began studying with Paul de Man as an undergraduate at Cornell, and just as I was beginning to hear about someone named Jacques Derrida doing exciting work in France (all of this scored to the drumbeat of bombardments half a world away and growing calls to bring the war home), Eric Lindstrom’s invitation to write this afterword naturally leads me to reflect on two closely related questions: first, what hindered theory’s reception of Cavell’s work; and second, what, if anything, has changed to make that work more available for engagement?</p>
<p>	To speak briefly to the first question, and to forestall the suggestion that the difficulty, alluded to briefly by Lindstrom, has been the idiosyncracies of Cavell’s style, or (more complexly) his (parochial?) concern with the fate of philosophy in America and its repression of Emerson as its founder: the real stumbling block has always seemed to me Wittgenstein or, not to speak in proper names, the appeal to the authority of ordinary language.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> Austin comes in here too, of course, though not to the same extent, if only because Austin had his own use for technical language.</note> While one can imagine Derrida and Cavell alike finding use for Lacan’s dictum, “il n’y a pas de métalangage,” no transcendental standpoint from which language might be apprehended in its totality and critiqued, for deconstruction this entails as its dialectical counterpart the idea that everyday language is conditioned through and through by metaphysical oppositions, and the difficult task (“immense labeur,” as Derrida would say) of undoing and displacing them from within a syntax and lexicon they intimately inform. From such a perspective, Wittgenstein’s remark that “what we do is bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use” (<title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> 116), a remark which surely provides the subtext for Cavell’s characterization of the work of Romanticism as “the task of bringing the world back, as to life” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 52), will seem at best an evasion of the problem, at worst an invitation to complacency, a pastoralizing appeal to normative contexts of usage that turns a blind eye to the destabilizing critical potential of literary language, while from a Wittgensteinian perspective, deconstruction perpetuates the mirage of a totalizing linguistic edifice that holds us captive—an edifice which Wittgenstein could dismiss as “houses of cards” (<title level="m">Philosophical Investigations</title> 118)—through the very project of undertaking to dismantle it.</p>
<p>	It is not surprising then that Paul Fry’s finely argued piece on “Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell,” which explicitly characterizes Cavell’s work as mediating between two “traditions of philosophy” (2) and whose reading of Shelley is shaded in various ways by de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured” essay,<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> In addition to various explicit references, Fry’s analysis of Shelley’s complexly chiasmic handling of the relationship between life and death in the epilogue to “The Sensitive Plant” and elsewhere is reminiscent of de Man’s discussion in that essay of the relation between sleeping and waking in “The Triumph of Life.” </note> originally published in the 1979 <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism </title>(Fry himself having arrived at Yale as an assistant professor in 1971), essentially has to bracket Cavell’s “primary interest [. . .] in the recovery of the quotidian” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.fry.html">par. 6</ref>) in order to conduct its argument.  What remains is Cavell’s other signature preoccupation (to the extent they can be separated from one another), the problematic of skepticism, whose subversion, in Fry’s reading of Shelley, of the categories of truth and error (as of those of life and death) gives poetry its chance, at least in the pre-1820 Shelley. Fry finds in this “grounding of poetry in skepticism,” in particular in its critical, “constructive” potential, common ground with Cavell’s insistence, early and late, on the skeptic’s “insight [. . .] that certainty is not enough” (<title level="m">Must We</title> 258). </p>
<p>	That “the skeptic’s insight” is integral to Cavell work; that his concomitant rejection of a Cartesian epistemology of certainty makes common cause in this regard with what came to be known as post-structuralist theory; that this rejection is further concomitant with an openness to literature as an originary mode of human knowing and thus as a contestant of or partner in philosophy’s claims; that this rejection and openness are hallmarks of Romantic writing and thought and what Cavell’s diagnoses as its “disappointment with the Kantian settlement” with skepticism; that Cavell’s work therefore involves from the start an original relation to Romanticism (prior to its channeling through the pivotal figure of Emerson): all these propositions Fry’s discussion of Cavell and Shelley demonstrates, either directly or by implication, in exemplary fashion.  At the same time, that Fry speaks of “Cavell’s understanding of the liberating power of skepticism” (which Fry sets off against a “linguistic determinism” to which he sees the late Shelley turning and that he associates with the “Yale School” and its impact on literary studies), gives me pause. In my reading, the importance Cavell accords skepticism is not a function of its “liberating power” but of the irrepressibility of the impulse to which it gives expression and access, an impulse Cavell identifies with the all-too-human wish to escape the human and finds articulated in, for example, the first sentence of the first edition of Kant's <title level="m">First Critique</title>.
            <note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> “Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of mind.”</note>
</p>
<p>Of the other contributions, it is Eric Lindstrom’s—which is also the essay most concerned (particularly in its first half) with claiming for Cavell an original relation to Romanticism—whose way of construing that relationship most resembles Fry’s. Again it is skepticism, or more precisely what Cavell calls “living one’s skepticism,” which Lindstrom understands as the task of “bridg[ing]” “isolation and [. . .] community,” as the uncertain possibility of self- or world- “renewal by way of our skepticism,” which is seen as constituting “Cavell’s Romanticism” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 6, passim</ref>) Both find touchstones for their arguments in cognate passages from <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>: for Fry, Cavell’s interpretation of “Romanticism’s work [. . .] as the task of bringing the world back, as to life. This may present itself as the quest for the return to the ordinary, or of it, of a new creation of our habitat; or as the quest away from that, for the creation of a new inhabitation” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53); for Lindstrom, Cavell’s presentation of the thought “that the world could be—or could have been—so remade, or I in it, that I would want it, as it would be, or I in it” as “an idea that Emerson or any Romantic would be lost without” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 35). </p>
<p>	It is understandable that such words might be construed as a warrant for skepticism, understood as a thorough-going questioning of what I take as given in my relation to the world and others, and Lindstrom is certainly not alone in taking Cavell’s words about “living one’s skepticism” to involve an ethical injunction (though he is careful to describe its possibility as in question). For myself, however, I take away a different understanding of this issue, and therefore a different understanding of Cavell’s relation to Romanticism on this score. The theme of “living one’s skepticism” arises initially in <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> in the context of Cavell’s extended comparison of the classical philosophical problem of material objects skepticism, reaching its definitive formulation in Hume, and the more peculiarly modern problem of other minds skepticism. With regard to the former, Hume famously observes that “when we leave our closet and engage in the common affairs of life, its conclusions vanish.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> The sentence I cite is from the opening of the third book of Hume’s <title level="m">Treatise of Human Nature </title>and is said with reference to all “abstruse reasoning.” Its specific application to skepticism is developed in the concluding section of the same book.</note> Or, as Cavell phrases it, “[W]ith respect to the external world an initial sanity requires recognizing that I cannot live my skepticism”—and then continues, “whereas with respect to others a final sanity requires recognizing that I can, I do” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 451).</p>
<p>	Particularly when considered within the context of this latter acknowledgement, the “Romantic” idea over which Lindstrom lingers—“that the world could be—or could have been—so remade, or I in it, that I would want it, as it would be, or I in it” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 35-36)—reads to me as formulated in resistance to the draw of a skeptical half-heartedness that repeated experience (hence, “a final sanity”) all but requires us to share, and that manifests above all (and here my line of thought rejoins Lindstrom’s) as “our distance from [. . .] the language we routinely use” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 11</ref>).  Whether this distance, to again echo Lindstrom glossing Cavell, is understood in terms of “the finitude of ‘where we stand’ in questioning use of our own and others’ language” (ibid) or in terms of an absolute demand that no remaking of the world or imagining of the world remade could satisfy, seems to me precisely where the issue of skepticism in its relation to Romanticism’s transformative aspirations is lodged for Cavell.</p>
<p>	But what is “the finitude of where we stand” in questioning our use of language? Consider the following passage from Arthur Eddington’s 1929 <title level="m">The Nature of the Physical World</title>, recognizably a latter-day version of (and conceivably reflecting familiarity with) Hume’s portrayal of the situation of the skeptical philosopher:         <quote>I am standing on the threshold about to enter a room. It is a complicated business [. . .] I must make sure of landing on a plank travelling at twenty miles a second around the sun. [. . .] The plank has no solidity of substance. To step on it is like stepping on a swarm of flies. Shall I not slip through? [. . .] [T]he occurrence would be, not a violation of the laws of nature, but a rare coincidence. [. . .] Verily it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a scientific man to pass through a door. And whether the door be barn door or church door it might be wiser that he should consent to be an ordinary man and walk in rather than wait till all the difficulties involved in a really scientific egress are resolved. (324)</quote>
            In a well-known 1938 letter to Scholem, Walter Benjamin famously wrote of Eddington’s conceit, which he cites in translation at greater length, “In all of literature I know of no printed passage that exhibits the Kafkaesque-<emph>gestus</emph> to the same extent.” That it does so is because this “most recent of experiential worlds”—which “is projected theoretically, for example, in modern physics and practically in the technology of warfare” and which Benjamin also associates with “the experience of the modern city dweller”—“was conveyed to [Kafka] precisely by the mystical tradition,” with which it exists in “tremendous tension” but whose powers had to be appealed to in order to confront a “reality [that] can scarcely be experienced by an <emph>individual</emph>” (Benjamin 563-4).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"> The use Benjamin makes of the Eddington passage would have been suggested to him in part by Eddington himself. The title of the chapter from which the passage is drawn is “Science and Mysticism” (a title which undoubtedly attracted Benjamin’s attention), while the chapter’s theme is that “The physicist now regards the external world in a way which I can only describe as more mystical, though not less exact and practical, than that which prevailed some years ago, when it was taken for granted that nothing could be true unless an engineer could make a model of it” (344). The cited passage itself is immediately preceded by the statement that “the deepest philosophical researches as to the nature of the Deity may give a conception equally out of proportion for daily life [as those of the physicist]” (323).</note>
</p>
<p>Less well known, at least by students of literature, are some remarks in Wittgenstein’s <title level="m">Blue Book</title> (1933-34) which may as well (and might in fact) be responding to the same passage in Eddington:
            <quote>We have been told by popular scientists that the floor on which we stand is not solid, as it appears to common sense, as it has been discovered that the wood consists of particles filling space so thinly that it can almost be called empty. [. . .] To say, on this latter ground, that the floor is not solid is to misuse language. For even if the particles were as big as grains of sand, and as close together as these are in a sandheap, the floor would not be solid if it were composed of them in the sense in which a sandheap is composed of grains. Our perplexity was based on a misunderstanding [. . .] the word “solidity” was used wrongly [. . .] in a typically metaphysical way, namely without an antithesis. (Wittgenstein 45-46)</quote>
            These things are a parable. In Benjamin’s reading, although Eddington’s explicit subject is the constitutive role of uncertainty in quantum mechanics’ displacement of classical mechanics, the passage expresses something more general, an immobilizing anxiety—"Shall I not slip through?"—in the face of what Dickinson could still name “that precarious Gait/Some call Experience,”<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9">
<quote>

</lg>
</quote>
</note> a skeptical bearing that paradoxically claims the vindication of scientific truth. No less for Wittgenstein, more (and then less) is at stake in Eddington’s scene than meets the eye: it is the type of metaphysical error, and it is to be met by “bringing words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.” </p>
<p>The method or idea of “bringing words back [. . .] to their everyday use,” which is to say of ordinary language philosophy as practiced (differently) by Wittgenstein and Austin, is presented by Cavell as simultaneously the “return of a voice to philosophy” and “giving me a voice in philosophy” (<title level="m">Pitch</title> 69).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"> Timothy Gould’s 1998 <title level="m">Hearing Things: Voice and Method in the Writing of Stanley Cavell </title>remains the crucial investigation of the problem of voice in Cavell’s work. In the present context, it is worth noting that Cavell’s relation to Romanticism is one of Gould’s running concerns, and his relation to deconstruction a recurrent one.</note> Since that unembarrassed, if exquisitely complex, appeal to voice went directly against the grain of the deconstructive critique of phonocentrism, confirming it in its suspicions, as it were, of appeals to the ordinary, it is notable that the second half of Lindstrom’s essay on “Cavell, Derrida and the Literary Animal” should look for the grounds of a <emph>rapprochement </emph>in “Derrida’s [. . .] raising the profile of embodied voice of his text, so that at times he parallels Cavell in a precise, yet diffusely lively, vocal inflection” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 17</ref>) The possibility of such an approach attests not only to what Lindstrom accurately describes as “Derrida’s [. . .] turn to autobiographical writing from the 1980s onward” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 17</ref>) and, with surehandedness, asks us to consider in relation to the even more marked and earlier initiated tendency in Cavell. It is also grounded in the increasing importance accorded by Derrida to the “idiomatic,” marker of the singularity and multiplicity of languages, and closely allied as a linguistic category, I would argue, with the “ordinary” and the “everyday.” Finally it attests to the easing of a degree of censorship attaching to invocations of “voice” whose imposition was the inevitable if not sought as such consequence of the deconstructive program of undoing metaphysics’ foundational repression of “l’errance joyeuse du <emph>graphein</emph>” (Derrida, “Éllipse” 429; Derrida’s emphasis). Here again, the shift from emphasis on the irreducibly figural dimension of propositional language to an emphasis on an irreducibly <emph>performative</emph> dimension has played a central role.</p>
<p>Thus Lindstrom is careful to stipulate, in initiating his comparative investigation of Derrida’s and Cavell’s "strain[s] of philosophy moving both against and [. . .] arching back toward the conditions of song,” that what he is inquiring into “is not at all a centering of logos as metaphysical 'presence' in voice,” but rather, in his suggestive if elusive formulation, “an inflection of thought by the tensional body of performed language” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.lindstrom_essay.html">par. 20</ref>) Although one may ask whether such a recasting of voice in terms of embodied performance (here dependent on an equivocation as to whether the “body of performed language” is the body doing the performing or the “body” of the language performed) does not reproduce the anchoring of language in a relation of self-presence that is the target of Derrida’s critique, I prefer to examine for a moment one figuration of that “tensional body” on which he dwells in developing his related thinking about the relation to animality in Cavell’s and Derrida’s comparably mobile, improvisatory inhabitations of language, the following stanza from Wordsworth’s “Lines Written in Early Spring”:
         <quote>
<lg>
<l>The birds around me hopped and played</l>
<l>Their thoughts I cannot measure,</l>
<l>But the least motion which they made,</l>
<l>It seem’d a thrill of pleasure.</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            Lindstrom’s attention is rightly drawn to Wordsworth’s play with “measure”: “Surpluses of feeling nearly built into the pseudo-cognitive structure of the ‘measured’ verse ballad lightly and non-insistently countermand [. . .] Newtonian [. . .] or Cartesian [. . .] paradigms of measurement” ("Introduction" par. 23). But there is another less evident but more piercing play of words involved in the way “thrill” channels “trill” (as de Man would, in fact, have pronounced it), an association by means of which Wordsworth connects the vibratory intensifications, the “trills” of poetic voice to the birds’ “least motion,” and which anticipates, in the unfolding of Lindstrom’s essay, his closing citation of Derrida (referencing the myth of the cicadas in <title level="m">The Phaedrus</title>): “‘I philosophize’ can mean that as a man I am a cicada, I recall what I am, a cicada who remembers having been a man. To remind myself of myself is to recall myself to singing and music” (<title level="m">Animal</title> 53; qtd. in Lindstrom). The writings of Cavell, Derrida, and Wordsworth alike make something—and ask us to make something—of this tremulous excess. </p>
<p>Turning from Fry’s and Lindstrom’s essays to the contributions of François and Walker, what strikes me most immediately is the degree to which questions about the relationship of self and world yield place in both to intersubjective dramas of relationship, with marriage the dominant figure and Austen the preeminent writer to be interrogated. While it might seem that François provides the theoretical context for this difference in emphasis, drawing on yet another Cavellian account of Romanticism as “the ‘process of secularization,’ whereby finite individuals are asked to play ‘God’ to one another by verifying and bearing witness to one another’s separate existences” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 3</ref>), this is only partially the case since the wedding of “the discerning intellect of man [. . .] to this goodly universe” of which Wordsworth “would chant [. . .] the spousal verse” (“Prospectus" to <title level="m">The Recluse</title> ll. 52-3) offers a competing pattern of secularization and figuration of marriage, a complication to which I return below.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"> I follow François, who here is following Cavell, in using the term “secularization” with reference to Romanticism, but share Lindstrom’s hesitations about those of Cavell’s remarks that “are content to stop at broad agreement with the longstanding idea of romanticism as a substitute for, or afterlife of, religion” (personal communication). My essay “Romanticism and the Internalization of Scripture” was intended as a critique of that idea as expounded in Abrams’ <title level="m">Natural Supernaturalism </title>(and, more fleetingly, <title level="m">De la grammatologie</title>), though the copula of my title has sometimes been mistaken for an equals sign.</note>
</p>
<p>Walker observes with admirable economy, “A cornerstone of Cavell’s work is the claim that marriage marks the recalcitrant sites where narratives wrestle with skepticism” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.walker.html">par. 4</ref>) Correlatively, both he and François lay stress on what the latter calls “marriage as a daily or <emph>diurnal</emph> event” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 6</ref>; my emphasis).  For François, Cavellian marriage is “incapable of definitive achievement because it consists of the precarious sustaining (or not) of a conversation over time, one felicitous instance of which can never absolutely guarantee the dawn of another” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 6</ref>) while Walker identifies as “[a] hallmark of Cavell’s work on marriage [. . .] that there is no such thing as marriage:  there is only remarriage, day after day” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.walker.html">par. 12</ref>) In short, marriage is also a figure of the everyday, the ordinary. This way of associating marriage with the diurnal cuts two ways (at least). On the one hand, as the preceding quotations make clear, it exposes in its structure the marriage bond and everything figured by that bond to the condition of separateness it is conventionally imagined to allay, a move at once desentimentalizing and dramatizing. On the other hand, that marriage (which is to say, remarriage) should be the privileged figure for this (condition of) commitment to the everyday accentuates the risk of conflating the ordinary with the normative, and, still today, specifically, the heteronormative. In this respect, Emily Sun’s treatment of marriage and friendship as virtually interchangeable “conditioned forms of intimacy,” while eliding the specifically institutional nature of marriage (as Cavell observes, “If marriage is the emblem of intimacy, it is equally the emblem of institutions”), has the virtue of making room within a discussion of Cavellian marriage for the homoerotic intensities of Shelley’s “Julian and Maddalo.”</p>
<p>Sun’s essay is also distinctive in locating in Cavell’s account of Romanticism a <emph>critique </emph>of its “defects” or “defaults”: more specifically, Romanticism’s disappointment with the Kantian “settlement” or bargain with skepticism (relinquishment of knowledge of the thing-in-itself, in exchange for an intelligible phenomenal world) as leading for Cavell to its own problematic bargaining with “animism” (thus seeming, as Cavell remarks at one point—though speaking, in the first instance, of himself—to “exchange one form of craziness for another”). To pursue this reading of Cavell, Sun has to disregard his explicit statement that “[t]he matter of animism is not going to be easy to state, because it has been badly misconceived (though perhaps it no longer is) as something Romantics embrace” (<title level="m">Quest </title>53), but it is useful to be reminded that Cavell’s relationship with Romanticism is indeed shadowed by a philosophical uneasiness vis-à-vis the claims of literature that does not enter into his relationship with, say, Shakespeare. </p>
<p>It is thus indeed telling, as Sun emphasizes, that the last of the 1983 Beckman Lectures, which form the first part of <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary </title>and constitute Cavell’s most sustained explicit engagement with British Romanticism, in fact turns to a reading of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, for something like a dramatization in its final scene of a solution to the problems Romanticism poses “in its efforts at re-animation of the world and recovery of (interest in) the ordinary” (Sun par. 2). Accordingly the last third of Sun’s essay is likewise devoted to tracking this reading, while the first half reads “Julian and Maddalo” and in particular the fate of Julian, as “an unconnected man,” as dramatizing “a forfeit of the quest for the ordinary” (Sun par. 9). The theoretical hingecrux of Sun's argument, however, turns on Cavell's concern with how the Ancient Mariner “takes his tale to compete with the prospect of marriage” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 64). Since the burden of that tale is, of course, "to love and reverence...all things that God made and loveth," and moreover to find the celebration of such love and reverence "far sweeter than the marriage feast," one may well understand that concern as a further moment in a critique of Romantic animism. In turning towards what Sun, borrowing a phrase from Cavell, calls "intimacy at large" (think Schiller's sloppy "<emph>Kuss der ganzen Welt</emph>"), Romanticism turns away from the "conditioned intimacies" of our shared criteria in language, without which nothing, and no one, can count (a further aspect of Sun's essay, as Eric Lindstrom notes, being its careful attention to Cavell's use of economic metaphors—of which Romanticism’s “bargain” with skepticism or animism would be yet another instance).</p>
<p>The phrase "intimacy at large" occurs in the course of what Cavell calls his "way of figuring" the Mariner's moral: "To marry now is to be willing to have a further adventure of aloneness...as if marriage is a further investment of our narcissism.... [F]or that very reason this intimacy cannot be celebrated, or sanctified; there is no outside to it.... Then the Mariner's may in this way be a message of romanticism as such, that there is an intimacy at large, and that poetry is responsible for giving it expression" (<title level="m">Quest</title> 55-6). The originality of Sun's reading is to hear in these words a "critique of Romanticism," rather than, as I find myself inclined to take them, a possible critique of what it is "to marry now." In fact, Cavell's "way of figuring" does not, I think, quite allow us to locate where his investment lies, as though there is "an intimacy at large" in his prose, not in the sense of embracing everything at once, but in the sense in which we may speak of a fugitive being "at large," evading the detection of the authorities. </p>
<p>Perhaps what gets pinned down as Romanticism's "animism" also involves an "intimacy at large" in this sense. Consider these lines from "To My Sister," written while William and Dorothy were keeping house at Alfoxden and caring for the illegitimate child of a friend (thus the original title, "Lines Written at a small distance from my House and sent by my Boy to the Person to whom they are addressed”):
         <quote>
<lg>
<l>Love, now an universal birth, </l>
<l>From heart to heart is stealing</l>
<l>From earth to man, from man to earth:</l>
<l>It is the hour of feeling. (ll. 21-24)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
            Someone might say these lines are guilty of animism in the sense of attributing feeling to the world "at large." But if love is here “stealing” across boundaries, what passes between earth and man is continuous with the vows which pass unspoken in the lines the poet writes for his sister’s reading (“Some silent laws our hearts may make/ Which they shall long obey” [ll. 29-30]), and which make of the poem a kind of epithalamion, but an epithalamion celebrating a moment and a form of relationship for which there precisely were not and could not be publically established forms of consecrations and which it thus becomes the task and raison d’être of the poem to create.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"> See Wilner, “Experimental Prose and the Re-configuration of Incestuous Bonds: from <title level="m">The Grasmere Journal </title>to <title level="m">Tender Buttons</title>.”</note>
</p>
<p>This brings me back to the issue of intersubjectivity as the sphere in which the acknowledgement of relationship and separateness is to be played out. As the varying emphases of these five essays bear witness, Cavell’s work, like Romanticism itself, moves between questions about my relationship to the world and questions about my relation to others. While there is plenty of reason to construe this movement as a development—thus <title level="m">The Claim of Reason </title>passes from “Skepticism and the Existence of the World” in Part II to “Skepticism and the Problem of Others” in Part IV, as <title level="m">The Prelude </title>seeks to pass “From Love of Nature to Love of Man”—in the end that crossing seems to me no more decided, nor would one want it to be, in Cavell than it is in Wordsworth. Having explored the way in which Austen’s use of free indirect style frees her protagonists from the “burden that Cavell takes as the mark of secular individuals—that of making themselves known and accepting to be known by one another” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 11</ref>), Anne-Lise François is led to ask, “What would it mean to reimagine marriage as something occurring between novelist/narrator and protagonist, according to heteronormative assumptions, between hero and heroine” (<ref target="praxis.cavell.2014.francois.html">par. 14</ref>)? Perhaps nothing more, I am inclined to surmise, than to imagine a child wed to its doll or its truck. This is to suggest, first of all, that the oscillation in Cavell’s stagings of skepticism as between what I will call the problem of object relations and “the problem of others” should be thought of as continuing to underwrite his thinking about marriage (which is not to say that they are simply analogues of one another since, to begin with, the one predicates asymmetry while the other symmetry); and secondly, and more crucially for me, that this oscillation is intimately involved in experiences of reading and writing and the pre-verbal processes of symbol-formation that precede them.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"> In this connection, I have always been fascinated by Klein’s account of “little Fritz,” for whom “in <emph>writing</emph> the lines mean roads and the letters ride on motor-bicycles—on the pen—upon them. For instance, ‘i’ and ‘e’ ride together on a motor-bicycle that is usually driven by the ‘i’ and they love each other with a tenderness quite unknown in the real world” (317, Klein’s emphasis). </note> In his “Afterword” to <title level="m">The End of the Line</title>, Neil Hertz observes how “because the frame separating the author/reader from the work is permeable—and has to be, if the work is to be read at all—a play develops between author/reader and text, regardless of the degree of autobiographical likeness with which a particular surrogate is represented” (220), thus elaborating on his preceding, more schematic, analysis of how “a differential play between subject and object can find its echo and emblem ‘within’ the nominal object” (218). The lightly ethical cast of François’ interest in how the play of free indirect style "frees characters from the work of...making themselves legible to others" invites consideration in the context of such reflections and may justifiably be seen as declining Cavell's "conception of marriage as a kind of shorthand for the ongoing and difficultly evinceable project of acknowledgment" (par. 7).  That she should be led, however, to locate these degrees of freedom at least partially in response to Cavell’s writings on Romanticism, acknowledgement, and marriage speaks to just how continuously Cavell’s working of these themes and wooings of his reader leaves itself open to perpetual interruption. </p>

<head>Your Friends and Lovers: Perfectionism’s Recounting of Romanticism</head>

<p>Stanley Cavell’s central engagement with British Romanticism takes place in the 1983 Mrs. William Beckman Lectures at Berkeley, the first of the sets of lectures that form his 1988 book, <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>. He performs there readings of the “war-horse” poems of “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” and the “Intimations Ode.” And he offers his elegantly memorable summation of the work of Romanticism as “the task of bringing the world back, as to life,” which “may, in turn, present itself as the quest for a return to the ordinary, or of it, a new creation of our habitat; or as the quest, away from that, for the creation of a new inhabitation: Wordsworth and Coleridge would represent the former alternative; Blake and Shelley [. . .] the latter” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 52-3).  Cavell interweaves in the Beckman Lectures his reading of British Romanticism with consideration of texts by Emerson and Thoreau, Kant, Heidegger and John Wisdom, alongside references to Wittgenstein and Austin, tracing in these texts parallel and intersecting lines of skepticism and Romanticism. By juxtaposing American and British Romanticism with the linguistic turn in twentieth-century philosophy, Cavell highlights the antecedence of Romanticism, in its self-conscious concern with the status of language, for branches of linguistic philosophy, positioning himself as inheritor of both traditions, interpreter of their quests for the ordinary.</p>
<p>	For his conclusion to the Lectures, Cavell turns beyond the complex of nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts mentioned above to Shakespeare’s late romance, <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>, explaining that “[a]part from any more general indebtedness of the romantics to Shakespeare,” he finds the play “particularly apt in relation to the romantic themes I have emphasized of reawakening or revival” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 76).  Titled “Recounting Gains, Showing Losses,” the essay interprets the protagonist Leontes’ enactment of and recovery from skepticism as a process of disattunement and reattunement with shared criteria of speech that the play allegorizes not only on the level of plot, but by means of a language rich with metaphors of economy and computation.  Positioning his reading at the culmination of the Lectures, Cavell seems to use implicitly the alternative logic of recovery he discerns in Shakespeare’s play to extend his critique in the previous chapter, “Texts of Recovery,” of the defects or, as it were, <emph>defaults</emph> of Romanticism in its efforts at re-animation of the world and recovery of (interest in) the ordinary.</p>
<p>	That critique, presented in broad but deft strokes, consists principally of the charge that Romanticism accepts too readily “something like animism” or what Ruskin terms the “pathetic fallacy” in its efforts at re-animation (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn-1" n="-1">Joshua Wilner also deals with Cavell’s critique of Romantic animism in his essay, “‘Communicating with Objects’: Romanticism, Skepticism, and ‘The Specter of Animism’ in Cavell and Wordsworth” in <title level="m">Stanley Cavell and Literary Studies: Consequences of Skepticism</title>, ed. Richard Eldridge and Bernard Rhie.  Qualifying Cavell’s claims concerning a naïve animism in Wordsworth’s wish to “communicate with objects” in the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, Wilner reads in Wordsworthian lyricism a difference between “communicating <emph>with</emph>” and “communicating <emph>about</emph>” that marks the difference between the power of language to address and the power of language to refer.  Romanticism’s foregrounding of the former, according to Wilner, highlights our inevitable relationship to a language that is never simply ordinary and never quite our own.  </note> This hastiness suggests a “bargain” with the “concept of knowledge and the threat of skepticism”—which Cavell situates specifically in relation to Kant’s division of the claims of knowledge of the world between the subjective and the objective, the sensible and the intelligible (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53). Cavell’s prose evokes, in the articulation of this critique, a hypothetical “philosopher” who “may feel” that Romanticism “gives up the game” too quickly of the claim of reason in enacting its task of recovery (<title level="m">Quest</title> 53). The proverbial “life of the world” Romanticism seeks to bring back would seem to this philosopher to be one in need of a more qualified parsing or accounting.</p>
<p>	In this essay, I would like to follow cues and unravel implications within Cavell’s admittedly broad but richly suggestive critique of Romanticism in the Beckman Lectures in relation to a major Romantic Cavell mentions but does not read closely, namely, Percy Bysshe Shelley, classified above with Blake as one who undertakes a quest <emph>away</emph> from the ordinary for “the creation of a new inhabitation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn0" n="0"> In his essay for this collection, Paul Fry reads the movement <emph>away</emph> from the ordinary in Shelley as the very “moment of crisis turned to advantage from which [his] poetry arises [. . .] Our hope to inhabit another world can only derive from our uncertainty about whether or how we inhabit this one.”  Fry’s subtle ear takes us to—and helps us hear—how Shelley expresses such uncertainty also in the register of a “facetious and self-effacing tone” that comes and goes, for instance, in the Puck-like lines from <title level="m">The Witch of Atlas</title> that lend Fry the title of his essay, “‘A Modest Creed’: Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell.”  Fry’s discernment of an urbane, lighter messianic register in Shelley (and Cavell) opens up lines that I cannot pursue within the parameters of this essay.</note> Cavell has in mind the Shelley whose general mythopoetic, utopian orientation is most evident in texts like <title level="m">The Revolt of Islam</title> and <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, which bear comparison in their high, prophetic register to the Blake of <title level="m">The Four Zoas</title>.  The particular text that I would like to consider in relation to Cavell’s critique of Romanticism is, however, one that constitutes somewhat of an exception or counterpoint to his typical style.  <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title>, subtitled “A Conversation,” is one of the few examples of what might be called an “ordinary language Shelley”: composed in the conversational or “familiar” style, it unfolds in the recognizable, everyday setting of a Venice contemporary to the author, albeit one shadowed by such Gothic elements as the island madhouse and the sepulchral ending.</p>
<p>	The main question I take the poem to be exploring is that of friendship, most obviously, the friendship between the two title characters that forms the substance of the “conversation” the subtitle names.  As Julian recalls late in the poem, the virtue of Maddalo’s “wit and subtle talk” was that it would “make me know myself” (560-61).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> Citations of <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> are by line number from <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, ed. Reiman and Fraistat.  Citations of the Preface to <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> are by page number from the same edition.</note>  He reiterates here the Socratic injunction and justification for conversation between friends as the optimal way of living the examined life.  So who are these friends and interlocutors?  The Preface, written in a different voice than the poem proper (which is narrated by Julian), introduces Count Maddalo as “a Venetian nobleman of antient family and of great fortune” and Julian as “an Englishman of good family” (119).  The rest of the descriptions of the friends focuses on their respective political outlooks: Maddalo is “a person of the most consummate genius, and capable, if he would direct his energies to such an end, of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country.  But it is his weakness to be proud”; while Julian is “passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind, and the immense improvements of which, by the extinction of certain moral superstitions, human society may be yet susceptible” (120). The friends are introduced specifically as well-born men who are potential redeemers and reformers of “human society.”</p>
<p>	Shelley adopts for the poem an urbane style befitting the idiom of the well-born.  As he writes to Leigh Hunt on August 15, 1819, he chooses to employ “a certain familiar style of language to express the actual way in which people talk with each other whom education and a certain refinement of sentiment have placed above the use of vulgar idioms,” noting that he uses “the word <emph>vulgar</emph> in its most extensive sense; the vulgarity of rank and fashion is as gross in its way as that of Poverty, and its cant terms equally expressive of base conceptions, and therefore equally unfit for Poetry” (<title level="m">Letters</title>, II, 108).  While the familiar language that Shelley uses to write the poem in loose couplets is one specific to an educated and refined elite, it differs from the language of the few current in a milieu of rank and fashion.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"> For an important argument on how <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> shows Shelley’s class-based limitations as a political poet, see Kelvin Everest’s “Shelley’s Doubles: An Approach to <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title>,” reprinted in <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, 675-83.

</p>
<p>	The narrator Julian is a foreigner visiting Maddalo in Italy, which he calls at one point “Thou Paradise of exiles!” (57). In reverse of the fall from Eden, he imagines Italy as the site of happy exile from a fallen world: while paradise may be regained for a few, the rest of the world remains unredeemed.  In this paradise, Julian takes pleasure in holding such free-ranging talk with Maddalo as

</lg>
</quote>
         Just as he celebrates the unrestrictedness of their talk, Julian celebrates aspects of the landscape that convey to him a sense of boundlessness.  Describing his ride on the Lido with Maddalo, Julian professes his love for

       In Maddalo’s company, Julian is able to enjoy a solitude beyond the condition of aloneness, a solitude that would be the corollary of genuine community, and to aspire to transcend the finitude of his current condition.  Friendship in “Julian and Maddalo” promises to be for its central consciousness a cure for aloneness and disappointment, a means for the aspiring self to recreate itself as well as to articulate a meliorist vision for the many.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"> Earl Wasserman reads the poem as, moreover, enacting a relationship of friendship with the reader: “its purpose with respect to the reader is the effect that Julian attributes to Maddalo’s companionship: not to dictate a truth or impose a conclusion but, through the unresolved dialectic of friendly controversy, to ‘make me know myself’ (561).”  <title level="m">Shelley: A Critical Reading</title>, 61.</note>
</p>
<p>	Julian’s ideal of friendship would seem to constitute a version of perfectionist friendship, a philosophical theme for which Socrates and his circle serve as cultural model and which is central to Cavell’s thinking of moral perfectionism.  What Shelley portrays in “Julian and Maddalo” is, however, an episode of crisis in Julian’s vision and version of friendship that ends with disappointment and disillusion—the separation of friends, the cessation of conversation, and antagonism towards a world deemed in the final line “cold” (617).  The crisis develops out of a debate between Julian and Maddalo that reaches a climax when Maddalo brings Julian to visit the figure of the Maniac.  Mentioned in the Preface as the third character of the poem, the Maniac is another visitor to this “Paradise of exiles,” who had shared the meliorist hopes of Julian but who has since gone mad.  Julian leaves Venice in the wake of this encounter.  What accounts for his departure—and the seeming forfeit of his quest for the ordinary?  What <emph>inquest </emph>of the ordinary might the poem offer by showing the forfeit of the quest for the ordinary?<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"> Eric Lindstrom alerted me to the pun in Cavell’s title in his “Introduction” to this volume.  Simon Critchley also remarks on it in <title level="m">Very Little [. . .]  Almost Nothing</title>, 139.  Cavell himself comments on the ambiguity in his title thus: “It is this history of devotion to the discovery of false necessity that brought me to the ambiguity of the title I give to these lectures, <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>; to the sense that the ordinary is subject at once to autopsy and to augury, facing at once its end and its anticipation” (<title level="m">Quest</title>, 9).</note>
</p>
<p>	The disagreement between Julian and Maddalo, sketched out already in the Preface, begins in the poem proper when Maddalo checks Julian’s enchanted vision of the Venetian cityscape by pointing to him on their gondola ride home an island with a madhouse and belfry tower. Maddalo comments on this sight as “our mortality” and “the emblem and the sign/ Of what should be eternal and divine!” (120-22) They and others are no different from the madmen who respond passively and automatically to the bell’s call every sunset to vespers. To Maddalo’s attitude of nihilistic resignation, Julian responds the next morning by affirming his secularist faith in the perfectibility of mankind and the possibility of human beings’ liberation of themselves from “religions and old saws” and “chains [. . .] which our spirit bind” (162, 181). An impassioned Julian argues,

<l>Much may be conquered, much may be endured</l>
<l>Of what degrades and crushes us. We know</l>

<l>So taught those kings of old philosophy</l>
<l>Who reigned, before Religion made men blind. (182-89)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         In answer, Maddalo tells Julian of “one like you/ Who to this city came some months ago/ With whom I argued in this sort” (195-97).  This man has now gone mad, and his “wild talk” will, according to Maddalo, show the vanity of “such aspiring theories” (201).  </p>
<p>	As Maddalo’s comparison of the Maniac and Julian insists, the Maniac serves as a precursor or double of Julian in the poem. They share the same meliorist ideas and outlook. Maddalo had talked with and played host to the Maniac before he had talked with and played host to Julian, even outfitting the former’s rooms at the madhouse with “busts and books and urns for flowers, / Which had adorned his life in happier hours, / And instruments of music” (254-56).<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"> Marjorie Levinson has noticed the similarity between the Maniac’s rooms and Julian’s later expressed delight in “books [. . .] / Pictures, and casts from all those statues fair / Which were twin-born with poetry” (554-56), accoutrements associated with Maddalo’s hospitality, in <title level="m">The Romantic Fragment Poem: A Critique of a Form</title>, 161.</note>  Finally, among the features that Julian and the Maniac—and perhaps also Maddalo—share is their propensity for poetry.  Of the Maniac’s speech, Julian remarks, “the wild language of his grief was high, / Such as in measure were called poetry” (541-2). Maddalo pronounces, somewhat sententiously, “Most wretched men / Are cradled into poetry by wrong, / They learn in suffering what they teach in song” (544-46). The bond of affiliation among the three men is also a bond among poets: “In friendships I had been most fortunate, / Yet never saw I one,” recalls Julian of the Maniac, “whom I would call / More willingly my friend” (575-77). Potentially a friend, the Maniac forms an oblique and shadowy third to Julian and Maddalo in Julian’s imagined “Paradise of exiles.”</p>
<p>	By widespread critical consensus, the figures of Julian and Maddalo are taken to be based on Shelley and Byron.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"> See a recent reading of the poem as Shelley’s staging of a conversation between the two poets in Simon Bainbridge’s “‘Other voices speak’: The Poetic Conversations of Shelley and Byron” in <title level="m">A Companion to Romantic Poetry</title>, 197-216.</note>  Before writing <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> in 1819, during a pause in writing Act II of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, Shelley had worked on and abandoned a drama about Torquato Tasso, the sixteenth-century poet of <title level="m">Jerusalem Delivered</title>—and possibly the model for the Maniac.  The relationship of friendship among the characters is specifically an affiliation among poets—in this case, a vanguard fraternity of the few committed to re-imagining the world for the many.  Curiously, while it is compellingly suggested throughout the poem proper that the three characters are poets, the Preface-writer omits mentioning this feature altogether.  Closely echoing Julian’s opinions, the Preface-writer seems to assume likewise the persona of a friend, one who may remark of Julian with loose familiarity that “in spite of his heterodox opinions, [he] is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities” (121). The Preface-writer may gloss over what he may feel should be tacitly supposed and self-evident about this poetic confraternity.</p>
<p>	About the Maniac’s speech, the Preface-writer uses the phrase, “unconnected exclamations of [. . .] agony” (120), for description—a formulation that resonates strikingly with Julian’s speculation, after hearing the speech, about staying on in Venice if “I had been an <emph>unconnected</emph> man” (547, my emphasis).  The Maniac is unconnected, severed from ties with others, and his speech is, correspondingly, unconnected.  It lacks, first of all, consistency and coherence.  As Julian recalls, the Maniac spoke “sometimes as one who wrote and thought / His words might move some heart that heeded not,” “then as one / Reproaching deeds never to be undone”; “then his words came each / Unmodulated, cold, expressionless” (286-92).  Second, this fragmentary speech is unconnected to any actual interlocutors: the Maniac vacillates between soliloquy and imagined addresses principally to an unnamed “Thou” but also to an unnamed “ye few.”  The latter are those “by whom,” he cries, “my nature has been weighed / In friendship” and are, like him, followers of truth (344-45). His assurances to these imagined addressees are reminiscent of Julian’s earlier declarations of political meliorism to Maddalo:</p>
<quote>
<lg>
<l>Believe that I am ever still the same</l>
<l>In creed as in resolve [. . .]  (358-59)</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Nor dream that I will join the vulgar cry,</l>
<l>Or with my silence sanction tyranny [. . .]  (362-63)</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>I am prepared—in truth, with no proud joy—</l>
<l>To do or suffer aught, as when a boy</l>
<l>I did devote to justice and to love [. . .]  (379-81)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
<p>This address to “ye few” is framed by speeches directed to “Thou, my spirit’s mate” (337), a Lady who he claims deserted him and who, Maddalo recounts, had come with the Maniac “from France, and when/ She left him and returned, he wandered then / About yon lonely isles of desart sand / Till he grew wild” (246-49). Maddalo and Julian both speculate that her abandonment was the cause of his derangement. The Maniac gives a fragmentary account of their relationship, now blaming her for her inconstancy, then expressing regret over his own culpability and alluding to a “child” who he wishes would turn out to be “more mild / For both our wretched sakes” (484-86). He evinces, furthermore, a startling horror of sexuality, referring to “[t]he deep pollution of my loathed embrace” (422) and expressing a fantasy of self-castration “so that ne’er / Our hearts had for a moment mingled there / To disunite in horror” (426-28). The Maniac speaks of coital union as the experience, paradoxically, of a horrifying disunion—the experience, one might say, of sexual difference itself, with the diverging consequences and destinies that may unfold for each partner.  Unconnected from the world as lover, as father, and as friend, the Maniac feels radically alone in his abandonment.</p>
<p>	In the wake of the visit to the madhouse, Julian decides to leave Venice for London the next morning. He claims first, though, that “[i]f I had been an unconnected man / I, for this moment, should have formed some plan / Never to leave sweet Venice” (547-49), where he has enjoyed so much Maddalo’s company, which could “make me know myself” (561). He admits then to wanting relief from the impact of the Maniac’s speech, while deliberating, in the contrary direction, that perhaps, with patient study, he could “reclaim him from his dark estate” (574). By deciding to depart, however, he effectively renounces his therapeutic impulse as an “idle thought” (567), a “dream of baseless good” such as “oft come and go in solitude / And leave no trace” (578-80). He puts into question the efficacy of his “aspiring theories.” The conversation with Maddalo is suspended.</p>
<p>	In the coda, Julian recounts returning to Venice after “many years” and “many changes” (584-85). The friends are separated: Maddalo is travelling in Armenia. Julian learns that the Maniac and the Lady are both now dead from Maddalo’s daughter, a hitherto peripheral figure who now acquires the importance of being Julian’s final interlocutor. He had described her as a child as a creature of grace and promise, a “special favourite” (151) whom he holds up to her father as the sign that “we might be all / We dream of” (172-73). As a grown woman, Maddalo’s daughter remains for Julian a vestige of possibility, “a wonder of this earth / Where there is little of transcendent worth, / Like one of Shakespeare’s women” (590-92). Which one? Miranda? Perdita? Paulina?  Or perhaps one more conspiratorial, like Lady Macbeth?<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"> I am grateful to Jonathan Mulrooney for this perturbingly illuminating suggestion.</note>  She tells Julian about the fate of the Maniac, how his health declined, how the Lady returned and left again, summarizing tersely, “They met—they parted” (608), but withholding the account of “<emph>why</emph> they parted, <emph>how</emph> they met” (610), preferring to encrypt the story in silence, “[a]s yon mute marble where their corpses lie” (615).  Upon Julian’s prodding, she tells him the story, but Julian repeats at the end her gesture of withholding.  The poem ends with the lines, “I urged and questioned still, she told me how / All happened—but the cold world shall not know” (616-17).</p>
<p>	Julian’s declaration places the reader among those in the “cold world.” The adjective gives what might seem mere reticence an aspect of hostility.  While the Maniac had cried of abandonment, Julian seems at the end of the poem to be vengeful in his disappointment.  Where the poem had started with a celebration of the possibilities of friendship in a perfectible world, it ends with Julian’s isolation and withdrawal from the ordinary.  Venice is the same, but Maddalo is gone, and the flatly monosyllabic statement, “His dog was dead” (588), succinctly conveys Julian’s sense of disenchantment with the ordinary.  To adapt one of Cavell’s favorite formulations from <title level="m">Walden</title>, the poem moves from morning to mourning.</p>
<p>	Let us return now to Cavell’s critique of Romanticism. As mentioned above, his principal charge is that Romanticism settles too quickly for animism in its efforts at recovering the world, bringing it back, as to life. Another way of putting it, as Cavell does at the end of his reading of “The Ancient Mariner,” is that “a message of Romanticism as such” may be that “there is [. . .] an intimacy at large, and that poetry is responsible for giving it expression” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 65).  In seeking an “intimacy at large,” Romanticism elides, then, conditioned forms of intimacy, notably in “The Ancient Mariner,” the form of the pair or the couple.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"> In <title level="m">Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism</title>, Eric Walker examines marriage—or, in Cavellian terms, <emph>re</emph>marriage—in Wordsworth and Austen as site and activity of mutual, diurnal recognition and the basis of modern identity.  </note>  As Cavell quotes, the Mariner purports to show that “to walk together to the kirk / And all together pray / While each to his great Father bends” (605-7) is far “sweeter than the marriage-feast” (601).  Cavell asks:
         <quote>Why? Even if one ceremony is sweeter than the other, it does not yet follow that they are incompatible, that we must choose between them.  Why is the marriage deserted, that is, why are <emph>all</emph> and <emph>each</emph> found place for while <emph>a pair</emph> or <emph>a couple</emph> are not?  Does God, among all the things he made and loves, not love, or no longer make, marriages?  And shall there be no more marriages?  How does the Mariner’s tale compete with marriage? (<title level="m">Quest</title> 64)</quote>
         In answer, Cavell proposes that the Mariner “takes his tale to compete with the prospect of a marriage, to prefer either aloneness or else society in its totality to the splitting or pairing contracted in marriage” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 64). As it stands, marriage
         <quote>cannot secure the new bonds which must reconstitute a legitimate public, which means overcome our drifts into privacy [. . .] To marry now is to be willing to have a further adventure of aloneness, without solitude but also without society: as if marriage is a further investment of our narcissism [. . .]. If marriage is the name of our only present alternative to the desert-sea of skepticism, then for that very reason this intimacy cannot be celebrated, or sanctified. (<title level="m">Quest</title> 64-5)</quote>
         Romanticism prefers, then, to quest for an “intimacy at large” or to remain “at large” in its quest for intimacy—an inclination that seems to function, in Cavell’s critique, as the very corollary of animism.</p>
<p>	Taking “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” as his representative text, Cavell reads Romanticism as veering between advocating solitude and re-imagining society in its totality as polar options for curing the individual of the aloneness discovered in skepticism.  In so doing, Romanticism elides or defers marriage as structure of intimacy and, in Cavellian moral perfectionism, pre-eminent site of mutual and diurnal education for the aspiring self.  But is this an elision or a deferral?  Cavell’s following remark couches the preference for privacy in temporal terms, as a deferral: “I am not one who takes romanticism as the achievement of major celebrations of privacy, but rather [. . .] as the achievement of the willingness for privacy, the survival of it <emph>until, if ever</emph>, genuine publicness is recognizably established, or reestablished” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 64, my emphasis).  Romanticism, then, may make genuine privacy the priority for the achievement of a genuine publicness, in relation to which marriage or friendship may be merely counterfeit forms of intimacy, further adventures of aloneness and inexpressivity.  This genuine publicness may be one of futurity, a publicness-to-come, or one that returns in re-establishment.  If such genuine publicness is one that needs re-establishment, if the intimacy-at-large Romanticism seeks is one that needs <emph>re</emph>covery, properly speaking, rather than just discovery, then, Cavell asks, “How did it get loose, as if disinvested? And why does friendship demand it, as well as marriage? Or does it?” (<title level="m">Quest </title>65).  The recovery of intimacy within the contexts of friendship and marriage, according to Cavell’s economic simile above, involves a re-investment in the ordinary conceived as a complex network of interests and interconnections.</p>
<p>	Friendship and marriage are, for Cavell, those conditioned forms of intimacy that complicate one’s participation in the life of the many, one’s membership in the all and each. Friendship is an affiliation of the few distinct from the classification of the few according to birth or rank; as a discursive category, it is a relationship conducive to the examined life, in which the individual may aspire, in relation to her interlocutors, to her unattained yet attainable self. Marriage may be viewed as a form of friendship—insofar as marriage is, in modernity, likewise dissociated from legal or religious sanction. Its difference from friendship consists in the singularization of the individual it involves and in its specifically diurnal temporality—its commitment to mutual education in everyday repetition.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> explores friendship as a cure for aloneness and as a relationship essential to the hope for genuine publicness.  It allegorizes friendship in the context of a poetic fraternal vanguard as the means for a transformation of society in its totality.  This allegory is all the more remarkable in light of Shelley’s writing it parallel to <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, a text so notably different in register and in messianic hopefulness.  <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> dramatizes the liberation of mortals by means of the actions of a vanguard of immortals, undertaken in a day of redemption that bursts the continuum of Jupiterian time.  <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> unfolds in three consecutive ordinary days a crisis of friendship that results, years later, in the protagonist’s disappointment in friendship’s transformative potential and his alienation from the “cold world.”</p>
<p>	What kind of inquest does the poem perform in showing Julian’s ultimate forfeit of the quest for recovery?  The poem shows a crisis in friendship and, in the predicament of the Maniac, a crisis of erotic love. If the Maniac is doomed to be an unconnected man whose speech consists of “unconnected exclamations of agony,” Julian himself seems to be likewise unconnected from others besides his friend Maddalo, strangely coupled with Maddalo’s daughter at the end in quasi-conspiratorial secrecy.  Using a counterfactual, he had contemplated staying on in Venice “if I had been an unconnected man.”  The counterfactual here seems oddly descriptive of Julian’s effective situation throughout the poem: his “connections” are alluded to only late in the poem and appear obscure and remote (in that foggy, unhallowed place designated in shorthand as “London”). The formulation also bespeaks an underlying wish to be “unconnected” and a conception of the poetic reformer as lone and simple entity, free to be at large in the quest for genuine publicness.  <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title> attests to the seductive power and the deficit of such a fantasy of the unconditioned subject, disinvested from the conditioned intimacies that constitute one’s life in the world and the life of the world in oneself. </p>
<p>	Cavell’s critique of Romanticism in the Beckman Lectures culminates in a reading of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.  In the course of his analysis of Leontes’ jealous and vengeful actions and recovery, after the passage of sixteen years, from radical skepticism, Cavell discerns a logic of recovery alternative to what he finds in Romanticism.  As he remarks at the end of the essay, “The romantics saw this revenge [against life], as for example, in <title level="m">The Ancient Mariner</title>, as our carrying the death of the world in us, in our constructions of it.  The final scene of issuing in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> shows what it may be to find in oneself the life of the world” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 101).  Cavell reads Leontes’ return to the ordinary as contingent upon his discovery and acceptance of a necessary multiplicity in himself—as husband and lover, as father, as friend—in a world of multiple others and ceaseless multiplication, call it a world of counting, in which to speak is necessarily to count and to recount.  The implication, it seems, is that this multiplicity constitutes “the life of the world” itself.  And the other implication is that Romanticism tends to elide or defer this multiplicity and the conditioned intimacies it entails.</p>
<p>	The critical events of the play occur after Leontes, King of Sicilia, becomes jealous of the relationship between his wife Hermione and his friend and brother Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and suspects them of having an affair.  His suspicion reaches such a degree that he doubts not only whether he has sired the child Hermione is bearing but also whether their six year-old son Mamillius is his.  In his reading, Cavell goes beyond Leontes’ manifest jealousy of Polixenes and Hermione to discern a more fundamental cause of Leontes’ skeptical doubt in his sudden disowning of Mamillius as his issue.  Indeed, Cavell argues that it is Leontes’ doubt over the question of his own paternity that functions as the cause of his jealousy of Polixenes, rather than vice versa.  In seeing Mamillius sitting on his mother’s lap and whispering into his ear “a winter’s tale,” Leontes begins to question, by asking whether their noses resemble one another’s, if Mamillius is indeed his son.  This process of skeptical questioning leads Cavell to discuss possible ways of answering the question, “How do you know?,” on which Leontes’ question (“How do you know your son is yours”) is predicated.</p>
<p>	He brings up first two ways that constitute modes of <emph>telling</emph> how one knows.  First, one may claim to know, in a classic example drawn from Austin’s essay, “Other Minds,” that there is a goldfinch in the garden by noting “some feature of the goldfinch, such as its eye markings or the color of its head”; in this case, “you begin a narrative of the object’s differences from other relevant objects” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 83). Second, you may “explain how you are in a position to know, what your credentials are, or whether someone told you”; in this case, you tell of “differences in your position from other positions” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 83).  In both of these cases, you can tell how you know to anyone <emph>for</emph> anyone.  Telling depends on criteria shared with others, and criteria provide the very conditions of shared speech.</p>
<p>	By speaking of and comparing noses, Leontes appeals to criteria to tell whether or not Mamillius is his son. In rejecting these criteria as insufficient, Leontes expresses a disappointment with criteria and the limits of human knowledge. He resorts to another route of answer to the question of how you know, which consists of “a claim to have experienced the thing [. . .] to have seen it” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 84).  In this case, your claim is a claim to have seen something for yourself and not just for anyone.  This claim does not rest on a knowledge of differences.  Yet Leontes cannot say that he knows in this way; he has not, like Hermione, “experienced the thing” and “seen it for himself.”  Cavell reads this failure of knowledge as a “failure of acknowledgment, which means, whatever else it means, that the result of the failure is not an ignorance but an ignoring, not an opposable doubt but an unappeasable denial” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 88).</p>
<p>	Leontes’ denial is a world-annihilating denial of his attunement with others in shared speech.  This denial, for Cavell, rests on the denial of an even more fundamental way of using language to <emph>tell</emph> than using language to tell differences, one as fundamental as seeing for oneself.  Cavell relies here on his work in Part One of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason </title>on Wittgenstein’s idea of criteria to explain this more fundamental use of language to <emph>count</emph>.  Wittgenstein uses the idea of a criterion, writes Cavell, 
         <quote>to describe, in a sense to explain, how language relates (to) things, how things fall under our concepts, how we individuate things and name, settle on nameables, why we call things as we do—questions of how we determine what <emph>counts</emph> as instances of our concepts, this thing as a table, that as a chair, this other as a human, that other as a god.  To speak is to say what counts. (<title level="m">Quest</title> 86)</quote>
         Counting is a process of determining meaning and has, apart from a numerical use, this specifically criterial, non-numerical use: “it is not here tallying how much or how many, but establishing membership or belonging” (<title level="m">Quest</title>, 86). To speak is to say what counts, to participate in the life of the world by establishing membership or belonging in speech. In his desire to know, Leontes refuses to use language to count and hence loses both the ability to use language to tell differences as well as to tell, as in “recount.” He loses the ability to “account for the order and size and pace of his experiences,” to reorder them in the act of recounting.<note place="foot" resp="editors" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"> In the closing section of his essay for this volume, “Cavell’s Romanticism and the Autobiographical Animal,” Eric Lindstrom offers a rich discussion of the topic of measure—as activity of enumeration and as lyrical and musical ordering—in Cavellian autobiographical practice and Wordsworthian lyrical utterance. </note>
</p>
<p>	Leontes loses his ability to count because, Cavell argues, he <emph>wants not to count</emph>: he wants not to own what is happening to him as his, and wants there to be no counting.  Cavell pays attention to how Shakespeare situates Leontes precisely and ironically in a world of counting, one rife with the language of economy and computation—from the courtiers’ exchange in the prologue, to Polixenes’ opening speech, to the pastoral calculations of the Clown and Autolycus.  Leontes does not count and cannot participate in the life of the world, repudiating telling and counting as conditions of participation, because he wants there to be no separation.  Counting, like separation, implies multiplicity and differentiation.</p>
<p>In keeping with Leontes’ vengeful actions in banishing Hermione and Perdita and accusing Polixenes, Cavell terms Leontes’ very repudiation of counting as “revenge”—and revenge against “life” itself, no less.  Then, what is “life?”</p>
<p>	Life here is breeding, issuing, multiplying, dividing, replicating, separating.  The fact of natality is itself a process of division.  Interrogating why the play proper begins with Polixenes wanting to leave when he does, Cavell proposes: “because Hermione’s filling up and approaching term seems to him to leave no more room and time for him in Sicilia.  It is this, the implication of the fact of her pregnancy, that Polixenes’ speech leaves unsaid; and it is this that Leontes in turn undertakes to deny” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 94).  Brothers become friends, wives mothers, husbands fathers, again and again, each splitting and multiplying.  In accordance with this horror of multiplicity, Leontes wants revenge also against Time, “not because of its threat of mutability, bringing change to present happiness, but for something like the reverse reason, that its change perpetuates the nightmare of the present, its changes, its issuing, the very fact of more time” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 92).</p>
<p>	The final scene of the play presents, for Cavell, its vision of recovery.  The very theatricality of the scene is crucial to Leontes’ return; however convincing of the truth, the oracle had been insufficient to bring Leontes back to life.  Beyond being told something (by the oracle), Leontes needs to be shown something.  Theater or spectacle exceeds here the capacity of telling or narrative.  In making this point, Cavell returns to the distinction he had made earlier between telling, as a mode of determining how one knows, and seeing for oneself, “experiencing the thing.”  </p>
<p>	In his skeptical madness, Leontes expressed his disappointment with criteria and disattunement from speech shared with others, becoming unable to tell or count.  He resorted then to want to claim to experience the thing itself, to see for himself.  One might say that he wanted to be <emph>shown </emph>something while setting himself apart from the world as a world of counting.  What happens in his recovery seems, paradoxically, however, a <emph>showing</emph> to him of his participation in a world of counting, a showing which he does not just see but in which he also functions as participant.  Cavell notes how Paulina enlists a willing Leontes to join her as stage manager or producer of a spectacle in the final scene in which Hermione herself, moving from stasis into life, is the very issue.  More than just stage manager, Leontes participates with Hermione in a process of mutual reawakening, a scene of remarriage as the enactment of mutual education.  Cavell suggests that there takes place for Leontes finally a forgoing of the revenge against life and a forgiving of himself that rests on the acceptance of multiplicity in himself and in others.  The “idea of theater in this theater above all means,” writes Cavell, “that each is part, only part, that no one is everything, that apart from this part that one has, there is never nothing, but always others” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 89).  Counting and recounting involve one’s attunement with shared criteria, but it is theater—the art that confronts us perhaps more than any other with the fact of our multiplicity—that shows us why counting and recounting necessarily structure our speech.  It is in this sense that <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale </title>shows in its final scene “what it may be to find in oneself the life of the world” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 101).</p>
<p>	Sixteen years pass between the beginning and the ending of <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>.  The passage of time is registered in its significance for Leontes only at the end, in his discovery of and participation in a theater of multiplicity and change.  In the last lines of the play, he bids Paulina:
         <quote>
<lg>
<l>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</l>
<l>Each one demand, and answer to his part</l>
<l>Perform’d in this wide gap of time, since first</l>
<l>We were dissever’d.	(5.3.151-55)</l>
</lg>
</quote>
         Insofar as the last two lines may be construed as suggesting the event of natality, the task of each one demanding and answering to his part describes not just a recovery of the last sixteen years but the very activity of life. Since first we were dissever’d, one speaks not just as one but in the roles of daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend, or queen to others who likewise answer to multiple parts. It is precisely because we are answerable to time and division that our answerability to one another takes place necessarily within contexts of speech that are finite but not fixed—in relation to a multiplicity and shifting hierarchy of parts that are likewise finite but not fixed.  At the end of Part One of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>, Cavell speaks of philosophy as “the education of grownups” (<title level="m">Claim</title> 125).  In <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>, he reads Shakespeare’s late romance as an allegory of growing up that entails the acceptance of the finite and countable as conditioning the inhabitation of the ordinary.</p>
<p>	As many as sixteen years may also have passed between Julian’s two visits to Venice narrated in <title level="m">Julian and Maddalo</title>. Julian grows old, with “aged eyes” and “wrinkled cheeks” (611-12), yet it remains a question whether or not he grows up, as it remains a question whether the poem envisions a growing up that is not a growing old. How much irony is there in Shelley’s portrait of the skeptical utopian poet as an older man? Are Julian and the Maniac versions of the Alastor-poet?  And of the one-who-lifted-the-veil-which-those-who-live-call-Life?  Shelley restages again and again inquests of the ordinary that forfeit quests for the ordinary.  Cavell’s perfectionist critique of Romanticism may shed light on this predicament of repeated forfeiture by illuminating the delicate and mobile scaffolding of finite contexts and parts that constitute the ground of the ordinary.  And it may thus lay claim to strains of Romanticism that aspire to the education of grownups, to the mutual creation of subjects who may declare their standing with one another as friends, lovers, and citizens of words. </p>

<head>Austen and Cavell</head>
<byline>

</byline>
<p>	In <title level="m">Emma</title>, Frank Churchill begins life as Frank Weston.  Jane Austen’s brother, Edward Knight, started life as Edward Austen.  Closer to home, Stanley Cavell spent the first two decades of his life as Stanley Goldstein.  In<title level="m"> Little Did I Know</title> (2010), Cavell tells the story of how the late adolescent Stan Goldstein performed “the wish to name myself” in wartime California:
         <quote>Family names were irrelevant to the neither serious nor nonserious encounters that made up the seascape with girls the world had become.  Stan was all that had been called for.  But soon after my inward leave-taking from home [. . .] I introduced myself to a young woman as Stan Cavell.  The first two syllables of the family’s original Russian name Kavelieruskii [. . .] broke away as cleanly as if I had flawlessly cut a diamond. (200)</quote>
         As he navigates this passage with perplexed parents and the legal bureaucracy, Cavell interprets his action as “declaring the search for a life I could want, not merely endure, in America” (202).  He thereby understands it, or offers it to our understanding, as a perfectionist moment or impulse, posing identity on the cusp of the desire for a new life evermore about to be.</p>
<p>	Cavell also unpacks this episode under the sign of adoption, “this adolescent’s way of adopting himself” (203).  This self-representation as an adoptee builds on an earlier moment in the autobiography, where Cavell reports a sense of himself as an “unfound foundling” (179), as an unclaimed stranger.  Cavell thus pinpoints himself on Freud’s map of the family romance, the child for whom identity means inhabiting an adoption fantasy of originating elsewhere, of belonging elsewhere or to someone else.  Because skepticism—the ground bass of Cavell’s work—frames humans as strangers to their own circumstances, adoption offers a template for human identity in which there are no natives, always already at home.  To be human, from this angle, is to experience selfhood as adopted.  In his recent study of transracial adoption, Mark Jerng foregrounds adoption as “the disjunctive act of being taken up into another history and another set of conditions and relationships” (xxi).  In Cavell’s episode, adopting the identity “Stan Cavell” is the outward sign of a corresponding act of estrangement, “my inward leave-taking from home.”  To leave home is to come home to the homeless condition of being human, what Cavell refers to in his primary texts on Romanticism as “our worldlessness or homelessness” (<title level="m">Quest </title>32).  To exchange Stan Goldstein for Stan Cavell is not to trade a false self for a true self, but to embrace the necessary distance between selfhood and absent origin.  Very much like the unsettling ways the marriage settlement circulates in Cavell’s work, adoption beckons in this late autobiographical text as a primary sign of human disjunctiveness and estrangement.</p>
<p>Such a model of the human subject calls out Cavell’s comments on “separation” and “parturition” in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>:  “As if all disseverings are invoked in each; as if to say that life no less than death is a condition and process of dissevering; as if to see each of us ‘demanding and answering to our part’ means seeing ourselves as apart from everything of which we are a part, always already dissevered” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 89).  Explicitly yoked to his readings of exemplary Romantic texts, Cavell’s essay on <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> interprets Shakespeare’s manifold figures of separation and parturition under the sign of marriage, as he reads the final scene “as, among other things, a wedding ceremony” (97):  “Then let us emphasize that this ceremony of union takes the form of a ceremony of separation, thus declaring that the question of two becoming one is just half the problem; the other half is how one becomes two” (100). Here is a way to think about marriage that underwrites Cavell’s resonantly condensed description of marriage as “the mutual acknowledgment of separateness” (178).  Cavell’s reading of the problematic of skepticism in <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> assembles themes of doubt, separation, estrangement, dissevering, and parturition to prepare his ultimate claim that a remarkable idea of marriage is at stake in the ultimate scene.  But to understand the primary stakes of the play to be marriage is to elide the ways in which those same themes of separation foreground questions about parents and children as well as spouses.  My point is that <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> is also a play about adoption, although that term or its cognates never appear in Cavell’s extensive but subordinated attention to the play’s manifold debates about blood issue, bastardy, and the care of children.<note xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" resp="editors" n="1"> For a reading of the play in the context of adoption, see Novy.</note>  Because marriage and adoption are intricately interwoven in this Shakespeare text that preoccupies Cavell, and especially because Cavell has lately troped a transformative moment in his own life history under the sign of adoption, I propose to track the traffic between marriage and adoption in the context of Cavell’s peculiar traffic with the Romantic writer most notoriously preoccupied with marriage, Jane Austen.</p>
<p>After a review of Cavell’s own recent engagements with texts of Austen, I turn to two novels in particular:  <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, which I read as a book about a foundational Cavellian conjugal trope, remarriage, and<title level="m"> Emma</title>, which I read as a book about adoption.<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2"> An earlier version of part of this work was presented as “Austen, Cavell, and the Ordinary” at the 2006 MLA meeting in Philadelphia.  My thanks to William Galperin, who organized and chaired that session for the English Romantic division.</note>  Students of Cavell or Austen will not be surprised that marriage is everywhere at issue in these pages.  What is new is an emphasis on an Austen novel that Cavell nowhere mentions—<title level="m">Persuasion</title>—and my focus on adoption, whereby I argue that marriage and adoption are twinned events where normative patterns of pairing and kinship are first unstitched and then rewoven in the necessarily elusive forms of Cavellian perfectionism.  Especially because Cavell himself—a devoted interpreter of film—has limited his remarks on Austen to the novels alone, I pay particular attention to how a set of Austen films inflect adoption and marriage.<note xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" resp="editors" n="3"> In the Austen commentary in <title level="m">Philosophy</title>, Cavell turns for a paragraph to consider Robert Altman’s <title level="m">Gosford Park</title>, which he specifies as “a brilliant reenactment of the conditions of glamorous joylessness depicted in Austen’s <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>” (126).</note>  A cornerstone of Cavell’s work is the claim that marriage marks the recalcitrant sites where narratives wrestle with skepticism, and I shape this essay to explore what happens when we extend that large claim to include the unsettling settlements of adoption.</p>
<div type="section">
<head>I.  Cavell’s Austen</head>
<p>	Cavell’s Austen emerges belatedly:  “I should confess that I came somewhat late to an unconstrained fascination with Jane Austen” (126).  This 2005 observation, in the title essay of the volume <title level="m">Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</title>, speaks to what for many years seemed a curious gap or a missed opportunity, given Cavell’s long preoccupation with marriage in Shakespeare and in film.  Cavell himself flags the untimely sequence, remarking on “the encouraging pertinence of [Austen] to a further region of the work I do, a pertinence I have not felt prepared to broach previously [. . .]. [Her novels] are clear precursors of the preoccupations of the two genres of film that I have devoted books to—genres I name the Hollywood comedy of remarriage and the melodrama of the unknown woman” (119).  Whereas Blake was a key figure in Cavell’s early invocations of British Romanticism (as in the final sentences of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title>), Austen has become a touchstone in later Cavell.<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">  In addition to the Blake references in <title level="m">Claim</title>, Cavell addresses the place of Blake in his work most directly in the (edited) transcript of “Questions and Answers” appended to the version of the essay “In Quest of the Ordinary” in the Eaves and Fisher volume.  In that Q&amp;A, Cavell confesses that “I feel seduced by Blake as well as threatened by him.  If I ever leave the ordinary for his high prophecies and mythology—I am speaking here of the later Blake—I am not sure that I will ever find my way back” (232).  Cavell’s unwritten work on Blake thus takes up company with his speculation about an unwritten work on the <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>:  “I propose one day—even alerted to the folly in being, or remaining, promising—to write something about this book based on the assumption that it is composed essentially without digression” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 42).</note>  In the 2010 autobiography, for example, Blake is absent from the index, whereas Austen often assumes a very privileged spot in the roster of Cavell’s lifelong intellectual interests, as in this genealogy of “a specific register of the moral life, one I relate to moral perfectionism, a register running, if largely unheralded, throughout Western philosophy and literature, from Plato and Aristotle through Dante and Montaigne and Jane Austen and Emerson and George Eliot and Nietzsche and Mill to Heidegger and Wittgenstein” (259).  At a later moment in the autobiography, Cavell remarks again the special temporality of Austen in his intellectual life:  “I do not understand why it was only after philosophy became identifiable for me that after years of all due respect to them, I fell in love with the writings of Jane Austen and of George Eliot” (460).  </p>
<p>	Cavell’s phrasing of his late return to Austen as “unconstrained fascination” prompts the question of a prior category of constraints, of enforced limits and boundaries.  Something there is in Austen that now speaks powerfully to Cavell of the unsettlingly closeted nature of human experience, which is also signified in the way Cavell then proceeds to foreground “distress” (to be pressed upon, unpleasantly) as defining her writing.  Nearly all of the commentary on Austen appears in the title essay of the 2005 volume, <title level="m">Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</title>, where Cavell pairs Austen with Nietzsche:  “The spiritual distress registered in Nietzsche, and characteristic of his writing, is not inaccurate to something to be felt in Jane Austen’s prose.  You might say that her prose seeks incessantly to minimize (hence maintain) the expression of distress in everyday existence no less drastically than Nietzsche’s seeks to maximize it” (124).<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="editors" n="5"> In <title level="m">Philosophy, </title>Cavell turns to Austen very briefly in one other essay (“Performative and Passionate Utterance”), pinpointing a passage in Austen (an excerpt from the exchange between Emma and Mr. Elton in the carriage ride home from the Christmas dinner at the Westons) as an example of a range of “perlocutionary conditions” that index “a pressure for change” (188-91).  In the “pedagogical letters” in <title level="m">Cities</title> (2004), Cavell invokes the example of Austen in a few instances which are altogether consonant with the remarks in <title level="m">Philosophy</title>.</note>  Cavell works out this unusual pairing with brief comments on three novels, <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, and <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>:
         <quote>What invites novels such as Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, and <title level="m">Emma</title>, together with George Eliot’s <title level="m">Middlemarch</title> and <title level="m">Daniel Deronda</title>, to this discussion is, in contradiction to much of philosophy, their devotion to the life of the everyday, while at the same time they share, in the texture and turn of every scene, their knowledge of, their craving for, a life lived from what Emerson and Nietzsche call the further self, glimpsed from the perspective of what they picture as life’s higher moments—perfectionist moments.  The lives depicted can seem, from a philosophical perspective, too confined or aloof to provide moral inspiration or instruction for a rough world. The experience of the novels is, for many, for me, otherwise. (122)<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="editors" n="6"> Cavell’s all-too-brief unpacking of Austen in the context of perfectionism is to my mind usefully consonant with William Galperin’s detailed account of the dynamics of the “possibilistic” in Austen.</note>
</quote>
         The proposition that Austen’s novels strike many as offering images of human lives that can appear “too confined” lines up with Cavell’s subsequent observation that one of the features of Austen’s fiction that long kept him at arm’s length was “Austen’s narrator’s renowned surface of containment” (124).  Constraint, confinement, containment, distress:  these are the clouded headings under which Cavell organizes his reading in Austen (and Nietzsche, Emerson, and Eliot) of the “unrelieved routine or fixation of ordinariness” (122), which yields a “state of vulnerable conformity,” a human condition that suffers, in Cavell’s most extreme formulation, “brutalities” (123).</p>
<p>	No sunny Austen, this.  I return to Cavell again and again in no small measure for his consummate skill as a close reader.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="foot" resp="editors" n="7"> It is not too far from the mark to claim that I owe a book to Cavell’s close reading of a single stanza late in “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” when he foregrounds the Ancient Mariner’s wish “to go together to the kirk” in the company of “all” and “each”—the many and the one—which language elides the couple, the human pair (<title level="m">Quest</title> 63-64).</note>  In one of the handful of such exercises Cavell offers from <title level="m">Emma</title>, he zooms in on a sentence—indeed, a phrase—from the opening chapter, and it strikes me as no accident that this is a scene in which Austen herself upends convention by pitching a wedding as a funeral, as an occasion of distress, of vulnerability.  As Emma and her father grieve the passing of Miss Taylor into Mrs. Weston, the narrator remarks that this is a moment when “Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance” (I.1.4). Here is Cavell’s gloss:
         <quote>I find that I am unsure whether this meditation means that she is vexed not to have her friend to continue their happy mode of existence; or whether it suggests that she is so grief-stricken that she cannot imagine wanting her own existence to continue; or whether, as mostly seems to me the case, that Emma herself cannot tell the difference. (124)</quote>
         If I ever paused previously at the phrase “mournful thought of any continuance,” I understood it as a jab at the unlikely prospect that Emma’s thoughts of any kind (even grief) might exhibit duration.  But I had certainly never before understood this moment as Emma entirely halted in her tracks, where “continuance” itself is substantively at stake.  Lest a reader object that Cavell is overreading “continuance,” here is a sentence from the final chapter of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>.  Edward Ferrars, previously cut off by his mother, is gingerly returning to life:  “In spite of being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his present engagement” (III.14.423).  Whereas “continuance” is explicitly at stake in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (in both comic and serious registers, as typical in Austen), the fine tuning of Cavell’s ear catches (indeed, brings to our attention) the radical vulnerability of Emma’s new form of confinement and distress.</p>
<p>	As Cavell underscores, the wedding that falls on the Woodhouse home like a funeral pitches the stakes of this marriage novel extraordinarily high from the outset.  Recalling his reading of “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” two decades earlier, Cavell unpacks <title level="m">Emma</title> in its opening moments as a narrative poised to unfold, among other possibilities, as what he calls an antithalamion, although he doesn’t put the term into play on this occasion (<title level="m">Quest</title> 65).  Cavell is not taken in by Emma’s bluff throughout Volume One that she can exist without marriage, that she can continue her life perfectly well as a single woman and a daughter, a sister, a friend.  Compulsory conjugality is not so readily taken off the table under the Hegelian dispensation, wherein marriage is “life in its totality” (Hegel 161).<note xml:id="ftn8" place="foot" resp="editors" n="8"> On Hegelian marriage, see Walker, <title level="m">Marriage</title>, 30-32, 42-43.</note>  But instead of the normative epithalamic form in which the culture continues to package and repackage Austen the commodity, the novel Jane Austen wrote opens by foregrounding the dire constraints and confinements of marriage, as if marriage were, in Adam Phillips’s formulation (quoted below in its entirety), a threat instead of a promise (Phillips 98).  </p>
<p>	These bad consequences include the risk run by Emma, in a few additional words of Austen's spotlighted by Cavell, to be “in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude” (qtd. in <title level="m">Philosophy</title> 125).  In his reading of Austen, Cavell tags the distressing forms of “vulnerable conformity” with multiple figures of limits, boundaries, and enclosures.  Those figures also line up with a complementary set of figures of solitude, isolation, separation, and unshareability.  Cavell juxtaposes his foregrounded image of Emma Woodhouse at risk with Elizabeth Bennet, focused in a reply Elizabeth makes to Darcy early in <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, when Darcy has challenged the narrowness (the confinements and constraints) of her social circle:  “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever” (I.9.47).  Cavell’s gloss:
         <quote>Now to see something new for ever in the singular persons within an unvarying society—to see, let’s say, from the heightened perspective of an over-morning—is an accurate description of what a writer such as Jane Austen has learned to provide for the world.  But this implication of a certain genius reflected in Elizabeth at the same time serves more threateningly to seal her isolation (or loneliness), to show her consciousness to risk being unshareable. (128)</quote>
         To be sealed up or sealed off is to suffer the distress of enclosure and constraint, now figured additionally as solitary confinement, as isolation.  In these brief comments on Elizabeth Bennet and Emma Woodhouse, Cavell points to the “danger” they everywhere confront in plots busy with the task of “confronting everyday life with itself” (123), as the “perfectionist path exacts the cost of a great separation” (129).  The “certain genius reflected in Elizabeth” is Austen herself, and Cavell thus signals that, like many, he reads these two (distressed and vulnerable) heroines as surrogate figures.  But unlike the constructions of the Janeite herd, this Austen is no fantasy figure, no light, bright, and sparkling adornment.  To locate these characters’ struggles with confinement and the risk of unshareable solitude in the authorial subject is to construct Austen herself as enclosed and closeted.</p>
<p>	Cavell’s closeted Austen strikes me as offering an alternative to the most complex construction of Austen in such terms, the picture limned by D. A. Miller.<note xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">  Miller, D., <title level="m">Style</title>; “Attitude.”  Cavell’s most extensive set of remarks on the closet is the “Postscript” in <title level="m">Contesting Tears</title>, in which he responds to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s reading of “The Beast in the Jungle” in <title level="m">Epistemology of the Closet</title> with “an alternative interpretation of closeting” (181).  One of the reasons I rue Cavell’s silence on <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> is the missed opportunity to put such a reading in conversation with Sedgwick’s influential “Masturbating Girl” essay and D. A. Miller’s reading of Robert Ferrars and “unheterosexuality” (<title level="m">Style</title> 16); I gesture toward Sedgwick’s essay at the end of this essay, in comments on an image from the 2007 film of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>.</note>  Both understand Austen’s own identity to be crucially at stake in the fiction.  But a key difference between Cavell and Miller comes into focus in how they approach <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, the third of the three Austen texts Cavell attends to.  In Cavell’s account, Fanny Price joins Emma and Elizabeth in an imperiled trio when he turns briefly to consider slavery in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, “the most lurid of the compromises with an imperfect (to say the least) society shown in Austen’s six major novels” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 126).  Emphasizing the “economy of horror sustaining the main house of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>” (127), Cavell understands Fanny Price under the sign of “Nietzschean convalescence,” a character by design “imperfectly fit for the world as it is because in preparation for a further constitution” (126).  Miller, on the other hand, corrals Emma and Elizabeth not with Fanny but with Mary Crawford, in the agon of the unrepresentable authorial subject and her surrogate “stylothetes”:  “Though Austen’s typical heroines—Elizabeth Bennet, Mary Crawford, Emma Woodhouse—are all stylists, we are ceaselessly directed to observe the excesses, the failures, even the evils in their performance of style, as though the stylothete were a queen bee who would tolerate no rivals” (<title level="m">Style</title> 42).  Cavell understands Emma, Elizabeth, and Fanny as watchful observers rather than high-wire performers.  When, following Miller, the motive quest of Austen’s career is enclosed absolutely in the distressed constraints of the (closed) biography, the confinements painfully manifest in Fanny become an unprofitable dead end, especially when Mary Crawford beckons with her “saucy, playful smile” (III.16.531).  But to understand Fanny with Cavell as undergoing “convalescence” aims a narrative arc at recovery, however difficult or remote.</p>
<p>In a late section of <title level="m">Monogamy</title>, a set of aphoristic mini-essays about marriage, Adam Phillips poses conjugality not in its positive Hegelian form—to marry is to be born again—but in its negative form, as threat:  not to marry is to court death, in two ways: 
         <quote>The opposite of monogamy is not just promiscuity, but the absence or the impossibility of relationship itself.  Indeed, one reason monogamy is so important to us is that we are so terrorised by what we imagine are the alternatives to it.  The other person we fear most is the one who does not believe in the universal sacredness of—usually heterosexual—coupledom.  As homophobia, xenophobia, all the phobias tell us:  if we don’t choose monogamy our fate will be isolation or the chaos of impersonality.  A threat, that is to say, not a promise.  Abandonment and exclusion, or getting too mixed up with, and by, other people.  In unguarded circulation, or stranded.  In other words, we do not know whether we want monogamy, but we do know that we fear excess:  an excess of solitude and an excess of company.  (98)</quote>
<title level="m">Monogamy </title>throughout frames the Cavellian couple who are willing to gamble on a perfectionist quest that is fraught all the way down, navigating again and again the uncertain daily passages between the terrors of the only other ways to try to be human: alone or lost in a crowd.  Cavell pinpoints such perils, such distress, in the worlds of Emma Woodhouse, Elizabeth Bennet, and Fanny Price, constrained and confined, risking isolation, separation, and solitude.  </p>

<div type="section">
<head>II.  <title level="m">Persuasion</title> and (Re)marriage</head>
<p>	A hallmark of Cavell’s work on marriage is that there is no such thing as marriage:  there is only remarriage, day after day.  Here is Cavell’s 1985 summary of his concept of “remarriage,” in the wake of his book-length readings of the idea in Hollywood films and Shakespeare:  “The central idea is that the validity or bond of marriage is no longer assured or legitimized by church or state or sexual compatibility or children but by something I call the willingness for remarriage, a way of continuing to affirm the happiness of one’s initial leap, as if the chance of happiness exists only when it seconds itself” (“Capra” 3).  Although the word “remarriage” was available in her culture’s lexicon, Austen never uses the term, but she does address this Cavellian inflection of marriage by means of the phrases “first attachment” and “second attachment.”  These terms gesture in Austen toward a post-Romantic understanding of marriage as a mode of what Kierkegaard calls repetition and what Cavell invites us to think of as the problem and challenge of the ordinary.  In temporal terms, whereas “marriage” traditionally bids to be a lifetime milestone (even if, as now, undertaken in serial instances), Cavellian “remarriage” is a quotidian marker, occurring day after day.</p>
<p>	The two novels in which Austen explicitly takes up the question of second attachments are <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> and <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, ironically the two major novels about which Cavell is silent.<note xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" resp="editors" n="10"> Some material in this section is adapted from my more detailed reading of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as a Cavellian text in <title level="m">Marriage</title>.</note>  In these foregrounded instances of literal second marriages, Austen directs attention to a pressure that everywhere bears upon marriage; as Cavell puts the case, in another context, “the world must be regained every day, in repetition, regained as gone” (<title level="m">Quest </title>172).  In <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, Austen rigs an elaborate joke at Marianne Dashwood’s expense.  Marianne, a devoted romantic, claims that there is no such thing as a second attachment, which elicits her sister Elinor’s wry account of the theory, in a conversation with Colonel Brandon:  “How she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not” (I.11.66).  Because Elinor and Marianne are children of the second marriage, the joke is at Marianne Dashwood’s expense:  if she is right and second attachments are “impossible to exist” (I.11.66), Marianne herself is an existential impossibility.  From Cavell’s point of view, she has it just backwards—not only are second attachments possible, but they are all there is.  Marianne Dashwood is a Cavellian heroine <emph>manqué</emph>.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">Persuasion</title> everywhere recasts the question of marriage as the question of remarriage.  Of Anne Elliot, the narrator early in the novel observes, “No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them” (I.4.30-31).  The sentence brims with Cavellian markers:  the “small limits” of Anne’s world (the confinement, constraint, and containment that distress Emma, Elizabeth, and Fanny); Anne’s “fastidiousness” and “nice tone of mind” (a certain genius reflected in Anne); and the quest evermore for always elusive perfectionist “cure” (Cavellian “recovery”).<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">	 This is Austen’s only use in her fiction of the phrase “small limits,” which in the writing of her time is far less frequent than the widespread “narrow limits” (which Austen never employs).</note>  A remarkably large number of characters in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> are on the far side of attachment:  Anne Elliot has loved and lost; Sir Walter Elliot is a widower; Lady Russell is a widow; Captain Wentworth has loved and lost; William Elliot is a widower; Mrs. Smith is a widow; Mrs. Clay has returned, mysteriously, “from an unprosperous marriage” (I.2.17); Captain Benwick, unluckily, has even been widowed before marriage.  When in Volume Two Anne Elliot heads for Bath, she does not make a new friend but busies herself “renewing” an old friendship, with the crippled Mrs. Smith.  The language describing this rehabilitated friendship emphasizes repetition:  “The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled” (II.5.166).  Having renewed, reestablished, and rekindled their friendship, Anne then revisits Mrs. Smith:  “In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne’s astonishment increased” (II.5.167).  In the world of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, there are always only second attachments.  </p>
<p>	Although Cavell’s chief interest in Austen is the way in which her novels render the obstacles to and the risks of the perfectionist quest, he also remarks what he calls “the elation of her novel’s [sic] conclusions” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 126).  Andrew Miller makes a similar claim at the close of his Cavellian-inflected reading of how Austen’s novels “amplify” narratively the tension between a perfectionist dynamic (through free indirect discourse, we are invited to sympathize with characters who just might be able to accomplish change) and a counter-measure that he calls the “optative” (these characters are locked in a past before which we as readers of an objective narrative are helpless).  Miller points to the conclusion of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> as an exemplary instance of how an Austen text points toward a release from the constraints that everywhere define it, remarking “the redemptive exhilaration I find under the otherwise leaden skies of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>:  its suggestion that our past can be changed or its effects, at any rate, undone, even as Anne is allowed to undo her past, her refusal of Wentworth, and elicit a second proposal” (135).  Cavell and Miller offer a different model for how to read the endings of Austen’s novels:  not as the conventionally epithalamic endorsements of normative heterosexual coupling they are so easily taken to be, but as markers of risky, elusive possibilities grounded in a model of the human pair that continues to bear the burdens of distress, a “mutual acknowledgement of separateness” (<title level="m">Quest </title>178). Because Miller and Cavell similarly testify to how an Austen novel, both in spite of and because of its burdens, can achieve at its end “elation” or “exhilaration,” and because Miller quite rightly (in my judgment) tethers this accomplishment to <title level="m">Persuasion</title> in particular and its constitutive structure of Cavellian secondariness, I want to turn to a privileged Cavellian form and inspect how two recent films adapt the very puzzling final paragraphs of the novel.</p>
<p>	One of the abiding oddities of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is the opaque ending, where it is altogether unclear where the (re)married Wentworth pair will settle down—or perhaps only come to a pause, again and again?  (Austen typically does not leave the settlement spot unsettled in the other novels, regardless of their many celebrated exit ironies—what we might call the Pemberley effect demanded of her endings.)  The only glancing reference to such a generic close in the final paragraphs of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is the casual observation that Anne’s old friend Mrs. Smith was “their earliest visitor in their settled life” (II.12.274), a phrase which begs more questions than it answers:  settled where?  And in what sense “settled”?  What’s missing, of course, is an estate name, the force of which formulaic detail is to lock down the couple in a fixed system, a dynamic at odds with an inflection of marriage as remarriage, as reengaged and reinvented, a renewed creation day after day.</p>
<p>	The stakes of such endings come into useful focus in two very different film adaptations of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, the 2007 ITV production directed by Adrian Shergold and the 1995 BBC production directed by Roger Michell.  The 2007 Shergold <title level="m">Persuasion</title> offers an arrestingly fumbled re-reading of the conclusion.  Wentworth takes a blindfolded Anne (not a good sign) to her new married home, which is—impossibly—the Elliot ancestral home, Kellynch Hall, and the film’s final image is their wedded dance in the forecourt of the (mysteriously) recovered family estate.<note xml:id="ftn12" place="foot" resp="editors" n="12"> At the end of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, in terms of property transfer, nothing has changed:  William Elliot will inherit Kellynch.  Kellynch as a wedding present from Wentworth to Anne is pure fantasy.</note>  Instead of remarriage, the film foregrounds a refinanced property.  The unmoving house looms large over the dancing couple who twirl in embrace about a fixed spot, and the carriage which has conveyed them there, mobile, is now parked irrelevantly to the side.</p>

</figure>
<p>In contrast, the conclusion of the 1995 Michell <title level="m">Persuasion</title> locates the Wentworth couple on board a ship, which is as smart a guess as any concerning their “settled life”—if a guess is required.  This image of a seafaring couple is also consonant with another key structure in the novel, the unconventional Croft marriage as an ideal for the Wentworth pair: the Croft marriage, much of which has been spent at sea, is chronically on the move.  This (re)married couple gaze not at one another (nor do they twirl in embrace about a fixed spot), but they gaze, separately, in different directions.  The rigging upon which they lean  picks up one of Austen’s navy jokes in the novel (“the little knot of the navy”), for it is the notable skill of this branch of the military—Austen’s favorite branch, as a loyal sibling—to tie knots, and this remarriage knot is tied in new ways that open upon new futures, possible and perfectionist.<note xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" resp="editors" n="13"> In Volume Two, when Anne Elliot sees Admiral and Mrs. Croft on the streets of Bath, she notices them “occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy” (II.6.183).</note>

<p>This image of Anne and Wentworth on deck, which I read as a Cavellian inflection of the married pair, is not the film’s ultimate shot, however, and the final image pulls back from the (re)married couple to offer a long view of the full-rigged ship, which now replaces the landed estate as a new mobile form of the fixed settlement spot.</p>

</figure>
<p>The risk of this narrative strategy is to freeze the ship’s motion at anchor in an apparently new settlement system, but a system that offers distinction without difference.  A prevailing understanding of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is that the Croft and Wentworth marriages refigure in a postwar mode of emergent bourgeois professionalism the residual landed virtues of Pemberley.  Marriage and virtue, once fixed, are now free to wander.  But I want to suggest that Austen shapes <title level="m">Persuasion</title> to contest the epithalamic mandate on several fronts.  To substitute mobility for fixity as the foundation of marriage is to continue to insist upon an unshifting foundation.  To understand the Wentworth marriage as a postwar Pemberley-to-go is to continue to credit the centripetal force of the marriage refuge.  In its elaborate counterpoint of motion and stasis, <title level="m">Persuasion</title> the novel instead works toward a style of marriage writing that inclines marriage toward remarriage, attachment toward reattachment, over and over, day after day, sentence after sentence. It unsettles the marriage settlement.  The 1995 Michell film at its end verges upon this Cavellian dynamic of the novel, before pulling back and away. The ending of a different film, the 2009 BBC <title level="m">Emma</title>, approaches more closely a perfectionist Cavellian period.</p>

<head>III.  <title level="m">Emma</title>, Adoption, and Marriage</head>
<p>	The 2009 BBC <title level="m">Emma</title>, directed by Jim O’Hanlon from a screenplay by Sandy Welch, is a remarkable adaptation in any number of ways, but especially in its framing moments, at opening and close.  Instead of launching the film in lockstep with the novel (the aftershocks at Hartfield of the marriage of Miss Taylor to Mr. Weston, which registers on Emma and Mr. Woodhouse as a funeral—those moments that Cavell finds so telling), O’Hanlon foregrounds in his opening images a set of very different and very dark events from the novel’s various backstories:  the death of Emma’s mother, the death of the first Mrs. Weston, and the death of Jane Fairfax’s mother.  At the other end of the film, O’Hanlon again plays fast and loose with one of the novel’s most famous structures, the supremely self-contained world of Highbury.  In the film, the spatial surround of the Emma Woodhouse-George Knightley marriage settlement is not tethered to the intensely local question of whether the couple will live at Donwell Abbey or at Hartfield, as in the novel.  Instead, O’Hanlon closes by taking the married couple on the road on their wedding trip to the sea, breaking the celebrated narrative frame that is Highbury.  I propose that both of these framing revisions adapt <title level="m">Emma</title> as a narrative with noteworthy Cavellian inflections, pointing toward a human world in which adoption and marriage are isomorphic forms available, however elusively, to the perfectionist quest. </p>
<p>	I have elsewhere argued that <title level="m">Emma</title> is usefully read as a novel about adoption.<note xml:id="ftn14" place="foot" resp="editors" n="14">  I presented a paper on Austen and adoption at the “New Directions in Austen Studies” conference at Chawton in the summer of 2009; the new BBC <title level="m">Emma</title> was first broadcast on UK television in the fall of 2009 (and in the US early in 2010).  That Chawton paper is now published online (Walker, “Place”).</note>  Three of the main characters—Frank Churchill, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith—are untethered from their birth families, and this unusual surplus gives redundancy signifying force:  surrogate families rival consanguineous sets in the world of this novel.  The contingencies of adoptive families run unsettlingly counter to the constraints of the closed systems of blood kinship that underwrite identity and power in manifold ways in Austen’s world.<note xml:id="ftn15" place="foot" resp="editors" n="15">  For an account of how gay adoption functions to contest the model of the nuclear family, see Elfenbein and Watkins:  “Rather than trying to model ourselves on the nuclear family, we hope to foster an alternative to its traditional linkage between biology, heterocentrism, and nationalism” (310).</note>  Bastards (Harriet Smith), orphans (Jane Fairfax), and semi-orphans (Frank Churchill) line up as a disruptive adoptive set with other creatures on the margins of Highbury: old maids (Miss Bates), widows (Mrs. Bates), governesses (Miss Taylor), yeoman farmers (Robert Martin), and threatening bands of gypsies.  Although all three adoptive narratives in <title level="m">Emma</title> take their origins in deaths (Frank and Jane) or the mysterious shadows of illegitimacy (Harriet Smith), these haunted plots also mark spaces where new futures might be imagined in perfectionist glimpses.  In short, I want to line up adoption in <title level="m">Emma</title> with how Cavell as autobiographer understands his decision to change his own name as a form of adoption, as a “search for a life I could want.”</p>
<p>	The O’Hanlon <title level="m">Emma</title> narrates these three opening moments as scenes of separation and parturition, as leavetakings from home.  Instead of a wedding that falls upon Hartfield as a funeral, the film opens with the death of Emma’s mother.  The young Emma Woodhouse is posed beside her mother’s coffin:</p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="4">

</figure>
<p>Fast on the heels of this foundational sorrow, the film cuts to the first image of adoption.  Mr. Weston is at the bedside of his dead wife, and their son Frank is at the door with his aunt, Mrs. Churchill (the sister-in-law of Mrs. Weston), who will now, in the language of the novel, “take the whole charge of” Frank (I.2.14), who grows up not as Frank Weston but as Frank Churchill.  </p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="5">

<title level="m">Emma,</title> screenplay by Sandy Welch, directed by Jim O’Hanlon, BBC 2009.  Near the opening of the film; Mr. Weston at the deathbed of (the first) Mrs. Weston, Frank’s mother; Frank Weston at the door with his aunt, Mrs. Churchill.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Instead of foregrounding this tale of adoption, the novel offers it as backstory information in the second chapter, and the episode in the novel is also geographically distant from Highbury:  the young Mr. Weston is serving in the military in Yorkshire when he marries a Miss Churchill, and Yorkshire is where Frank grows up at his new adoptive home, Enscombe, the Churchill family seat.<note xml:id="ftn16" place="foot" resp="editors" n="16"> It is significant that Mrs. Churchill, who famously jerks Frank around throughout the novel, is not his blood relative (Mr. Churchill is instead the biological brother of Frank’s birth mother).  Although Frank’s adoption is a kinship transfer (like the transformation of Austen’s brother Edward from Austen to Knight), the <title level="m">Emma</title> narrative does not claim blood as definitive of family.  For adoption in the period, see Walker (“Place”). </note>  But the O’Hanlon film locates the adoption episode in Highbury itself, and these narrative rearrangements work to yoke more directly than does the novel the fates of two young citizens of Highbury who have both lost their mothers.  The effect of this pairing is to locate under the sign of adoption the marriage plot that will soon entangle both these characters.  As Frank Weston disappears into the carriage in which he exits Highbury to take up his new identity as Frank Churchill, the camera frames his face staring through a rain-drenched back window at his tearful father bidding him farewell, Frank’s hand raised to steady himself as the carriage lurches forward and to reach back toward the brief opening chapter of his life that has already closed, an echo of the young Emma’s hand on her mother’s coffin.</p>

</figure>
<p>Immediately following the death of Emma’s mother and the death of Frank Churchill’s mother, the O’Hanlon film turns to foreground a third piece of the novel’s backstory, the death of Jane Fairfax’s mother.  The novel delays this narrative background until much later, the second chapter of Volume Two, when Colonel Campbell makes the offer “of undertaking the whole charge of her education” (II.2.175), which translates into a <emph>de facto</emph> adoption of Jane from her Highbury kin, Miss Bates (her aunt) and Mrs. Bates (her grandmother).  Once again we see the adoptive child conveyed away from Highbury in a carriage, and Frank Weston and Jane Fairfax are now joined visually by the occasions and modes of their leave-takings.  </p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="7">

</figure>
<p>As the marriage plot driving the narrative enlarges its net to include Jane, the O’Hanlon film continues to signpost the first stirrings of that plot with scenes of adoption, a primary means whereby Austen’s culture manages parental deaths and the care of children. There is no better anchor in the novel itself for these cinematic rearrangments than that early phrase descriptive of Emma that catches Cavell’s attention, “mournful thought of any continuance” (I.1.4).  For these children, the future itself is immediately and grimly at stake:  after such deaths, what continuance?  The contingencies of adoptive identity—not only its dire necessities but also its fragile possibilities—will fall upon them a second time as adults in the contingencies of marriage.</p>
<p>	At the other end of the film, O’Hanlon offers another dramatic departure from the book’s narrative template.  <title level="m">Emma</title> the novel is by design an experiment in how Austen’s famous narrative boundaries, “3 or 4 Families in a Country  Village” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 275), can help a plot achieve escape velocity precisely to the extent that those boundaries are sharply drawn and unbroken, reflecting what Cavell calls their “surface of containment.”  <title level="m">Emma</title> begins and ends in Highbury and takes its being therein.  The famous final phrase, “the perfect happiness of the union” (III.19.528), brings the marriage plot to its perfected close and simultaneously snaps the gate shut on the small world that is Highbury, by which paradoxical means the novel becomes an available world.  O’Hanlon breaks this frame and takes the film on the road in its closing shots, following Emma and Knightley on a wedding trip to the sea.<note xml:id="ftn17" place="foot" resp="editors" n="17">	 The textual anchor for the wedding trip to the sea is a sentence several paragraphs before the conclusion:  “They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the sea-side, which was the plan” (III.19.527).  The O’Hanlon film foreshadows the trip to the sea with several invented conversations about young Emma’s ignorance that such a thing exists, with a heavy-handed debt to Emma Thompson’s screenplay for Margaret Dashwood in the early scenes of the Ang Lee <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>.</note>  I was startled at first viewing because the narrative costs on this score are so high, but I now view these images as abundant recompense, especially as they open the film into the contingent Cavellian territory of perfectionist possibilities.</p>
<p>	Post-Highbury, Emma and Knightley in the film are first framed together in a carriage.  In terms of both the novel and the film, this image most readily invites understanding as a triumphant revision of Emma’s vexed carriage ride with Mr. Elton at the close of Volume One.</p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="8">

</figure>
<p>But in O’Hanlon’s full cinematic setting, the image also stretches back to the carriages that convey Frank Weston and Jane Fairfax to their adoptive futures, lining up adoption and marriage as twinned vessels of the perfectionist quest, as both forms wrestle to free themselves from necessity in order to face the fearful risks of contingency.</p>
<p>	Freed from the carriage, the next image offers Emma and Knightley, backs to the camera, hand in hand, walking over the downs toward the sea.  </p>

</figure>
<p>I return to Cavell for a gloss on this image.  Several years after the publication of his major work on “comedies of remarriage,” <title level="m">Pursuits of Happiness</title> (1981), Cavell published a short essay, “A Capra Moment,” returning to one of the exemplary films in that book, Frank Capra’s <title level="m">It Happened One Night</title>, but on this occasion singling out a “moment whose apparent commonplaces and evanescence found no place in my long and difficult chapter on the film” (3).  That “moment” is, simply, this:  “a man and a woman are walking away from us down an empty country road” (3).  Cavell then reads this Capra moment as a compound of four key markers, “away from us / together / walking / on the road,” which together compose, for Cavell, a “wedding photo,” with the special inflections by which Cavell understands (re)marriage:  “the centered walk away down the road [. . .] does also feel like something is ending, hence like something is beginning, some border being crossed.  It is this undefined openness, as if leaving the past behind them, that marks this particular inflection of vulnerability, of thoughtful anticipation” (5).  I find these dynamics reproduced in O’Hanlon’s penultimate image of Emma and Knightley, moving away from us, together, walking, on the road.  The “particular inflection of vulnerability” in the film at large is the vulnerability not only of the risk known as marriage but also the risk known as adoption.</p>
<p>	Before turning to the final image in O’Hanlon’s <title level="m">Emma</title>, I want to contrast another late image in a recent film of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> in order to foreground the ways in which the ultimate <title level="m">Emma</title> image smartly refigures signposts of the marriage empire.  In the 2007 BBC adaptation of <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, the director John Alexander and screenwriter Andrew Davies pose Elinor Dashwood alone by the sea, seated on a bench, with her back to the viewer.  </p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="10">

<figDesc>
<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, screenplay by Andrew Davies, directed by John Alexander.  BBC 2007.  Late in the film; Elinor Dashwood by the sea at Barton, after Marianne’s recovery and before Edward’s revelatory arrival.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>This image is staged after the return to Barton, after Marianne’s recovery but before Edward Ferrars arrives to stumble toward marriage.  Elinor is seated on the bench ever so slightly off center, inviting the thought of what absent other might fill an empty spot close beside her in a composition of balanced symmetry.  Post-Sedgwick, reading the vectors of desire in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> can never again fixate on heterosexual marriage as sole available telos.  Like Elinor herself in the image, Elinor’s desire, autocentric and allocentric, faces elsewhere, elusively.  And were she standing there alone, the scene would be a wrap, on these notes.  But she is not entirely alone, and that’s my point:  there is the bench to account for.  Unremarkably, the bench marks the grounded and settled spot where the marriage empire summons identity to take seated place, with room for one other.<note xml:id="ftn18" place="foot" resp="editors" n="18">The <title level="m">OED</title> primary definition of “bench” repeats Johnson’s primary sense:  a bench differs from a “stool,” which holds only one person.</note>  Unremarkably, a bench also marks widely and deeply in the language the weight of communal and judicial authority, signifying here the foundational regime of coupledom that arranges the solitary Elinor in a position that demands a paired companion.  Edward Ferrars will soon fill that spot, although the final paragraph of the novel has great sport with the thought that Marianne and Brandon crowd their way on the bench as well.</p>
<p>	To close O’Hanlon’s <title level="m">Emma</title>, Knightly and Emma, walking away from the viewer, clear the dunes and arrive, like Elinor, by the sea. The final image is a long shot from behind of the pair gazing out over the coast.  </p>
<figure rend="noThumb" n="11">

<title level="m">Emma</title>, screenplay by Sandy Welch, directed by Jim O’Hanlon, BBC 2009.  The final image; Emma and Knightley, backs to the camera, gaze out over the sea.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>It is a place manifestly not without vulnerability, without risk—those cliffs!—but the scene is simultaneously suffused with the calm of the (momentarily) untroubled expanse of water.  As in the image in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title>, the bench on the right marks the fixed settlement spot, but in this image it is, remarkably, empty.  The faint track across the field to that bench confirms the power of the marriage empire, but the image also offers, disruptively, vanished traffic and an empty destination. The human pair to the left are set apart from that authoritative anchor, not seated of necessity (or by birth) in the old order but standing together in a shared difference, gazing away from the viewer into an unwritten future.  In a different context, Cavell will define their attitude as “the mutual acknowledgement of separateness” (<title level="m">Quest </title>178).  In <title level="m">Emma</title>—the novel and especially the O’Hanlon film—separateness is a characteristic of the human condition that is located under the sign of adoptive identity.  The novel and the film offer a human world in which adoption and marriage are isomorphic forms suffered by and available to, however elusively, the perfectionist quest.  I take that thought as license to superimpose a different narrative on this final image:  to the right, we see a fixed place benchmarked for someone named by others Stanley Goldstein.  To the left, standing aside, there is a place for someone who names himself, adoptively, Stan Cavell.  It is the human fate of both the California ephebe and the Regency couple—adopted, (re)married—to remain apart from everything of which they are a part.</p>

<p> I begin with an acknowledgment of gratitude to Eric Lindstrom not simply for
               providing generous and illuminating comments on earlier drafts but for imagining an
               essay worthier than the one here presented. At the start of his own “Austen and
               Austin” Lindstrom juxtaposes the story of Jane Austen’s short-lived engagement to
               Harris Bigg-Wither—in which she gave her consent one day and retracted it the
               next—with J.L. Austin’s off-hand comment from <title level="m">Sense and
                  Sensibilia</title>: “There’s the bit where you say it and the bit where you take
               it back” (qtd. in Lindstrom 501). However indirectly, the following essay has been
               written as an extended meditation on the brilliance of this juxtaposition, which
               helps de-dramatize a consent no sooner given than withdrawn, where the consent and
               its withdrawal constitute a single, finished non-drama, and not an invitation for
               further courtship.</p>
<p>"The verb needs modifying," is the lesson of Austin's "excuses"—their tenor "is that
               I did it but only <emph>in a way</emph>, not just flatly like that" (“A Plea for
               Excuses” 187).<note xml:id="ftn1" place="foot" resp="editors" n="1"> All further
                  citations from Austin refer to <title level="m">How to Do Things with
                     Words</title>.</note> Excuses do not deny or cancel a given action: they modify
               it, and potentially endlessly, as one might glean both from Austin's own many
               discriminations and from the multiple near synonyms—mitigate, extenuate, temper,
               etc.—for "alter[ation] in the direction of mildness or moderation"
               (<emph>OED</emph>). By contrast, third-person accounts of Austen's broken engagement
               (such as Deirdre Le Faye's, cited by Lindstrom) perhaps necessarily tend to retain
               something of the novelist's own flatness and model a different kind of tact:
               explanation for why Cassandra and Jane had to be fetched from the Bigg household
               sooner than expected may eventually be given, but none for the withdrawn consent.
               Somewhere between the rich insufficiency of the interminably proliferating Austinian
               excuse and the minimal sufficiency of unapologetic Austenian report lies the
               dialectic that this essay hopes to explore: on the one hand, the strangely generative
               powers of retraction-through-verbalizing modification; on the other, the even
               stranger generosity of another mode of recession that declines even to assume the
               work of articulation.</p>
<ab rend="center">****</ab>
<p>My first engagement with Cavell’s work concerned his tendency to identify
               “romanticism” with what he calls the “process of secularization,” whereby finite
               individuals are asked to play “God” to one another by verifying and bearing witness
               to one another’s separate existences. In this early work Cavell’s originality lies in
               reconverting into the passive voice a crisis of knowledge commonly expressed in the
               active: skepticism about other minds turns out to be a drama not of insufficient or
               unreliable or as yet imperfect levels of knowing but of too much being known—a tragedy that ensues when the skeptic refuses to allow himself to be found out by the other to be, like her, mortal and separate, and attempts to convert into a reparable “intellectual lack” the irreparable “metaphysical finitude” the other has already revealed in and for him.  From the start, then, Cavell implies that what seems the
               harder role—the active <emph>task</emph> of making oneself known—may be an evasion of
               the passive <emph>role</emph> of allowing oneself to be known.</p>
<p>In <title level="m">Open Secrets</title> I argued that “romanticism” so defined—as
               the last, unfinished act of a drama called “secularization”—puts humans in the
               position of playing impossible roles for one another—my allowing myself to be known,
               your playing God to know me—each rife with heroic temptations toward “absolute
               activeness” and “absolute passiveness”: the Protestant emphasis on a law of the heart
               means that it is now up to me to determine what is asked of me, while what
               constitutes the acknowledgment of this unsummoned gift remains in turn equally
               unspecified (Cavell, <title level="m">Claim</title> 470).<note xml:id="ftn2" place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">See François 212-217. </note> Such schematic
               stagings of something called “romanticism” or “secularization”—as a drama of
               revelation and abandonment that could never (and indeed need never) have happened to
               particular individuals—betray Cavell’s own preference for dramatic genres, a
               preference itself readable in terms of a Romantic desire to give dramatic form to
               human history.<note xml:id="ftn3" place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">For Cavell’s
                  indebtedness to Romanticism’s post-Kantian, necessarily failed project of giving
                  aesthetic form to what can have no form—the freedom that Kant had saved for humans
                  only by declaring impossible to intuit empirically—see the lecture “Unworking

               incredulous readers itself replays at the metalevel the difficulty of believing in
               acknowledgment as a decisive action.</p>
<p>For again, as I argued in <title level="m">Open Secrets</title>, if for Cavell the
               “humanization” of acknowledgment places “infinite demands upon finite resources”
                  (<title level="m">Claim</title> 470), then assuming the burden of the power to
               confirm one another’s self image means, in large measure, renouncing these demands,
               as my acknowledgment of your capacity to sustain “infinite interest” inevitably
               shades into a sense of how little this can do for you (361). If we accept Cavell's
               account of the skeptic’s doubt as indicating not cognitive uncertainty but the
               disavowal of having already been found to be a mortal among other mortals,
               acknowledgment constitutes an advance on knowledge, but not in the sense of the
               discovery of a new and decisive piece of evidence, rather in that of a change in
               attitude—an adjustment whereby the questioner may simply stop questioning and let go
               not so much of the possibility of certainty as of a fantasy about what achieving
               certainty might mean.<note xml:id="ftn4" place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">See, for
                  example, Cavell’s summary of his previous arguments at the start of <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary,</title> in which he addresses those who
                  have misread him as giving up on the philosophical project and advocating
                  acknowledgment as some kind of leap of faith beyond the limits of human knowledge:
                  “I do not propose the idea of acknowledging as an alternative to knowing but
                  rather as an interpretation of it” (8). </note> Acknowledgment in this sense can
               look more like relinquishment than resolution, but because he wants to preserve the
               distinction from cognitive advance, Cavell perhaps too strongly insists on
               “acknowledgment” as above all an expressive act, even if at other points he concedes
               that this attitudinal relaxation of the skeptic’s demand for proof may never in fact
               take definitive expression. Compare, for example, the following passages: <quote>
<p rend="noCount">Acknowledgment “goes beyond” knowledge, not in the order, or as
                     a feat, of cognition, but in the call upon me to express the knowledge at its
                     core, to recognize what I know, to do something in the light of it, apart from
                     which this knowledge remains without expression, hence perhaps without
                     possession (<title level="m">Claim</title> 428).</p>
<p rend="noCount">If my attitude towards him expresses my knowledge that he has a
                     soul, my attitude may nevertheless not be very definitely expressed, nor very
                     readily. It may take ages; it may be expressed now in the way I live[. . .]. The
                     word “attitude” can be misleading here. It is not, in the matters at hand, a
                     disposition I can adopt at will. It will be helpful to take the English word in
                     its physical sense, as an inflection of myself toward others, an orientation
                     which affects everything and which I may or may not be interested in
                     discovering about myself. (360)</p>
</quote> Such divergent passages bear witness to the difficulty of reconciling
               Cavell’s heroic investment in “acknowledgment” as the duty and burden of secular
               individuals, with the figures of “decline,” “lapse,” and “concession” by which one
               signals one’s disappointed acceptance of the other’s finite and fallible knowledge of
                  oneself.<note xml:id="ftn5" place="foot" resp="editors" n="5"> Underscoring the
                  redundancy of a phrase such as “mutual acknowledgment of separateness,” Eric
                  Walker indirectly points to this link between concession or retraction and
                  acknowledgment as an assertion or finding whose object is always
                  negative—something one does not want or is disappointed to find—so that
                  acknowledgment may be assertive as an expressive act but recessive as a
                  propositional statement: “‘acknowledgment,’ as I understand it, carries with it a
                  sense of the inescapable persistence of the separate self: to acknowledge in
                  Cavell’s lexicon, to respond to the disappointment of knowledge of the world and
                  of other minds, is to be by definition separate, both from the world and from
                  other minds” (<title level="m">Marriage, Writing, and Romanticism: Wordsworth and
                     Austen After War</title> 43). </note>
</p>
<p>When proposing this essay I’d originally promised to explore these tensions as they
               inform Cavell’s more recent work, where the ambiguous call for some kind of
               demonstrative, expressive act or sign acknowledging the unreliability of signs
               reappears, and where what was once the “secularizing process” is redescribed as the
               double project of meeting the demand for intelligibility while giving up on the
               fantasy of perfect expression. Here in terms that sound less “romantic” or
               post-secular than Habermasian, Cavell warns us that if we do not accommodate the
               imperative of expression to ordinary language, we are “stopped short in the
               obligation to make our desires, hence our actions, intelligible and hampered in our
               demand and right to be found intelligible in those desires and actions, to ask
               residence in the shared realm of reason” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 188).
               But as often happens with the promises one makes in an abstract and their somewhat
               inconsequent realizations, in the course of reading essays from Cavell’s <title level="m">Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow</title>, my thoughts took a slightly
               different turn toward Cavell’s longstanding interest in marriage, and more
               particularly, in marriage as a daily or diurnal event—an event that, as Eric Walker
               also argues, Cavell frequently defines as essentially incapable of definitive
               achievement because it consists of the precarious sustaining (or not) of a
               conversation over time, one felicitous instance of which can never absolutely
               guarantee the dawn of another. Indeed “felicity” here, in direct contrast to the
               sense in which J. L. Austin uses the word to measure the successful performative, may
               be predicated on continued uncertainty as to whether full, exact communication has
               actually and finally occurred, whether the invitation to exchange has been accepted
               or rebuked. Thus, according to Cavell, in both the Hollywood remarriage comedies and
               melodramatic refusals of marriage discussed in his earlier <title level="m">Pursuits
                  of Happiness</title> and <title level="m">Contesting Tears</title>, <quote>nothing
                  legitimizes or ratifies marriage—not state, or church, or sex, or gender, or
                  children—apart from the willingness for reaffirmation, which is to say, for
                  remarriage [. . .] and what makes marriage worth reaffirming is a diurnal devotedness
                  that involves friendship, play, surprise, and mutual education, all manifested in
                  the pair’s mode of conversing with each other (not just in words). (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 121-22) </quote> In an earlier chapter in <title level="m">Philosophy</title> he cites Benjamin’s enigmatic claim from the essay on
                  <title level="m">Elective Affinities</title> that “marriage is never justified in
               law (that is, as an institution) but is justified solely as an expression of
               continuance in love, which by nature seeks this expression sooner in death than in
               life” (qtd. in <title level="m">Philosophy</title> 86-87). Cavell offers the
               following parenthetical gloss: “perhaps Benjamin means this as a smack at a Romantic
               suggestion that it is easier to love eternally than diurnally” (87). </p>
<p>Now, of course, marriage so conceived—as a never conclusively achieved diurnal
               continuance—works in tension with marriage as pronounced by law, whether civic or
               religious. Marriage in this latter sense constitutes perhaps the most famous example
               of Austin’s illocutionary performatives—speech acts supposed to occur once and for
               all and whose felicity is determinable according to clearly established conventions:
               I can’t be uncertain as to whether I’ve been married in the eyes of the law in the
               same way that I can doubt what counts as the renewal of the vows the next day and
               then the next. Although Cavell never quite explicitly says so, this potential
               disjuncture between the closure to progressive, iterative tenses of the Austinian
               performative “I do” and his conception of marriage as a kind of shorthand for the
               ongoing and difficultly evinceable project of acknowledgment more or less maps onto
               the comparison he makes in the chapter “Performative and Passionate Utterance”
               between illocutionary acts, where the doing lies in the saying (I do, I give and
               bequeath, I bet, I christen, etc.), and perlocutionary ones, where something
               happens—some strong emotional effect is released, whether inadvertently or
               intentionally—by virtue of the saying but where the doing and the saying don’t
               usually line up with the same first-person form: to take Cavell’s examples, to say “I
               seduce you” is no guarantee that I do, or an utterance may be extremely embarrassing
               or painful but not necessarily because its utterer says, “I now embarrass you, I now
               injure you” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 178).<note xml:id="ftn6" place="foot" resp="editors" n="6"> Here as everywhere in Cavell communicativeness
                  is not a matter of imparting information but of exercising a capacity for
                  projecting and anticipating the expectable but never fully calculable response of
                  one’s listener, as the speaker “makes herself intelligible” only by imagining,
                  doubtless never quite precisely, her words as they will be heard by her
                  interlocutor: “if I could not rationally expect, by variously expressing myself to
                  you, to have the effect of alarming you or reassuring you, of offending or amusing
                  you, boring or interesting you, exasperating or fascinating you, [. . .] I would
                  lack the capacity to make myself intelligible to you. And what you would lack is
                  not some information I might impart to you” (172). </note>
</p>
<p>For both Austin and Cavell, perlocutionary speech acts differ from illocutionary ones
               in that with them “there is no accepted conventional procedure and effect. The
               speaker is on his own to create the desired effect” (180). In this respect, the
               “perlocutionary” belongs to the realm of the “secular” as Cavell uses the term to
               designate the sense of not knowing what the rules are, of having to make them up as
               one goes along, as if being finite or mortal were also being subject and subjecting
               oneself to potentially endless interpretation. Hence, if “a performative utterance is
               an offer of participation in the order of law,” then, “a passionate utterance is an
               invitation to <emph>improvisation</emph> in the disorders of desire” (185, emphasis
               added). And just as the appropriate agents cannot be determined beforehand, knowing
               when the speech drama is at an end is nearly impossible, since, unlike the
               definitiveness with which in Austin’s examples one may refuse to recognize a
               challenge or an offer of marriage and this is the end to the matter, “in the realm of
               the perlocutionary, refusal may become part of the performance” (183). Thus to cite
               again the line I took for another epigraph, “there is no end to the things that
               happen to people” (175). Yet in the midst of thus emphasizing the unstoppable and
               uncontrollable proliferation of responses that in turn elicit further responses,
               Cavell introduces an example of a line that he reads as exceptionally
               end-stopped—Carmen’s “No. You do not love me”—a response that listeners and
               performers alike usually hear as an invitation for Don José to contradict her but
               that Cavell takes as a mere constative: <quote>Every critic I have read on the
                  subject takes Carmen at that moment of refusal to be further seducing Don José,
                  ridiculing his sense of honor, enticing him to come with her into the life of
                  freedom from law. But the written score (it is not always performed so) marks her
                  line pianississimo (triple piano). She is at that moment, as I perceive her,
                  paradoxically, and as far as humanly possible, expressionless, without
                  implication, utters with no expression a pure constative, the simplest of truths,
                  that he does not love her. She stares blankly at the truth and is bewildered. The
                  unprecedented event, finding no love where she has commanded and returned love,
                  causes her to issue a flurry of invitations and taunts to cover her bewilderment,
                  confused and confusing gestures to which this man, in her eyes, has, within the
                  space of a song, a song she rejects, become irrelevant; she denies that it is she
                  who has been singled out in his song. That much has ended in her. But how will it
                  end between them, who will have the last word? Who does have the last word? (184)
               </quote> Under such conditions, there seems to be no choice but to rely on the
               “other”—the conversational partner or interlocutor to fill in the blanks—to finish
               off the unsaid, to read past the silences. We can see the appeal as well as treachery
               of this paradigm in which we are called upon to be active readers, readers capable of
               weighing the partial meanings with which a certain silence may be filled. The good
               “other” or marriage partner would be the one who helps us to expressiveness, and for
               an instance of this happy partnership, Cavell turns to Jane Austen’s <title level="m">Emma</title> at the end of the chapter. Most difficult to imagine, however, would
               be the interlocutor capable of assenting to the finality of Carmen’s constative.</p>
<p>I will come to Austen myself momentarily, but for now by way of further exploring the
               impossibility of a statement such as “I persuade you,” I want to make a brief detour
               through perhaps the most operatic writer of third-person fiction, Stendhal. Cavell's 
               “Performative and Passionate Utterance” begins as a critique of Austin’s relative
               neglect of perlocutionary effects as symptomatic of his unease before the messiness
               of human passions, but the idea that “perlocutionary acts make room for, and reward,
               imagination and virtuosity, unequally distributed capacities among the species” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 173)
               might be part of what gave pause to the advocate of “plain saying,” since it evokes
               the familiar topos of the indeterminably elect—an aristocracy of the imagination
               whose special powers would be differently called into play by passionate utterances
               than by “illocutionary acts” where no such questions arise: “I do not, except in
               special circumstances, wonder how I might make a promise or a gift, or apologize, or
               render a verdict,” whereas persuading, consoling, confusing, and seducing you “may
               take talent” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 173). Stendhal’s 1827 novel <title level="m">Armance </title>offers a
               remarkable example not so much of the difficulty of persuasion per se as of the
               non-relation, or the unpredictability of relation, between effort and success.
               Stendhal’s young hero struggles to persuade his cousin of his indifference to the
               wealth into which he has recently come and which will enable him to marry well; after
               days of wondering how to defend himself against her accusation of his worldliness, an
               accusation she has, of course, never expressly addressed to him, he finally settles on
               this: <quote>

</quote> Oddly juxtaposing past, present, and future, Octave’s proposal is hit upon
               in the past tense but offered—tendered—to the future of Armance’s reception, as if
               his speaking had not yet begun; irreducible to the irony of using speech to
               circumvent the unreliability of speech, his words amount to a surprisingly uncynical
               assumption of the disjuncture between intention and effect—a recognition that, while
               the content of his speech may be as good as empty, what happens while he is speaking
               isn’t. From the histrionic demand for action and not mere words as proof of a
               resolution to sacrifice, he falls back on the very vanity of these “mere” words, as
               if in inversion of Hippolytus’s “my tongue swore to, but my heart did not”;
               abandoning his attempt to persuade her, he gives in, with his impossible invitation
               that she “see in his eyes if he is lying,” not to a naive faith in the truth of
               physical presence, but to her powers to do something other than listen (while he

                  the inward performance above all else (9-10). Cavell returns to the line and to

               already been effective in persuading her by its very desperation (of adequate means):

                     of deserving her forgiveness. </p>
</quote> This same structure of a discourse
               whose emptiness or vanity at the level of content in no way determines its
               decisiveness or seriousness, and indeed whose status as mere babble in fact
               facilitates its import, will later define Armance’s discovery that Octave loves her
               (before he knows this himself) as he speaks to her about another woman whom he has
               been pretending to pursue in public: <quote>
<p rend="noCount">Il y avait dans
                     l’accent profond et presque attendri avec lequel Octave disait ces vaines
                     paroles, une si grande impossibilité d’aimer les grâces un peu hasardées de la
                     jolie femme dont il parlait, et un dévouement si passioné pour l’amie à
                     laquelle il se confiait, qu’elle n’eut pas le courage de résister au bonheur de
                     se voir aimée ainsi [. . .] Tout ce que sa prudence pouvait obtenir d’elle,
                     c’était de ne pas parler; le son de sa voix eût fait connaître à son cousin
                     toute la passion qu’il inspirait. (108)</p>
<p rend="noCount">There was in the deep and almost softened accent with which

                     a devotion for the friend to whom he was confiding himself, that she did not
                     have the courage to resist the happiness of seeing herself thus loved [. . .] All
                     her prudence could obtain from her, was not to speak; the sound of her voice

</quote> Nothing, in a sense, could be further from the renewed commitment to
               ordinary language with which Cavell ends his essay, citing again Austin’s caution,
               “Accuracy and morality alike are on the side of the plain saying that our word is our
               bond” (<title level="m">Philosophy</title> 191), and for the remainder of this essay I will follow Cavell in turning to
               the more familiar psychological realism of Jane Austen’s fiction, whose characters
               (with the possible exception of the diffident Fanny Price) show a different
               (although, I would argue, not greater) faith in the possibility of communication than
               Stendhal’s histrionically hermetic heroes do. Yet, in the end, the directness with which point-blank
               declaration occurs for Octave and Armance in and through, as well as after, so many
               rounds of deferral, disguise, mutual deceit, and self-deception in the end does not so
               much differ from Cavell’s own movement of return to the ordinary through the
               passionate, charted in this essay and elsewhere in his work. The heady combination of
               directness and indirection, of trenchant circumlocution and perfected error
               characteristic of Stendhal’s prose, derives in large part, of course, from the flat
               definitiveness with which his third-person narration reports his protagonists’
               attempts to obfuscate and delay the crisis of mutual encounter and revelation such
               that every sentence performs the conclusion the characters would postpone. It is
               tempting in this context to cite again Cavell’s claim that the “book of philosophy”
               that Thoreau would find “suitable” to students “would be written with next to no
               forward motion” because it would “culminate in each sentence” (<title level="m">Quest</title> 18).<note xml:id="ftn9" place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">Cavell concludes this speculation by suggesting that such prose would know
                  nothing of poetic enjambment or the continuance of thought from one line to the
                  next, which may explain why when paraphrasing this passage Critchley adds or
                  elaborates that we would “find no reason to continue reading from one sentence to
                  the next” (124). According to Critchley, Cavell praises writing that “knows when
                  to stop,” because such knowledge “opens a certain relation to finitude” (124). Yet
                  the irony of these multiple rephrasings of a sentence that would need no other—an
                  ideal supposed to be Thoreau’s even if it does not exist on his printed
                  page—suggests that the thought of the thought that would require no further
                  thought itself cannot come to term, whatever Critchley’s worries about Cavell’s
                  temptation to short circuit “the vertiginous forward motion without destination”
                  of Schlegelian irony. There is perhaps no sharper instantiation of the difficulty
                  of telling the “inertia” of the finished sentence from this “vertigo” than the
                  staccato of Stendhal’s prose. </note> How might third-person narration effect such
               singular stopping points? With this question in mind, I now return to Carmen’s “last
               word” and its possible equivalents in Austen’s prose.</p>
<p> Indeed what if, instead of awaiting rescue from a patient Mr. Knightley, we were to
               introduce into this conversational paradigm, premised as it is on a model of language
               as communication between a sender and a receiver, the innovation for which Austen is
               perhaps most well known in the history of the English novel: free indirect style in
               which no one speaks?<note xml:id="ftn10" place="foot" resp="editors" n="10">For the
                  argument that no one speaks, see Banfield; for the extensive literature on Austen
                  and free indirect style, see as well, among others, Cohn; Ferguson; Finch and
                  Bowen; Andrew Miller, “Perfectly Helpless”; and D.A. Miller, <title level="m">Jane
                     Austen, or the Secret of Style</title>. </note> For this particular mode of
               narration frees protagonists from the burden that Cavell takes as the mark of secular
               individuals—that of making themselves known and accepting to be known by one another.
               In Cavell’s model, it is the good, discerning interlocutor—the rather preachy Mr.
               Knightley—who is capable of bestowing acknowledgment and simultaneously forgiving the
               heroine for her double failure with respect to adequate expression: her inability not
               to express herself all the time and her failure to express herself as she would
                  like.<note xml:id="ftn11" place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">Cavell gives the last
                  word to Knightley’s exclamation to the woman he can now sincerely and truthfully
                  call “his” Emma: “My Emma, does not everything serve to prove more and more the
                  beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?” (<title level="m">Emma</title> 486; quoted in <title level="m">Philosophy </title>191).
                  But he thereby passes over an irony that Austen’s wry narration does not let
                  pass—namely that Emma at this point is still withholding from her future husband
                  her role in unwittingly redirecting Harriet Smith’s attentions toward him: “Emma
                  agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s account, which she
                  could not give any sincere explanation of.” </note> But I want to suggest that
               Austen’s novels—and third person narration in general—also afford another kind of
               forgiveness for the failure to arrive at fully articulate, transparent expression.
               Elsewhere I have described how free indirect style frees characters first from the
               work of speaking for themselves, giving accounts, and making themselves legible to
               others that constitutes the right and duty of Habermasian individuals, and then from
               the no less onerous burden of having to signal “deep” or unfathomable emotion.
               Cavell’s relative neglect of third-person narrative modes, which his late turn toward
               Jane Austen’s fiction makes all the more noticeable, belongs to his investments in
               dialogical, dramatic forms, investments themselves indicative of his commitment to
               self-expression as the measure of having assumed the burden of the other’s separate
               existence. Yet this neglect seems all the stranger in light of his claims for the
               ordinariness of desires that may remain without expression, or rather his ambivalence
               toward the “Rousseauian” or “Romantic” myth that I am essentially unknowable,
               incommunicable to others, and his wish <emph>not</emph> to exaggerate the gulf between the mystery
               of inchoate private experience and the formal articulations required of public life.
               If the double, contradictory injunction to invest the self with secret proprietary
               value and make it publicly accountable ends up faulting thoughts for not “ris[ing] to
               the level of the expressible” (Ferguson 167; François 14), no such negative judgments
               attend the experiences rendered by free indirect style—mental states no less achieved
               for not being said aloud by one speaker to another—because their realization is not
               predicated on their being claimed, voiced, and communicated.</p>
<p>In other words, the silent agency of narration may do for a character what the
               musical notation “pianississimo” in Bizet’s opera does for Carmen, or
               indeed what Cavell’s speculative interpretation of what is happening within her at
               that moment does, which is not so much to supply the unspoken words as to explain the
               sufficiency of what she does utter. Transpose his “She stares blankly at the truth
               and is bewildered” to the past tense and it acquires the easy weight of a novelistic
               truth we would not hesitate to credit—a “pure constative” in its own right. The
               interchangeability of “pure” and “mere” and “simple” in such cases points to the
               sometimes but not always problematically unassuming character of the constative as a
               statement both beneath and beyond contestation. To take an example worlds apart from
               <title level="m">Carmen</title>, Austen’s sentence describing the situation of Fanny Price abandoned if only
               temporarily on her bench as the others wander Sotherton’s grounds together—“she
               seemed to have the little wood all to herself” (<title level="m">Mansfield
                  Park</title> 117)—repeats at the level of form the passing by or minimal notice of
               which Fanny is the object; or rather it transposes the other characters’ potentially
               ill-willed neglect into a kind of benign negligence. Fanny’s self-consciousness of
               herself as abandoned is registered as the illusion of possessing the little wood;
               something or someone in the sentence smiles wryly at this illusion, whether this
               smile belongs to Austen or Fanny herself does not really matter. </p>
<p>Simultaneously unhesitating and unforthcoming, frankly assertive and closed to
               further elaboration, third-person psycho-narration promises to suspend the
               multiplying cascade-effect of perlocutionary utterances and bring to a term the
               potentially endless spiral of rejected rejections, inconclusive farewells, fallings
               silent, and resumed “no”s. This, of course, sounds a lot like the ideological use
               often attributed to impersonal narration—that of offering a measured mode of
               disclosure, a cool middle way between the sense of ourselves as utterly opaque and
               utterly exposed to one another. The long-standing association of free-floating,
               impersonal narrative agency with the similarly invisible divinity of textual
               monotheism, or the equally bodiless “voice” of ideological discourse, would also seem
               to cast the disclosure of unspoken thoughts made possible by free indirect style as a
               regression from the scene of secular judgment that so interests Cavell—a falsely safe
               retreat, then, from the loneliness and uncertainty of having to discern the other’s
               meaning on one’s own. Yet I hope in the readings that remain to suggest otherwise by
               distinguishing the kinds of resting-places precariously achieved from the false
               comfort of the illusion of total transparency and by emphasizing the sense of
               heightened proximity to unretractable error and incorrigible blindness. For Andrew
               Miller, who also addresses the relevance of the effects particular to Austen’s
               narrative style and Cavell’s project of acknowledgment, the “conversation” between
               her two narrative techniques—objective narration and free indirect
               discourse—simultaneously provokes our desire to complete a character’s near but
               fatally flawed self-understanding and leaves us powerless to do so (72). Miller shows
               remarkably little anger toward the double push and pull by which, he claims, Austen’s
               narration simultaneously goads and halts us, because he reads it through the lens of
               Cavellian perfectionism as an invitation for us both to wake up to the gap between
               ideal and actual self and <emph>not</emph> to experience this gap as a cause for despair (80-82),
               as if by helping us to a renewed sense of our helplessness Austen were rewriting in
               less stark terms Kant’s famous formulation of the predicament of human
               reason—solicited to attempt something it knows it cannot achieve.<note xml:id="ftn12" place="foot" resp="editors" n="12">Cf. the famous opening, also cited by Joshua
                  Wilner in his “Afterword” to this collection, of Kant’s <title level="m">Critique
                     of Pure Reason</title>: “Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is
                  called upon to consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented
                  by its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of
                  mind” (xvii). </note> On this reading the erring human subject who reads and is
               read by Austen’s perfectly finished sentences cannot avail herself of their
               achievement, but where Miller assumes a subject who will always therefore try harder,
               I take the appeal of a “prose [that] never needs help but is unfailingly up to its
               aims” (71), as an invitation, in the other direction, to give up trying and happily
               resign oneself to the ready help of more capable hands. </p>
<p>“Edmund, you do not know <title level="m">me</title>” (<title level="m">Mansfield
                  Park</title> 492)—Fanny exclaims to herself of her future husband, quickly
               dispensing of the illusion of marriage as an exercise in mutual knowability through
               witty or cutting repartée of the kind that Cavell idealizes. What would it mean to
               reimagine marriage as something occurring between novelist/narrator and protagonist
               rather than, according to heteronormative assumptions, between hero and heroine? What
               reparative work can we assign to the gently mocking maternal narrative voice who does
               the work of acknowledging Fanny’s bad faith and by the same gesture forgives or
               excuses it? In the following passage, for example, Austen’s judgment on Fanny as a
               moralizing prude doubles that of Fanny upon herself as hypocrite, but the one seems
               to cancel the other out, yielding in the place of moral heaviness, a sense of
               exhilarated exculpation (the “them” in question are Mary and Edmund whom Fanny is not
               displeased to see quarreling at her first ball): <quote>Fanny, not able to refrain
                  entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied. It was
                  barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet some happiness must and would
                  arise, from the very conviction, that he did suffer. (324)</quote> The middle
               sentence, which appears to belong more clearly to Fanny’s consciousness than the
               last, whose concluding and abstracting insight may or may not be hers, uses strongly
               moralizing language—“barbarous”—to condemn what it also presents as a mere temporal
               coincidence. The following sentence goes further in asserting an invidious causal
               connection between her happiness and Edmund’s suffering, but withdraws the moral
               condemnation. Yet it is not so easy to parcel out what here belongs to the subject of
               the happiness (Fanny) and what to its ironic reporter (whom we call Austen for
               shorthand). For if the impersonal, agentless construction—“it was barbarous”—and the
               use, specific to written language, of the auxiliary verbs “must” and “would” to refer
               to an indefinite happening in time, rather than an imperative or hypothetical
               condition, indicate narrative detachment from the character’s subjective experience,
               they also register this character’s own tendency toward queenly, self-absolving,
               analytic cool. If Fanny were to have written to some confidante, “It was barbarous
               [of me] to be happy when Edmund was suffering,” she might have been told she was
               sentimentally over-estimating her guilt but she could as easily have been taken as
               wittily and urbanely yoking moral hyperbole to the obviously unperturbed,
               deflationary “it was.” As it is, Fanny must accept to be happy, and to find her
               happiness where she does, at however tainted a source, exercising a kind of
               non-punitive self-knowledge in doing so without too loud a protest.<note xml:id="ftn13" place="foot" resp="editors" n="13">See François 226. This unwilling
                  opportunism will also mark Fanny’s happiness at the novel’s end, for this too will
                  arise from a similarly tainted source: Henry’s re-seduction of and then entrapment
                  with Maria. </note>
</p>
<p>A few more examples will, I hope, round out the sense of this easing off of judging
               and relaxing into sufficiency, whether on the part of narrative agency or
               protagonist; perhaps appropriately, none of these passages quite meets the
               requirements of what I’m looking for: a judgment or last word that would simply lift
               the exacting pressure of the demand for an answer. A certain sly way of getting the
               last word, without in fact uttering it, is in any case the natural prerogative of
               free indirect style, whose ironic effects derive in large part from putting into play
               and leaving without comment the disjuncture between a character’s beliefs or meanings
               and the plot’s actual or imminent truth. So several chapters before the novel’s own
               dénouement, Chapter 11 of Volume III of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>
               concludes by markedly <emph>not</emph> resuming narration, ending instead with a rendering of
               Fanny’s growing excitement as she warms to what appears to her as the prospect of
               Henry Crawford’s soon desisting from his suit: <quote>Not considering in how
                  different a circle she had been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to
                  contrast, she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle, and
                  regardful of others, than formerly. And if in little things, must it not be so in
                  great? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling as he now expressed
                  himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed, that he would not
                  much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her? (479-80)</quote> As
               marriages go, the alliance between Austen’s narrative agency and Fanny’s point of
               view here would seem to strand the girl high and dry. For as if continuing the spring
               outing from which she has just returned, the passage, in its quick stringing together
               of questions and clauses, records a kind of quickening or thawing of Fanny’s
               speculative imagination, as she indulges in wishful thinking and begins to hope,
               admittedly for very little: that a man she does not love will simply go away and
               accept her “no” as definitive, for why should solicitousness for her health and
               well-being not be indicative of a more general wish to respect her choices? To this
               much, Austen gives Fanny reason and the logic remains intact, so that of the many
               jokes in play here, one is that she would like him better—and might be prepared to
               accept him—if he would only give up his pointed attention, and another is on the
               reader who, eager for Crawford’s chances, was prepared to take Fanny’s
               reconsideration of his qualities as a sign of her warming to him as a lover. </p>
<p>So in the previous chapter perhaps nothing disposes Fanny toward Henry more favorably
               than his declining her father’s invitation to join them for Saturday dinner. Here too
               there are too many jokes fully to unpack, for where Fanny seems to overestimate his
               delicacy (as women are always supposed to be doing according to the gendered ideology
               of gentility), the concluding contrastive judgment, whether Austen’s or her own, only
               continues to consign him to the damned who will never be worthy of her hand: if she
               is right to want to spare him, it is only on account of his vices: <quote>
<p rend="noCount">Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure,
                     and one of no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of
                     taking his mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror,
                     before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He was engaged to
                     dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met with some
                     acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he should have the honour,
                     however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, &amp;c. and so they
                     parted—Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil! </p>
<p rend="noCount">To have had him join their family dinner-party and see all their
                     deficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca’s cookery and Rebecca’s
                     waiting, and Betsey’s eating at table without restraint, and pulling every
                     thing about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet enough inured to,
                     for her often to make a tolerable meal. <emph>She </emph>was nice only from
                     natural delicacy, but <emph>he</emph> had been brought up in a school of luxury
                     and epicurism. (472)</p>
</quote> Finally there is a further joke in the
               discretion with which the narration leaves open whether Henry reads Fanny’s distress
               on her face and decides to decline the invitation accordingly, or whether he really
               does already have another engagement and is, as usual, putting his pleasure first—a
               miniature allegory of the difficulty of telling discretion from selfishness that
               informs the plot as a whole. </p>
<p>Indeed if Fanny deludes herself at the end of Chapter 11 of Volume III (since at this
               moment Crawford has no thought of giving her up and indeed never will have such a
               thought), the plot will soon prove her correct in supposing that “he would not much
               longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her.” Not until the final chapter does
               Austen step in to account for this arbitrary lapse, in an unusually extended exercise
               in counterfactual fiction where the verb “persevere” once again appears, this time in
               the conditional mood: <quote>
<p rend="noCount">Could he have been satisfied with the
                     conquest of one amiable woman’s affections, could he have found sufficient
                     exultation in overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and
                     tenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of success
                     and felicity for him. His affection had already done something. Her influence
                     over him had already given him some influence over her. Would he have deserved
                     more, there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained; especially when
                     that marriage had taken place, which would have given him the assistance of her
                     conscience in subduing her first inclination, and brought them very often
                     together. Would he have persevered and uprightly, Fanny must have been his
                     reward—and a reward very voluntarily bestowed—within a reasonable period of
                     Edmund’s marrying Mary. </p>
<p rend="noCount">Had he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought, by going
                     down to Everingham after his return from Portsmouth, he might have been
                     deciding his own happy destiny. (540)</p>
</quote> “Reward” is the same chilling
               word reserved for Marianne in <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> in the
               thoughts of her sister and mother, who with the maternal narrator thus conspire to
               sacrifice her to the double demands of fortune and virtue represented by Colonel
               Brandon’s long-suffering deserts.<note xml:id="ftn14" place="foot" resp="editors" n="14">Thus Elinor “felt that to <emph>his</emph> sufferings and <title level="m">his</title> constancy far more than to his rival’s, the reward of her sister
                  was due” (<title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> 379); “They each felt his
                  [Col. Brandon’s] sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by general
                  consent, was to be the reward of all” (429). </note> Austen’s repeated use of it
               here suggests that Henry’s reformation, however satisfying as a tale of moral
               redemption, would not have been worth the price of Fanny’s prostitution. At the same
               time, Austen rarely lays it on so thick, and in her haranguing of Henry for so
               completely if mindlessly ruining this alternative ending, we can read unease over the
               arbitrariness with which she has sprung her heroine from a plot from which Fanny
               herself could not so easily have extricated herself, since her giving ground in
               forming the hope that he would go of his own accord would have given him his first
               real grounds for hoping in the first place. </p>
<p>Or so it would have gone were Fanny and Henry Stendhalian characters. Instead, Austen
               shows Henry extracting himself from a resolution metonymical of his proposal to
               Fanny, in a sentence that ironically produces the gentled sequence of
               deferral-turned-desertion and postponement-become-abandonment for which Fanny wishes,
               a movement parsed over three mental decisions among which Austen’s narrator finally
               does not decide: delay, performance by other means, cancellation: <quote>But he was
                  pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser’s party; his staying was made of flattering
                  consequence, and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were
                  both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind
                  unused to make any sacrifice to right; he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,
                  resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its purpose was
                  unimportant—and staid. (540-41)</quote> The repeated resolution (not to do x
               today, not to do it directly/in person, not to do it at all) finally does not resolve,
               and the last somewhat unsettling “or” amounts to a kind of shrug of the shoulders on
               Austen’s part: she does not care to know which way out Henry finally took, as all or
               any would have been sufficient.</p>
<p>“Men owe us what we imagine they will give us. Forgive them this debt” (Weil, <title level="m">Gravity and Grace</title> 9). In one breath Simone Weil makes an
               outrageous claim—there is nothing we cannot legitimately ask of others, or to put it
               in novelistic terms, “the schoolgirl is owed nothing less than what she imagines men
               will give her”— and in the next retracts it. I deliberately invoke the figure of the
               adolescent girl, simultaneously more exacting and less demanding than her adult
               parents who have entered into contract with one another, for in both its content and
               movement Weil’s thought follows the high-flown gestures of Stendhalian heroines: “A
               beloved being who disappoints me. I have written to him. It is impossible that he
               should not reply by saying what I have said to myself in his name” (Weil 9). The
               reader is not told just how the man has let her down or how she has excused him to
               herself. The novel that Weil here leaves unwritten, and that I have been suggesting
               in this essay Cavell’s famously uncontrolled prose often steps in to write, would
               concern the state of the man (the mortal?) who has been both accused and absolved of
               his insufficiency—from whom the secret of his having proven an illusion, unable to
               meet the other’s desire, has not been kept. </p>
<p>I’d like to close with a passage that cuts the dialectic between the mildness of
               Fanny’s hopes and the extravagance of Weil’s, both of which can so easily shade into
               the coldness of no expectations at all. The passage finds Elizabeth Bennett (Fanny’s
               supposed anti-type) taking pleasure in the joke she imagines Darcy enjoying at her
               expense if he could, as she reflects on the irony of her changed feelings with
               respect to his earlier marriage proposal: <quote>What a triumph for him, as she often
                  thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four
                  months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as
                  generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was
                  mortal, there must be a triumph. (<title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>
                  344)</quote> She imputes a cruelty, a laugh at her expense, for which she does not
               fault him. Perhaps such a going ahead of the other’s power of injury is all too
               readable according to the by now familiar reading of the disciplinary movement of
               Austen’s marriage-directed novels, where marriage is the reward for the wound the
               heroine inflicts upon herself and her narcissistic image of self-sufficiency. But
               such a reading hardly does justice to the multiple ironies of this fantasy of Darcy
               unable not to smile, powerless to resist his power over her, phrased as it is in the
               abstract form of the universal axiom. However one parses the thought—“it would take a
               god not to laugh at the errors of mortals”; “it would take superhuman strength not to
               find some pleasure in the weakness of the other”—one hardly begins to approach the
               riddle of a sentence that here finally does what it says and achieves a
               triumph—unassigned in Elizabeth’s mind because non-culpable, free of personal guilt,
               but in another sense unassigned because belonging to the immortal hand that writes
               the sentence and whose particular triumph is precisely to leave in doubt the reality
               of a triumph its human protagonist so decisively asserts, on the basis of
               finding her lover mortal.</p>

<anchor xml:id="LindstromIntroAbstract"/>Eric Lindstrom</hi>, <title level="a">Introduction</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">For Romanticists, the many interests of Stanley Cavell’s work include not only the pervasive concern with skepticism across all his books, but topics as divergent as understanding and incomprehensibility, acknowledgment, denial, withholding and secrecy, responsibility, forgiveness, gender, melodrama, horror, monstrousness, therapy, cinematic ontology, religion, secularity, and spectatorship. Two points of emphasis are maintained across his books. These are: the idea of skepticism as an unappeasable predicament one does not solve but lives (skepticism as a problem whose “answer does not consist in denying the conclusion of skepticism but in reconceiving its truth” [<title level="m">The Senses of Walden</title> 133]); and the discovery that acknowledgement and avoidance are primary human orientations (often experienced through their equally human denial), with regard to which certainty and ignorance (the more visible and epistemologically-privileged terms of knowing) are evasions.</p>
<p rend="noCount">Four of the contributors to Stanley Cavell and the Event of Romanticism (François, Fry, Wilner, and Lindstrom) presented early versions of their essays as part of the “Stanley Cavell and Romanticism” panel, organized by Joshua Wilner and Eric Lindstrom, at the 2010 International Conference on Romanticism (ICR) held in Lubbock, Texas.

<anchor xml:id="FryAbstract"/>Paul H. Fry</hi>, <title level="a">'A Modest Creed': Saving Skepticism in Shelley and Cavell</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Shelley and Cavell share the view that the imagination, visionary or otherwise, arises from a necessary basis in skepticism. What Shelley calls “Error and Truth” are historical; they are shaped by change and time. Only poetry, perpetually reconstituting veridical propositions as metaphor, can prevent the arteries of knowledge from hardening. Skepticism enables hope: our uncertainty about what life is (it is figured as death in <title level="m">Adonais</title>) makes it possible to wonder whether death may not really be life. Apparently in contrast, Cavell emphasizes romantic disappointment with Kant’s “settlement” with skepticism, whereas for Shelley our inability to know the thing in itself is the very opening required for imaginative hope. Yet Shelley does not doubt the existence of things, only their identity, and also their “life,” and here he anticipates the argument of Cavell in <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title>. For Shelley, as for Cavell, the visionary does not replace the ordinary but recognizes it anew. They differ from each other finally, however, in that whereas Cavell understands what Wittgenstein calls “criteria” for knowledge in semantic terms, Shelley sees them as typically semiotic: “almost all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others” (“On Life”). The darker skepticism of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> anticipates deconstruction.</p>

<anchor xml:id="WalkerAbstract"/>Eric C. Walker</hi>, <title level="a">Austen and Cavell</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Taking its departure from Stanley Goldstein’s adoption of himself as Stan Cavell, this essay argues that marriage and adoption are twinned locations where normative patterns of pairing and kinship are first unstitched and then rewoven in the necessarily elusive forms of Cavellian perfectionism.  After a review of Cavell’s own belated engagements with Austen’s fiction, the essay offers, first, a reading of a central Cavellian trope, remarriage, in a novel he ignores, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>; and, second, a reading of <title level="m">Emma</title> as a novel preoccupied with adoption.  Because Cavell does not attend to cinematic Austen, I pay special attention to the 2009 Jim O’Hanlon film of <title level="m">Emma</title> and argue that both the novel and the film offer a human world in which adoption and marriage are isomorphic forms suffered by and available to, however elusively, the perfectionist quest.</p>

<anchor xml:id="SunAbstract"/>Emily Sun</hi>, <title level="a">Your Friends and Lovers: Perfectionism’s Recounting of Romanticism</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Stanley Cavell famously defines the work of Romanticism in <title level="m">In Quest of the Ordinary</title> as “the task of bringing the world back, as to life.”  This essay examines how Cavell turns to Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title> as a text that anticipates Romanticism’s preoccupation with reanimation; in his analysis of the play’s language of economy and computation, Cavell parses “life” as a process of division and branching that is denied or overlooked by skepticism.  According to such an understanding, Romantic efforts to reanimate “life” in its generality fall short of a genuine recounting of and reckoning with the ordinary.  The essay reads Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Julian and Maddalo” as staging the several characters’ failure to recover the world and bring it back to life.</p>

<anchor xml:id="FrancoisAbstract"/>Anne-Lise François</hi>, <title level="a">Passing Judgment, Conceding Perfection: Third-Person Narration and Versions of the Cavellian Secular</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">This essay reviews the tensions between the hard work that the Cavellian figure of “acknowledgment” is supposed to perform in guaranteeing recognition between secular individuals, and the movements of “decline,” “lapse,” and “concession” by which acknowledgment happens. Cavell’s comments on perlocutionary utterances as acts whose happening cannot be definitively concluded, similarly leave open the question of what is to count as a “final word” between people. For a possible answer, the essay turns toward free indirect style in third-person narration as literature’s own performance of the finality, passiveness and non-assertiveness of acknowledgment, and offers sentences from Austen and Stendhal as instances of “passing judgment.” What light can a narrative style that enacts a split between the subject of experience and the agent of its verbalization shed on the Cavellian figures of conceded recognitions, withdrawn questions, and final judgments?  </p>

<anchor xml:id="LindstromAbstract"/>Eric Lindstrom</hi>, <title level="a">Cavell’s Romanticism and the Autobiographical Animal</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">This essay discusses the implications of Cavell’s performative act to “confess” a Romantic attitude toward the claims of experience. “To be interested [. . .] in the costs of knowing to the knowing creature, I suppose one will have to take an interest in certain preoccupations of romanticism,” Cavell admits near the end of the second part of <title level="m">The Claim of Reason</title> (242).  I read Cavell’s habitual sense of Romanticism, in the languages of economic exchange and animal life, as “the cost of knowing to the knowing creature.”  The last half of this essay discusses Cavell’s complex, sometimes prickly relationship with Jacques Derrida and the relation of both to autobiographical modes of Romanticism. Cavell’s topic, I argue, is the “recall,” his reclaiming, via Romantic poetry as well as through so much else, of what it means to be responsive to the human animal by other standards besides a rehearsal of self-possession in our measures of knowledge.</p>

<anchor xml:id="WilnerAbstract"/>Joshua Wilner</hi>, <title level="a">Afterword</title>
</head>
<p rend="noCount">Starting out from a consideration of the more or less contemporaneous emergence of Cavell's work and deconstruction, this afterword responds to the other contributions to the collection. In doing so, it also emphasizes the importance of Wittgenstein and the idea of "bring[ing] words back to their everyday use" in understanding Cavell's engagement with Romanticism; examines the Cavellian problematic of "living one's skepticism" as entailing something other than an ethical recommendation; and, taking a cue from François' contribution, asks whether marriage in Cavell is to be considered only in terms of intersubjectivity.</p>
