            <p class="noCount">This volume of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> includes an editor's introduction by <a class="link_ref" href="#LindstromAbout" title="">Eric Lindstrom</a>, with essays by <a class="link_ref" href="#FryAbout" title="">Paul H.

            <p class="noCount">At a climactic point in Part Four of <em>The Claim of Reason</em> (1979), the American philosopher Stanley Cavell arrives at the striking conclusion
               that “romanticism opens with the discovery of the problem of other minds, or with
               the discovery that the other is a problem, an opening of philosophy.” Cavell’s account
               of how Romanticism opens is not historical in orientation, but rather offers a rich
               conceptual, aesthetic, and ethical site of concern that both interrupts and generates
               his life’s work— thus presenting an opening for scholars and students of the Romantic
               Period to think the subject of Romanticism anew in studying (with) Cavell. The essays
               in this volume seek to provide the fullest account to date of Cavell’s prompting by
               Romanticism in light of his powerful record of engagement with British and European
               Romantic texts: a body of literature on which Cavell has performed several bravura
               readings. Cavell’s writings and distinctive philosophical approach have garnered an
               increasing amount of sustained attention over the past several years, particularly
               since the publication of <em>Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow</em> (2005) and <em>Little Did I Know</em> (2010). Yet beyond his major American subjects of Thoreau and Emerson, there is still
               little published scholarship that engages Cavell’s thought at extended, close range
               with Romanticism as the moment that matters so much him: the “perfectionist” opening
               that comes after religion, but before philosophy. The present collection—with essays
               (in suggested reading order) by Emily Sun, Paul Fry, Eric Lindstrom, Eric Walker,
               and Anne-Lise François, and a substantial Afterword by Joshua Wilner—hinges between
               the efforts to record Cavell’s engagement with British Romantic texts and to stage
               new interventions.</p>

               <p class="noCount">This volume was designed at the University of Maryland by David Rettenmaier, Site
                  Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style applied by
                  David Rettenmaier. TEI renders text in archival quality for better preservation and
                  future access. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms
                  provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">About the <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em></span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">The <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation
                  of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation
                  of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <em>RCPS</em> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand,
                  dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other,
                  retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions
                  of today. <em>RCPS</em> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical
                  writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
