            <p class="noCount">This essay reflects on Keats’s crossover success as a hyper-canonical and popular
               poet for contemporary middle-brow readers, contextualizes scholarly discourses about
               his poetry’s longstanding (and often vexed) connections with popular culture, and
               introduces the essays in <em>Keats in Popular Culture</em>, which investigate popular culture artifacts and mediums as well as popular literature
               involving Keats. 
               “Keats in Between”
               recalls three longstanding embarrassments for teachers and scholars of literary history—popular
               culture, media, and affect—which routinely have been defined in opposition to (while
               continuing to inform) the high canon of English literature, and it posits Keats’s
               two-hundred year reception history as an exemplary case for examining popular culture
               as a generative, shape-shifting borderland where liking/loving and responding to literature
               intermingles, sometimes indistinguishably, the tastes of the people and the elite.</p>

                  <p>How has John Keats (1795–1821) become such a crossover success with a “powerful appeal”
                     to “academic specialists” and “the nonreading public”? Where and in what forms can
                     we find evidence of Keats’s appeal outside of classrooms and scholarly publications?
                     And, why should we (teachers and scholars) take seriously, let alone value, Keats’s
                     afterlives created by non-academic specialists and non-poets in mediums, genres and
                     modes that we might deem ephemeral, adulterated, and/or reductive instantiations of
                     his high canonical poetic value? <em>Keats in Popular Culture</em> pursues these questions with the hope of broadening our disciplinary understanding
                     of what Jack Stillinger has termed the “concentrated canonical complexity” of “Multiple
                     Keats.”

                              imaginative dividedness between the serious and the humorous, the straight and the

                     Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and a handful of others—at the top of the lists of the most
                     esteemed writers in English poetry” (251).

                     and Thomas Pfau have reinvigorated studies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                     century as a self-conscious age of sensation, emotional transference, and bodily movement.

                     </div> Pfau’s contention that Keats’s “technique of hypersimulation […] baits its audience’s
                     critical and melancholic recognition of poetry as semblance, and semblance as socially
                     determined” demonstrates how mediation and affect theories can be combined to recast
                     longstanding cruxes in Keats studies concerned with authorial fashioning and reader
                     response (343). In 
                     “Liking/Loving: Affect Theory for Media Scholars,”
                      the closing section of their introduction to <em>Multimedia Romanticisms</em>, James Brook-Smith and Andrew Burkett argue further that intermingling media and
                     affect theories can help spotlight a “productive openness of Romantic-era media discourse
                     that is neither bounded by the technological channel of communication nor by today’s
                     reigning norms of hyper-efficient informatics” (Par. 27). <em>Keats in Popular Culture</em> explores such media-affect crossovers between Keats’s age and our own where discipline-specific
                     inquiries and hyper-canonical treatments of his poetry and biography alternately inform
                     and give way to broader networks of connection involving multiple mediums and diverse
                     audiences.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This inquiry draws our attention beyond discourses focused solely on poetry to consider
                     more unregulated appropriations of and responses to Keats in less specialized and
                     more overtly commercialized mediums. As Yohei Igarashi muses, Romantic period scholars
                     have often overlooked or been reluctant to pursue such connections because of Keats’s
                     own characterizations of his work: “The pertinacity with which Keats strives to align
                     himself with the longstanding medium of poetry and the book may be responsible for
                     the lack of sustained commentary on his relation to the larger ecology of contemporaneous
                     means of communication” (173). Likewise, Keats’s several disparaging comments about
                     popular mass market poetry as debased literature that traffics in commercialized,
                     often all-too “smokeable,” forms has led generations of professional writers and scholars
                     to class his poetry exclusively within highbrow literary discourses.

                     use of “untoward” suggests that reading Keats’s poetry can draw us into intensely
                     intimate and potentially unseemly, emotional connections that trouble our professional
                     and personal disciplinary boundaries. Such “untoward attachments” obfuscate what Laura

                     discourses theorizing about popular culture emerged in the second half of the eighteenth
                     century. These popular culture conceptions often overlapped with debates about how
                     to define an expanding canon of English literature, and they involved proto-media
                     articulations and new ways of describing reader-author relationships as personal affairs
                     of liking and/or loving literature.

                     artificial “writing which is aggressively <em>literary</em> and therefore not just ‘not Literature’ but, in effect, <em>anti</em>-literature: a parody” (10, 5). Writing at, though not necessarily for, canonical
                     tastes, Keats fetishizes an aesthetics of betweenness, which sensationalizes high
                     poetic styles, poetry as a constructed medium, and the reading public’s growing desire
                     to experience biographically-infused, authorial emotion. With Levinson’s critique

                  <p>So, how might studying Keats’s affective, multi-media afterlives help us to read him
                     anew? First, such an approach prompts us to continue reevaluating our profession’s
                     longstanding repudiation of popular literature as solely market-driven, ephemeral,
                     ‘bad’ art (overly simple, not serious, or adulterated). Second, within that reconsideration,
                     we can re-contextualize Keats’s own dismissals of the word popular in ‘popular literature.’
                     Andrew Bennett’s <em>Keats, Narrative, and Audience</em> (1994) and <em>Romantic Poets and the Culture of Posterity</em> (1998) remind us of how Keats’s criticisms of fashionable authorship and poetry with
                     a mass market appeal have led generations of Romantic period scholars to align Keats
                     with William Wordsworth’s skewed argument in his 
                     “Essay Supplementary to the Preface”
                      (1815) that a poet’s contemporary popularity rendered them unfit for a future place
                     in the high canon of English poetry.

                     </div> By all accounts, Keats was neither a popular nor a well-reviewed Regency poet, and
                     he seemed intent upon establishing a posthumous reputation beyond the transience of
                     what he called the “little famous” of his age so that he could finally be “among the
                     English poets.” Keats undoubtedly had a vexed relationship with popular writing for
                     a consumer culture that was caught up in discourses about fame and celebrity.

                     of already slippery high, low, and middling aesthetic distinctions: “Keats began in
                     1818 to represent aesthetic experience as a continual, undecided negotiation that

                     and attention” (194). Through his alignments with Hunt’s new school of poetry, metropolitan
                     visual entertainments, and Kean’s sensational Shakespeare performances, Keats wittingly
                     and unwittingly drew his poetry into public debates about what popular and high literary

                     maintains that Holman deeply valued “the portability of ‘Keats,’ above all” and understood
                     his unparalleled collection of images, ranging from illustrations to postcards, as

                  <p>In the late twentieth- and early twenty-first century, this emphasis on reader-author
                     intimacy, participatory poetics, and popularizing high literary forms has coincided
                     with the rise of what Beth Driscoll calls “the new literary middlebrow.” Driscoll
                     argues that new literary middlebrow culture has eight family attributes: “middle class,
                     reverential towards elite culture, entrepreneurial, mediated, feminized, emotional,
                     recreational, and earnest” (6). Through her amendments to what she describes as Pierre
                     Bourdieu’s rigid, polarizing theories (art for art’s sake vs. mass market productions)
                     about the field and habitus of literary production and cultural capital, Driscoll
                     examines a neglected “middle space” in which the “middlebrow’s expansive, colonizing
                     activities continually shift the boundaries between cultural categories, while the
                     new relationships it creates between mass audiences and intermediaries recalibrate
                     lines of authority” (17). Although Kelvin Everest does not mention middlebrow culture

                     “Why Read Keats?”
                      (2002), he proffers a new literary middlebrow educational ideal: “[Keats’s] example
                     affirms that English poetry is an art form for the people as a whole, and not the
                     preserve of a privileged elite. In Keats’s poetry the English poetic tradition is
                     claimed for a fundamentally democratic future, in which high aesthetic experience
                     is the possession of a wider and socially inclusive readership” (3).

                     </div> For Stanley Plumly—perhaps Keats’s most ardent poet-scholar advocate—associating Keats
                     with anything middlebrow (even some of Keats’s own poetry) degrades his greatness
                     and, thus, should be discarded. Plumly’s conviction leads him in <em>Posthumous Keats: A Personal Biography</em> (2008) to eschew influential pre-Raphaelite tastes involving the “luxury, drapery,
                     weft, and rich weave of the texture and rhythmic structure in Keats’s romances and
                     ballads” because “such qualities tend to confirm rather than challenge, reinforce
                     rather than resist convention, and meet—in spite of counter-Victorian and post-Victorian
                     protestations of art for art’s sake—mostly middle-brow nineteenth-century expectations”
                     (321). Despite his elegant protestation, Plumly’s concerns about the “irresistible,”
                     convention-reinforcing “qualities” of Keats’s narrative verse underscore Keats’s powerful
                     middlebrow appeal as well as Plumly’s own personalized literary middlebrow treatment
                     of Keats’s biography and poetry.

                     Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason—”. Negative
                     capability has garnered this currency largely because it suggests an adaptable, betwixt-and-between
                     subject position within a non-systematic philosophy for considering life and art while
                     “remaining content with half knowledge” in the midst of unreconciled contradictions
                     (<em>Letters</em>. I. 193, 194). Far from a limiting cultural shibboleth, negative capability describes
                     being in the middle as a virtue, which can foster mental lability and creative ways
                     of thinking about and between different epistemologies of human knowledge. As Brian
                     Rejack and Michael Theune maintain in their introduction to <em>Keats’s Negative Capability: New Origins and Afterlives</em> (2019), Keats’s concept has “escaped the gravitational pull of Keats studies” to emerge

                     medicine, Zen philosophy, and business marketing and management (3-4). I also would

                     ‘Big Six’ male Romantic poets: William Blake, Lord (George Gordon) Byron, Percy Bysshe
                     Shelley, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Of the six, Blake and Byron
                     have garnered the largest popular culture following. As Steven Clark and Jason Whittaker’s <em>Blake, Modernity, and Popular Culture</em> has shown, Blake’s afterlives as a political radical and visionary iconoclast have
                     appeared most influentially in music, experimental film, and graphic novels.

                     culture presence has been dwarfed by Byron’s and Blake’s. Coleridge has had a slightly

                     is more accessible and less radically visionary than Blake, less egocentric and aggressive
                     than Byron or (a more staid and stuffy) Wordsworth, more psychologically stable and

               <p>Ranking fittingly in the middle of these six, Keats’s new literary middlebrow popularity
                  involves intense, personal connections based on deep feeling for his short life and
                  tubercular death, doomed romance with Fanny Brawne and poetry, underdog status and
                  outsized writing ambitions, capacity for friendship and broad-minded sociality, and
                  sense of identity as transformable and mobile. Like Shakespeare’s and Austen’s, Keats’s
                  recent afterlives represent and inflect our myths about creative genius, romantic
                  love, and individual agency. Reactions to his short biography, however, separate Keats’s
                  afterlives from theirs. His young-adult romance with Fanny Brawne, rapid mastery of
                  writing poetry, and death at twenty-five well before his achievements were widely
                  recognized speak readily to post-1950s youth cultures focused on (and often marketed
                  to) under-appreciated young adults trying to define their shifting, middle-class identities.
                  Given Keats’s new literary middlebrow popularity, I wonder too if currently we are
                  seeing (to borrow Gregory Dart’s term) an outsized, fun-house mirror, “Cockney moment”
                  reflecting authors and readers. Though not focused on political enfranchisement like
                  the “moment” (1810–1840) Dart describes, our quasi- “Cockney moment” (I submit 1990ish–present)
                  has many of the “amphibious qualities” that he details—exemplified by Leigh Hunt’s
                  writing, which “hovers uncertainly between the polite and the plebeian” (203). We
                  too are immersed in a rapidly-shifting, and now expressly global, metropolitan climate,
                  which is “liberal and open in some respects, but also superficial and fashion-hungry
                  in others.” Marked by “very broad tastes in literature” and an “expanded field of
                  print journalism,” our climate teems with debates about the “cultural legitimacy”
                  of “the so-called ‘middle class’”—pointed by its young adult avatars (first Gen X,
                  then Millennials, and now Gen Z) who continue to “transform traditional aesthetic
                  norms” in new digital mass media (Dart 204, 205).</p>

                  <p>New literary middlebrow culture has challenged high canonical gatekeeping, but its
                     inherited tastes and largely reverential attitudes toward highbrow culture predominate,
                     as Jane Campion’s commercially successful film <em>Bright Star</em> (2009) and “Introduction” to <em>Love Letters and Poems of John Keats to Fanny Brawne</em> (2009) demonstrate. In Campion’s transmedia introduction, “<em>Bright Star</em>—the Story of Keats and Fanny,” she not only summarizes the major biographical plot
                     points informing her literary biopic; she also enthuses: <span class="quote">‘The poems, the love letters, the love story are all part of the alchemy that makes
                        Keats so special, so available to successive generations of readers. The young man
                        who died devastated, convinced that he would be forgotten, has been repeatedly re-discovered.
                        For many people, he is the first point of entry into poetry and his life story is
                        a big part of that magical equation. (vi–vii) ’</span> Campion’s affection and marketing for this Keats-Brawne story celebrate alchemical
                     auto-biographical processes, an intensely engaging romance and devastating tragedy,
                     and a near complete loss followed by paths of rediscovery that continually draw readers
                     into poetry. For Campion, what makes Keats so “special” is his affective, textually
                     embodied capacity for revival—a “magical equation” that involves his discoverers in
                     recognizing parts of themselves which, like Keats, may appear to have been nearly
                     lost. Campion’s biopic immerses us in melodrama and sentimentality, but it also plays
                     high art-for-art’s sake ideals against mass commercialization and suggests an intermedium
                     between the two: an intermingling of canonical Keats aesthetics and Brawne’s stylish
                     stitch-work. Moreover, with Brawne as our focalizer and emotional surrogate, <em>Bright Star</em> grants us visual access to Keats’s personality and artistic genius while blocking
                     any close textual/bodily understanding as Keats disappears off-screen into near-deathly
                     anonymity while Brawne remains on screen to elicit our compassion.

                     </div> Winner of the 2016 New York City Independent Film Festival’s “Best Short,” <em>Visiting Mr. Keats</em> spotlights the overweening drive of university academics who seek to control the reception
                     and cultural significance of canonical writers such as Keats. <em>Visiting Mr. Keats</em> literalizes the notion that professors can transport students back to the very historical
                     moment of an author’s writings, and it features an English professor (Bell), who can
                     travel back in time, and one of her graduate students, whom she has chosen to take
                     on a research trip to Keats’s Hampstead residence in the spring of 1819. Posing in
                     early nineteenth-century garb as a weaver (pseudonym Cornelius Green) and his mother,
                     this ambitious graduate student and his domineering professor visit Keats at home
                     with Charles Brown with the stated intention of asking Keats one question: what did
                     Keats mean in the first line of <em>Endymion</em>, “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”? Both student and professor fritter away their
                     opportunity by passive-aggressively arguing to such an extent that Brown politely
                     asks them to leave. As the graduate student hurriedly bids adieu to a nonplussed Keats
                     with an unwitting parody of Keats’s own line, “a joy forever,” the professor—contrary
                     to her own student-directed admonishments about not violating time-travel protocols—carelessly
                     leaves behind her iPhone with its nightingale image on the casing. At the film’s close,

                     that Keats composed his fabled “Ode to a Nightingale” that very night after finding

                     “Quoting Keats”
                      points the way into this space of seeing and listening to Keatsian echoes, iterations,
                     and re-creations. His tracing of the popularity of <em>Endymion</em>’s first line provides a backward- and forward-turning meditation on what quoting
                     and misquoting Keats can teach us about our own mass cultural fixations on engines
                     of authorship and textual reproduction. In 
                     “Reading Keats Together: Cleanth Brooks and the Collegiate Public,”
                      Christopher Rovee reminds us of how Keats’s amateurish, ‘Cockney’ qualities were widely
                     excised by Brooks’s influential, New Critical touting of Keats’s “well-wrought,” expert
                     craftsmanship. Rovee contends that Brooks’s Keats-centered work played a significant
                     role in transforming post-World War II university literature classrooms into places
                     (perhaps even mediums) that rejected mass consumer culture and, instead, encouraged
                     a new mass influx of college students to create with their professors an authentic,
                     socially valuable, popular culture through communal acts of close reading. Forest
                     Pyle’s 
                     “Keats Effects”
                      theorizes about how we can identify overlooked and under-heard networks of poetic
                     influence and sonic effects—whether “obstructive enthusiasms” or “shrines of no prospect.”
                     Pyle’s focus on poetry, music, and image in “Cockney pop” signals this collection’s
                     intention to describe new constellations of Keats’s presence in our contemporary skylines.
                     Betsy Tontiplaphol’s 
                     “<em>Bright Star</em> and the Etsy Effect”
                      prompts us to recognize one such constellation in Campion’s <em>Bright Star</em>. Tontiplaphol argues that Campion’s film lauds an imperfectly material Keats whose
                     dynamic avatars can be found on the social media website Etsy, which celebrates the
                     labor of amateur hands in a personalized handicrafts movement. Noah Comet’s Bridget
                     Jones-enthused response draws these essays into stereoscopic view, suggesting what
                     we might look and listen to as we move forward with Keats studies in the twenty-first
                     century. In popular culture, Keatsian in-betweenness is legion.

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>The Cambridge Companion to John Keats</em>, Stillinger defines “Multiple Keats” as “an internal complexity in the poet constituted
               primarily by self-division—a sort of unresolved imaginative dividedness between the
               serious and the humorous, the straight and the ironic, the fanciful and the real,
               the high-flying and the down-to-earth, the sentimental and the satiric, the puffed
               up and the deflated” (253).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Keats’s canonicity was already well-established when Matthew Arnold published his
               essay on Keats in T.H. Ward’s <em>English Poets</em> (1880). Arnold countermands longstanding positive and negative evaluations of Keats
               as overly sensual and effete, characterizations that peaked dramatically after Harry
               Buxton Foreman published Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne (1878). On Keats’s shifting
               nineteenth-century reception, see James Najarian’s <em>Victorian Keats: Manliness, Sexuality and Desire</em>; Jeffrey Robinson’s <em>Reception and Poetics in Keats: My Ended Poet</em>; and Sarah Wootton’s <em>Consuming Keats: Nineteenth-Century Representations in Art and Literature</em>, as well as more recent antipodal arguments in Emily Roerhbach’s <em>Modernity’s Mist: British Romanticism and the Poetics of Anticipation</em>; and William Ulmer’s <em>John Keats: Reimaging History</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">See David Damrosch’s distinctions between hypercanon, countercanon, and shadow canon
               in 
               “World literature in a Postcanonical, Hypercanonical Age.”
               On Keats and hypercanonity, see Jeffrey Cox’s chapter section 
               “Hypercanonical Keats and the Pantheon of Living Poets”
               in <em>The Cambridge Companion to British Romantic Poetry</em> and James O’Rourke’s edited collection <a class="link_ref" href="/praxis/grecianurn/index.html"><em>Ode on a Grecian Urn: Hypercanonicity and Pedagogy</em></a>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Along with Beth Driscoll’s argument in <em>The New Literary Middlebrow</em>, I follow Lawrence Levine’s interventions in <em>HighBrow/Lowbrow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America</em>—particularly his attempts “to open not close doors, to raise as well as answer questions,
               to stimulate as much as convince, and to lure as many scholars as possible into asking
               comparable questions and pursuing related lines of research” (
               “Prologue”
               9)—and Peter Swirski’s <em>From Lowbrow to Nobrow</em>, which calls for a more incisive investigation of popular culture and maintains that
               the distinction between “Highbrow” and “Lowbrow” does not suffice in the midst of
               what he dubs “artertainment” and “popular literature [which] is by now the master
               currency for cultural transactions as well as a new constellation of myths and metaphors
               capable of helping us negotiate the experience of the (post)industrial age” (180).
               My aims for <em>Keats in Popular Culture</em> also align with recent arguments such as Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s <em>Generous Thinking: A Radical Approach to Saving the University</em> and Devoney Looser’s 
               “<a class="link_ref" href="https://profession.mla.org/the-hows-and-whys-of-public-humanities/">The Hows and Whys of Public Humanities</a>.”

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">In his letters Keats uses “smoked,” “smoke,” “smoking,” and “smokeable”—each of which
               have slightly different meanings ranging from to jest at and ridicule to noticing,
               seeing through, and understanding (<em>Letters:</em> II. 13, 19, 36, 174, 206, 217, 221, 244). In his 
               “Smokeability”
               section (393–402) in <em>England in 1819</em>, James Chandler provides an incisive gloss of “smokeable” as “an act of <em>condescension</em>, toward ‘weakness’ or ‘inadequacy’” (399). Chandler demonstrates Keats’s concern
               about his poems being publicly “smoked” (seen through, ridiculed) and classed as trendy,
               light-weight knock-offs in the vein of overly sentimental or sensational poems and
               novels appealing predominantly to female readers. On highbrow conceptions of Keats,
               Virginia Woolf’s characterization in her 
               “Middlebrow”
               essay offers an apt and influential example: “To be a highbrow, a complete and representative
               highbrow, a highbrow like Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley, Keats […] is of course
               beyond the wildest dreams of my Imagination […] Look at Keats, loving poetry and Fanny
               Brawne so intemperately that he pined and died of consumption at the age of twenty-six”
               (Par. 3). Woolf closes the essay with a playful threat: “If any human being, man,

         <div class="note" id="Note39"><span class="noteLabel">39. </span><span class="noteBody">Twenty-first century popular culture renditions of Keats’s poems offer a synesthetic
               feast for the senses that welcomes the animating play of his canonical and non-canonical
               poetry and revels in his experimental, many-chambered, multicursal poetics. As starting
               points, I suggest the following admixtures: 
               <p class="noCount">A) A high school choir singing Keats’s posthumously published 
                  “Welcome joy, and welcome sorrow”
                  : <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTSp0IAqDTc">www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTSp0IAqDTc</a></p> 
               <p class="noCount">B) The band Kate Moths’ 2017 song version of Keats’s 
                  “This Living Hand”
                  : <a class="link_ref" href="https://tripleeye.bandcamp.com/track/this-living-hand-by-john-keats">tripleeye.bandcamp.com/track/this-living-hand-by-john-keats</a>. See too the 1995 album cover for <em>Consolation Prize</em> by the band This Living Hand.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">C) Graphic Memoirs and Poetry Comics of 
                  “La Belle Dame sans Merci”
                  are growing steadily. Perhaps most notable is PM Buchan’s (with Karen Yumi) four-part
                  graphic memoir (three parts are published with the fourth seemingly forthcoming),
                  which followed his ten-minute film and companion mini-album (2011): <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINf9UfMSUg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLWe-DKTAGho5zBy9nCL-SkfxJ2MfQVDHu">www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINf9UfMSUg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLWe-DKTAGho5zBy9nCL-SkfxJ2MfQVDHu</a>; <a class="link_ref" href="https://soundcloud.com/echolevel/sets/echolevel-la-belle-dame-sans">soundcloud.com/echolevel/sets/echolevel-la-belle-dame-sans</a>. On poetry comics, see my 
                  “Graphic &amp; Digital Keats: 
                  “La Belle Dame sans Merci”
                  in Poetry Comics”
                  ; pdf version at: <a class="link_ref" href="http://reconfigurations.blogspot.com/2020/04/brian-bates-graphic-and-digital-keats.html">reconfigurations.blogspot.com/2020/04/brian-bates-graphic-and-digital-keats.html</a>.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">D) For two Keats-inspired video games, see <em>Elegy for a Dead World</em> (2015), <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfps2HKE4B4#action=share">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfps2HKE4B4#action=share</a> and <em>Apotheon</em> (2015), <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8F0syDVcho">www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8F0syDVcho</a>. <em>Apotheon</em> led one (albeit factually inaccurate) reviewer to exclaim: “If Keats had been alive
                  200 years later, he might have quit his job and become a game developer, not a poet.
                  And if he had, <em>Apotheon</em>, a new game for the PC and PS4, might be his ‘Ode To A Grecian Urn.’ It takes the
                  gameplay of classic side-scrollers like <em>Legend of Zelda II</em> and <em>Castlevania</em> and applies it to the side of an Athenian amphora, bringing the art of ancient Greece
                  to vivid life” (Brownlee).</p> 
               <p class="noCount">E) The San Francisco conceptual, performance artist and experimental philosopher Jonathon
                  Keats continues to stretch the bounds of Keats’s namesake and negative capability
                  concept. Most prominently, see <em>Forged: Why Fakes are the Great Art of Our Age</em>. His major claim—“No authentic masterpiece is as provocative as a great forgery.
                  Forgers are the foremost artists of our age”—uncannily echoes John Keats’s appreciations
                  of Thomas Chatterton’s <em>Rowley</em> forgeries (4).</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note39_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
