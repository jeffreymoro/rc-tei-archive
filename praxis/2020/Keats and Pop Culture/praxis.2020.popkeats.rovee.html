            <p class="noCount">This essay considers Keats’s unique appeal to the New Critics of the 1930s, 40s, and
               50s. It returns to a landmark in American literary studies—Cleanth Brooks’s study
               of Keats’s 
               “Ode on a Grecian Urn”
               —drawing on Brooks’s unpublished personal and professional papers to place his work
               in the context of mid-century disciplinary and methodological changes. At a time when
               greater access to American higher education created what we might call a “classroom
               public” for poetry, Brooks’s study of Keats advocates for and models the close, collective
               reading of poetry, idealistically figuring the university classroom as a site of social
               inclusion while also summoning the conservative historical fantasies associated with
               Southern Agrarianism.</p>

                  <p>It’s not uncommon for readers to cite John Keats’s Grecian urn as if it were the main
                     piece in one of modern criticism’s most consequential titles, Cleanth Brooks’s <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em>.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The phrase “Keats’s well-wrought urn” appears, for instance, in Bornstein, p. 265;
                              Dass, p. 36; Fairer, p. 32; Haw, p. 187; Richard Keller Simon, p. 123; and Vinegar

                     </div> The confusion between Keats’s “bride of quietness” and the “well-wrought urn” of John
                     Donne’s 
                     “The Canonization”
                      can be chalked up to the prevalence of the conceit: urn as self-contained text-object.
                     Brooks himself encouraged the misidentification by making 
                     “Ode on a Grecian Urn”
                      his book’s central case study, and his self-declared goal, “to bridge the gap between
                     metaphysical poetry and other poetries” (<em>Postscript</em> 698), is in keeping with just such a mix-up. Keats’s poem abets in its own way, embedding
                     the key adjective (“O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede / Of marble men and maidens <em>overwrought</em>…”) and thus suggesting Brooks’s title as an allusion to the poetic differential in
                     which he was so heavily invested, between content (overwrought expression) and structure
                     (well-wrought achievement), between the depiction of emotion (pictures on the side
                     of an urn) and the complex aesthetic form that contains such depiction (the urn itself).</p>
               </div>
               <p>That Keats’s urn has become so readily identifiable with a touchstone of twentieth-century
                  formalist criticism speaks to his exceptional status among American New Critics, who
                  were famously—if somewhat disingenuously—dismissive of the romantics. As Frank Jordan
                  explains in his overview of modern romantic criticism, the New Critics’ “sharpshooting
                  was chiefly aimed at Shelley (a poet of adolescent ideas for readers of adolescent
                  enthusiasms) and Wordsworth… Only Keats escaped their fire virtually unharmed” (62).
                  Ernest Bernbaum’s tabular accounting of romantic scholarship in the 1940s shows that
                  Keats was the most written-about of the romantics in that decade (73), and in 1948
                  J. R. MacGillivray remarks on the “almost unqualified praise” of Keats by “the ‘New
                  Criticism’ of the thirties and forties” (still “new” enough to need quotation marks;
                  lxxxi). Frederick Pottle, colleague and sparring-partner of Brooks at Yale, introduced
                  his classes on Keats in the 40s and 50s by summarizing the poet’s relatively high
                  standing among contemporary critics: <span class="quote">‘Probably now at the highest point of critical acclaim. Some attempt to make him out
                     the greatest of the Romantics. Essays on positive values by Leavis, Brooks, Tate,
                     Burke…. Basic reason for their approval: however far Keats may be from the tradition
                     of wit or the kind of imagery exemplified by the metaphysicals and the moderns, he
                     invariably shows a firm grasp of objective reality in the mode of common concrete
                     dense perception. Disciplines and impersonalizes his personal emotions by developing
                     them out of real objects. ‘Sensuous’—cf. what the Victorian critics thought ‘Adolescence.’

                     “Current Developments”
                     )’</span> Realistic, concrete, disciplined, impersonal, dramatic, undogmatic, ironic, skeptical,
                  and above all—as the sum of these qualities—<em>mature</em>: “John Keats is not one of the villains of modern criticism,” Brooks declared in
                  1957, indeed he “may well prove to be one of [its] heroes” (
                  “Artistry”
                  246).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Though he came to believe that he would “be among the English poets” after his death,
                     Keats could hardly have foreseen being a hero of academic critics. The gap between
                     popular appeal and critical respect was an ongoing source of ambivalence for him,
                     as his need to make money from poetry proved bewilderingly hard to separate from his
                     grander sense of vocation. “I equally dislike the favor of the public with the love
                     of a woman—they are both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence,” he wrote
                     his publisher John Taylor (<em>Letters</em> II: 144), aligning the allure of popular approval (and the money that came with it)
                     with the allure of beauty for the errant knight in 
                     “La Belle Dame sans Merci”
                      (or more personally, the allure of Fanny Brawne for a young poet in need of funds
                     to marry her while he still could). Keats played out his resistance to that allure
                     in romances like 
                     “Isabella,”
                      whose gross and “wormy circumstance” mocked the standard romance-reader, and 
                     “The Eve of St. Agnes,”
                      where a sexually explicit depiction of Porphyro’s encounter with “hoodwinked” Madeline
                     was deemed “unfit for ladies” by his friend Richard Woodhouse and frustrated Taylor
                     by tacitly refusing a wider readership (<em>Letters</em> II: 163). “I feel it in my power to become a popular writer—I feel it in my strength
                     to refuse the poisonous suffrage of a public” (<em>Letters</em> II: 146): Keats distinguished his ability to produce sensational, “overwrought” content
                     from the “strength” required to assimilate that content to a rigorously wrought form.
                     That capacity to aesthetically process and transform sensuous and complex experience
                     would come to be seen as the hallmark of Keatsian maturity—as in his acclaimed ode,
                     which distills the romances’ “unfit” sexual scenarios into an aesthetic encounter
                     fit for a museum, with a male viewer who “haunts about th[e] shape” of an ancient
                     artifact figured as an inaccessible “bride,” and a “leaf-fring’d legend” whose images
                     of “violent love-making” (as Brooks describes) merge with the total form of a Greek
                     vase (
                     “History Without Footnotes”
                      93).

                              the poem by canonical Keats criticism, though with quite variable emphases (46).</span></div>

               <p>Keats’s ambivalence about “the poisonous suffrage of the public,” which in the Keatsian
                  narrative connotes his “maturity” as well, offers an alternative way of understanding
                  his exceptional appeal to New Critics, who evince a similar jumble of popularizing
                  and gatekeeping impulses. The rise of close reading in the mid-twentieth-century classroom,
                  in Doug Mao’s words, “seemed happily timed to address the newly broad composition
                  of collegiate student bodies, and in this sense to participate in a further democratization
                  of American society” (246). But Mao’s judicious phrasing reflects some of the contentious
                  assertions about readers made by the New Criticism’s leading figures—John Crowe Ransom
                  railing against what he called the “low grade” taste of “the participating millions”
                  (<em>World’s Body</em> 280); Allen Tate condemning “egalitarian superstition” (<em>Essays</em> 527); Brooks pitting the mature reader of poetry against the “desperately bad” taste
                  of a “young lady … in raptures over her confessions magazine” (<em>Well Wrought Urn</em> 233). In <em>Cultural Capital</em>, John Guillory gives such assertions an institutional context, by presenting the
                  New Criticism as an attempt to re-order the field of literary studies and, with it,
                  American culture as a whole. “The retreat of literary culture into the university
                  can be understood as a kind of transcendence of the cultural conditions of modernity”
                  (165), writes Guillory: “In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult,
                  students also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied <em>in the university</em>” (173). Approaching the formalist turn as a disciplinary response to a looming sense
                  of cultural disorder, Guillory argues that the withdrawal of poetry into the seminar-room
                  made literature “more difficult to consume outside the school” (174). The blossoming
                  of close reading as the central activity of literary studies, in this thesis, corresponds
                  with poetry’s retreat from public culture into a mature and masculine exclusivity,
                  with “the urn as a figure for the enclosure of literary culture in the academy” (166).</p>
               <p>Brooks’s writing, which frequently turns polemical, gives the critic of elitism plenty
                  to work with. Even when displaying his belief in what could make poetry genuinely
                  popular, he laments those forms of popular culture that serve as distracting alternatives.
                  “Even people who think that they care nothing for poetry have interests which are
                  the same as those satisfied by poetry,” he tells us; “they listen to speeches, go
                  to church, view television programs, read magazine stories or the gossip columns of
                  newspapers” (Brooks and Warren, <em>Understanding Poetry</em> 21). These distractions are associated with an urgent crisis of language and imagination:
                  “Never has language taken such a pounding perhaps in our history,” Brooks says, citing
                  “what happens to [it] as it is used day in and day out by the journalist, the advertising
                  man, the Tin Pan Alley lyricist, the class B movie script writer, the politician,
                  and the bureaucrat” (
                  “Literature as Paideia”
                  ). In <em>The Hidden God</em> (1963), he cites “the pressure of the popular arts” as particularly damaging, noting
                  that if Wordsworth “claimed that the imagination was being strangled by the more sensational
                  popular arts,” then “cheap fiction, Tin Pan Alley, the movies, the radio, and now
                  television makes what Wordsworth faced in 1800 seem very mild indeed” (3). Brooks
                  was every bit at ease in dismissing popular culture as he was in citing Cole Porter
                  or Alley-Oop to do so, and this rhetorical flair is part of his power as a prose stylist.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Approaching the question of access to literary culture in terms of Brooks’s cultural
                     polemics, however, keeps us from seeing the more paradoxical aspects of a close-reading
                     practice that would come to be widely understood as a catalyst for inclusivity.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Graff writes that “putting the emphasis on the literary text itself … seemed a tactic
                              ideally suited to a new, mass student body that could not be depended on to bring
                              to the university any common cultural background” (173). As Guillory points out (168),
                              Graff makes no claim for the democratizing intentions of new-critical pedagogy, yet
                              the basic association between the democratization of culture and new-critical pedagogy
                              is nonetheless common. For an example of the optimistic rhetoric, see Holland: “The
                              ‘New Criticism’ opened the great tradition of English literature to people of any

                     </div> We do better by attending to the exacting labor that most preoccupied Brooks and his
                     colleagues: close reading itself. In this essay I turn to his central methodological
                     demonstration, 
                     “Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History Without Footnotes.”
                      Despite its starring role in <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em>, this study of 
                     “Ode on a Grecian Urn”
                      is known more for its broadest strokes than for its finer brushwork. But it rewards
                     careful scrutiny. The essay shows Brooks dramatizing close reading as a collective
                     practice that hedges against the alienation of modern life by nourishing an intimate
                     community whose members attend, all at once, to the same thing. Indeed, in the idealized
                     new-critical seminar, poetry becomes genuinely popular again: the modern reading public
                     may be defined by the fact that authors no longer know the people for whom they write,
                     but Brooksian reading turns back the clock, not only by drawing a poem near to its
                     reader, but by drawing readers near to one another. More restrained than, say, the
                     radical formalism of Theodor Adorno, which allowed art to float free of social instrumentality
                     as part of a broader revolutionary program, the reading-practice Brooks articulates
                     in his study of Keats respects the autonomy of art but is itself infused with social
                     and moral purpose. The scene of close reading brings into being a communal formation,
                     call it “the classroom public,” which is not easily pinned down, politically speaking,
                     and which idealistically figures present as well as future scenes of reading as sites
                     of social inclusion, even as it nostalgically summons some of Agrarianism’s more conservative

               <h2><span class="head">II. ‘On a level’: Close Readers in the Ivory Tower</span></h2>
               <p>The idea that close reading enabled “a counter-hierarchical pedagogy” has been part
                  of the discipline’s self-narration dating back almost to the new-critical era itself.
                  Addressing Yale’s incoming graduate cohort in 1966, Pottle, who was then the English
                  department’s DGS, described the vivifying effect of new-critical pedagogy. An eminent
                  historicist and one of Brooks’s most formidable antagonists in the 1940s and 1950s,
                  Pottle told the new arrivals that the entrenched practice of close reading had effectively
                  lightened the weight of canonical authority. Graduate students were no longer “over-awed
                  by previous judgments,” he said; “No doubt this has made the study of literature more
                  exciting.” And as with canonical authority, so too with professorial authority: the
                  student now is “on a level with the instructor, or even above him. Nobody has to be
                  a specialist or even learned.” The result was “a sense of wide horizons, room for
                  discovery, [and] encouragement of the combative sense” (
                  “Current Developments”
                  )—this latter encouragement hinting that students were freshly empowered to wage intellectual
                  battle with their professors.</p>
               <p>To an extent, we discern in these words a kindly welcome meant to put an anxious clatch
                  of doctoral candidates at ease. <em>Don’t be nervous about your seminar with Misters Brooks, Wimsatt, or even Bloom</em>, Pottle implies; <em>nowadays the student is on a level with the instructor, or even above him</em>. Pottle also reproduces a familiar image of the New Critic as pedagogue, one that
                  was born with the 1938 publication of the teaching anthology <em>Understanding Poetry</em> and flourished with the democratization of higher education: <em>Nobody has to be a specialist or even learned</em>. But while the New Critics’ close reading techniques facilitated participation among
                  students of varying educational backgrounds, a new academic egalitarianism was not
                  in their purview. The odd mixture of anti-industrialist populism and aristocratic
                  sensibility that defines the original Agrarian position in part helps to explain this
                  split-seam within new-critical thought. At issue here are two competing notions of
                  humanities education prominent in the emerging modern university of the 1930s and
                  1940s: the <em>liberal-free</em> and the <em>oratorical</em>. The liberal-free ideal, grounded in the Enlightenment, is critical in orientation,
                  devoted to open-ended inquiry and to the production and accumulation of knowledge,
                  as opposed to the dissemination of information (Harpham 11–13). Its concern is for
                  students’ growth; in the liberal-free university, “maturity” is about learning how
                  to think and is achieved through “an emphasis on freedom, especially freedom from
                  tradition and a priori strictures and standards” (Kimball 119). Conversely, in the
                  oratorical tradition, “maturity” is about learning <em>what</em> to think. Grounded in Plato and fortified by thinkers like Arnold and Newman, the
                  oratorical approach is cultural in orientation, devoted to the passing-down of specific
                  knowledge, “the tradition of great texts” (Kimball 238), moral values, and the preservation
                  of an existing idea of culture (Harpham 12–13). The mainstream of new-critical practice
                  effectively straddled these two approaches to education. It combined a potentially
                  disruptive emphasis on criticism (versus philology, historicism, ethics) with a countervailing
                  dedication to high culture. In this doubled thinking, the New Criticism practically
                  wrote its own contradictory legacy as a movement that is as much praised for its progressive
                  and egalitarian tendencies as disparaged for its consolidation of a restrictive view
                  of the literary.</p>
               <p>On the one hand, then, the new-critical emphasis on <em>understanding</em> poetry suited a disciplinary ideal of literature as a subject distinct from the sciences,
                  a subject in which knowledge was a process rather than an outcome. It could not be
                  properly understood through the dissemination of facts, or through the paraphrasing
                  of its content, or through the appreciation of its aesthetic pleasures; it was instead
                  a provocation, a focus for hard thinking, a basis for maturation. By engaging meaningfully
                  with literature, adolescents learning to navigate the modern world learned how to
                  think and act like adults. As they learned to take responsibility for their independent
                  taste-judgments, though, they did so under the tutelage of professors who espoused
                  and maintained a definite taste-hierarchy, in which the most difficult of literary
                  works, which challenged readers with their ambiguities, tensions, and paradoxes, were
                  explicitly set above the modern forms of cultural production that were so alluring
                  to young people—radio, films, magazines, as well as the supposedly “immature” and
                  “sentimental” poetry by writers like Shelley or Joyce Kilmer. A mature literature
                  was touted as a difficult literature, and by providing students the tools to decipher
                  its meanings, the New Criticism could be seen as providing access to the cultural
                  capital that it historically represented, while securing the legitimacy of humanities
                  study more generally.</p>
               <p>The collegiate public was beginning to look different in the 1940s: if the public
                  for classic poetry in America was coming to be centered in the universities, those
                  universities were themselves becoming more representative of a wider public. Enrollments
                  soared through the decade, as media coverage popularized the idea of common Americans
                  “storming the ivory tower” (Clark 174). Although this expansion of opportunity did
                  not yet extend to American minorities, who remained subject to both explicit and de
                  facto forms of segregation, nonetheless “the college degree itself was transformed
                  in the 1940s from a document earned primarily by members of the American upper class”
                  (Ciabattari xix). The reading community taking shape in the American classroom during
                  and after the second World War, drawn from a range of educational backgrounds, was
                  thus a “fit audience though few” in the most perverse of ways, for it was precisely
                  its uneven fitness that conditioned its receptivity to the poetry that New Critics
                  wanted to teach.</p>
               <p>Not all professors of poetry were at ease with this shift toward a restricted collegiate
                  sphere. The poet Karl Shapiro, holding onto a romantic notion of the individual genius,
                  criticized the move of creative production into institutional settings, writing that
                  “Writers and artists have become professors, and young people of talent meet with
                  the creative spirit in an academic world” (208). For Shapiro, the influence of Brooks
                  and Warren, and the fact that <em>Understanding Poetry</em> represented “one of the most important works of the twentieth century,” was the sign
                  of a bigger problem: <span class="quote">‘It is the book that took poetry off the street and put it in the laboratory. It has
                     not only revolutionized the teaching of literature; it has practically put a stop
                     to genius. Every composition test and anthology shows its influence; the brainless
                     and beautiful poetry of our leading verse magazines derives from <em>Understanding Poetry</em>. The objectivity of such teaching tools prevents the young writer from creating standards
                     of his own. (208)’</span> Shapiro’s perception of student passivity (he calls this “the Brain-Washed Generation”)
                  is echoed by Joseph E. Baker, professor at Iowa, who grouses about the effect of close
                  reading on “young intellectuals” who “find no message in literature and therefore
                  as a literary generation have no message at all to give to the public.” Baker blames
                  “a demolition squad of English professors, a small but aggressive minority within
                  their own departments, hard at work with the efficiency of doctrinaires,” for training
                  students to “handle a poem like a cross-word puzzle” (2). The new-critical assumption,
                  according to Baker, was that the “general public” for poetry was “in the classroom”—“that
                  literature is mainly to be written, and even read, in ivory towers”—but that the classroom
                  did not allow for conversation “about human problems, about life, about ideals and
                  eternal verities (3).</p>
               <p>Brooks’s assumptions about the so-called Ivory Tower, though, were different; he sought
                  to transform the concept. In a kind of urn-like chiasmus, he saw the popular as literary,
                  and the literary as popular: “it is possible to prove that certain … poets inhabit
                  the Ivory Tower by measuring the size of the reading public which appreciates them,”
                  he argued, “but it would be better to say that the public is in the Ivory Tower” because
                  of the “greater scope and breadth which the poetry of the obscure poets assimilates”
                  (<em>Modern Poetry</em> 67–68). In Brooks’s view, a public composed of student-readers would encounter through
                  poetry a totality of experience that belies the very concept of the Ivory Tower. This
                  was in keeping with the contemporary push to view College English as a curricular
                  space dedicated, in the words of Esther Raushenbush (who taught at Sarah Lawrence
                  and later became its president), to “helping [students] grow out of their adolescence
                  and become mature human beings” (v). The seminar promised a sort of coming-of-age,
                  in which students would learn to subordinate their personal interests to a supposedly
                  more mature and objective criticism. It also promised opportunities for moral edification—a
                  humanist aim that formalist readers were only too happy to claim for their own approach,
                  by suggesting the spiritual benefit that would come with practicing critical rigor.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The transformation of the collegiate public intensified after the war, when government
                     investment contributed to a near-total makeover of the nation’s classrooms. Under
                     the $5.5 billion GI Bill, war veterans became a prominent presence on campus, by dint
                     of sheer numbers and by their visible maturity and academic success. Keith Olson,
                     the leading historian of the GI Bill, reports that more than two million veterans
                     attended university in the half-decade following the war, one million in 1947–48 alone
                     (596, 602). Seventy percent of the class of 1949 were veterans (596). College attendance
                     was no longer the exclusive preserve of wealthy young elites, which it had been even
                     as late as the 1930s; it was “established as a social norm” (McGurl 66), more diverse
                     in terms of class, ethnicity, and religion, and with so many ex-servicemen, there
                     were even students of various age- and maturity-levels.

                              As Bailey explains, “Though African Americans and Latinos were as fully entitled to
                              benefits as white veterans, they faced much greater obstacles, from racial segregation
                              and discrimination in higher education to a much lower high-school graduation rate
                              that left black veterans less able to take advantage of education benefits” (98).

                     </div> Marriage had been grounds for dismissal before the war (Olson 606), but one of every
                     five veterans arrived on campus with a spouse, and many of them had babies (Frydl
                     314), meaning that for the first time there were students on campus who, instead of
                     being children, were themselves parents. In this way more than others, perhaps, the
                     GI Bill helped to unsettle the seemingly natural equivalence between college and a
                     specific period of life, “the adolescent years.” College came into its modern identity
                     as a mechanism or social instrument potentially applicable to all age-groups—“the
                     essential technology,” as Mark McGurl says, “for producing American egalitarianism
                     through meritocratic class mobility” (61).

                              ideological tools: “During the past sixty years or so, the higher-educational system
                              has been one of America’s most effective technologies for sustaining the ideology
                              of equal opportunities, and it has done this by orchestrating the myth of systemic

               <p>With enrollments nearly eighty percent higher than at the start of the decade, there
                  developed an “uncritical acceptance of largeness” (Olson 607) as a governing reality
                  of higher education: overcrowded sections, longer teaching hours, expanded course
                  offerings, towering dorms, and so forth (Frydl 316–18). The New Critics were alert
                  to this aspect of modern mass education, and in their pedagogy they sought ways of
                  containing or re-unifying its potentially disparate energies. In his 1938 essay 
                  “The Teaching of Poetry,”
                  Ransom had predicted that the radically non-historical approach of <em>Understanding Poetry</em> would make the classroom a space for active critical assessment rather than for the
                  passive reception of information—liberal-free rather than oratorical—changing the
                  very nature of English instruction while bringing new texts into discussions long-dominated
                  by classic ones (82–3). Ransom and his fellow Agrarians viewed lecture-style teaching
                  as “a technique of mass-production” (Davidson 34), whereas <em>criticism</em>, instead, was conceived as the basis for active and inclusive “public discussion”:
                  <span class="quote">‘The official Chaucer course is probably over ninety-five percent historical and linguistic,
                     and less than five percent aesthetic or critical. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
                     But it is not improved because the student has had to tie his tongue before it. It
                     is an artistic object, with a heroic human labor behind it, and on these terms it
                     calls for public discussion. The dialectical possibilities are limitless, and when
                     we begin to realize them we are engaged in criticism. (
                     “Criticism, Inc.”
                     102–3)’</span> The prevailing classroom approach, Ransom implies, was coercive. The student must
                  “tie his tongue” in a system of instruction based on the entrenched authority of “dryasdust
                  philology” (McGann 49) or professorial whimsy. Oratorical teaching was a form of discipline,
                  performed by “men who do little more than read well aloud, enforcing a private act
                  of appreciation upon the students” (99). Ransom’s antipathy to the existing curricular
                  order is crystalized by his comparison of the literature curriculum to a previous
                  generation’s idea of the art museum. “The professors so engaged”—that is, the professors
                  seeking to cultivate among students an unthinking reverence for the status quo—“are
                  properly curators,” he provocatively argues, “and the museum of which they have the
                  care is furnished with the cherished literary masterpieces, just as another museum
                  might be filled with paintings” (100).</p>
               <p>Yet his idealization of the seminar’s “public discussion” nonetheless drew on other
                  forms of scholarly authority. As Bonnie Smith has shown in <em>The Gender of History</em>, when the nineteenth-century concept and practice of the History Seminar traveled
                  from Europe to the United States, it conferred scientific legitimacy on historical
                  study (105–116; see also Mommsen 81–99 and Turner 299–310). The Johns Hopkins professor
                  Herbert Baxter Adams said that seminars were like “laboratories where books are treated
                  like mineralogical specimens, passed about from hand to hand examined, and tested”;
                  at Harvard, Ephraim Everton claimed that the “scientific method” embedded in the seminary
                  structure “would transform knowledge” (qtd. in Smith 105, 106). The seminar was egalitarian
                  in concept, a “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gesellschaft</span>, a society, a club,” as Everton put it, “presided over by a professor, but composed,
                  not of subject students, but of members” (qtd. in Smith 107). It was also a specifically
                  masculine space, as Smith argues: “From the beginning, the seminar member was considered
                  a kind of participatory, universal citizen who was implicitly gendered male and whose
                  autonomy was shored up by the excluded and dependent status of women” (113). Ransom’s
                  liberal-free ideal of the new-critical seminar was a similarly legitimizing concept,
                  which coopted the prestige and the manliness of historiography, as it merged (through
                  the close reading of individual poems) professional training and evidentiary pursuit.</p>
               <p>This ideal of the seminar as an egalitarian space, dedicated to “public discussion”
                  among mature participants, is one of the enduring legacies of the American New Criticism.
                  But this even plane was hard to actualize, particularly given the knowledge hierarchy
                  endemic to the academy. At LSU in the 1930s, Brooks tried to foster discussion by
                  freely incorporating popular culture in his teaching, both to help him connect with
                  students and to help students connect with the world of poetry. Teaching metaphor,
                  for instance, he used cigarette ads to show how the girl in an advertisement bears
                  a merely metaphorical relationship to the taste of the cigarette, a strategy designed
                  (as he recalls) “to pry off the museum glass” from poems. Making poems more accessible,
                  though, hardly erased his evident authority—if anything, it enhanced it. In the 1960s,
                  under pressure to get more popular culture into later editions of <em>Understanding Poetry</em>, in order to appeal more directly to the student market, Brooks and (Robert Penn)
                  Warren set Cole Porter’s 
                  “You’re the Top”
                  alongside Cleopatra’s lament for Mark Antony. “Cole Porter is no Shakespeare,” Brooks
                  clarified in his 
                  “Instructor’s Manual”
                  —addressed to teachers, not students—but the comparison between Tin Pan Alley lyricist
                  and Renaissance poet would nonetheless helpfully “remind the student that interesting
                  metaphor can be found outside the collected poems of a renowned author.”</p>
               <p>It was a delicate balance to strike, between appealing to students’ sensibilities
                  and preserving the centrality of the literary work. The seminary imperative required
                  a certain give-and-take on the part of professors, a softening of some distinctions
                  and a reinforcement of others, and this was an even more delicate matter when it came
                  to the choreography of the discussion. The Keats scholar Jack Stillinger describes
                  the challenges of his own early pedagogy. Stillinger, who entered college in the late
                  1940s and started teaching in the mid 1950s, recalls “posing Brooks-and-Warren-like
                  questions” to his classes but finding dialogue almost impossible to sustain: “class
                  ‘discussion’ inevitably turned into lecture,” he writes, and “the students didn’t
                  seem to mind”: “when it came to class discussion—Ph.D. professor in the front of the
                  room, face to face with freshman and sophomores who had hardly any experience of life
                  or literature or even much knowledge of the English language—some individual readers
                  were thought to be superior to some others” (Stillinger). Anyone who has facilitated
                  a close reading among a group of students can probably identify with Stillinger’s
                  struggle, and it could only have been harder at mid-century, when it was so novel
                  a classroom approach that students were unprepared to play along. When Ransom joined
                  the Vanderbilt faculty in 1914, the curriculum was organized entirely along historical
                  lines: students were expected to remember “the names, titles, and facts of English
                  literature” and “to memorize the five thousand or so lines that in the opinion of
                  their instructor were most representative of their literary heritage.” Yet Ransom
                  “almost immediately” began teaching in the mode that Brooks and Warren would later
                  codify in <em>Understanding Poetry</em>, and a Kenyon undergraduate in the 1950s recalled Ransom as “very nearly incapable
                  of giving a formal lecture”: “The effect was one of complete formlessness, but, in
                  retrospect, it all seems to have been done with a great deal of precision” (qtd. in
                  Young 417).</p>
               <p>The ability to straddle the line separating “formlessness” and “precision” was essential
                  for teachers who brought collective close reading to the center of their classroom
                  practice. Not everyone succeeded. Despite the mythology, New Critics were sometimes
                  thought of as <em>bad</em> teachers: “the ‘new critics’ often talk over their students’ heads,” Robert Withington,
                  a professor at Smith College, wrote in <em>College English</em> in 1950; “The critic is, too often, not a teacher” (282). This was rivalry, in part—the
                  pushback of the historicist lecturer for whom facilitating critical discussion did
                  not count as “teaching”—but the praise lavished on certain New Critics nonetheless
                  indicates that great teaching was neither easy to come by nor often found.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One iconic new-critical pedagogue, Austin Warren, excelled by negotiating so adeptly
                     the conflicting demands of class discussion. Though he is best known for co-authoring <em>Theory of Literature</em> with his Iowa colleague Renê Wellek, Warren took special pride (and found his deepest
                     sustenance) in teaching. His new-critical style is Keatsian, predicated on empathy
                     and an almost novelistic ability to inhabit other voices: reluctant “to argue for
                     a position put forward as my own,” he sought instead “to exposit sympathetically the
                     view of the author whose text was before us, or to articulate for an inarticulate
                     student what I divined his own views to be” (
                     “In Search”
                      25). Myron Simon, a longtime UC Irvine professor who took Warren’s undergraduate American
                     literature survey at Michigan in 1948, recalled how the teacher “promptly disturbed
                     the mild air of the lecture room” with his care for “rebel voices” (118), seeking
                     “to build a community in the classroom by making the relation between teacher and
                     student a reciprocal one” (125–26). Yet Warren’s explicit deferral of authority was
                     shadowed by an awareness of his power. He reflected that, in ceding authority to students
                     by placing their arguments at the center of discussion, he still could call on “the
                     seductive powers of a teacher’s personality and voice” (
                     “In Search”
                      25). In a short tract on teaching which he contributed to <em>PMLA</em> in 1955 (which he believed to be the very first pedagogical piece ever to appear in
                     that journal), he wrote that “intellectual honesty” demanded “that the teacher shall
                     not limit himself to asking the students: ‘what do <em>you</em> think?’,” adding: “Empathy is next to essential, but it is dangerous also.”

               <p>Brooks’s own, famously agile teaching was distinguished by the ability to manage these
                  contradictions of the new-critical style. His reputation as an exemplary choreographer
                  of discussion preceded him when he moved from LSU to Yale in the late 1940s. A comic
                  poem published in <em>The Yale Record</em>, 
                  “Mistah Brooks – he here,”
                  commemorated his arrival in New Haven by detailing how “carefully, intimately” he
                  performed his role as a close reader at the head of the classroom: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">The Yalemen come, the English majors, the hangers-on, the dreamy architects,</div>

               </blockquote>
               <p> What stands out here is the way the student-writer portrays Brooks’s careful calibration
                  of professorial authority. As a teacher he meticulously stages a nearly invisible
                  authority, the appearance of reciprocity masking the fact that authority moves in
                  one direction only: “He suggests”; “And they listen”; “And they understand.” Whereas
                  Stillinger in the 1950s—and many of us still today—struggled with the contradictory
                  demands of the student-oriented classroom, Brooks displays an agility that would be
                  unique in any case, but which is especially striking for the 1940s, when “straightaway
                  lecturing” was the norm (Stewart 107).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Brooks no doubt would have felt the difference between teaching at a large land-grant
                     institution and at an elite private university, no matter how much the GI Bill unsettled
                     the cozy homogeneity of the seminar room after the war. His students in Louisiana
                     would mostly have arrived at college with the expectation of learning a trade; the
                     older pedagogical model in which pedantic professors dispensed facts about literature
                     would not have roiled their expectations in the least. At Yale, though, students mostly
                     hailed from New England boarding schools, and Brooks would have met there with a confident
                     and cliquish sense of privilege that made student participation both easier to come
                     by and more crucial to keep in check. While the diminished stress on learnedness contributed
                     to leveling the relations between professor and student, we should not overstate the
                     degree to which close reading superseded context in Brooks’s classes. Brooks took
                     a pragmatically eclectic approach to teaching. Former students have remarked on his
                     inclusive, outside-in classroom approach, by which he framed the work of close reading
                     by always beginning with historical and biographical details external to the text.
                     Susan Wolfson writes, citing the Shakespearean Lawrence Danson (a former student of
                     Brooks), that in graduate seminars “the first half of the term was spent reading historical
                     background, biography, and literary history, the second half reading the poetry. While
                     the curriculum was not dialectical, it was also not exclusionary.”

                     </div> This feature of Brooks’s teaching method is confirmed by the many typed-out lectures
                     preserved among his papers, which regularly intersperse historical and biographical
                     information with occasional close readings. In guiding students through poems, as
                     Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernan have recently shown, he “works to make his classroom
                     as self-contained as good poems should be and guards against a referentiality that
                     would connect his classroom to the world in nonfigural ways.” But he also freely brings
                     biographical and cultural contexts to bear when they can be of assistance, and rather
                     than belabor the “unity” of individual poems, he more often attends to the images,
                     metaphors, and diction of individual passages read in isolation, often in an appreciative
                     mode.

               <p>Still, if Brooks was more permissive of historical study in his teaching than he lets
                  on in his criticism, among undergraduates—who could compare his approach with traditional,
                  historical professors—he seemed downright revolutionary. In the <em>Yale Course Critique</em> of 1963 a student publication, a review of his course on 
                  “Contemporary Poetic Theory and Practice”
                  praised his “informal approach” in the classroom as a consequence of his formal approach
                  to poems: <span class="quote">‘Few students take notes. Aesthetic analysis in the manner of the New Critics is stressed
                     while the historical, sociological, and psychological aspects are necessarily de-emphasized.
                     A great deal of personal interest and initiative are necessary for the student to
                     gain from the informal approach since Mr. Brooks emphatically does not ‘spoon-feed’
                     his students with factual information about the modern poets. (
                     “English 71”
                     28)’</span> Transcripts of this same class, preserved in Yale’s Beinecke Library, confirm this
                  informality. At one point, when one of the students is trying to describe his boredom
                  at Archibald Macleish’s insistence on illustrating every one of his poetic statements,
                  the transcriber inserts a stage-direction: “as opens eye with a thumb.” This moment
                  (the student gesturally describing his boredom) shows how easy Brooks’s students felt
                  in class; they did not always passively follow him and apparently felt comfortable
                  engaging with him in spite of his professorial mastery. Brooks, for his part, handles
                  the moment with characteristic complaisance: “Quite right. I don’t think we have any
                  basic disagreement here.” Students continue to break in on the lecture with questions
                  and comments, and he seamlessly merges each of their points into his flow. Analogous
                  to his work with poems, Brooks’s unifying impulse transforms haphazard classroom repartee
                  into the coherent discussion of a community bonded by his almost imperceptible guidance.</p>

               <p>“Brooks the critic emerged from Brooks the pedagogue,” Jewel Spears Brooker appreciatively
                  wrote in a 1995 review of his final, posthumous essays (131). But it works the other
                  way around, for Brooks, as well. The critic <em>is</em> a pedagogue, whose prose models the work of teaching and thematizes the teacher’s
                  orchestration of a reading undertaken by many people at once.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The gently wielded authority of the pedagogue and expert close reader features in
                     Brooks’s essay on Keats’s 
                     “Ode on a Grecian Urn,”
                      a landmark in the history of romantic criticism and his signature study “in the structure
                     of poetry.” First published in the 1944 <em>Sewanee Review</em> as 
                     “History without Footnotes: An Account of Keats’s Ode,”
                      the piece reappeared as chapter 7 of <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em>, title slightly modified: 
                     “Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History without Footnotes.”
                      (In both titles, Brooks playfully linked the essay’s lone footnote to that word.)
                     In it, Brooks answers the criticisms of T. S. Eliot, John Middleton Murry, and H.
                     W. Garrod, by accounting for the speech of the urn at the poem’s conclusion, what
                     Eliot had called “a serious blemish on a beautiful poem.” Brooks observes that “some
                     critics have felt that the unravished bride protests too much,” and he catalogs the
                     complaints, noting that the lines have been cast as “an intrusion on the poem,” as
                     a descent into messaging that “injures the poem” because it “does not grow out of
                     it” organically (89–90).

                     </div> This language of violation and injury was part of the new-critical playbook. Allen
                     Tate called the last stanza “an illicit commentary” and a “radical violation” (
                     “Reading”
                      195–6), and Earl Wasserman later observed that New Critics tended to figure the crossing
                     from one disciplinary mode or discourse into another as a sexual “transgression,”
                     with the act of “reaching outside the text for information” akin to straying beyond
                     the marital bond between text and reader. “Most explicators are sensible men,” Wasserman
                     writes, who “wish the work of art were so self-sufficient it could not tempt them
                     to sin” (3).</p>
               </div>
               <p>This question of formal “violation” is precisely what Brooks claims as his special
                  interest in the ode. It is “as neat an instance as one could wish” (92) of “the problem
                  of belief” (90), as I. A. Richards termed the relation between a poem’s aesthetic
                  quality and the verity of its assertions. Exploring this instance, Brooks recasts
                  the urn’s speech as a problem not of content (the closing statement’s “truth or falsity”)
                  but of context (whether the statement “was properly prepared for”). “The very ambiguity
                  of the statement, ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’ ought to warn us against insisting
                  very much on the statement in isolation,” he argues, “and to drive us back to a consideration
                  of the context in which the statement is set” (90). The poem’s most celebrated lines,
                  in other words, should matter less than the structure in which they appear. Brooks
                  thus pursues his account of Keats’s ode as what he calls a “test”—an endeavor to see
                  whether those lines are indeed a “blemish,” or whether they are “dramatically appropriate”
                  (91).</p>
               <p>Brooks begins his essay by casting aside extra-poetic materials (“Keats’ reading,
                  his conversation, his letters”), leaving a reader face-to-face with the poem itself
                  (91). The effect is both personalizing and de-personalizing. On the one hand, the
                  reader is enfranchised to make judgments; on the other hand, those judgments are to
                  be based on an empirical procedure. Accordingly, Brooks relinquishes his own speaking
                  “I,” writing in the passive voice: “The poem is to be read in order to see whether
                  the last lines of the poem are not, after all, dramatically prepared for” (92). What
                  Brooks calls “the paradox of the speaking urn” (100)—the notion, quoting Archibald
                  Macleish, that “poems should not mean / But be” (89)—morphs into a matching paradox,
                  that of the speaking critic. Just as poems should avoid making direct statements,
                  so critics should demonstrate like scientists. <em>The poem is to be read.</em></p>
               <p>This distancing of the reader, however, is followed by a minor crisis in the identity
                  of that reader, who Brooks exhorts: <span class="quote">‘Yet there are some claims to be made upon the reader too, claims which he, for his
                     part, will have to be prepared to honor. He must not be allowed to dismiss the early
                     characterizations of the urn as merely so much vaguely beautiful description. He must
                     not be too much surprised if ‘mere decoration’ turns out to be meaningful symbolism—or
                     if ironies develop where he has been taught to expect only sensuous pictures. Most
                     of all, if the teasing riddle spoken finally by the urn is not to strike him as bewildering
                     break in tone, he must not be too much disturbed to have the element of paradox latent
                     in the poem emphasized, even in those parts of the poem which have none of the energetic
                     crackle of wit with which he usually associates paradox. This is surely not too much
                     to ask of the reader—namely to assume that Keats meant what he said and that he chose
                     his words with care. (92) ’</span> While there’s some risk in over-reading Brooks’s characteristically qualified idiom,
                  it is not at all clear just who this “reader” is—whether Brooks is describing, in
                  the third-person, <em>his own task</em> in the essay, or whether he is simply dramatizing a reading-practice that he expects
                  <em>his readers</em> to imitate. Helen Vendler writes that “lyric is a role offered to a reader” (181);
                  for Brooks, <em>criticism</em> is a role offered to a reader, with detailed stage directions. The refrain “He must
                  not be,” repeated three times, catalogs the trained responses to Keats’s ode that
                  readers should resist. With the flatly ironic “This is surely not too much to ask,”
                  Brooks admits that to pay strict attention to the words on the page is, in fact, a
                  lot to ask for readers accustomed to seeking out messages or history. Even beyond
                  these echoing <em>musts</em>, a subtle air of coercion haunts the essay’s vocabulary—readers are “<em>forced</em> to conclude” (90), or “<em>forced</em> to accept” (94)—suggesting that good close reading means repeatedly resisting one’s
                  scholarly conditioning. This recurrent idiom of force suggests that it’s not the artwork
                  that awaits ravishment by a reader, but readers who are always potentially ravished
                  by conventional disciplinary practices.</p>
               <p>Within 
                  “Keats’ Sylvan Historian,”
                  Brooks reveals his own coercive streak as an integral part of the drama of reading.
                  For all his probity and care to anchor statements in the evidence supplied by the
                  poem, he also has a penchant for drawing attention to those moments when probity fails
                  him. A seemingly minor instance occurs early in the essay, when he somewhat misleadingly
                  quotes from stanza five: “…the urn, like the ‘leaf-fring’d legend’ which it tells,
                  is covered with emblems of the fields and forests: ‘Overwrought / With forest branches
                  and the trodden weed’” (92). Is it the <em>urn</em> that is <em>overwrought with natural emblems</em>, as Brooks here suggests, or the <em>maidens</em> pictured on its side who are <em>overwrought with emotion</em>? We can read it either way; the ambiguity lies in the enjambment. This movement of
                  poetry in time, the way its meanings shift with the turn of the line, is an important
                  feature of a poem that in Brooks’s own account pits the nominal against the participial
                  and verbal—“frozen, fixed, arrested” figures against “flesh-and-blood men and women,”
                  a world “beyond time” against “our time-ridden minds” (99). But Brooks does not acknowledge
                  this other way of reading “overwrought”; indeed by capitalizing the word he actively
                  dismisses any other reading, giving the impression that the reference moves only forward.
                  Can he have missed the ambiguity? It’s not likely—and later in the essay he quotes
                  the very same passage from the other side: “…the rich, almost breathing world which
                  the poet has conjured up for us contracts and hardens into the decorated motifs on
                  the urn itself: ‘with brede / Of marble men and maidens over-wrought’” (99). Here
                  “over-wrought”—now hyphenated, but neither capitalized nor enjambed—is presented (again
                  unambiguously) as a postpositive adjective. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to
                  catch Brooks out in a bit of expository duplicity, or to suggest a lack of care for
                  words that Keats “chose … with care,” but simply to show how peculiar, even playful,
                  his reading practice can be. It is possible that he’s making, or more properly <em>dramatizing</em>, a point, namely that poetic evidence is never entirely stable. The figure of the
                  “well wrought urn,” often misread as a figure for radically internalist understandings
                  of the autonomous aesthetic object, allows room for deviance. The poet chooses his
                  words with care—but so does the critic. The notion of an impartial reader who dutifully
                  extricates and explicates the truth of the text itself is something of a fiction,
                  and as much as we think of Brooks as a careful reader always faithful to the text
                  itself, here is a counter-instance in which he proves liberal, careless, mischievous
                  with the text (readers can decide which it is). And, for an even more striking example
                  of this, I turn in closing to what I consider the essay’s strangest moment: when Brooks
                  considers the “little town” and “green altar” of stanza four.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5">
               <h2><span class="head">IV. ‘A poignance beyond anything else’: Brooks’s Stranger</span></h2>
               <p>William Empson complained of Brooks’s “anti-emotional bias” (
                  “Darling”
                  697), but there is none of that in Brooks’s admiring consideration of stanza four.
                  Drawn to its “poignance beyond anything else in the poem” (97–98), Brooks is especially
                  taken with the way that the fancied town in this stanza embodies his notion of rural
                  “communal life” (96), its “strange emptiness” implying a vanishing world whose culture
                  was rural and organic, rather than urban and commercial. Though Keats “goes out of
                  his way to leave us the widest possible option in locating” the town—“It may be a
                  mountain town, or a river town, or a tiny seaport”—its “essential character” is clear
                  enough to him: <span class="quote">‘it is small, it is quiet, its people are knit together as an organic whole, and on
                     a ‘pious morn’ such as this, its whole population has turned out to take part in the
                     ritual…. [T]here is the suggestion that the little town is caught in a curve of the
                     seashore, or nestled in a fold of the mountains—at any rate, is something secluded
                     and something naturally related to its terrain. (97) ’</span> Brooks’s description of this notional town, whose “people are knit together as an
                  organic whole,” brings to mind the fading agricultural communities of the deep South,
                  which the Agrarian polemics of <em>I’ll Take My Stand</em> (1930) had idealized. He once argued that <em>Light in August</em> could not survive a transplant “to the east side of Manhattan Island” because “community,
                  in Faulkner’s sense, does not exist” there (
                  “Southern”
                  250). But it exists here in stanza four.</p>
               <p>Something quietly troubles Brooks about this stanza, though, and in an odd parenthesis,
                  he admits to being puzzled by one of its lines, the line addressed to the abandoned
                  town: “and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate, can ere return.” He solves
                  his confusion by devising an anonymous stranger, a future visitor who has stumbled
                  into the abandoned town, to stand in as the object of the line’s address: “(I can
                  see no other interpretation of the line, ‘and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate
                  can ere return’)” (98). William Empson would solve it differently, paraphrasing the
                  line, instead, as addressed to the members of the procession: “none of them will ever
                  go home again, so that their town will be mysteriously desolate” (<em>Structure</em> 369). Oddly, neither of these exemplary close readers, Brooks nor Empson, can abide
                  an apostrophe to a merely hypothetical, empty locale; both are compelled to read the
                  address as directed to <em>somebody</em>. But Brooks, unlike Empson, invents his human addressee, casually inserting the stray
                  detail of this “stranger” into the poem: <span class="quote">‘The little town which has been merely implied by the procession portrayed on the
                     urn is endowed with a poignance beyond anything else in the poem. Its streets will
                     ‘for evermore be silent,’ its desolation forever shrouded in a mystery. <em>No one in the figured procession will ever be able to go back to the town to break
                        the silence there, not even one to tell the stranger there why the town remains desolate.</em> (97–98; emphasis added)’</span> Who is “the stranger there,” and where did he come from? However one reads the ode,
                  <em>there is no stranger there</em>. Practically winking at his reader, Brooks adds: “If one attends closely to what
                  Keats is doing here, he may easily come to feel that the poet is indulging himself
                  in an ingenious fancy” (98).</p>
               <p>Of course it is the critic “indulging himself in an ingenious fancy,” inventing a
                  human figure who mediates the affect, the “poignance,” of the town for the community
                  of readers attending closely to Keats’s poem: <span class="quote">‘The poet, by pretending to take the town as real—so real that he can imagine the
                     effect of its silent streets upon the stranger who chances to come into it—has suggested
                     in the most powerful way that he can its essential reality for him—<em>and for us</em>. It is a case of the doctor’s taking his own medicine: the poet is prepared to stand
                     by the illusion of his own making. (101; emphasis added)’</span> Analysis has brought Brooks so far into the poem’s world, has made him so alive to
                  its conjurings, that he and his fellow readers (now generously included in the consensual
                  “us”) encounter this enigmatic wanderer on the little town’s silent streets as a real
                  being, and enter into a “mythic history” of this fictional town that he calls “richer
                  and more interesting than the history of actual cities” (98). Why does Brooks insert
                  this stranger, an “illusion of his own making” (101)? Why insist on a human recipient
                  of the speaker’s address, a human witness to the town’s poignancy, a human wonderer
                  at its incomprehensible emptiness? Might the stranger be a figure for Brooks himself—the
                  professional critic gazing longingly upon the Agrarian origins that he has since abandoned
                  on the procession toward the green institutional altars of academe?</p>
               <p>Ruminating on this stranger’s presence can help us to understand why Keats’s Ode suits
                  Brooks’s purpose in <em>The Well Wrought Urn</em>. The poem may represent a free-standing aesthetic artifact, but this is finally less
                  significant than the fact that it represents a <em>reader</em>, interrogating the urn to make human sense of it (see Wolfson 301–5, 317–28). By
                  inventing this stranger, Brooks effectively duplicates the dramatic tableau of the
                  poem as a whole. The stranger in an abandoned town—like the questioner of the urn
                  and like the reader of the poem—wonders at a past that he cannot begin to comprehend.
                  Moreover, that act of reading calls into existence a small community of <em>other readers</em>, who attend all at once to the same thing—to the urn, the pictures on its surface,
                  and the conjurings beyond it. By becoming one of those readers ourselves, reading
                  Brooks reading, we join this quasi-organic community.</p>
               <p>It is a dynamic that, for Brooks, bears a clear moral and social value. This is evident
                  in his affection for the imaginary town as the lost site of a genuinely popular form
                  of art. There are two ways of thinking about popular art: as an art of the people,
                  which organically expresses the will of the community from which it emanates (this
                  is the idealized sense of a socialist art that is so well-integrated into society
                  that one ceases even to recognize it as art); and as an art that is artificially popularized
                  by modern means (this is the vitiated sense of mainstream media and consumable mass
                  entertainment). Brooks might accept that a genuinely and organically popular form
                  of culture is no longer possible in a modern world, but he locates in close, collective
                  reading an antidote to the enervating and commercial versions of popular culture.
                  By turning Keats’s imaginary town into a version of the Southern agricultural idyll,
                  he also reminds us of something that’s easy to forget in our disciplinary histories:
                  that the Agrarian ethos that helped give rise to close reading lingers on in the nostalgic
                  practices of modern literary studies, as a residual affect of that original ethos.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.6">
               <h2><span class="head">V. ‘Distrust is healthy’: A Community of Readers</span></h2>
               <p>In its idealized recuperation of this communal rapport, Brooks’s “agrarian anticapitalism”—Frederic
                  Jameson’s phrase for “the early New Criticism” (374)—departs from the aestheticist
                  anticapitalism of an avant-gardist like Adorno, for whom the purposelessness of the
                  artwork is precisely its parody of means-end capitalism. As Adorno writes in his late
                  fragmentary work, <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, the displacement of the artwork from its native soil allows for a salutary destruction
                  of its meaningfulness. It falls “helplessly mute before the question ‘What’s it for?’”;
                  its significance is its insignificance (121). For Adorno, it is when art is most visibly
                  estranged from the social, paradoxically, that society most powerfully exerts itself.
                  Brooks, on the other hand, evinces discomfort with “the strange emptiness of the little
                  town,” insisting instead on a human “stranger” to serve as recipient for the poem’s
                  apostrophe and as stand-in for the community of readers engaged with the poem. Where
                  Adorno would argue that “only what exists for its own sake, without regard to those
                  it is supposed to please, can fulfill its human end” (
                  “Valéry”
                  181), Brooksian analysis valorizes that human end. The “masochistic” project of “autonomous
                  art,” Sianne Ngai argues in an essay on Adorno, is “an incessant, guilt-ridden meditation
                  on its own social impotence” (843), but Brooks denies that impotence, viewing close
                  reading as an activity imbued with social and moral value, in its potential for returning
                  a less alienated relationship with the products of culture and, in an sense, with
                  the community that those products stand in for.</p>
               <p>In 1949, Brooks went on a New Haven radio program, <em>Yale Interprets the News</em>, to discuss “the difficulty of teaching literature to persons preoccupied by such
                  mass information media as the movies.” He explained afterwards to a reporter: “Small
                  wonder that the student sometimes feels that Shakespeare is dry and that modern poetry
                  is incomprehensible—remember that he is unconsciously measuring both by popular entertainment”
                  (
                  “Brooks Warns of Jeopardy to Education”
                  ). Such moments, in which Brooks registers a cultural polemical against popular consumer
                  culture, are among the loudest notes in his corpus, and they speak to his deeply felt
                  sense that something substantial was at stake in the direction of literary studies
                  and the practice of close reading. They are hardly representative, however, of a critic
                  whose main labors were the intensive and often playful analysis of literary texts,
                  and the genial modeling of such analysis in the literature classroom. By the 1950s
                  Brooks could jokingly refer to himself as “the monster” when introducing himself to
                  a new group of students, aware of the distance between his radical reputation and
                  genial demeanor: <span class="quote">‘“I want to warn you, you’re in the hands of the monster now.” These words, delivered
                     in the gentlest of border-state accents, were the first I ever heard Cleanth Brooks
                     utter. The year was 1951, the setting was a Yale College classroom. I was a junior,
                     and this was the opening session of Brooks’s class in modern poetry. (Gollin 257)
                     ’</span> This habit of self-deprecation belies the image of the cultural radical spearheading
                  a conservative revolution, while also indicating that the real revolution was taking
                  place more quietly, not in inflammatory claims about the dangers of popular culture,
                  but in the day-to-day work of a reading practice that was simultaneously public and
                  private.</p>
               <p>We learn more about Brooks, and more about new-critical cultural politics in general,
                  by carefully attending to this great bulk of his professional output. Brooks’s practice
                  as a close reader is more complex than its reputation suggests; indeed as we have
                  seen, it is sometimes downright bemusing, though to trace that bemusement can lead
                  us quite unexpectedly to the center of his thought. By reading Brooks reading, we
                  learn how to read some of his more extreme judgments as forays into the sensational
                  and too-loud world of public language—necessary advertising for a reticent practice.
                  And we might at the same time ponder the paradox at the end of 
                  “Keats’ Sylvan Historian,”
                  where he presents to readers (by this point a communal “we” encompassing teacher,
                  student, and colleague), as the poem’s ultimate assertion, a “healthy” skepticism
                  toward the free-standing statement—a “distrust” of the poem’s own words. He repeats
                  the word four times in his essay’s final three sentences, culminating in a statement
                  that might itself tease us out of thought: “Such a distrust is healthy. Keats’ sylvan
                  historian, who is not above teasing us, exhibits such a distrust, and perhaps the
                  point of what the sylvan historian ‘says’ is to confirm us in our distrust” (101).
                  The danger, it seems, is not that students might <em>dislike</em> poetry, that they might find Shakespeare “dry” or Eliot “incomprehensible,” but that
                  they might <em>trust it</em>, rather than training in themselves a healthy attitude of resistance—not just toward
                  poetry, but toward all of the claims that culture, in its disparate forms, makes on
                  us.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">The phrase “Keats’s well-wrought urn” appears, for instance, in Bornstein, p. 265;
               Dass, p. 36; Fairer, p. 32; Haw, p. 187; Richard Keller Simon, p. 123; and Vinegar

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">On eroticism in the ode, see Johnson, pp. 129–35; Pope; and Zeitlin. As Pope summarizes,
               the specter of sexual violence in the poem has long been recognized as a feature of
               the poem by canonical Keats criticism, though with quite variable emphases (46).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Graff writes that “putting the emphasis on the literary text itself … seemed a tactic
               ideally suited to a new, mass student body that could not be depended on to bring
               to the university any common cultural background” (173). As Guillory points out (168),
               Graff makes no claim for the democratizing intentions of new-critical pedagogy, yet
               the basic association between the democratization of culture and new-critical pedagogy
               is nonetheless common. For an example of the optimistic rhetoric, see Holland: “The
               ‘New Criticism’ opened the great tradition of English literature to people of any
               or no cultural inheritance…. In an upwardly mobile society, students whose parents
               had never graduated from high school could be <em>littérateurs</em>” (68). More nuanced, Mao enriches our understanding of this counter-hierarchical
               tendency by arguing that the New Criticism’s emphasis on the text-object in itself,
               rather than on the scholarly origins and contexts that enable its study, served a
               paradoxically leveling function: “the primary aim of the New Critics in this area
               was … to bring ‘difficult’ poetry to the widest possible audience by showing that
               one can engage complexity without devoting one’s lifetime to the mastery of historical
               and biographical contexts” (248).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">On the other hand, the impact of the G.I. Bill on racial equality was disappointing.
               As Bailey explains, “Though African Americans and Latinos were as fully entitled to
               benefits as white veterans, they faced much greater obstacles, from racial segregation
               and discrimination in higher education to a much lower high-school graduation rate
