                <p rend="noCount">How is the image of Keats “constellated,” as Walter Benjamin
                    might say, in the romanticisms of our contemporary popular culture? This essay
                    attempts to answer that question by exploring the “Keats effects” or what the
                    poet Frank O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the particular pulses of his poetic and
                    cultural charge, at the charged moment of his own popularity in and outside his
                    circle and as his poems and images have entered the currency of our own
                    contemporary cultural discourses, what biographers of Romantic poets like to
                    call our “popular imagination.” This essay pursues two discursive strains of the
                    Keats effects: on the one hand, the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider
                    and outsized Cockney ambitions, restless experimentation with revered and
                    popular forms, artistic and poetic allusions, complete with devoted fans and
                    fiercely reactionary enemies; and on the other hand, the indelible and affecting
                    record of personal pathos, the doomed poet whose fragile beauty is inseparable
                    from the poems themselves, their making, their reception, and the fate of their
                    maker. I consider how both of these Keats effects posit modes of impossibility
                    that remain impossibly beautiful. </p>

                <head>I. Two Images</head>
                <p>I begin with two charged examples of the Keats effects. The first, an image of
                    Keats in one of the last poems Frank O’Hara composed before he was killed by a
                    dune-buggy on Fire Island in the summer of 1966. It’s an eleven-line poem called
                    <title level="a">Again, John Keats, Or the Pot of Basil</title> which arrives at a Keatsian impasse:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>I have a pot of basil a friend gave</l>
                            <l>me and am reading Keats and realize</l>
                            <l>that everything is impossible in a different way</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent2">(<title level="m">Collected
                                Poems</title> 471–72, lines 7–10)</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote>
                    The gift of the basil from an unspecified
                    friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats that results in the poem’s central
                    event, a “realization” which offers no vision into the future, no way beyond the
                    impasse. I want to understand this last line, one arrived at by reading Keats
                    again: how is everything impossible <emph>but</emph> in a different
                    way? What does this revised impossibility mean for Keats and his historical
                    currency?</p>
                <p> For the second version of the Keats effects, I invoke the famous penciled image
                    Keats’s friend and companion Joseph Severn drew of the poet during a
                    long-suffering night in Rome in the weeks before his death: “Keats on his
                    death-bed,” an image that quickly became an icon of the passion of the poet,
                    that failing “lunger,” who knew long before the fact that “his name was writ in
                    water.” In Severn’s picture, Keats’s head rests on a pillow and in bed clothes
                    more suggested than drawn. More prominently, the artist has penciled two
                    concentric cones, a light exterior and dark interior cone which serve as contrast
                    to the three-quarter image of the sleeping poet. Thus does Severn, drawing this
                    picture at 3am to “keep awake,” have the face of Keats propped directly against
                    a figured oblivion, his own impossibility.

                </figure>
                </p>
                <p> Neither item is likely to be what first comes to mind for the topic of “Keats
                    in Popular Culture.” Neither was composed by the poet; and neither would seem to
                    belong to what in the most restricted sense we presently call “popular culture.”
                    But the rubric is capacious enough to invite many permutations of the topic. I
                    hope to demonstrate that both of these tokens are examples of Keats’s “currency”
                    for popular Anglo-American culture, more expansively construed. What interests
                    me here are the “Keats effects,” what O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the particular
                    pulses of his poetic and cultural charge, at the charged moment of his
                    “popularity” in and outside his “circle” and as his poems and images have
                    entered the currency of our own contemporary cultural discourses, what
                    biographers of Romantic poets like to call our “popular imagination.” While I’ll
                    be making some direct references to Keats’s poetry in our contemporary culture,
                    I’m more interested in two discursive strains of the Keats effects. On the one
                    hand, there is the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider and outsized
                    Cockney ambitions, restless experimentation with revered and popular forms,
                    artistic and poetic allusions, complete with devoted fans and fiercely
                    reactionary enemies. On the other hand, there’s the indelible and affecting
                    record of personal pathos, the doomed poet whose beauty&#8212;fragile and fractured&#8212;is
                    inseparable from the poems themselves, their making, their reception, and the
                    fate of their maker. We all know this image, and we know it <emph>as
                    image</emph> more than story or fact, an image Karen
                    Swann describes as the “beautiful dreamer” who “lives a posthumous life, beyond
                    life and death, but transcending neither” (<title level="a"><title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    Dreamers</title> 21). I want to consider how both of these Keats effects posit modes of
                    impossibility that remain impossibly beautiful. </p>

                <head>II. Romantic Constellations, Pop Cultural Effects</head>
                <p>The conceptual model I take for my thinking about the relationship between Keats
                    and contemporary popular culture is Walter Benjamin’s poetics of history,
                    especially the <title level="a">Theses on the Concept of History</title> and his earlier scattered
                    methodological formulations in <title level="m">The Arcades Project</title>.
                    Turning to Benjamin means dispensing with the themes that drive most narratives
                    of literary or cultural history&#8212;tradition, influence, progression&#8212;and learning
                    instead to attend to the historical “constellations” between Romanticism and the
                    contemporary and to measure the specific charge of the “Keats effect” in the
                    images and dispositions of contemporary popular culture. Elsewhere,
                    Jacques Khalip and I have invoked Benjamin to suggest
                    that Romanticism offers <emph>images</emph> of itself to the future
                    which may be reclaimed or, as Benjamin puts it, redeemed in a present, including
                    the present of our contemporary popular culture. Benjamin describes this
                    fortuitous convergence of past and present as a constellation
                    (<title level="m">Konstellation</title>). Like the arrangements of stars in the night, these
                    constellations are shifting and contingent, and they offer no promise of
                    alignment. Therefore, the dispositions of Romantic constellations are by no
                    means uniform, especially in what we have come to call popular culture. My
                    project here, as in my collaboration with Khalip, is to find a way to “grasp the
                    constellation” into which our “own era has formed with a definite earlier one,”
                    in this case the era we designate as Romantic (<title level="a">Present Darkness</title> 1). For
                    Benjamin, “the constellation as <emph>image</emph> serves less as the
                    temporal measure of the difference between the past and the present (and, as a
                    consequence, their seemingly inextricable relationship), and more as a structure
                    for interpreting the ‘now’ as the event of a seizure, a grasping of the past as
                    if for an emergent intelligibility,” something that occurs,
                    often inconspicuously, in a contemporary poem or a song or a film (<title level="a">Concept of
                    History</title> 397). Benjamin understood that each work of art&#8212;any document of
                    culture, popular or otherwise&#8212;might be “redeemed” or “cashed in” through the
                    constellations that materialize between past and present and crystallize in an
                    image such as those that populate our poems, paintings, or pop songs. We look
                    “with awaken’d eyes”&#8212;as Keats says of himself as he sees “his Psyche true”&#8212;for a
                    sight to behold and to which we become beholden. For Benjamin, the past makes
                    itself available as “true images” that single out their beholders who may be
                    separated from that past by hundreds and even “thousands of years” (<title level="a">Concept of
                    History</title> 397). These “images flash at the moment of their recognizability,” or
                    as in the idiom of Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title>&#8212;itself profoundly
                    charged with the Keats effect that it is also generating&#8212;as “incarnations of the
                    stars, when splendour / Is changed to a fragrance” and descends to earth (lines
                    173­–74). Keats’s “splendours,” as Shelley calls them, are the images that
                    populate his poetry, both the images he made and the image he became, what made
                    him reviled and has made him adored. “It seems,” Frances Jeffrey famously says
                    of <title level="m">Endymion</title> only in order to dismiss it, “as if the
                    author had ventured everything that occurred to him in the shape of a glittering
                    image” (203).</p>
                <p> What Jeffrey dismisses I want to redeem. What this means, methodologically
                    speaking, is attending to the appearances of these “glittering images,”
                    discerning their “shape” in order to attune oneself to their reconstellation in
                    the present as a distinctively Keatsian currency in the genres of popular
                    culture. In his own poetic thinking about the Keats effect, Shelley coined the
                    best name for this currency: a “transmitted effluence,” one which “outlives the
                    parent spark” (lines 407–8). If what Shelley writes is true, the distinctive
                    charge or “transmitted effluence” of particular texts or authors will prove to
                    have many distinctive permutations and prove to be far more varied than the
                    rubric of Romanticism often implies. This means something other than, say,
                    depictions of Romantic authors in our contemporary popular narratives, of which
                    the biopic is the default genre and Jane Campion’s 2009 film
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title> its most compelling example. But, however accomplished and
                    nuanced, the biopic is a dead-end genre, one not capable of accounting for the
                    ways in which the migratory effect of a writer’s work might well take its
                    impulse far beyond its own historical context and far beyond its medium of
                        origin.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I can be certain that there
                        are exceptions to this rule because I am aware of one: Derek Jarman’s
                        <title level="m">Caravaggio</title> (1986) which, despite certain explicit
                        anachronisms, conforms in the main to the narrative expectations of the
                        genre except at the decisive level of the shot where it often depicts a
                        <emph>transfer</emph> of images that activates the currencies
                        between the film and this most cinematic of painters. The best account of
                        this relationship is Leo Bersani and Ulysses Dutoit, <title level="m">Caravaggio</title>.
                        To my mind the most vitally true deployment of a
                        Romantic poet in Anglophone cinema is Jim Jarmusch’s <title level="m">Dead
                        Man</title> (1995) which features Johnny Depp as an accountant from
                        Cleveland named William Blake who travels west and “finds himself” in a
                        surreal Western. After being shot in the chest while in bed with Thel, Blake
                        is revived and taken on a trip by Nobody (“Exaybachay”), a Native American
                        without a tribe (played by Gary Farmer) who learned by heart the poetry of
                        this “dead man” in the “white men’s schools” in England. Over the course of
                        their travels further west, Blake “becomes” the poet, a “killer of white
                        men,” whose poetry is written with his gun. <title level="m">Dead Man</title>
                        is both visionary and revisionary, a “reconstellation” of the poetry of
                        Blake in the redeeming of the genre of the Western.</note>

                <p>Thus, there might be a distinctive “Byron Effect” or a “Blake Effect” (or, for
                    that matter, with a poet such as Southey, <emph>no effect</emph>, at
                    least in this moment of his “unrecognizability”) that inhabit and inform other
                    genres or media as well as the specifically Keastian effects I’m identifying
                    here. Not only are these effects potentially registered in any popular medium or
                    genre, their manifestations often make legible certain aspects of the “original”
                    which were yet to find their expressive medium. For instance, the “Mary Shelley
                    effect” seems exclusively cinematic in nature; and Mary’s account in 1831 of how
                    the story came into existence not only offers a paradigmatic version of the
                    “unbidden” Romantic imagination and its powers of self-origination, but in her
                    characterization of “the successive images that arose in [her] mind,” the “gift”
                    of a cinema “the usual bounds of reverie”: “When I placed my head on my pillow,
                    I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think,” she recounts, “my imagination,
                    unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in
                    my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw&#8212;with shut
                    eyes, but acute mental vision&#8212;I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling
                    beside the thing he had put together” (<title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                        168).<note place="foot" resp="author"> The Mary Shelley effect operates
                        on an altogether different scale for popular culture, dwarfing in
                        consequence any of the effects we might discern from her contemporaries,
                        including her husband, father, and mother. Shelley’s novel deploys Milton’s
                        poetry to displace his version of the Adamic myth with the Frankenstein
                        creation myth as the popular cultural paradigm for creation. A subset of
                        that popular effect is the way in which the creature’s “subversive
                        eloquence” was one of the first and consistent casualties. In the first and
                        very popular stage adaptation of the novel in 1823&#8212;retitled as
                        <title level="m">Presumption, or The Fate of Frankenstein</title>&#8212;the creature
                        is rendered mute and has essentially remained that way on stage and screen
                        ever since. In a form of narrative arrested development, theatrical and
                        cinematic productions&#8212;the latter beginning with a silent film in 1910 in
                        Thomas Edison’s film studios&#8212;the creature remains the “wretch,” the
                        “miserable monster whom” Victor “beholds” at the moment of his “birth.” In
                        the countless versions of the story for stage and screen that have mined the
                        tale for its horror and its kitsch, the creature’s eloquence, his aesthetic
                        sensibilities, and his capacity for poetry have been muted into their
                        opposite, the “muttering” of “inarticulate sounds,” that not only drain the
                        story of the novel’s lyricism but avoid the more threatening undecidability
                        that attends to the creature: how can we not call this cyborg human if he is
                        “moulded” of our same “clay” or if he can express our deepest ethical
                        longings and aesthetic judgments, and turn his demands into a Miltonic prose
                        poem?</note> This famous bit of text not only tells the origin story of the
                    story of a new origin, it refers itself to a new narrative technology and two of
                    its genres that had yet to come into existence, the medium of film and the
                    cinematic genres of horror and of kitsch. </p>
                <p> To sketch a wider range of reference, I turn briefly to two other versions of
                    this Romantic effectivity. Unlike the “Mary Shelley effect,” the pop cultural
                    effect I associate with Byron is not discernible in film as such but activates
                    the commencement of “celebrity culture” and circulates in certain influential
                    pop musical modes or poses. When, for example, Morrissey, lead singer for the
                    1980’s Manchester band The Smiths, opens the plaintive anthem <title level="a">How Soon is Now?</title>
                    to the iconic wails of Johnny Marr’s shimmering guitar with the following lines,
                    no one who has read Byron can miss the reference, intended or not, to
                    <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>:

                What at first sounds like an anthem triumphantly declaring that he’s “the sun and
                    the air” is undone by a homophonic pun (“son and heir”) and diminished further
                    by the slack lines that follow the declarations: “nothing in particular.” The
                    effect of these mock anthems is an affective irony that turns the song into the
                    pop melodrama that defines most every anthem by The Smiths or by
                    Morrissey.<note place="foot" resp="author"> While I believe that the pop cultural

                When we hear those lines and that particularly dead-pan irony, we don’t need to
                    see Morrissey sitting in his bath with a volume of Byron (as he does in the
                    video to <title level="a">Suedehead</title>) to feel the songs permeated by the poet, affectively and
                    tonally. Morrissey’s songs allow us to <emph>hear</emph> the campy
                    quality that was always central to the Byron effect, at least in
                    <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, the poem which “made” him; and Morrissey’s
                    songs allow us to <emph>hear</emph> for ourselves the queer desire in
                    the poet that recent scholarship has given us to know.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Morrissey,

                        himself: <title level="m">Autobiography</title> chronicles the story of
                        Morrissey’s cultural education from the point of view of the streets of
                        Manchester, almost as much a literary as a musical education, though more
                        modernist (Housman, Auden) than Romantic in its engagements. Above all, it’s
                        Wilde. As he writes in <title level="a">Cemetery Gates,</title> “Keats and Yeats are on your side
                        and Wilde is on mine.” Musically, his points of departure are Bowie, of
                        course, but also the glam rockers, Lou Reed, New York Dolls, and Patti Smith
                        among others. The book-length study most relevant to my discussion is Gavin

                        Now, quite sadly, but without apology, we must acknowledge a new and
                        indisputable fact which changes everything we think and say about this
                        artist that meant so much to us: Morrissey has become a fucking racist.

                <p> If the first and most obvious example of the “Blake Effect” for the last half
                    century of North American popular culture that comes to mind will be The Doors,
                    only their name and the early song <title level="a">Break on Through</title> feel genuinely charged by
                    a Blakean energy or thematics. Without question, Patti Smith is the contemporary
                    artist most “plugged” into the Blake effect, formally, thematically, even
                    scholarly. From the eruptive event of 1975’s <title level="m">Horses</title> to the
                    present, Smith’s sung poetry and garage music embraced the full visionary mode
                    of Blake’s poetics, a unique “marriage” of Innocence (<title level="a">Wave</title>) and experience
                    (<title level="a">Horses</title>) with a religious ferocity (<title level="a">In Excelsis Deo</title>) and a transgressive
                    proto-punk ethos (<title level="a">Pissing in a River</title>). Not only does she sing Blake’s
                    “songs”&#8212;most notably <title level="a">The Tyger</title>&#8212;she has selected and introduced a popular
                    collection of his poems and speaks and writes on the poet who is as much her
                    muse as Genet, Rimbaud, or the Beat Poets. But for Morris Eaves, neither the
                    Doors nor Patti Smith represents a version of the Blake he “wants.” In an essay
                    called <title level="a">On Blakes We Want and Blakes We Don’t,</title> Eaves bemoans the very aspect of
                    the “Blake effect” that I seek: “Blake’s durability seems to depend partly on
                    his ready reproducibility in simple forms as a cultural marker&#8212;memorable
                    images to decorate dust jackets, startling proverbs to launch book chapters,
                    catchy phrases to name rock bands” (414). Eaves’s lament serves as an epigraph
                    to Mike Goode’s <title level="a">Blakespotting,</title> a brilliant and pathbreaking exploration of the
                    poetics of the Blake effect. Goode argues that Blake’s work circulated from the
                    outset as detached pieces and images&#8212;poems, pictures, proverbs&#8212;and that this
                    “detachability” is fundamental to Blake’s artistic project and its effectivity.
                        <note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="a">On the Currency of Images: Percy
                        Shelley’s Minor Cinema,</title> I explore the principle of the detachability of the
                        image in poetry and film. There I argue that the image’s “detachability”
                        makes it available as a historical and transmedial “current,” one which
                        “charges” a constellation between such unlikely texts as Shelley’s
                        <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> and Todd Haynes’s
                        <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>.</note> Blake’s deployment of the
                    proverb form and especially what Goode calls “the largely unmappable circulation
                    of his proverbs” generate an anonymous textual system that is characteristically
                    Blakean” (<title level="a">Blakespotting</title> 773). Ironically, proverbial anonymity is Blake’s
                    signature, the distinctive idiom of the “Blake effect.” For his methodological
                    point of reference to this mode of poetic historicity, Goode turns not to
                    Benjamin but to the “rhizomatics” of Deleuze and Guattari: “Blake, in his
                    transformation of the proverb genre, created a medium that is its own
                    heterogeneous message, and that message, like the ‘rhizomatic’ forms that Gilles
                    Deleuze and Felix Guattari celebrate, becomes senderless and receiverless over
                    time, directed toward everybody and by everyone” (775). </p>
                <p> Over time many of Keats’s own phrases and formulations have also achieved the
                    status of the proverb; but the signature of their “sender” is far too
                    identifiable and too deeply marked with his poetic currency to produce the
                    “rhizomatics” that Goode persuasively locates in Blake’s poetic effect. For
                    Keats I discern two distinct but inextricable effects, something like the A-side
                    and B-side of a vinyl record. For the first of these effects, I borrow Peter
                    Szendy’s notion of “obstructive enthusiasm,” a term which I think characterizes
                    an important impulse in the poetry both early and late, not only the vexed
                    exuberances of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, but the excesses in the late
                    odes, for which the cascade of declared “happies” that get the speaker nowhere
                    in the third stanza of <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> can serve as an emblem. </p>
                <p> The second Keats effect I call “the shrine of no prospects,” one which counts
                    Severn’s drawing as among its first collected items. I think this is the best
                    term for the aura of painful regret which shrouds the poet much like Severn’s
                    drawing and which connects him not only to that phenomenon of the singer dead
                    “before his time” but to an affective and figurative temporality in Keats’s
                    poems and letters that reappears&#8212;reconstellated&#8212;as the pop cultural image of
                    certain singer-songwriters, contemporary death-bound troubadours. The rhetorical
                    signature of this current of pop music is the Keatsian oxymoron in the affective
                    dimension&#8212;“pleasant pain,” “half in love with easeful death,” and so on&#8212;and the
                    plaintive and absorptive register of the poems, as if they were always composed
                    in the minor key. But the curious “time signature” of this effect generates
                    something other than straight melancholy. In this version of “the Keats effects,”
                    we find a pop image of something which, quite like the poet himself, is always
                    projective and already posthumous.</p>

                    a vibrant urban culture of art and politics, sedition and experimentation,
                    famously derided in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> as “the Cockney School of
                    versification, morality, and politics” (qtd. in Roe 203).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Andrew Motion’s outstanding <title level="m">Keats</title>
                        is the first sustained biography to emphasize the depth of the poet’s
                        engagement with the radical, dissenting political culture of the
                        period.</note> We owe our understanding of this pop Keats to critics such as
                    Nicholas Roe, Jeffrey N. Cox, and others who have unearthed the ways in which
                    Keats was both indebted to and a principal contributor for what we would today
                    call an “alternative” or “counter-hegemonic” culture, one in which his poems
                    both originate and reiterate. Roe explains that the “Cockney” label was a
                    multiform epithet, one linked explicitly to the seditions of Leigh Hunt and to
                    the popular culture of “the London mob” and to the threat the urban experience
                    posed for the reactionary circle of <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, a threat
                    marked by class and gendered affect. Citing Samuel Johnson’s
                    <title level="m">Dictionary</title>, Roe notes that while “the leading sense of ‘Cockney’ is ‘a
                    native of London,’ its second definition of the word is ‘any effeminate, low
                    citizen’” (212). Thus does Keats belong to a particular poetic form of urban
                    effeminacy, the “lisping sedition” of “the affected school of our metropolitan
                    poets” (qtd. in Motion 523). The Cockney politics of Keats’s “metropolitan”
                    poetry is always marked with an erotic charge. Jeffrey Cox illustrates how the
                    erotic and even pornographic nature of this Cockney culture and the excesses of
                    its Catullan resonances&#8212;both explicit and elliptical&#8212;not only form the popular
                    historical context for Keats’s poems but inform their rhetorical and formal
                    textures: “If we fail to notice the density of the punning in the ode [on a
                    Grecian Urn], we lose a sense of the poem’s playfulness, of the experimental,
                    even quirky nature of Keats’s language . . . and of the Catullan and Cockney
                    delight in toying with what others considered serious in the name of a
                    linguistic and also finally an erotic delight” (620).<note

                    into this popular fascination with Roman eroticism, a fascination that makes
                    this most auratic of Keats’s poems shot through with a sexual charge. It’s not
                    that Keats doesn’t love the art of the “Grecian Urn” or the Portland Vase; it’s
                    that with his “human breathing passion,” he loves it <emph>too
                    much</emph>. Once we feel his desire for knowledge of the urn become erotic,
                    we see how the poem participates in a subterranean pop cultural eroticism that
                    veers to the pornographic, precisely like the urn itself: “a pornographic text
                    offers the identical pleasure over and over again,” writes Cox, adding, “every
                    time we read Keats’s urn we will see the same love ‘ever warm and still to be
                    enjoyed’” (625).<note place="foot" resp="author">  On the relationship
                        between the pornography and the “popular culture” of the period, see

                        the period in enlightened and self-conscious opposition to both the
                        philosophical assumptions and institutional practices of elite culture”
                        (25).</note> The result of Cox’s reading is not so much to resituate Keats’s
                    poetry in the context of popular discourses of classical and Cockney eroticism
                    as to reinject these ostensibly “timeless” poems with what Benjamin calls the
                    anachronistic “now-time” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Jetzeit</foreign>) of their own popular
                    culture. In this charged moment of British cultural politics, the status of
                    Keats’s poems could shift in an instant from what Cox describes as “a coterie
                    favorite” to “that of a target of the Cockney School attacks” (616); and Keats’s
                    aspirations of high literary art reduced to the parody of a gross popular
                    culture and, as in the words of the <title level="j">British Critic</title>, “the
                    gross slang of voluptuousness” committed by “the meanest and filthiest” of
                    “Cockney poetasters” (249). </p>
                <p> As hateful and reactionary as these attacks were, I count myself as one who
                    prefers the Keats of the urban gutter to the Keats of the British Museum,
                    <emph>until</emph> we reach the precious point at which those two
                    versions of the poet become indistinguishable. This is the sweet spot often
                    crystallized in Keats at which the most auratic of objects are simultaneously
                    objects of explicit erotic desire, the sexual and popular “undersong” of the
                    ode’s elevated lyric address. This is how Simon Jarvis teaches us to read
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>, by carefully excavating Keats’s “undersong” in
                    that poem, one which recognizes that the poet’s “ceaseless work on verse
                    language, the invention of a verse repertoire every bit as consequential for
                    nineteenth-century English poetry as Wordsworth’s” is also inseparable from its
                    “systematic assault on taste” (<title level="a">Undersong</title> 147). For Jarvis,
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s “own grandeur,” one both fine and dirty, “looks forward” to
                    “Picasso’s <title level="m">Vollard Suite</title>” or to Frank O’Hara’s <title level="a">Ode on
                    St. Cecelia’s Day.</title> In this way Jarvis discerns a scandalizing pop-cultural
                    current&#8212;what he calls “a partial countertradition”&#8212;that runs from Keats’s
                    (early) <title level="m">Endymion</title> through (early) Wallace Stevens and is
                    plugged in to the O’Hara of this (again, early) ode. O’Hara acknowledges the
                    saint’s day by doing precisely what Keats would have done: run as far as
                    possible from Pope’s famous ode commemorating St. Cecilia’s Day. O’Hara’s poem,
                    which Jarvis invokes without a gloss, is more a Keatsian hymn to Pan than a
                    celebration of “impoverished Cecilia”:

                Ultimately the poem is addressed not to St. Cecila or to Pan but to “the rest of
                    us,” those who like Pan, like Keats, like O’Hara, “play and are played / seeking
                    … the pattern of our true desire.” In Jarvis’s reading, the “countertradition”
                    initiated by Keats’s “masterpiece” and its “deep thicket of new verse rhythms,
                    textures, sentences, techniques” arrives smack in the middle of a brief
                    quotation from O’Hara’s brilliant mock manifesto, <title level="a">Personism</title>:

                    For Jarvis the literary “counter tradition” that leads from Keats to O’Hara&#8212;what
                    I am calling its Romantic currency&#8212;gives up the “lofty ideas” once they are
                    lofty enough for the refreshments to arrive and for the pleasures to begin for
                    real. It is “the line of reviled virtuosity and of dandyism in deadly earnest”
                    (163); and we should be clear that this “line” or trajectory of “Keatsness” is
                    queer in <emph>effect</emph> if not in origin, what Khalip has in a
                    different context called “tacitly queer” (<title level="m">Last
                        Things</title>).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Khalip’s book
                        constitutes a decisive and ongoing engagement with the queerness and
                        “lastness” of Romanticism, including a compelling account of the “tacit”
                        queerness of Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (74–91).
                        By now, the queering of Keats should be
                        beyond dispute. The issue of <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net
                        </title> edited by Michael O’Rourke and David Collings features important
                        essays&#8212;and an excellent introduction by O’Rourke and Collings&#8212;which address
                        the queer or “proto-queer” aspect of Romantic discourse. On the queering of
                        Keats, see in particular Caroline E. Kimberly, <title level="a">Effeminacy, Masculinity, and

                        for any scholar pursuing this queer strain in Romanticism, we are indebted
                        to Andrew Elfenbein’s <title level="m">Romantic Genius: The Prehistory of a
                        Homosexual Role</title>. While completing my essay, I came across Eric
                        Eisner’s brilliant <title level="a">Drag Keats: Mark Doty’s Cockney Poetics</title> and felt
                        confirmed in the direction of my argument. Eisner invokes Keats’s Cockney
                        currency as a way of reading Doty’s poetry and its special debts to Keatsian
                        glitter and excess. As Eisner puts it, Doty’s “Keats is in fact a Cockney
                        Keats, and … Doty’s queer poetics of excess&#8212;its campiness, its glitter,
                        even its ostentatious derivativeness&#8212;can be understood as a kind of
                        Cockney poetics,” with “Keats [as] … the signal poet of the simulated,
                        impure, and over-the-top” (388).</note> This particular current of the

                <p>“The ‘Cockney’ poem and its scandalized responses,” says Swann, “produced the
                    Keats that even cool modernism came to love” (21). Perhaps none cooler than
                    O’Hara, urban lyric poet in the era of Abstract Expressionism, Billie Holiday,
                    and James Dean. O’Hara’s poetry is shot through with so many of the most vital
                    currents of mid-century cosmopolitan culture&#8212;popular, elite, emergent,
                    experimental&#8212;that he should have a cultural constellation named for himself. In
                    the introduction to Donald Allen’s edition of <title level="m">The Collected
                    Poems of Frank O’Hara</title>, John Ashbery maps out this vast constellation of
                    the poet’s influences and engagements and many of the relevant strains of
                    nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and art, from the French Symbolists and
                    Surrealists through the Russian experiments of Pasternak and Mayakovsky as well
                    as the Abstract Expressionism of de Kooning, Pollock, and Kline. Of artists who
                    would find their fame after this moment of Abstract Expressionism, Philip Guston
                    and Cy Twombly and the music of Cage, Schoenberg, Satie and even Paul Bowles,
                    the experimental poetry of the Soviet Union and Africa. To Ashbery’s catalogue
                    of persons, many of whom he might have found in his own rolodex, we must surely
                    add the pulsing and tawdry kaleidoscope of mid-century popular culture, not just
                    film or cinema but <emph>the movies</emph> and the catalogue of movie
                    <emph>stars</emph>, such as Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, William
                    Powell and Lana Turner, and above all James Dean: “the heavens operate on the
                    star system,” O’Hara writes in <title level="a">To the Film Industry in Crisis,</title> his paean to
                    that constellation: “It is a divine precedent / you perpetuate!” and “it’s you I
                    love!” (232.43–45, 7). O’Hara’s poetry is charged with the enthusiasm of
                    infatuation, one which attaches itself “variously.” “I don’t prefer one ‘strain’
                    to another,” he writes in <title level="a">My Heart,</title> perhaps closer to a manifesto of his
                    poetry and his criticism than “Personism”:

                        in September 1955 prompted O’Hara to write three elegies, the third (and

                        vitality, “nerve,” and “variousness.” Like many of O’Hara’s best works, the
                        poem is both panoramic and intimate, a “cold last swim / before the city”
                        set against “a sky Tiepolo / and Turner compiled in vistavision” as he
                        imagines what it is like to be “robbed of these suns and knowledges” and
                        writes a name not in water but in sand: “A leaving word in the sand, odor of
                        tides: his name.” Along the way, O’Hara’s conceit careens from the
                        Turner-Tiepolo cinema to a bit part in <title level="m">Julius Caesar</title>
                        at the Brattle Theatre as his friends “listen to <title level="m">La

                    taste. He burned hard and gemlike. . . a less frigid version of Paterian

                        passage in her introduction to the second edition of the book, published by
                        the University of Chicago Press in 1998.</note> But, however phobic his
                    impulses and wrong his characterizations of the poetry or the aesthetic, I want
                    to reclaim the very term that Byrom might have regarded as his most decisive
                    dismissal: “Paterian pop.” I think there is no better way to name the cultural
                    vitality of this queer popular current that runs from Keats to O’Hara. </p>
                <p> “As if I were Endymion,” O’Hara exclaims in “There I could never be a boy,” one
                    of his poems to James Schuyler; and the references to Keats often occur when
                    O’Hara is figuring a limit (excess, abstraction, enthusiasm) by which he
                    measures his own aesthetic trajectory (216.14). This is the “Keats effect” that
                    connects these most famous figures of the Cockney and New York Schools, two
                    “coterie poets” who hail from the “affected school of metropolitan poets” and
                    were both denounced by conservative critics as “poetasters.” To articulate this
                    connection, I turn to Peter Szendy, French philosopher of pop culture, for the
                    term that activates this constellation: “obstructive enthusiasm” or
                    “infatuation” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">engouement</foreign>) Szendy calls it, with
                    reference not to contemporary or Romantic poetry but to the affects and effects
                    of popular music. Drawing on Theodor Reik’s psychoanalytic interest in
                    “obsessive melodies,” Szendy declares something about the effects of popular
                    music that, as Leonard Cohen might say, “everybody knows”: there are certain
                    popular melodies that act “like a ghost that has come to haunt us. Or like a
                    worm, a virus of the ear that keeps reproducing itself in us” (<title level="m">Hits</title>
                    32).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Will Bishop
                        translates <foreign xml:lang="fr">engouement</foreign> as “enthusiasm,” but I also
                        want to activate “infatuation” as the translation that speaks more to the
                        aesthetic affect at work here.</note> But on certain occasions the effect of
                    these melodies is something more than a mere “ear-worm”: in some instances the
                    popular melody manages “to bring some obstructive enthusiasm into our heart of
                    hearts, . . . bursts of enthusiasm, lyrical flights of incomparable force and
                    emotion” (33). None of which get us anywhere: these are lyrical arrests,
                    aesthetic seizures of the sort that O’Hara indelibly stamped at the end of <title level="a">The
                    Day Lady Died</title> when the speaker beholds the face of Billie Holiday on a “NEW

                Everything prior to this arrest by the photographic image of “Lady Day” is
                    movement and activity, clocked and named, Baudelaire’s
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">flaneur</foreign> on Manhattan time. It’s aesthetically exclusive (the gift of
                    “a little Verlaine / for Patsy”) and democratically urban (lunch is “a hamburger
                    and a malted”), cosmopolitan and popular (“a bottle of Strega,” French
                    cigarettes, <emph>and</emph> the “NEW YORK POST”). This is O’Hara’s
                    city “circuit” personally and poetically; and it belongs to the genre he made
                    popular&#8212;“I did this I did that”&#8212;urgently enjambed parataxis until the moment of
                    recognition: “a NEW YORK POST with her face on it,” at which point everything
                    stops as “he is thinking of leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT” and the time
                    suddenly changes and we belong to the memory of a “whispered song” by Lady Day
                    “and everyone and I stopped breathing.” This “inside out” elegy, one in which
                    the singer’s death is marked only in the title and the final brief stanza, is
                    the poem that only a fan could write, one whose movement, direction, and
                    enthusiasm has come to a standstill by the sudden appearance of an image.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> This is a poem which has been written
                        about often and well; but I want to note two important and engaged readings
                        of the poem that have long been crucial to my understanding of the poem and
                        of O’Hara: Marjorie Perloff, <title level="m">Frank O’Hara: Poet Among
                        Painters</title> (xvii–xix; 179–83); and Andrew Ross, <title level="a">The Death of Lady
                        Day</title> (68–77).</note>
                </p>
                <p> “Obstructive enthusiasm” appears in a more specifically Keatsian vein in the
                    O’Hara poem with which I opened this essay, <title level="a">Again, John Keats, or The Pot of
                    Basil.</title> The poem begins with the speaker’s reflection on the condition of an
                    empty blockage, a reflection which relies on the mutually exclusive colloquial
                    definitions of “through” as both adverb and noun: the speaker’s sense of feeling
                    “through” with things is likened to an image in a John Huston film, a
                    “throughness” broken suddenly by the gift of “a pot of basil,” a gift which
                    activates the derived meaning of “through” that prompts the speaker to announce
                    a Keatsian “breakthrough” that turns out to be another limit: “am reading Keats
                    again and realize / that everything is impossible in a different way” (471.7–9).
                    How better to describe O’Hara’s realization of an impossibility “in a different
                    way” than as an “obstructive enthusiasm”? The gift of the basil from an
                    unspecified friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats&#8212;himself a serious
                    “re-reader”&#8212;that results in the poem’s central event, a “realization” which
                    offers no vision into the future, no way beyond the impasse. O’Hara’s
                    “again-ness” with Keats reiterates the romantic poet’s own repetitive obsessions
                    regarding the <emph>re-reading</emph> of <title level="m">King
                    Lear</title> in <title level="a">On Sitting Down to Read <title level="m">King Lear</title> Once
                    Again,</title> which promises nothing more than a re-visitation of an impossibility,
                    “the fierce dispute betwixt damnation and impassion’d clay.” But the affective
                    charge of O’Hara’s impossibility is not direly obsessive but exuberant: if this
                    is the poetics of the impasse, it is the happy aporia, what in a relevant
                    register Emily Dickinson calls a “bright impossibility.” Keats’s odes are riven
                    with this kind of “obstructive enthusiasm”: not only the famously awkward six
                    “happies” of the third stanza of <title level="a">Ode on Grecian Urn,</title> which emphatically
                    reiterate a happiness denied the speaker, but the urgent desire for the speaker
                    of the <title level="a">Ode to Psyche</title> to be the “pale-mouth’d prophet” that history denied the
                    goddess, “latest born and loveliest vision.” The enthusiasms of the speakers of
                    Keats’s odes may entice us into believing the speaker has gotten somewhere in
                    the course of theode; and indeed, as in the <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> the speaker
                    may have enticed himself into believing that he has done so, until the music
                    “flees.” </p>
                <p> O’Hara’s own “Keats effect” is registered throughout his poetry in forms both
                    named and implied, often as examples of this “obstructive enthusiasm.” In a
                    sonnet called <title level="a">On a Passage in Beckett’s <title level="m">Watt</title> &amp; About
                    Geo. Montgomery,</title> O’Hara offers an extraordinary passage that marks both his
                    affective debt and rhetorical leave-taking from what he identifies as the Keats
                    effect and that he associates with “excess”:

                    In <title level="a">The ‘Unfinished,’</title> a sprawling name-dropping exercise, Keats is posited as
                    temporal reference: “I suddenly think of the moon, hanging up there / ever since
                    the time of Keats,” as if the lunar object is itself a Keats effect (317.57–58).
                    For O’Hara origins are always aesthetic, and therefore always multiple points of
                    artistic reference and poetic relays that, to invoke Deleuze and Guattari once
                    again, feel more “rhizomatic” than lineal or arboreal. In <title level="a">For Bob
                    Rauschenberg,</title> O’Hara’s often manic name-checks take on a poignant tone, one in
                    which art is enthusiastically registered as failure. “The frail instant” is
                    “drowned in Liszt” and our speaker has come to “despise” his “love for
                    Pasternak” (322.5, 9). The poem’s third stanza creates a constellation of three
                    poets who rarely occupy the same canonical space, from which the speaker, “alone
                    in pain,” is excluded:

                In this triad of “heavenly aspirations,” Keats’s “truth and beauty” gets the
                    upper hand, especially as it is followed immediately by a
                    question&#8212;“double-coin?”&#8212;an activation of the two-sided nature of the Keats
                    effect.</p>
                <p> Many of the important impressions of the Keats effects in O’Hara’s poetry take
                    the form of unattributed invocations, like the deployment of a crucial phrase in

                The opening clause of the final line&#8212;“I am sure of nothing but this”&#8212;activates
                    the famous line from Keats’s 1817 letter to Bailey, a letter which declares
                    Keats’s agnosticism as well as his poetic project: “I am certain of nothing but
                    of the holiness of the Heart’s affections and the truth of the Imagination.” And
                    when O’Hara wants to pursue this ungrounded Keatsian intensification to the
                    limit place of poetic abstraction, he turns in <title level="a">Personism</title> to Keats’s “negative
                    capability” in order to address the nature of poetic versus painterly
                    abstraction: “Abstraction (in poetry, not in painting) involves personal removal
                    by the poet,” writes O’Hara; and he goes on to link the “abstraction” and
                    “removal” of the poet to “negative capability (as in Keats and Mallarme)” (498).
                    But in order to achieve a “true abstraction for the first time, really, in the
                    history of poetry,” O’Hara’s <title level="a">Personism</title> goes in the opposite direction,
                    restoring, so it would seem, the “person” to the poem, and in the process,
                    “<emph>abstracting</emph>” him. While the irony of this mock manifesto
                    makes it impossible to decide how seriously we are meant to take O’Hara’s
                    formulation as a poetic project, the passage does mark Keats and negative
                    capability as a kind of limit case for the development of a decisive mode of
                    abstraction in contemporary art. And as O’Hara moves in his manifesto from
                    Keatsian negativity capability to Personism, we reach “obstructive enthusiasm,
                    the infatuated “vitality” of the limit: “What can we expect of Personism? (This
                    is getting good, isn’t it?) Everything, but we won’t get it. It is too new, too
                    vital a movement to promise anything” (499). Expect everything, O’Hara’s
                    says&#8212;just as it’s “getting good”&#8212;but realize that nothing will come of it:
                    <title level="a">Personism,</title> the poetic movement of vitality with no future. Without promise,
                    “you just go on your nerve,” writes O’Hara, identifying a term he invokes often
                    for his account of the fundamental poetic “charge” or impulse. “Implying both
                    spontaneity and outrageousness,” writes Brad Gooch, “‘nerve’ was O’Hara’s campy
                    version of Keats’s prescription of ‘negative capability’ or ‘wise passivity’ for
                    the young lyric Romantic poet. . . .‘Nerve’ was his aesthetic motor, his
                    program” (435). “Nerve” as “aesthetic motor”: “negative capability” with
                    vitality but no promise, “both a plus and a minus” as Gooch characterizes it,
                    the same impulse-blockage two-step that characterizes this version of the Keats
                    effect.</p>

                <p>If we can assign “a plus and a minus” to the Keats effects, “shrines of no
                    prospect” is the phrase I’d invoke for the “minus sign,” the alternating current
                    to “Obstructive Enthusiasm.” By this term I hope to convey the luxuriant
                    mourning for this doomed poet that Keats’s poetry, his death, and his “circle”
                    put into circulation for our own generation of doomed popular troubadours. What
                    Swann says about the various images of the poet in
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>&#8212;at least in the seductive mythology that is itself a part of
                    this shrine&#8212;extends to a rock music constellation we know well: “all abstracted
                    dreamers, all piercingly beautiful, all singled out by the gods, all marvelous
                    fated boys, all destined for celebrity”&#8212;and all doomed (20).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> And it will not be surprising to know that it is
                        something to which O’Hara would be attracted. Gooch writes that the poet was
                        “addicted to the notion of the tragic romantic artist” (303).</note> This
                    aspect of the Keats effect&#8212;the aura of painful regret&#8212;forces our hand: as
                    readers we are demanded to make a decision about the poet ahead of time, a
                    decision based on our feelings, a demand that was always in effect for the
                    poet’s first readers. For them and for us, one doesn’t “come around” to Keats
                    the way one might develop an admiration or critical interest in Wordsworth, for
                    instance, or even a fascination with the delirious irony of Byron’s many poses.
                    The affective response produced in advance by this Keats effect is not derived
                    from our understanding of his ethical impulses or his formal achievement or his
                    political engagement. Nor is it the result of careful rhetorical readings,
                    however much the poems may yield to that practice. Though the affective
                    relationship with this poet does not preclude rhetorical analysis or formal
                    interpretation, the Keats effect happens <emph>in advance</emph> of
                    any subsequent critical engagement; and it’s bound up with our image of him.</p>
                <p> In this context, it’s worth remembering that Keats initiates his own poetic
                    project with a series of poems addressed to popular models of the poet:
                    <title level="a">Imitation of Spenser,</title> the pageant of Western poets in <title level="a">Ode to Apollo,</title> of
                    course, and the sonnets to Byron and to Chatterton, that young suicide, “Dear
                    child of sorrow! Son of misery,” now “among the stars” whose “hymning” is now
                    far “above the ingrate world” (5). Keats’s elegiac outbursts to this tragically
                    dead young poet with whom he identifies establishes the rhetoric of a
                    relationship reactivated in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, arguably the most
                    beautiful British elegy of the nineteenth century.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> It depends upon whom you ask, of course. When Shelley
                        wrote to Ollier that he was “composing a poem of the death of Keats,” he
                        called it “a highly wrought <emph>piece of art</emph>, perhaps
                        better in composition than anything I have written.” Not the judgement of
                        the review in <title level="j">The Literary Gazette</title>, Dec. 1821: “The
                        poetry of the work is <emph>contemptible</emph>, a mere collection
                        of bloated words heaped on each other without order, harmony, or meaning”
                        (qtd. in Ann Wroe, <title level="m">Being Shelley</title> 265).</note> With
                    his fifty-five “Spenser stanzas,” Percy Shelley constructs Keats’s first “Sovran
                    shrine,” one which the older poet adorns with his friend’s own poetic images or
                    “splendours” (100, 174, 198, 363, 388). The revisitations of these images are
                    the dead poet’s own special effects in a “Temple” not of “Delight” but of
                    Melodrama, one designed exclusively for a ritualized weeping that is marshaled
                    “against oblivion.” Shelley’s elegy is certainly as responsible for this aspect
                    of the Keats effect as anything the younger poet ever wrote:
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> enshrined an image that almost immediately became inseparable
                    from both poets. Shelley famously inscribes an image of himself in this
                    “enduring monument” as “one frail Form, / A phantom among men, companionless”
                    (271–72), one of the poets who gather to mourn Adonais. As Andrew Motion puts
                    it, the early responses to Keats’s death “took their lead” from
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “the single most famous
                    and influential response to Keats’s tragedy…. [Shelley] turned Keats into an
                    archetype&#8212;not someone who had suffered uniquely, but someone who represented all
                    artists oppressed by reactionary regimes” (571). Motion laments the fact that
                    Shelley’s “distortions” became “quickly and firmly rooted in the popular
                    imagination” (572). Shelley’s own biographers agree that these “distortions” are
                    the result of his own projected hyper-identifications that crystallize in this
                    poem, especially the <emph>ad hominem</emph> assaults by conservative
                    reviewers on young poets associated with Hunt and Byron, agents of sedition and
                    immorality. Shelley’s emotional investment in the fate of
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> may have exceeded anything else he wrote; and it prompted him
                    to draft (and subsequently abandon) a preface to the poem which stresses the
                    “calumny” “heaped in so profuse a measure” upon <emph>himself</emph>
                    (qtd. in <title level="m">Being Shelley</title> 264). Given the compounding of
                    these affective substitutions between mourner and mourned, it is not surprising
                    that Shelley would express his hopes for the life of the poem. “I am especially
                    curious to hear the fate of <title level="m">Adonais</title>,” he wrote to Charles
                    Ollier: “I confess I should be surprised if <emph>that</emph> poem
                    were born to an immortality to oblivion.”</p>
                <p> “Oblivion” is an important word for Shelley, one that appears in many of its
                    forms in his poems and prose, including the lines of the elegy dedicated to “the
                    inheritors of unfulfilled renown” (Chatterton, Sidney, Lucan) from whom
                    “Oblivion … shrank like a thing reproved” (397, 405) and in the closing
                    sentences to his preface in which he praises “Mr. Severn, a young artist of the
                    highest promise.” In return for Severn’s “unwearied attendance” to the dying
                    poet, Shelley invokes the spirit of Keats to bestow a final plea on behalf of
                    the young artist, a plea that has the ring of an aesthetic benediction: “may the
                    unextinguished Spirit of his illustrious friend animate the creations of his
                    pencil and plead against Oblivion for his name!” The irony, of course, is that
                    it is the <emph>extinguishing</emph> body of Severn’s illustrious
                    friend that “animated” the one creation of his pencil to have “defeated oblivion
                    for his name.” Severn made many other pictures, of course, paintings of
                    historical or literary subjects&#8212;Keats and Shelley among them&#8212;subjects which
                    constituted his ambitions and the miniatures which made him money. But it seems
                    fair to say that the artist’s images of Keats and Shelley were saved from
                    oblivion in part by their affective relation to a poetry
                    and aesthetics of oblivion, the “oblivious spells” and “oblivious
                    melodies” of Shelley and of Keats. But for the circle of friends devoted to the
                    memory and reputation of Keats&#8212;a record of devotion which has made his death a
                    genre of its own&#8212;the phrase, “against oblivion,” might serve as an alternate
                    caption for Severn’s death-bed drawing. While Keats’s head rests on a pillow
                    more suggested than drawn, Severn has penciled two concentric cones: a light
                    exterior and dark interior cone which serve as contrast to the three-quarter
                    image of the poet. Thus does Severn, drawing this picture at 3am to “keep
                    awake,” have the face of Keats <emph>propped</emph> directly
                    “<emph>against</emph>” a figured oblivion. </p>
                <p> What are we to do with what Khalip calls “last things”? How do we dispose of
                    Keats’s <emph>effects</emph>, the personal artifacts and cultural
                    remnants that have been saved from oblivion, more “cloudy trophies hung” in the
                    Keats reliquary, none of which we’ve been assigned to study? In <title level="a">The Strange
                    Time of Reading,</title> one of the most beautiful and most moving pieces of literary
                    criticism I know, Karen Swann begins by addressing another item of “Keatsiana,”
                    an “image of Keats’s death mask” (275–82).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> The full range of Swann’s thinking and writing about the
                        aesthetic after-lives of Keats and Shelley has been indispensable to my own
                        critical and affective engagements with these poets and their work. But this
                        one essay in particular is special. As with everything Swann writes, it’s
                        exquisitely composed and delicately conveyed: Swann reads “effects” as
                        closely and intimately as she reads texts; and she allows herself the
                        vulnerability of a reader who acknowledges that she “finds herself reading
                        in the manner of Keats,” offering her own critical voice to this affective
                        currency of reading-relays. And in the context of the “Keats Effects” I am
                        describing, it is relevant to note that I heard the “live version” of this
                        article when it was first presented as a conference paper. I was moved in a
                        way I very rarely experience in such venues. At that moment, I found myself
                        listening not only as a Romanticist who learns from Swann’s work but with a
                        fan’s devotion.</note> The effect of the image, she writes, “is haunting,
                    fascinating … precisely because of the way its working depends on a sloughing
                    off of context” (275). Swann’s thinking about this version of Keats&#8212;“at once
                    supremely self-conscious and so absorbed in his medium that he can seem lost to
                    us”&#8212;poses an important question for the Severn image: is it possible to
                    <emph>read</emph> Severn’s image without inscriptions or captions,
                    whether real or imagined, without the saturation of affect, the genuine pathos
                    that attaches itself to this poet and his artist-caretaker at this “strange time
                    of drawing”: “28 Janry 3o’clock mng. Drawn to keep me awake – a deadly sweat was
                    on him all this night.”</p>
                <p> Severn records his image of Keats in that late indeterminate period of “no
                    prospect” when, as Rei Terada phrases it, the poet “was able to know” “the
                    experience without poetry” (<title level="a">Looking</title> 301).<note place="foot"
                        resp="author"> Khalip quotes this passage in the course of his own thinking about
                        the temporal force of the “posthumous” in Keats’s last letters: “To read
                        Keats thinking about his posthumous existence in a ‘last letter’ … is to
                        fall into the tangled temporalities of the epistolary form that breaks apart
                        the commemorative containment of something like a ‘life
                        <emph>of</emph> letters’” (70).</note> In the final term of the death
                    sentence, an artist is marking time against the oblivion of sleep in the days
                    before his poet-friend “stopped breathing.” What appears does not belong to the
                    temporal register of the death mask, that cultural relic on which Swann
                    reflects, but a <emph>limit-image</emph>. In the mask, she writes,
                    “‘Keats’ only comes into view … as the bright, aesthetic image peeled away from
                    referent and context,” an image that generates the “elegiac delusion: that
                    impossible feeling that ‘the poet is not dead’&#8212;but merely sleeping, dreaming,
                    wasting…. The feeling is … the affective freight or ‘ache’ that becomes attached
                    to the image that comes into view at the vanishing point, as ungraspable and
                    ungeneralizable singularity” (275). Much of what Swann says about Keats’s death
                    mask and its casted finality is transferrable to the hastily drawn image Severn
                    produced at the limit: indeed, the “affective freight or ‘ache’” attaches itself
                    perhaps more acutely to Severn’s sketched image, one which documents how the
                    poet might well be “sleeping, dreaming, wasting.”<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Severn has drawn a dying face that also resembles what
                        Khalip has called a “sleepy head,” the spot-on phrase he uses to think
                        through Joanna Kane’s arresting photographic portrait series of eighteenth-
                        and nineteenth-century life and death masks collected in the Edinburgh
                        Phrenological Society. She published her treatments of the images in
                        <title level="m">The Somnambulists: Photographic
                            Portraits from Before Photography</title>. If, as Khalip puts it, those
                        “image-masks errantly sleepwalk out of time,” Severn’s image is pinned to
                        its moment (68).</note> But unlike the death mask, the particular “ache”
                    that attaches to Severn’s image is not “ungraspable and ungeneralizable
                    singularity” but is acutely specific, “graspable,” and re-applicable. It’s three
                    in the morning, the end of “Janry,” and he is drawing this picture to keep
                    himself from sleeping while the poet&#8212;sweating a lot right now&#8212;is sleeping?
                    dreaming? wasting? dying? It’s an image which, as Shelley puts it in
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “can scarce uplift / The weight of the
                    superincumbent hour” (281­–82).</p>
                <p>If the ephemerality of drawing often conveys the sense of what Rebecca Comay
                    calls “unfinishedness” (or “under-determination”), the sense of “unfinishedness”
                    conveyed by Severn’s quickly drawn image of Keats is “over-determined” by our
                    awareness that the artist is documenting in “real time” the premature finishing
                    off of the poet (<title level="a">Tabula Rasa</title> 142). The drawing is an image of the poet at his
                    limit and, in its own state of “unfinishedness” at the limit of the image. Maybe
                    those of us who confess to be taken by the gifts and the passion of this poet
                    will, when we gaze upon this limit-image, “have grown into the likeness of his
                    death,” as Paul writes in his final letter, the one to the Romans. This is
                    another way of asking the question: can seeing ever lead to reading when the
                    very object we behold is constituted more by the aura of painful regret than the
                    proficiency of the artist? Is this the kind of image that, once beheld, makes us
                    beholden, or puts us “in a thrall”?<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                        “When reading Keats,” says Swann, “at least some readers find themselves
                        reading in the manner of Keats, who was always exceptionally alive to the
                        call of the image, always vulnerable to the sharp ache, the feeling of being
                        ‘drained, without any force’ that it induced” (279).</note> And isn’t this
                    precisely how this “limit-image” becomes an icon? To borrow Swann’s phrasing for
                    my account of Severn’s picture, the image “takes on the force of a relic, …
                    sharply intruding the time of the one who is no longer here into the presence of
                    our” beholding (<title level="a">Strange Time</title> 279). In Severn’s scandalized presence, Shelley
                    seemed to delight in shocking the pious artist with his indictments against
                    Christianity. But when he writes to Severn of his desire to collect the
                    “remnants” of Keats’s compositions in order “to have them published with a Life
                    and Criticism,” even the godless Shelley declares that Severn’s promised picture
                    of the poet will be “considered among the most sacred relics of the past.”<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Perhaps like the charred remains of
                        Shelley’s heart that Mary wrapped in the pages of
                        <title level="m">Adonais</title> and preserved as a relic to be shared with close
                        friends.</note></p>
                <p> Perhaps the power this image exerts over the beholder is a result of Severn’s
                    depiction of the figure’s solitary and even unconscious absorption. Perhaps in
                    order to examine the properties of this image, we can borrow the principles that
                    Michael Fried derives from Diderot for his defining engagement with eighteenth-
                    and nineteenth-century French painting. If we look at this picture from Fried’s
                    perspective, Severn’s image of the sleeping poet might derive its power from its
                    depiction “of a personage so absorbed [that it] appear[s] unconscious or
                    <emph>oblivious</emph> of everything” (7). In other words, it’s an
                    image that defeats theatricality at the limit of consciousness, by surrendering
                    to oblivion. “Like Adonis,” writes Swann, “Endymion is possessed of a certain
                    stagey dreaminess” (<title level="a"><title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    Dreamers</title> 25). Swann names an aspect of Keats’s work that, while
                    crossways with the art historical terms Fried employs, identifies a kind of
                    stage presence charged with this “Keats effect”: “theatrical absorption,” an
                    experience we might have treasured in an acoustic live performance by Elliott
                    Smith or Kurt Cobain. In the drawn or painted representations of sleeping
                    figures, as Fried puts it, the human being abandons “the upright posture that
                    establishes it in perceptual opposition to the object world … surrendering all
                    control or bodily functions as if to a power or rhythm outside oneself” (67):
                    the “deadly sweat was <emph>on</emph> him all night.” If Severn’s
                    absorptive image intends so little and means so much, it’s because this
                    “unfinished” drawing delivers us to limits that it doesn’t know
                    (unconsciousness, death, oblivion) but that it makes iconic in this shrine of no
                    prospect.</p>

                    dying. Cohen’s “tower of song”&#8212;“far in the unapparent”&#8212;sounds a lot like a
                    hotel, maybe even the Chelsea&#8212;L. Cohen is “paying [his] rent every day” to be
                    there&#8212;but it also, and again like the Chelsea, sounds a lot like a shrine,
                    <emph>the</emph> shrine of the dead or dying troubadours. The only
                    other lodger Cohen identifies is Hank Williams, who “living a hundred floors
                    above him,” is not much of an interlocutor:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                <l>I said to Hank Williams, ‘how lonely does it get?’ </l>
                <l>Hank Williams hasn’t answered yet;</l>
                <l>but I hear him coughing all night long</l>
                <l>oh, a hundred floors above me in the tower of song.</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote>
                One can see why Cohen’s song appealed to Cobain, by turns musically ambitious and
                    personally self-deprecating: the singer’s desire to find oneself in the “tower
                    of song” is not only ironized by the declaration that he is mere “penny
                    royalty,” but by the doubled irony of a desire that he has made into a
                    death-wish.</p>
                <p> Cohen’s song is saturated by a religious rhetoric which&#8212;Christian as well as
                    Jewish&#8212;is a feature of so many of his poems and songs and which is always, even
                    when he’s singing his famous “hallelulias,” subjected to the same ironic,
                    “broken” undertow. Here the singer’s prophetic, messianic impulse&#8212;“Twenty-seven
                    angels from the great beyond!” “There’s a mighty judgment coming!”&#8212;is undone,
                    often in the very next line: “But I may be wrong: / you see you hear these funny
                    voices in the tower of song.” And, however much he might be “crazy for love,”
                    he’s also already singing, posthumously, “with that gift of a golden voice”
                    “from the other side”: “you’ll be hearing from me, baby, long after I’m gone. /
                    I’ll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the tower of song.” The tower
                    of song is this place where the dead are still coughing and the living are
                    “sighing eternally.”</p>
                <p>It’s as old as poetry itself, of course, this elegiac
                    literary tradition in which poets honor their predecessors by mourning them,
                    fashioning in the process a company of singers they hope to join.
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> makes famous allusions to Bion and to
                    Moschus&#8212;both translated by Shelley&#8212;and to Milton; and the poem fashions images
                    of Byron, Hunt, and himself. But Shelley’s elegy marks a new and distinctive
                    species of hyper-identification with the dead poet, one which begins with
                    Shelley and his own personal and poetic projections on a poet about whose poems,
                    at least until <title level="m">Hyperion</title>, he felt a genuine ambivalence.
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> inaugurates a version of this Western elegiac
                    tradition that amplifies the affective dimension of these retrospective lineages
                    at the very moment it drains them of redemptive potential <emph>and
                    sings in praise of that</emph>. Or, more precisely, what Walter Benjamin would
                    call its “redemption value” is rendered into something sheerly aesthetic, weak,
                    impotent, and ineffectual: the shrine of no prospect. In the elegy that mourns
                    and celebrates Keats, Shelley called it “the abode where the Eternal are,” where
                    we mind and tend the effects of what Cohen called the “beautiful losers,”
                    residents of the tower of song, not only Cobain but Hank Williams, Nick Drake,
                    Ian Curtis, Elliott Smith. These singers belong in the same expansive cultural
                    constellation with such figures as Oscar Wilde, Percy Shelley, Frank O’Hara,
                    James Dean, Billie Holiday, Walter Benjamin, and especially John Keats&#8212;“lost
                    angels of a ruined paradise” as Shelley would call them, icons whose beauty is
                    inseparable from a suffering that in their “excessive Keatsness,” always
                    belonged to “the other side,” always already posthumous.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> I understand that the premature deaths of these poets
                        and singers and actors result from a variety of causes; and I don’t intend
                        to minimize the differences between rock and roll suicides and poetic
                        consumption, drowning, or even accidental death by sports car or dune-buggy.
                        But I believe that in terms of the Keats effect, the mode or manner of death
                        is less important than the image with which it is shrouded and made into
                        something popular even if not biographically accurate. For instance, while
                        composing <title level="m">Adonais</title>, Shelley writes that it was only
                        “by assiduous watching that [Keats] was restrained from effecting purposes
                        of suicide”; and Shelley’s “Inheritors of unfulfilled renown” notably
                        includes poets who died by their own hand.</note></p>
                <p> Among the singer-songwriters of this constellation, it’s possible to discern
                    what Benjamin, following Goethe, called “elective affinities” in form, theme,
                    and presentation; but the most significant aspect of their Keats effect resides
                    in their image, one they sang about&#8212;the “afterworld,” for instance, of Cohen and
                    Cobain&#8212;and an image they sang “to”: songs that went in search of that image and
                    songs that addressed it. And then in many cases, they became that image, “a
                    portion of the loveliness” they “made more lovely.” I do believe the poets and
                    singers I have gathered as examples of the Keats effects share among many other
                    things a demonstrable commitment to the radical lyricization of the ballad form
                    and&#8212;at least in the songs that register their “Keatsness”&#8212;an avoidance of the
                    anthem. Self-conscious or not, the Keatsian affective register of the oxymoron
                    is inscribed like a signature in the songwriting of these artists, such as
                    Elliott Smith’s one popular hit single, <title level="a">Miss Misery,</title> in which the plaintive
                    puns on “missing” and “misery” also produce the melancholy effects of those late
                    odes. Or Cobain’s <title level="a">Dumb</title> in which the singer’s experience of the blank emotion
                    of dumbness is, suddenly, “maybe just happy.”</p>
                <p> What, then, is the Keats effect that connects these singers, their songs, and
                    others who, regardless of genre, belong to this constellation, this special
                    version of Pandora or a “Keatsness mixtape”? It is an image, one which is
                    redeemed without prospects, without futurity. If redemption without futurity
                    sounds incoherent&#8212;two fundamentally different discourses yoked together,
                    something like a theologized nihilism&#8212;this discursive discordance is precisely
                    what these images invoke: a Leonard Cohen afterworld of sighs and coughs, “the
                    soul of Adonais, like a star,” beckoning a poet’s boat “far from the shore,”
                    where it is “borne darkly, fearfully, afar,” shrines of martyrs, icons of saints
                    and an absent God, an angel of history forever suspended, forever turned from
                    the future, sighing eternally such that it asks whether there can be an
                    <emph>image of the sigh</emph>. </p>
                <p> The last song of Nirvana’s <title level="m">MTV Unplugged</title> set, performed on
                    a stage covered with candles and Stargazer lilies, was their cover of <title level="a">Where Did
                    You Sleep Last Night?</title> or, as it is most often called, <title level="a">In the Pines.</title> The set
                    of songs Nirvana performed for that show posited its own remarkable
                    constellation: Cobain’s own compositions, of course, but also songs by David
                    Bowie, The Vaselines, and The Meat Puppets, as well as the homage to Leonard
                    Cohen in <title level="a">Pennyroyal Tea,</title> and then, “lastly,” <title level="a">Where Did You Sleep Last
                    Night?</title> Cobain introduces “the last song of the evening” as one written by
                    Leadbelly, his “favorite performer,” though as he had to know, the song was an
                    anonymous ballad performed by artists ranging from Bill Monroe and Roscoe
                    Holcomb to Loretta Lynn and most recently by Fantastic Negrito. The stories told
                    by the ballad differ considerably from version to version&#8212;most often a tale of
                    forsaken love&#8212;with the chorus as the song’s only constant. In the Leadbelly
                    version that Nirvana covers, the narrative is almost entirely eliminated, and a
                    central haunting question is introduced which distinguishes this version from
                    every other: “where did you sleep last night?” It’s a question posed to a
                    lover&#8212;“my girl”&#8212;followed by her reply:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                <l>in the pines, in the pines</l>
                <l>where the sun don’t ever shine</l>
                <l>I shivered the whole night through. </l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote>
                The Leadbelly version of the song is almost entirely comprised of the chorus
                    which both introduces the song and is then repeated five times, punctuated by an
                    instrumental interlude and one brief verse, which offers only the sketchy
                    violence of a murdered husband whose severed head is found in a “driving wheel.” </p>
                <p> Nirvana plays the song as a dirge, its relentless ballad measure slowed
                    painfully: three acoustic guitars, a cello accompaniment, Dave Grohl’s brushed
                    drums. The performance has the feel of inevitability. Throughout the song,
                    Cobain’s aspect is thoroughly absorptive: eyes downturned (reading the music,
                    reading the lyrics?), voice determined but measured until his signature wail
                    erupts in the final explosive chorus. The last line is broken down into the
                    shards of the chorus: “I shiver whole&#8212;[pause]&#8212;night through.” That final
                    “through” is extended and distended until it is no longer a sung note but a cry
                    hurled from the very end. But the image of the performance I’d like to extract
                    from this final line is the instant before that, the sudden and brief
                    arrest&#8212;fleeting standstill&#8212;at which the song and its singer reach the limit. In
                    the instant before that final chilling cry, Cobain sighs and for the first time
                    in the performance opens his eyes.

                    </figure>
                “With awaken’d eyes,” in that moment “where everyone and I stopped breathing,” he
                    gave a breath to his image. This is not just the image of a sigh, but the
                    instance of visual image and audible sigh converging to make a “sigh-image.” In
                    the form of a sigh, it’s an image which comes only to perish. The Keats effects
                    converge here, not as explicit references from Cobain to Keats, but as the
                    affective register through which we experience the performance of this ballad by
                    a singer made iconic by early posthumousness and his own obstructive
                    infatuations. These Keats effects remain ours.</p>
