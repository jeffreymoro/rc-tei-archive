            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount"> This essay traces aspects of Keats’s legacy across popular
                    culture through instances and mechanisms of quoting (or misquoting) his work.
                    The essay begins in periodical culture soon after Keats’s death (the late 1820s
                    and early 1830s), then moves to the discourse around the Manchester Art
                    Treasures Exhibition in 1857 (which, I suggest somewhat speculatively,
                    intersects with Keats in striking ways around quoting), and concludes with a
                    bigger leap ahead in time, to contemporary practices of quoting Keats through
                    various internet technologies and platforms. In each case the opening line to
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title> (“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever”) serves as the focal point
                    around which the networked connections of quoting practices and Keats’s
                    posthumous life circulate. Ultimately, the essay contends that a history of
                    Keats’s varied emanations across and through popular culture must of necessity
                    be a history of mediation, and the essay models a way of enacting that kind of
                    work. </p>

                <div type="section">
                <p>We see this logic play out already in <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                opening passage as Keats explains his decision to take up this
                tale of a Cockney/Classical dreamer overwhelming himself with poesy. The examples of
                things of beauty that “bind us to the earth” and “Haunt us till they become a
                cheering light / Unto our souls” emphasize processes of repetition (7, 30–1). We
                have the sun and the moon with their various daily, monthly, and yearly cycles;
                trees sprouting, clear rills cooling themselves, forest brakes rich with blooming
                flowers, all in their cyclical manners; and lastly poems, which recur in the form of
                repeated readings: “All lovely tales that we have heard or read” (22). The things
                themselves are all variable, repeatable things, but they also replicate insofar as
                they become “bound to us so fast / That […] / They always must be with us, or we
                die” (31–3). The joy of beauty both is and is not a part of the thing itself&#8212;it
                inheres in the object and in the relation that forms between the object and the
                observer of it. This logic continues in the poem’s narrative, as Endymion suffers
                over his repeated viewings, remembrances, and retellings of his encounters with
                Cynthia, “that completed form of all completeness” (606). Of course, the “completed
                form” of Cynthia is apparently incomplete until she returns in a new body (that of
                the Indian Maid), which turns out to have been a sort of clone of the original all
                along. Only by such repetition does anything ever happen in the poem. And even then,
                very little does, as ultimately Endymion ascends with his lover as the poem promptly
                and without fanfare ends. Yet as Noel Jackson suggests, the poem’s “inconsequential
                fulfillment, its fulfillment of inconsequence” functions as a “site of contingency,
                vitality, and (indeed) promise” (329). From one perspective the poem represents
                stagnation, but from a more properly Keatsian one, that stagnation appears
                dynamic.</p>
            <p>That this opening line from <title level="m">Endymion</title> becomes (arguably)
                Keats’s most frequently quoted verse is fitting given that quoting operates in a
                manner similar to Keats’s beauty and joy. Quotation, too, must be reiterated. It
                also does not need to emerge from a position of authenticity or originality.
                Particularly in the nineteenth century as his posthumous reputation slowly took
                shape, Keats was a poet more quoted than read. While it’s certainly true that some
                instances of quoting Keats resulted from a reader drawing on deep engagement with
                his work, it’s also true that the prevalence of quoting Keats during his first
                half-century or so of posthumous existence meant that many could interact with his
                work primarily through quotation without access to reading the work in other forms.
                Furthermore, quoting begets more quoting. Precisely because of the iterability of
                quoting, one could regularly <emph>quote</emph> Keats without having
                really ever <emph>read</emph> Keats.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> In her book <title level="m">Quotation
                                Marks</title>, Marjorie Garber poses a similar sort of iterability with
                            respect to quoting’s relationship to authority: “It instates an
                            authority elsewhere, and, at the same time, it imparts that authority,
                            temporarily, to the speaker or writer” (2). While Keats may not have had
                            much cultural authority in the first decade when he began to be quoted
                            (the 1820s), the authority accrued to him and to writers quoting him
                            gained further relevance precisely through the nature of quotation which
                            Garber identifies.</note> In short, the mechanisms of quotation
                play a large part in the shaping and spread of Keats’s legacy. This is certainly
                true today when we can encounter quotations from Keats across a wide range of
                websites, not to mention the many misquotations and wild misattributions that mingle
                with the more accurate materials. As ubiquitous as Keats is now, quoting Keats in
                the nineteenth century was widespread as well. One particularly influential instance
                occurred at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, when more than one
                million visitors over the space of five months contemplated paintings, drawings,
                photographs, and examples of other arts while the opening line of 
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> was presiding over them, the words emblazoned on the arch above
                the building’s entrance. Keats’s line was positioned so as to condition exhibition
                viewers’ responses to a wide variety of media forms, including the nascent form of
                photography, which raised significant questions about beauty’s thing-ness due to
                the technology’s relationship to reproducibility.</p>
            <p>The logics of cultural and aesthetic reproducibility in the nineteenth century have
                informed many scholarly treatments of Keats, which view his poetic project as a
                belated one, but one which nonetheless attempts an intervention, even if it occurs
                only through secondary, indirect, or remediated forms.<note place="foot" resp="author"> One thinks, for instance, of
                            Marjorie Levinson’s argument in <title level="m">Keats’s Life of
                                Allegory</title> that Keats develops his poetics out of his position of
                            alienation with respect to his class identity. In more positive terms,
                            both Charles Rzepka, in his reading of <title level="a">On First Looking Into Chapman’s
                            Homer,</title> and Jeffrey Cox, in his analysis of “Cockney classicism,” suggest
                            how we might view Keats’s alienation and belatedness as more unalloyed
                            advantages, as opposed to causes of symptomatic anxious
                        responses.</note> That last term, <emph>remediated</emph>,
                has become of particular interest to many romanticists currently
                engaging in what has been dubbed “Romantic Media Studies.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> An important
                            early articulation of this term comes via the title of Lauren Neefe and
                            Yohei Igarashi’s 2013 MLA roundtable devoted to the topic. More
                            recently, in his <title level="m">Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and
                            British Romanticism</title>, Andrew Burkett offers a rich overview of,
                            and exciting ways forward for, the subfield. His book shows how writers
                            in the romantic period “express[ed] diverse, flexible conceptions of
                            both media and mediation … before the media concept became distilled
                            later in the nineteenth century into its modern sense as the notion of
                            the technological channel of communication” (3).</note>
                Romantic media studies includes not only the many exciting works devoted to the
                textuality of the period (book history approaches like William St. Clair’s, media
                ecological work like Maureen McLane’s, and media-theory-inflected work like Celeste
                Langan’s and Andrew Burkett’s); it also extends to projects that situate romanticist
                scholarship within contemporary issues of mediation (digitally-built projects like
                NINES and the Blake Archive, but also traditional scholarly works that explore the
                implications of contemporary digital culture, such as Jerome McGann’s
                <title level="m">A New Republic of Letters</title>). With specific regard to Keats, I
                share Yohei Igarashi’s contention that “communicative mediation constitutes a
                significant, although still largely unremarked, concern of Keats’s poetry and
                letters” (173). By opening with the iterability of beauty in
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, then, I suggest that when we speak of aesthetics in Keats, we
                must also speak of mediation in Keats. If beauty must be reproduced in order to
                persist as a joy, then it must also be remediated. </p>
            <p>This essay approaches Keats’s afterlife in popular culture by examining how he has
                been, and continues to be, quoted. I argue that quoting ought to be understood as a
                material and medial practice, not merely a discursive one. In order to grasp the
                significance of Keats’s place within popular culture, we need to attend to the
                material mechanisms of quotation&#8212;which requires asking questions about access,
                distribution, remediation, replication, and transformation, among other material
                processes related to reading&#8212;and we need to place those mechanisms in a historical
                frame which allows for both continuity and tension between materialities past,
                present, and future. To explore some of these dynamics with respect to quoting
                Keats, I examine three different broadly construed moments and media technologies:
                periodical magazines in the decades immediately after Keats’s death, photography in
                the mid-to-late-nineteenth century, and the internet in our contemporary moment. In
                each case, as I will show, we cannot treat these moments and technologies in their
                own vacuums. The practices of quoting Keats, both past and present, always operate
                within a media ecology that operates through networks of association between various
                media and through different temporal frames.<note

                            for how quotation operates with respect to different genres and media.
                            Her focus is on how quotations of Shakespeare in novels serve to
                            buttress Shakespeare’s growing reputation, while also helping to lend
                            cultural significance to the novel form itself. The “cultures of
                            quotation” that influence the novelistic treatments involve other forms
                            of media, including the stage, periodicals, and the conventions of
                            polite conversation. See especially 21–48.</note></p>
            <p>As is the case with the other essays assembled in this volume, such work benefits
                from probing the borders between scholarly and popular discourse. This is
                particularly true for studying Keats, since he was and is a figure with pop-cultural
                standing alongside his revered place in literary studies. These borders are porous,
                and to better conceive of Keats and his work, we need to understand not just popular
                Keats and scholarly Keats, but also the web of relations linking the two.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Garber
                            discusses the closing lines of Keats’s <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title> and the
                            thorny issue of who speaks them, as an exemplary case of “the quotation
                            as floating signifier” (29). While in scholarly contexts there has been
                            much debate about what precisely Keats quotes the urn saying, in the
                            many examples Garber cites from a variety of pop cultural sources, the
                            lines are unambiguously credited as something Keats himself uttered. I
                            suggest a similar dynamic plays out with the opening line of
                            <title level="m">Endymion</title>, which signifies in vastly different
                            ways as it moves from and between scholarly and popular
                        contexts.</note> Particularly for those of us invested in doing
                public humanities work, knowledge of popular discourse around figures, works, or
                issues with which we engage in scholarly ways becomes crucial for bridging such
                divides, crossing such borders, or perhaps shifting the borders themselves. Work on
                the reception of Keats demonstrates that he has always been taken up in a number of
                disciplines and cultural contexts, and thus provides a historical frame and model
                for engagement with literary work that eschews our conventional notions of
                disciplinary borders.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See for instance Sarah Wooton’s work on
                            representations of Keats in nineteenth-century visual art, and Ann
                            Weirda Rowland’s work on Keats’s reception in turn-of-the-century
                            Boston.</note> We continue the legacy of Keats and his
                afterlives by understanding how he continues to be taken up in widely differing
                contexts, and we participate in extending that legacy particularly when we break
                boundaries separating domains like the scholarly and the popular.</p>
            <p>How exactly, then, might we situate my first example of quoting Keats, from what is
                essentially a school newspaper in 1828 showing its Keats-fanboy cred? The text in
                question is <ref target="https://bit.ly/341qXKF"><title level="m">The Harrovian</title></ref>, published by students of the famed
                public school, Harrow. In the closing article (<title level="a">The Editor Out of Bounds</title>) of the
                July 1828 issue, we encounter Keats’s opening lines of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> used to characterize the joyful way in which the young approach the
                world (192).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                            Keats appears elsewhere in the <title level="j">Harrovian</title>,
                            including on the third page of the first issue’s opening essay, <title level="a">The
                            Greek Drama,</title> where “the lamented Keats” is referred to as “the most
                            pure and imaginative poet of the age, and one in whom the springs of
                            sweet and honied thoughts, were more bright and beautiful than in any
                            writer, Shakespeare excepted, since the days of Homer” (3).</note> The editor,
                Robert Aris Willmott, gets the second line a bit
                wrong (“The loveliness increaseth,” instead of “Its loveliness increases”), which is
                commonplace in an era when one could not simply Google a line to check for accuracy
                (why such misquotations still occur in an era when one <emph>can</emph>
                Google for accuracy is a question I address in this essay’s final section). In 1828
                Keats had also yet to be republished, so the Harrow students would have relied on
                being some of the lucky few who had access to a copy of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> (or perhaps only read extracts from the poem printed in reviews
                from the time of its initial publication ten years before). In the next issue
                (August 1828) the lines appear again, this time coming as an epigraph to Edward
                Seymour’s essay on John Moultrie’s poetry, and this time with greater
                accuracy&#8212;“Its,” instead of “the,” but still “increaseth” instead of “increases”
                (198).</p>
            <p>As far as I’ve been able to discover, with the exception of quotations of the poem in
                reviews from around the time of its publication, these quotations from the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title> in summer 1828 are the earliest instances of the
                line being quoted.<note place="foot" resp="author">  It would be difficult if not impossible to rule out
                            that other earlier examples exist. And of course there are limitations
                            to relying on digital databases in performing such searches, given that
                            they are incomplete and are prone to errors of both the technical sort
                            (text searches in such databases rely on optical character recognition
                            software, which can have high error rates) and the human variety (as when
                            metadata about a digitized text’s publication date is incorrect).
                            However, based on searches for “thing of beauty is a joy” across
                            multiple databases (HathiTrust, Google Books, British Periodicals,
                            <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title>), there are almost no results in the 1820s, a
                            clear but slow uptick in the 1830s and 40s, and sizable jump in the
                            1850s. In the <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title>, for instance, there are no
                            results until 1832, and almost eight times as many results for 1850–9 as
                            for 1830–49. As I discuss later in this essay, the jump in the 1850s is
                            largely thanks to the line’s presence at the Manchester Art Treasures
                            Exhibition in 1857 (in that year the <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title> returns
                            123 results for the phrase).</note> Just over twenty years
                later, in July 1849, the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title> could refer to the
                line as “Keats’ often-quoted line” (<title level="a">To Correspondents</title>). But how exactly did that
                come to be the case? <title level="m">Endymion</title> was not exactly a bestseller,
                and editions of Keats’s poetry were few and far between before the late 1840s.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> The first
                            collected edition of Keats’s work appeared in 1829 in Paris in a volume
                            collecting Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats together, published by the
                            Galignani brothers. While other editions appeared in the 1830s from
                            American publishers (who were not constrained by copyright), it was not
                            until 1840 that an edition appeared in England. See J. R. MacGillivray’s
                                <title level="m">Keats: A Bibliography and Reference Guide</title> for
                            more detail.</note> I suspect that schools in the 1820s and
                1830s were a vital breeding ground for Keats’s legacy, in part because of the access
                to books otherwise inaccessible which they may have enabled. Clearly there were some
                Keats fans at Harrow in 1828, and we know as well that a few years later at
                Cambridge, Keats was one of the favored poets discussed at the meetings of the
                Apostles Club, whose members included Alfred Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, and Keats’s
                eventual biographer, Richard Monckton Milnes. One institutional factor which affects
                the early history of quoting Keats, then, is the nature of the elite educational
                system in the decades after Keats’s death. </p>
            <p>With the case of Harrow and <title level="m">The Harrovian</title> one must also place
                quoting Keats within the broader context of periodical writing at the end of the
                Regency period. Of course, during Keats’s career periodical criticism played a
                significant part in shaping his contemporary reception as well as setting the stakes
                for his posthumous life (<title level="m">Adonais</title> begins with a preface
                blaming Keats’s death on the cruelty and bad taste of reviewers). During Willmott’s
                precocious entry into the world of periodical magazines in 1828, his quoting of
                Keats slots into a still ongoing debate about poetry, of which Keats and the Cockney
                School attacks were just one example of the broader transformations in periodical
                culture which had been in process since the end of the eighteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Much has been
                            written about Keats and the Cockney School attacks in recent decades,
                            including the significant reappraisals in the late-90s by Nicholas Roe
                            and Jeffrey Cox. Duncan Wu offers this helpful summation of current
                            critical consensus about what the attacks meant: “In Z.’s anatomy, a
                            ‘Cockney’ lacked taste and education but was full of ‘vulgar’
                            pretension. The term was a class slur by which the well-educated Tories
                            portrayed their liberal counterparts as ill-bred social climbers” (37).
                            As both Roe and Cox argue, the attacks signaled a recognition, from the
                            attackers themselves, of the potential social and cultural power that
                            such “ill-bred” figures represented. For treatments of the broader
                            dynamics at play in periodical writing and literary reviewing during the
                            period, see Richard Cronin’s <title level="m">Paper Pellets</title>, Karen

                cultural influence of periodicals during the early-nineteenth century, it’s not
                surprising that Harrow’s school newspaper would be modelled on popular periodicals
                of the day, nor is it surprising that after editing the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title> Willmott contributed to
                <title level="j">Fraser’s Magazine</title> and the <title level="j">London Magazine</title>
                in the years immediately after completing his
                schooling at Harrow. In June 1830, Willmott publishes his first of many pieces for
                <title level="j">Fraser’s</title>, and he opens his discussion of “The Minor Greek
                Poets” by quoting the opening to <title level="m">Endymion</title> yet again. In his
                praise of Keats in the essay, Willmott buttresses his judgment by quoting the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> ascribing to Keats “‘a pervading tunefulness
                of nature’” (<title level="a">Greek Poets</title> 608). At first glance one might assume that Willmott
                quotes from Francis Jeffrey’s tentative defense of Keats published in August 1820,
                but it actually comes from Thomas Carlyle’s review of John Gibson Lockhart’s
                <title level="m">The Life of Robert Burns</title> in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title>
                in December 1828. In context, Carlyle’s comment is more faint
                praise than Willmott makes it seem: the full quotation is “a certain vague pervading
                tunefulness of nature” (281). More importantly, the full context also makes the
                connection to the attacks on Keats clearer: Lockhart was, of course, the writer of
                the Cockney School essays in <title level="j">Blackwood’s Magazine</title>. All of
                this is to say, when Willmott quotes Keats in <title level="j">Fraser’s</title> in
                1830, and when he and others quote Keats in the <title level="j">Harrovian</title> in
                1828, they are continuing the periodical jockeying over Keats’s reputation that
                began a decade earlier with the famous attacks in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>,
                the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>While we may tend to look toward Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the most
                significant early shaper of Keats’s posthumous reputation, it’s worth recalling that
                the periodical wars to which Shelley was responding by elegizing Keats continued to
                be fought long after they first began when Keats was still alive. Willmott’s defense
                of Keats (and his marshalling of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>’s
                opinion as evidence in his favor) no doubt felt necessary when one could encounter
                fresh attacks on Keats such as John Wilson Croker’s in the
                <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> in 1833. Fifteen years
                after his notoriously caustic review of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, Croker
                deliberately sets out to do the same to Alfred Tennyson’s 1832 volume. In a letter
                to <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> publisher John
                Murray, Croker promised to “undertake Tennyson and … make another Keats of him”
                (qtd. in Sherwood 41). It was not only that Croker wanted to create a similar effect
                on Tennyson. He saw the two poets as committing similar affronts to appropriate
                poetic taste. Croker opens the review by noting that Tennyson is “another and a
                brighter star of that galaxy or <emph>milky way</emph> of poetry of which
                the lamented Keats was the harbinger” (81). Quickly, though, a surprising turn of
                humility seems to occur, as Croker claims to “take this occasion to sing our
                palinode on the subject of ‘Endymion’” (82). He goes on to apologize for his
                short-sightedness, which prevented him from “foresee[ing] the unbounded popularity
                which has carried it through we know not how many editions.” Lastly he requests that
                “the publisher of the new and beautiful edition of Keats’s works now in the press,
                with graphic illustrations by Calcott and Turner, will do us the favour and the
                justice to notice our conversion in his prolegomena” (82). </p>
            <p>Of course, <title level="m">Endymion</title> had not gone through
                any editions beyond the first, and no such edition of his collected works existed
                except as a fiction employed by Croker to mock any who might be trying to rescue
                Keats from the stigma placed upon him by the <title level="j">Quarterly</title> back
                in 1818. The fiction demonstrates that Keats’s posthumous reputation was continually
                affected by actual material bibliographic practices and figural representations of
                them. And what matters here is that, according to Croker, not only is Keats not
                being read, he’s not being published, and not being published in particular ways:
                namely, with the elaborations of visual elements provided by fashionable painters
                like Callcott and Turner. He <emph>was</emph> being published, however, in
                one of the most popular venues for poetry publishing during the late 1820s and
                1830s: in the literary annuals and gift books which were adorned with engravings of
                paintings by figures like Callcott and Turner. Keats’s <title level="a">On a Picture of Leander</title> and
                “In drear nighted December” had appeared in Thomas Hood’s <title level="m">The
                Gem</title> (in 1829 and 1830, respectively). We might thus read Croker’s crass
                posthumous mockery as rooted in defensiveness. Seeing that poetry was being
                published in other forms than expensive illustrated editions, and seeing that the
                dastardly sapling Keats was taking root in the popular soil of the annuals, Croker
                feels compelled to lash out not only at the individual poet, but also at the
                systemic shifts in the publishing of poetry.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Lee Erickson argues that economic forces
                            were largely to blame for the steep drop in the numbers of poetry books
                            published in England after 1820, when the market for such books hit its
                            peak. He notes that the popularity of annuals and gift books helped to
                            exacerbate the other forces that were making it difficult for publishers
                            to invest in the publication of volumes of poetry. See especially
                            26–48.</note> Just as with the initial attacks on Keats, this
                later one can be read as a sign of concern about the change Keats represented. </p>
            <p>Given that in the 1820s and 30s Keats’s reputation was still being wrestled over in
                the pages of the same magazines which sought to silence him when he was still
                breathing, we ought to read Willmott’s instances of quoting Keats in periodicals not
                simply as neutral expressions of appreciation, but as willful acts of contestation.
                Willmott and his young peers at the <title level="j">Harrovian</title> were seeking to
                make names for themselves within the periodical arena, and one strategy for so doing
                was to renew and extend the cause of defending another youngster who had fought in
                the same space a decade before. In short, these early instances of quoting Keats’s
                most famous line play a part in making it the most famous of his lines, and they
                ought to be understood as responses to the material and medial conditions of
                late-Regency/early-Victorian periodical writing, through which Keats’s steady spread
                into popular discourse had to be negotiated and actively pursued.</p>
            <p>While the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title> calls the opening line of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> “Keats’ often-quoted line” in 1849, its popularity
                surely experienced a surge after 1857. The clear reason for the spike is the line’s
                presence over the archway at the entrance to the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition, which ran from May to October 1857. Visitors would have seen it there,
                but it also became a common reference point in writings about the exhibition in
                newspapers and periodicals during that year. Announcements in April describing the
                upcoming exhibition often noted the presence of Keats’s verse: on 10 April 1857 both
                the <title level="j">Globe</title> and <title level="j">Morning
                    Chronicle</title> used the same notice from the <title level="j">Manchester
                    Guardian</title>, which noted, “At the eastern (or entrance) end, we find the
                well-known and very appropriate line&#8212;‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever!’” Over
                the next few weeks, leading up to the opening of the exhibition on 5 May, similar
                notices appeared in newspapers across the country, giving Keats’s line probably its
                most concentrated period of quotation since the first publication of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> nearly four decades prior. One wonders if John
                Wilson Croker came across any of these newspaper articles, and if he did, was he
                perhaps still galled that his attempts to relegate <title level="m">Endymion</title>
                to obscurity in 1818 had failed, thanks in part to the popularity of that one
                eminently quotable opening line? While I am generally disinclined to dance on
                anyone’s grave, I also cannot help noting that Croker died just a few months after
                so many newspapers admiringly quoted Keats in April 1857. Perhaps it was Croker who
                ultimately found himself snuffed out by an article. </p>
            <p>If it’s any consolation to Croker, at least he wasn’t alive in October to witness an
                even greater concentration of approving quotations of Keats. During the months the
                exhibition was open, reviews and notices of it frequently mentioned Keats’s line,
                but it garnered even greater attention at the exhibition’s final day, 17 October
                1857. After an orchestra played music to mark the conclusion, Thomas Fairbairn,
                Chairman of the Executive Committee for the exhibition, offered a brief speech to
                officially close the exhibition: “… when you have left this building the Exhibition
                of Art-Treasures is closed. I hope that you will never forget the liberality which
                has enabled that Exhibition to be formed, and that hereafter all of you will be
                enabled to realise, the truth of the poet’s line&#8212;‘A thing of beauty is a joy for
                ever’” (<title level="a">Close</title>). By all accounts these remarks were met with robust cheers from the
                nearly twenty-thousand assembled guests. Keats’s words thus announced the exhibition
                in early advertisements for it, they oversaw visitors over the course of five months
                as they entered the building, and they echoed throughout that structure amid the
                applause marking the end of the exhibition.</p>
            <p>In this instance we again see the importance of the periodical press, although not
                with respect to the same culture of literary reviewing as that which animates
                Wilmott’s quoting of Keats in 1828–30. This case also involves multiple media
                through which the quoting of Keats occurs (architecture, image, print, voice). To
                further establish the connection between this example and my final section focused
                on quoting Keats via image-sharing websites, there is one additional
                nineteenth-century medium to which I will briefly turn: photography. The connection
                between Keats and photography is an indirect and subtle one, but the presence of his
                opening line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> at the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition suggests potential ways we might illuminate that connection further. </p>
            <p>As photographic technologies continued to evolve in the first few decades after Louis
                Dageurre and Henry Fox Talbot in the 1830s each separately developed and promoted
                their image-making methods, several common aspects of photography’s cultural
                significance began to emerge. As Steve Edwards notes in <title level="m">The Making
                of English Photography</title>, “The most striking feature of nineteenth-century
                English writing on photography is its overall sense of unease” (15). One primary
                form of that unease had to do with its uncertain status as art. Even though Talbot
                referred to his process as “the Art of Photogenic Drawing,” many viewed photography
                as no more than a purely mechanical process, one which involved little to no
                intervention of the artistic mind. Photographers and advocates for photography had
                to work hard to convince people that, as one correspondent in <title level="j">The
                Photographic Journal</title> put it in May 1859, “photographers can think with
                their cameras as well as painters can with their brushes, or sculptors with their
                chisels” (<title level="a">Photography and Art</title>). Even as late as 1861, The Royal Commissioners
                responsible for organizing the International Exhibition of 1862 thought otherwise
                about the apparatus and products of the camera. In deciding on the taxonomy for that
                exhibition, they followed the Great Exhibition of 1851 in classing photography among
                the “Machinery” section instead of among the “Fine Arts,” to the great
                disappointment and ire of the members of the Photographic Society. A great debate
                ensued, with the Photographic Society attempting to convince the Commissioners that
                photography did not belong “among the ploughs, harrows, and watering cans!” as one
                writer for the <title level="j">Photographic Journal</title> put it (Edwards 165–7).
                Sadly for the photographers, they did not prevail, and in a rather nasty twist of
                fate, many of their works of art (or rather, works of manufacture) were damaged,
                since the pictures were displayed on an upper floor, where intense heat and humidity
                caused many to start decaying (Edwards 189). </p>
            <p> Although Edwards does not discuss it in his book, which treats at length the 1862
                International Exhibition controversy, there was an earlier exhibition at which
                photography was displayed unambiguously as a fine art: the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition. The executive committee designed the exhibition to demonstrate Britain’s
                wealth of privately owned art works (on loan from the nation’s nobility), and, in a
                similarly nationalistic vein, to educate the public about art and cultural history.
                As Elizabeth Pergam argues in her book-length study of the Exhibition, there was
                also a clear commercial impulse at work, even though the organizing committee
                members tried hard to divorce those concerns from the supposedly more lofty cultural
                and artistic ones. It’s not entirely clear why the committee so readily defined “Art
                Treasures” as inclusive of “Oil Paintings, Water-colour Drawings, Engravings, and
                Photographs” along with various kinds of plastic and decorative arts (Pergam 245).
                But whatever the reasoning (commercial, educational, art historical, or otherwise),
                the Manchester Exhibition represents one of the first times that mass numbers of
                people would have experienced photography in the context of an art exhibition. Some
                1.3 million people visited it, and when they did, they were encouraged by Keats’s
                words to think of photographs as things of beauty capable of providing as much joy
                as any others. </p>
            <p> In addition to its uneasy cultural status, one of the key issues for photography in
                its infancy revolves around the uncertain ontology of the photographic image. In the
                early decades of photographic images, writers often explored the tension between the
                material and (seemingly) immaterial properties of those images. That is, in
                attempting to explain what precisely photographs were, writers frequently took
                recourse to quasi-magical explanations, as in Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s 1843
                letter to Mary Russell Mitford, where she describes her wonder at the daguerreotype:
                “Think of a man sitting down in the sun and leaving his facsimile in all its full
                completion of outline and shadow, steadfast on a plate, at the end of a minute and a
                half! The Mesmeric disembodiment of spirits strikes one as a degree less marvelous”
                (qtd. in Fraser 138). Barrett Browning recognizes the material processes at work&#8212;the
                interaction of light and shadow with a chemically treated plate&#8212;but as did many
                other writers, she also poses this interaction as a kind of spiritual, immaterial,
                magical process. </p>
            <p> The tenuous materiality of photography, then, made it difficult for writers to
                articulate what exactly was the thing of beauty that might be a joy for ever. And
                moreover, that tenuous materiality was even more tenuous over time. As the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> wrote of photographic processes in 1843,
                they offered the potential of collapsing time into minute durations that seemed
                capable of preserving those times and places: “The self-delineated landscape is
                seized at one epoch of time, and is embalmed amid all the co-existing events of the
                social and physical world […]; and every picture becomes an authentic chapter in the
                history of the world” (<title level="a">Photogenic Drawing</title> 330). A further temporal complication,
                however, is raised by the increasing prevalence, over the next few decades, of
                photographic processes which employed multiple stages. Whereas the daguerreotype, as
                discussed by both Barrett Browning and the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>,
                involved a single process (light acting upon a plate to produce a positive image
                thereon), what became the standard later was the dual, negative-positive process.
                One advantage of this two-part method was that multiple copies could be produced
                from a single negative. That reproducibility, as in Keats, meant that permanence was
                more likely, since an object could be made and remade again and again. But that dual
                process also rendered less clear the ontology of the image. We see this tension on
                display in one of the reviews of the photographic gallery at the Manchester Art
                Treasures Exhibition, where a writer for the
                <title level="j">Liverpool and Manchester Photographic Journal</title> (later
                the <title level="j">British Journal of Photography</title>) begins by noting the
                “striking omission” of “direct photography” (such as daguerreotypes, which by 1857
                were becoming far less common). He regrets that “all that we see here are the result
                of a subsequent process […] the original negatives are nowhere visible”
                (<title level="a">Exhibition</title> 126). It might seem odd to us that a visitor to a gallery of
                photography would complain about not having the negatives on display, but that fact
                demonstrates the extent to which the photographic object was not yet a culturally
                fixed one. All of this is to say, early photographic discourse shows how the
                technology posed challenges for how to locate the materiality of this particular
                aesthetic object. It offered the sense of an eternally fixed image, “an authentic
                chapter in the history of the world,” as the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>
                puts it. But it also seemed multiply-distributed across space and time thanks to its
                reproducibility, and as would later become clear, due to its liability to
                change.</p>
            <p> We see these dynamics play out in the commercial realm of photography as well, where
                once again Keats’s words prove rather useful in their elasticity and applicability.
                There are scores of examples from the late-nineteenth century of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s opening line being used in advertisements, for everything from
                clothing to stove polish, and, in a number of examples, for photography. Take the
                case of John Rowlinson of Bury, who in 1857 owned a “Photographic and Fine Art
                Gallery.” In the <title level="j">Bury Times</title> in October of 1857, as the
                Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition was coming to a close, Rowlinson was promoting
                his services by using the opening line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> as the
                epigram for his advertisements. The notice refers to the “beautiful Art of
                Photography,” and encourages patrons to take advantage of the ample natural light
                which flows into his newly constructed gallery for the purposes of “tak[ing] Correct
                Likenesses in any kind of weather.” The advertisement concludes with this rather
                macabre warning: “Call at JOHN ROWLINSON’S Photographic Establishment, 17,
                PRINCESS-STREET, BURY, and have your shadow taken before the substance fades away.”
                Besides reminding potential customers of their own mortality, Rowlinson’s
                advertisement capitalizes on the tensions inherent to the nature of photography
                which Keats’s line captures as well. Photographs are mere shadows, and yet they
                persist and endure after the substance fades away; things of beauty have a material
                basis, and yet the joy which they also are transcends that finitude. Even if this
                advertisement were not inspired by the presence of Keats’s words at the Manchester
                Art Treasures Exhibition, the congruence of the three&#8212;the line from
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, the popularization of photography as art at the
                exhibition, and Rowlinson’s advertisements in the same month that Keats’s words and
                the exhibition were being linked in numerous newspapers across the
                country&#8212;nonetheless creates a moment during which the quoting of Keats’s most famous
                sentiment was closely associated with this new media form and how it was understood
                in relation to aesthetics. </p>
            <p>One way to link my first two stories with my last is with the concept of the
                middlebrow, which Brian Bates, in the introduction to this collection, offers as a
                valuable heuristic for making sense of Keats and/in popular culture. Both periodical
                culture&#8212;which during the Romantic period moved more and more towards democratization
                and away from its roots in gentility&#8212;and photography&#8212;which began as the product of
                Talbot’s aristocratic leisure but quickly transformed into a mass, popular
                technology&#8212;fulfill several of Beth Driscoll’s eight family attributes of the
                middlebrow: “middle class, reverential towards elite culture, entrepreneurial,
                mediated, feminized, emotional, recreational, and earnest” (6). The story of quoting
                Keats across the nineteenth century is undoubtedly one told through and enabled by
                the particular affordances of the media cultures of the time; it is also a story of
                how those media-ecological entanglements emerge from and help shape ideas about the
                aesthetic, about class, and about the democratization of culture. Keats becomes, and
                continues to be, an effective tool for these mechanisms at least in part because of
                his own work’s status as decidedly middlebrow, whether conceived of through
                Christopher Ricks’s embarrassed Keats, Marjorie Levinson’s illegitimate Keats,
                Nicholas Roe’s unapologetically Cockney Keats, or any number of other accounts which
                position Keats in the liminal spaces between the high and the low, the elite and the
                popular. The forms of mediation which give us quoted Keats in the nineteenth century
                are themselves likewise situated in the space of the middlebrow.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Driscoll’s
                            focus is on the contemporary texts and institutions of the middlebrow,
                            but she (and other scholars of the middlebrow) have stressed the
                            importance of the concept’s emergence at the turn of the twentieth
                            century, and the “family resemblance” definitional approach Driscoll
                            takes also allows for a fluid application across different periods and
                            contexts (5–6). With respect to Keats, his early critics certainly cast
                            him as what would become recognizable as middlebrow about a century
                            later (the Cockney School attacks arguably characterize Keats’s poetry
                            with all eight of Driscoll’s features of the middlebrow); Keats slowly
                            becomes associated with high culture as he enters the canon by the
                            early-twentieth century; and he then
                            increasingly becomes associated with middlebrow institutions later in
                            the century, in part through his quotability in various popular culture
                            contexts.</note> I turn lastly, then, to that intensely
                middlebrow contemporary realm of mediation, the internet, and especially that corner
                of the internet through which individuals self-fashion themselves through acts of
                quotation.</p>
            <p> My significant jump forward in time may seem to place us in a wildly different media
                environment than that of the nineteenth century. As I’ve shown, however, a focus on
                quoting Keats in popular culture in the past is one that leads us into a rich,
                multiply-mediated ecosystem. The mechanisms of contemporary new media are certainly
                different in kind and degree, but they nonetheless exist in relation to the broader
                history of media that helps illuminate Keats’s reception beginning two hundred years
                ago. Just as a focus on quoting Keats in the periodicals of the 1820s and 30s can
                help reveal the particularities of that media-specific moment; and just as a focus
                on quoting Keats around the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition shows a confluence
                between the democratization of art, the continuing spread of periodical culture, and
                the emergence of the photographic arts; so too does a focus on quoting Keats on the
                wilds of the internet demonstrate the way that the middlebrow propagates through
                non-human media agents as much as through conscious intentional human actors. With
                respect to Keats’s presence on quotation websites, and particularly on image-sharing
                sites like Instagram and Pinterest, my primary interests lie with what happens when
                quoting goes awry. As I suggested with the initial examples of the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title>’s slight misquotations, the internet is not where
                misinformation, misattribution, and other forms of departures from reality and fact
                began; however, I focus on the mistaken examples of quoting Keats on the internet
                because they are particularly intriguing for their connections with how quoting
                propagates through digital platforms. </p>
            <p>The variety of misquotations and misattributions associated with Keats floating
                around the internet is impressive, though not necessarily atypical. Garson O’Toole,
                the pseudonymous founder of the website, Quote Investigator (quoteinvestigator.com),
                and author of <title level="m">Hemingway Didn’t Say That: The Truth Behind Familiar
                Quotations</title>, has spent nearly a decade attempting to catalogue, correct, and
                explain the origins of the many spurious quotations that circulate on the internet
                in various fora.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The pseudonym belongs to Gregory F. Sullivan, a

                twentieth-century American writer who wrote a biography of Dorothy Parker. Even so,
                the range of misattributed Keats quotations helps to illuminate some of O’Toole’s
                types of misattributions and the mechanisms that produce them.<note place="foot" resp="author">  O’Toole

            <p>Among the examples I’ve found related to Keats are the following: lines from W. B.
                Yeats’s poem, <title level="a">Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,</title> which likely emerges from the
                similarity of their names (not to mention the fact that The Smiths have long
                asserted that Keats and Yeats are on your side).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">  O’Toole classes “similar names” as one
                            common form in the Reader Error category.</note> Another
                example of this sort, which involves both the similarity of their names and their
                alphabetical proximity, is this section from a speech by John F. Kennedy: “The
                problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics, whose
                horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things
                that never were.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a thorough explanation on the origin of this
                            misattribution, see Sue Brewton’s blog post devoted to the topic: <ref

                        </note> Thanks to Jane Campion’s film <title level="m">Bright
                    Star</title>, which featured a significant amount of dialogue lifted directly from
                Keats’s letters alongside invented sentences and conversations, one can find at
                least one example of what O’Toole calls the “historical fiction” mechanism, or when
                a quotation from a piece of historical fiction gets attributed directly to the
                person depicted in the fiction. In <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, for instance,
                Keats as portrayed by Ben Whishaw says to Abbie Cornish as Fanny Brawne, “We have
                woven a web, you and I, attached to this world but a separate world of our own
                invention.” The sentence has circulated widely, sometimes with images from the scene
                in the film, but more commonly with simply a textual attribution to Keats. While
                many misquotations and misattributions have fairly transparent explanations behind
                them, others confound (at least my) understanding. I’ve yet to concoct a plausible
                explanation for how these lines from Demi Lovato’s song, <title level="a">Skyscraper,</title> came to be
                connected with Keats:
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                <l>Go on and try to tear me down</l>
                <l>I will be rising from the ground</l>
                <l>Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper</l>
                    </lg>
                </quote>
                To the credit of the internet and
                its users, some sharing the image clearly do so in jest and in appreciation of the
                absurdity. One reblogger on tumblr offers this valuable corrective: “Obviously it
                wasn’t John Keats, it was Sylvia Plath.”<note

            <p>Other examples fall under O’Toole’s “ventriloquy” category, which involves statements
                that seem plausible to attribute to the person in question. For instance, one can
                perhaps understand why Keats might have written something like “I am profoundly
                enchanted with the flowing complexity in you” to Fanny Brawne. A variety of
                quotations about failure have also been attributed to Keats, perhaps because of his
                statement from the preface to <title level="m">Endymion</title>, “There is not a
                fiercer hell than the failure in a great object” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 102),
                as well as his more accepting perspective on failure from his 8 October 1818 letter
                to James Augustus Hessey: “I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail
                than not be among the greatest” (<title level="m">Letters</title> I: 374). While those
                two quotations do appear in results for a Google search for “Keats failure,” the far
                more common results, at least in the case of images, involve some version of this
                misattribution: “Don’t be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience.
                Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success.” What’s distinctive about this last
                quotation, though, is that it’s been around (in this form or in similar ones) and
                attributed to Keats since the late-nineteenth century. We see the collision of
                quoting practices from 140 years ago and those of today when encountering, for
                instance, the 1877 <title level="m">New Cyclopedia of Prose Illustrations</title> via
                Google Books.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                            The full quotation in Elon Foster’s <title level="m">New
                                Cyclopedia</title> is as follows: “Albeit failure in any cause produces
                            a correspondent misery in the soul, yet it is, in a sense, the highway
                            to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to
                            seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out
                            some form of error which we shall afterward carefully eschew” (320).
                            Other books attribute the quotation in this form to Keats, but as far as
                            I have discovered, Foster’s is the earliest one.</note> Here
                quoting Keats (although through a misattribution) occurs in a particular print
                context in 1877 which persists and evolves as it enters into the digital context of
                2019, and it does so through the particularities of mass digitization efforts, OCR
                technologies, and search capabilities.</p>
            <p>Although O’Toole uses the resources of the twenty-first century to do the work of
                tracking misquotations and misattributions, and he does also gesture toward the
                causal relationship between the proliferation of misinformation and digital media, I
                suggest that understanding the mechanisms of (mis)quoting in our era requires more
                attention to that causality. That is not to say that in the era of print periodicals
                and books that those media did not exert a causal force on such dynamics. How Keats
                became associated with the failure quotation in the <title level="m">New Cyclopedia
                    of Prose Illustrations</title> likely involved the specific ways that books like it
                were produced, as much as the association of Keats and some of his writing with
                failure. In the digital context, however, the mechanisms involved are often further
                removed from human activity and rooted more deeply in the materiality of
                computational processes. As such, the nature of quoting Keats (or anyone else) in
                contemporary media needs to be understood as part of a broader history of mediation,
                while also recognizing the distinctiveness of new media.</p>
            <p>My final example gestures toward some of the specific ways in which the
                particularities of digital media drive potential misattributions in ways distinct
                from the earlier history I’ve discussed thus far. The misattribution in question
                (“Life is divine Chaos. It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way”) I first
                encountered by searching for #johnkeats on Instagram, and have since encountered it
                on several other sites. There is perhaps an argument to be made that this example
                falls under the “ventriloquy” category, given that Keats’s famous coinage, negative
                capability, has led to a wide range of ideas associating Keats with “being in
                uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp;
                reason” (<title level="m">Letters</title> I: 193). Keats fans might thus find it
                plausible to attribute to him the notion of life as divine chaos, the messiness of
                which must be accepted and not irritably resisted. More importantly, though, this
                example illustrates some of the nebulous computational processes that likely led to
                the misattribution happening in the first place and contributed to its spread. A
                longer and slightly different version of the quotation (without the messiness
                phrase) is elsewhere attributed to solbeam, which is the pen name of a blogger who
                runs a site called “seekingsol.” In a post from August 2005 she wrote that the bit
                about life being divine chaos was what she would say to her 14-year-old self, had
                she the opportunity to do so. How, then, does that post from 2005 end up as a
                quotation misattributed to Keats?</p>
            <p>The quotation first started circulating and became popular on the internet in the
                form of a few similar images, with the attribution always to solbeam (a reverse
                image search for one of the popular iterations of this image comes up with matches
                as far back as February 2008). The shift to Keats appears to have resulted from the
                quotation being used in <title level="m">The Keatyn Chronicles</title>, a YA romance
                series by Jillian Dodd, published since 2012, and now on its twelfth volume. Keatyn
                is the name of the protagonist, which could have led to confusion on its own merits,
                but the confusion gets even worse because Keatyn’s nickname is Keats. One of her
                boyfriends, Brooklyn, likes to quote John Keats to her, which he does on multiple
                occasions while saying, “Keats for my Keats” (55, 160, 208). Early in the first book
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> gets a nod from Brooklyn, who
                utters the poem’s opening line while cuddling with Keatyn (53). Soon after this
                first romantic encounter, another tryst likewise involves quotation, but in this
                case he notes, “‘Life is messy. Like that quote we like … <emph>Life is
                    divine chaos</emph>. It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way’” (163). The
                italics seem to indicate that only “<emph>Life is divine chaos</emph>”
                refers to “that quote we like,” but in the instances when the sentences are
                attributed to Keats, the second sentence, which in the novel is Brooklyn’s gloss on
                the quotation, is always included as part of the quotation. Neither character in
                this scene refers to any part of the quotation as coming from Keats, but Brooklyn
                does refer to Keatyn as Keats just a few lines after he says the phrase. The simple
                textual proximity of “Keats” and the two sentences which get attributed to the poet
                seems unlikely to be the result of some individual’s misreading of the scene.
                Instead, it seems more likely that the algorithmic processes underlying the complex
                workings of internet virality, textual transformation, and memetic recirculation are
                responsible. </p>
            <p>One final detail adds to the likelihood that this particular misattribution results
                as much from machine readers as from human ones. In one image attributing “Life is
                divine chaos” to Keats, the attribution is actually to “Jhon Keats.” While a simple
                typo is a possibility, and Jhon is a rare alternative spelling for John, it is also
                a common mistake that occurs with optical character recognition software (OCR).
                Whitney Trettien writes about print-on-demand editions of Milton’s
                <title level="m">Areopagitica</title>, including one titled <title level="m">English Reprints Jhon
                    Milton Areopagitica</title>, and analyzes the “remediated,
                <emph>dis</emph>mediated strangeness” of OCR reprints.<note place="foot" resp="author">  Trettien distinguishes between
                            print-on-demand facsimile editions (produced using images of scanned
                            books) and OCR editions (which harvest text from scanned images and then
                            create print books meant to resemble modern typography). Currently on
                            Amazon one can find two different copies of facsimile editions of
                            Keats’s 1820 volume which list the author’s name as “Jhon Keats.” With
                            the facsimile editions, OCR is still used to automate information about
                            the texts, such as the title and author’s name.</note> Print
                books which have been scanned (or microform versions of print books that have been
                scanned) and then have OCR performed upon them often result in high error rates,
                especially with older typographical conventions. But OCR is unreliable with other
                forms of text as well, such as the cursive scripts used to create image-based memes
                with quotations from, or misattributions to, famous writers like Keats. And so we
                arrive at an image attributing “Life is divine chaos” to Jhon Keats, a process which
                begins with a popular meme attributing the same words to solbeam, which then appears
                in a novel featuring a character nicknamed Keats, which then transmigrates into a
                new meme attributing the words to John Keats, and through further machinic
                processes, John becomes Jhon. As digitized texts like Dodd’s
                <title level="m">Keatyn Chronicles</title> get acted upon by human users <emph>and</emph>
                by automated processes, strange new mechanisms produce unexpected instances of
                quoting like this one. While such mechanisms surely differ in degree and kind from
                the mechanisms of, say, periodical writing in the 1820s and 30s, or newspaper
                accounts of the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, we ought to treat each
                as part of a broader history of Keats’s pop cultural afterlife, which is always
                necessarily a history of mediation.</p>
            <p>One further scene from Dodd’s book nicely illustrates the overlapping of differently
                mediated engagements with Keats’s legacy and how they shape what quoting Keats means
                now. A few chapters after Brooklyn’s “divine chaos” comments, he presents Keatyn
                with a birthday gift: “an old book, the cover faded and the words
                <title level="m">Poetical Works</title> by John Keats embossed on the spine.” After Brooklyn
                describes the gift as “‘Keats for my Keats,’”
                <emph>his</emph> Keats looks into <emph>the other</emph> Keats, where she finds “an old inscription” reading
                “1903, To my love. / &#8212;S,” and a new one, from Brooklyn, reading 
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                <l>Even Keats speaks of chaos.</l>
                <l><emph>There is nothing stable in the world; uproar’s your only music</emph>.</l>
                <l>All my love,</l>
                <l>B. (208)</l>

                </quote>
                The palimpsestic inscriptions layer
                together a history of affective relationships crafted through the nexus of Keats’s
                poetry. First, a complete edition from around the turn of the century, when many
                monumentalizing editions of Keats’s work were being published (contra Croker’s
                mocking reevaluation of Keats’s legacy in 1833), remediates Keats to his posthumous
                audience, and a member of that audience uses the book to transfer the cathected
                emotions linked to Keats to his “love.” That engagement is then furthered by
                Brooklyn’s new annotation, where he characterizes this twenty-first-century
                attachment through “that quote we like” about “divine chaos,” which he connects to
                Keats with an accurate quotation (Keats does indeed write about there being “nothing
                stable in the world” in a letter to his brothers in January 1818). The final piece
                of this complicated web of connections exists outside of Dodd’s novel, where the
                collocation of Keats, Keatyn, and “divine chaos” establishes a new, not entirely
                human-made node in the network of quotations which help to create our popular Keats. </p>
