                  <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> posits Keats’s
                    two-hundred year reception history as an exemplary case for examining popular
                    culture as a generative, shape-shifting borderland where liking/loving and
                    responding to literature intermingles, sometimes indistinguishably, the tastes
                    of the people and the elite. This collection of essays recalls three
                    longstanding embarrassments for teachers and scholars of literary
                    history—popular culture, media, and affect—which routinely have been defined in
                    opposition to (while continuing to inform) the high canon of English literature.
                    These essays aim to: 1) spotlight the positive affinity, and not antithesis,
                    between Keats and popular culture in our time and his own; 2) examine Keats’s
                    afterlives in multi-media creations involving authorial fashioning and
                    participatory poetics; 3) posit what we might learn through such creations about
                    how to read, view, and hear Keats in a growing new literary middlebrow culture;
                    and 4) prompt reflections on how we as teachers and scholars can connect with
                    broader mass audiences interested in Keats.</p>

               <head>About the Design and Markup</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> This volume was designed and encoded at the University of
                    Colorado, Boulder by Cayla Eagon, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic
                        Circles</title>. The banner image was designed by Cayla Eagon and uses, with
                    permission, images adapted from Douglas Steiner's "Variations, The Life Mask
                    John Keats" (2012), a photo study of the life mask of Keats created by Benjamin
                    Robert Haydon and photographed by the Keats Museum, London and Methuen &amp;
                    Co., London. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made
                    using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool,
                    with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders
                    text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura
                    Mandell and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT
                    transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

               <head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is
                    devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
                    investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of
                    Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated
                    domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual
                    terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period
                    and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a
                    vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of
                    today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain
                    with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
                    scholarship.</p>

                    hyper-canonical and popular poet for contemporary middle-brow readers,
                    contextualizes scholarly discourses about his poetry’s longstanding (and often
                    vexed) connections with popular culture, and introduces the essays in <title level="m">Keats in

                    longstanding embarrassments for teachers and scholars of literary
                    history—popular culture, media, and affect—which routinely have been defined in
                    opposition to (while continuing to inform) the high canon of English literature,
                    and it posits Keats’s two-hundred year reception history as an exemplary case
                    for examining popular culture as a generative, shape-shifting borderland where
                    liking/loving and responding to literature intermingles, sometimes
                    indistinguishably, the tastes of the people and the elite. </p>

                       [Keats] may at present be the best loved English poet of all time, with powerful appeal to every one of the broad categories
                       of audience—fellow writers, literary professionals and academic specialists, the reading public and the nonreading public alike.
                       He has become iconic, not so much “a writer” as “the writer,” not just canonized but worshipped. (114)<lb/>

               <p>How has John Keats (1795–1821) become such a crossover success with a “powerful appeal” to “academic specialists” and “the nonreading public”? Where and in what forms can we find evidence of Keats’s appeal outside of classrooms and scholarly publications? And, why should we (teachers and scholars) take seriously, let alone value, Keats’s afterlives created by non-academic specialists and non-poets in mediums, genres and modes that we might deem ephemeral, adulterated, and/or reductive instantiations of his high canonical poetic value?
                <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> pursues these questions with the hope of broadening our
                    disciplinary understanding of what Jack Stillinger has termed the “concentrated
                    canonical complexity” of “Multiple Keats.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In
                        <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to John Keats</title>, Stillinger
                            defines “Multiple Keats” as “an internal complexity in the poet
                            constituted primarily by self-division—a sort of unresolved imaginative
                            dividedness between the serious and the humorous, the straight and the
                            ironic, the fanciful and the real, the high-flying and the
                            down-to-earth, the sentimental and the satiric, the puffed up and the
                            deflated” (253).</note> As Stillinger reminds us in <title level="a">The ‘Story’ of Keats,</title> Keats
                    has been classed since the middle of the nineteenth century “with
                    Shakespeare—and Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and a handful of others—at the top of
                    the lists of the most esteemed writers in English poetry” (251).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Keats’s
                            canonicity was already well-established when Matthew Arnold published
                            his essay on Keats in T.H. Ward’s
                            <title level="m">English Poets</title> (1880). Arnold
                            countermands longstanding positive and negative evaluations of Keats as
                            overly sensual and effete, characterizations that peaked dramatically
                            after Harry Buxton Foreman published Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne
                            (1878). On Keats’s shifting nineteenth-century reception, see James

               <p>
                  <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> aims to: 1) spotlight the positive affinity, and not
                    antithesis, between Keats and popular culture in our time and his own; 2) examine Keats’s afterlives in multi-media creations
                    involving authorial fashioning and participatory poetics; 3) posit what we might learn through such creations about
                    how to read, view, and hear Keats in a growing new literary middlebrow culture;
                    and 4) prompt reflections on how we as teachers and scholars can connect with

                Celeste Langan, Kevis Goodman, Maureen McLane, John
                    Guillory, Clifford Siskin and William Warner have done much to inform our
                    understanding of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as a
                    hyper-mediated age of teeming material and conceptual media. Likewise, Adela
                    Pinch, Jerome McGann, William Ready, Brian Massumi, Rei Tereda, and Thomas Pfau
                    have reinvigorated studies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century
                    as a self-conscious age of sensation, emotional transference, and bodily
                    movement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On mediation,

                Pfau’s contention that Keats’s “technique of hypersimulation […] baits its audience’s critical and melancholic recognition of
                poetry as semblance, and semblance as socially determined” demonstrates how mediation and affect theories can be combined to
                recast longstanding cruxes in Keats studies concerned with authorial fashioning and reader response (343). In <title level="a">Liking/Loving:
                    Affect Theory for Media Scholars,</title> the closing section of their introduction to <title level="m">Multimedia Romanticisms</title>,
                James Brook-Smith and Andrew Burkett argue further that intermingling media and affect theories can help spotlight a “productive
                openness of Romantic-era media discourse that is neither bounded by the technological channel of communication nor by today’s
                reigning norms of hyper-efficient informatics” (Par. 27). <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> explores such
                media-affect crossovers between Keats’s age
                    and our own where discipline-specific inquiries and hyper-canonical treatments
                    of his poetry and biography alternately inform and give way to broader networks
                    of connection involving multiple mediums and diverse audiences.</p>
               <p>This inquiry draws our attention beyond discourses focused
                    solely on poetry to consider more unregulated appropriations of and responses to
                    Keats in less specialized and more overtly commercialized mediums. As Yohei
                    Igarashi muses, Romantic period scholars have often overlooked or been reluctant
                    to pursue such connections because of Keats’s own characterizations of his work:
                    “The pertinacity with which Keats strives to align himself with the longstanding
                    medium of poetry and the book may be responsible for the lack of sustained
                    commentary on his relation to the larger ecology of contemporaneous means of
                    communication” (173). Likewise, Keats’s several disparaging comments about
                    popular mass market poetry as debased literature that traffics in
                    commercialized, often all-too “smokeable,” forms has led generations of
                    professional writers and scholars to class his poetry exclusively within
                    highbrow literary discourses.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his
                            letters Keats uses “smoked,” “smoke,” “smoking,” and “smokeable”—each of
                            which have slightly different meanings ranging from to jest at and
                            ridicule to noticing, seeing through, and understanding
                            (<title level="m">Letters:</title> II. 13, 19, 36, 174,
                            206, 217, 221, 244). In his <title level="a">Smokeability</title> section (393–402) in
                            <title level="m">England in 1819</title>, James Chandler provides an
                            incisive gloss of “smokeable” as “an act of
                            <emph>condescension</emph>, toward ‘weakness’ or ‘inadequacy’” (399).
                            Chandler demonstrates Keats’s concern about his poems being publicly
                            “smoked” (seen through, ridiculed) and classed as trendy, light-weight
                            knock-offs in the vein of overly sentimental or sensational poems and
                            novels appealing predominantly to female readers. On highbrow
                            conceptions of Keats, Virginia Woolf’s characterization in her
                            <title level="a">Middlebrow</title> essay offers an apt and influential example: “To be a
                            highbrow, a complete and representative highbrow, a highbrow like
                            Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley, Keats […] is of course beyond the
                            wildest dreams of my Imagination […] Look at Keats, loving poetry and
                            Fanny Brawne so intemperately that he pined and died of consumption at
                            the age of twenty-six” (Par. 3). Woolf closes the essay with a playful
                            threat: “If any human being, man, woman, dog, cat or half-crushed worm
                            dares call me 'middlebrow' I will take my pen and stab him, dead.” (Par. 10).</note>
                Building on ground-breaking work about Keats and the ‘Cockney School of Poetry’—most notably by Nicholas Roe and
                Jeffrey Cox—affect studies about Keats have led the way in unsettling and reevaluating classifications of his
                seemingly highbrow poetics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On Keats and
                            the ‘Cockney School,’ see also work by William Keach, Alan Bewell,

                            attitudes, urban sociality, suburban tastes, artistic identities, erotic
                            sensuality, and performative theatricality marking what Gregory Dart has
                            called <title level="a">The Cockney Moment: 1810–1840.</title> Notably, Keats’s Victorian
                            reputation begins to rise following the end of that “Cockney
                            Moment.”</note> Most recently, Karen Swann’s <title level="m">Lives of the Dead Poets</title> (2019) examines how reading Keats can “elicit untoward
                    attachments” that “enthrall us despite our suspicion that we may be bound in a
                    calculated effect” (31, 42). Swann’s use of “untoward” suggests that reading
                    Keats’s poetry can draw us into intensely intimate and potentially unseemly,
                    emotional connections that trouble our professional and personal disciplinary
                    boundaries. Such “untoward attachments” obfuscate what Laura Mandell has
                    described as the already blurry line “between the fan’s love for pop culture and
                    the academic’s love for literary history” (Par. 3).</p>

                  <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> recalls three longstanding embarrassments for teachers
                    and scholars of literary history—popular culture, media, and affect—which
                    routinely have been defined in opposition to (while continuing to inform) the
                    high canon of English literature.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In the
                            twentieth century, Cleanth Brooks, Lionel Trilling, M.H. Abrams, and
                            Helen Vendler have been, arguably, the most outspoken and influential in
                            separating Keats from popular culture, media, and affect.</note>
                Although the term popular culture—“the cultural
                    traditions of the ordinary people of a particular community” (OED)—first
                    appeared in print in the 1850s, sustained intellectual discourses theorizing
                    about popular culture emerged in the second half of the eighteenth century.
                    These popular culture conceptions often overlapped with debates about how to
                    define an expanding canon of English literature, and they involved proto-media
                    articulations and new ways of describing reader-author relationships as personal
                    affairs of liking and/or loving literature.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Peter

                            well as Andrew Piper and Janice Radway. Following Roger Chartier’s <title level="a">What
                            is the History of Books,</title> John Storey argues that
                            late-eighteenth-century intellectuals “invented” two predominating
                            conceptions of popular culture. The first (chronologically) involved
                            idealizations of rural folk culture, and the second involved
                            urban-industrial entertainments.</note> As Lionel Trilling, John Bailey, Christopher Ricks, and
                    Marjorie Levinson have demonstrated, readers of Keats’s poetry are no strangers
                    to feeling embarrassed over Keats’s “badness” in particular lines and even
                    entire poems that fall well short of, or appear to mock, high aesthetic poetry
                    standards.<note place="foot" resp="author"> From his first biographer Richard Monkton Milnes (1848) to Matthew Arnold, F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling, Earl Wasserman, Walter Jackson Bate, David Perkins, and Helen Vendler (among others), arguments for Keats’s elevated place in the canon of English poetry have often involved rear-guard actions to protect his poetry and biography from slighting treatments.</note> Most resoundingly, Levinson argues that Keats had a “legitimacy problem”—anxiety about his middling social class alienation from the canon—which manifested itself in a self-consciously artificial “writing which is aggressively <emph>literary</emph> and therefore not just ‘not Literature’ but, in effect, <emph>anti</emph>-literature: a parody” (10, 5). Writing at, though not necessarily for, canonical tastes, Keats fetishizes an aesthetics of betweenness, which sensationalizes high poetic styles, poetry as a constructed medium, and the reading public’s growing desire to experience biographically-infused, authorial emotion. With Levinson’s critique in mind,

                    reception history as an exemplary case for examining popular culture as a
                    generative, shape-shifting borderland where liking/loving and responding to
                    literature intermingles, sometimes indistinguishably, the tastes of the people
                    and the elite. To make this case, these essays investigate popular culture
                    artifacts and mediums as well as popular literature involving Keats.</p>
               <p>So, how might studying Keats’s affective, multi-media afterlives help us to read him anew? First, such an approach prompts us to continue reevaluating our profession’s longstanding repudiation of popular literature as solely market-driven, ephemeral, ‘bad’ art (overly simple, not serious, or adulterated). Second, within that reconsideration, we can re-contextualize Keats’s own dismissals of the word popular in ‘popular literature.’
                Andrew Bennett’s <title level="m">Keats, Narrative, and Audience</title> (1994) and <title level="m">Romantic Poets
                    and the Culture of Posterity</title> (1998) remind us of how Keats’s criticisms of fashionable
                    authorship and poetry with a mass market appeal have led generations of Romantic
                    period scholars to align Keats with William Wordsworth’s skewed argument in his
                    <title level="a">Essay Supplementary to the Preface</title> (1815) that a poet’s contemporary
                    popularity rendered them unfit for a future place in the high canon of English
                    poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author">  In the <title level="a">Essay
                            Supplementary to the Preface,</title> Wordsworth declares: “Away, then, with
                            the senseless iteration of the word,
                            <emph>popular</emph>, applied to new
                            works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of
                            the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions, as if
                            urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell” (372). On the
                            double-sidedness of Wordsworth’s use of ‘popular,’ which pits
                            inauthentic and degrading mass cultures against nearly lost authentic
                            cultures, see Ann Wierda Rowland’s <title level="a">The Popular Tradition,</title> pp. 119–26.
                            As Lucy Newlyn has argued in <title level="m">Reading, Writing, and
                                Romanticism: The Anxiety of Reception</title>, “Wordsworth went on
                            courting recognition while also appearing to accept neglect” (98). His
                            market struggles with the tastes of a burgeoning mass reading public
                            multiplied as he sought to differentiate the “pleasure” that his poetry
                            might elicit from more popular gothic sensationalism. See Michael
                            Gamer’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception,
                                and Canon Formation</title> as well as Jon Klancher’s argument in
                        <title level="m">The Making of English Reading Audiences</title>: “Having
                            described the middle class audience as consumers of a brutalized culture
                            fashioned for urban readers, Wordsworth seeks in the rustic’s
                            alternative culture a means to reverse that reception into a form of
                            ‘consumption’” (143).</note> By all accounts, Keats was neither a popular nor a
                    well-reviewed Regency poet, and he seemed intent upon establishing a posthumous
                    reputation beyond the transience of what he called the “little famous” of his
                    age so that he could finally be “among the English poets.” Keats undoubtedly had
                    a vexed relationship with popular writing for a consumer culture that was caught
                    up in discourses about fame and celebrity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On Romantic

                    too easy literary style and quasi-celebrity, aristocratic status. However,
                    Keats’s affinities with Byron’s poetry, as well as other popular Regency poets

                    be understood in relation to Cornwall (pseudonym for Bryan Waller Proctor) who
                    after Lord Byron and Felicia Hemans was one of the best-selling and most
                    positively reviewed poets from 1819–1823.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Turley demonstrates how reading Keats’s
                            poetry alongside Cornwall’s “cast[s] into relief issues of audience,
                            taste, critical reception, ‘high’ versus ‘low’ culture, and literary
                            commercialism,” and he shows how, in contrast to Keats, Cornwall
                            “successfully commodified ‘Cockney’ School’ aesthetics” and
                            “populariz[ed] a filtered version of ‘Cockney Romanticism” by
                            “configuring [his readers] as constituents of a mass audience” and
                            “reassur[ing] book buyers of their competency as readers” (4, 45, 40).

                    (meter-mania) sweeping across Britain from “farm servants” to “unmarried ladies”
                    and “our very footmen,” which rendered Keats too vulgar (common) to be
                    considered for a pantheon of living poets let alone for an enduring canon of
                    English poets (193).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All

                Their ‘story’ of Keats focused on his cultural and aesthetic betweenness—a shibboleth that Keats himself
                foregrounds in his 1818 <title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Endymion</title>:
                <quote>
                The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a
                <emph>space of life between</emph>, in which the soul is in ferment, the character
                    undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence
                    proceeds mawkishness, and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of

                    added)
                </quote>
            Amidst this “space of life between,” Keats describes himself as “in ferment”—intensely stirred up in a
            transformative process—and short on measured high culture aesthetics. He owns <title level="m">Endymion</title>
                as a “failure,” resulting from “great inexperience,
                    immaturity, and every error denoting a feverish attempt” (139). Moreover, he
                    archly styles himself as an arrested cultural aspirant who “may be speaking too
                    presumptuously and may deserve a punishment” for having “touched the beautiful
                    mythology of Greece, and [potentially] dulled its brightness” with his
                    adulterated poetic treatment.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Keats also aligns himself with Thomas
                            Chatterton and the cult of the Romantic genius who dies young—see Thomas
                            Cook’s <title level="m">Thomas Chatterton and Neglected Genius</title>—and
                            recalls what Charles Rzepka astutely characterizes in <title level="a">‘Cortez: Or

                  </note> Keats’s acknowledged “mawkishness”
                (over-stirred sentimentality) may well serve as self-flagellation before possible critics, but
                that “mawkishness” also stakes a claim for <title level="m">Endymion</title>: it will have a
                sensational, bittersweet effect that high culture reviewers and readers “must necessarily taste

                reviewers reacted to this taste of Keats by relegating
                    him to the trash bin of literary history not only because his poetry smacked of
                    middle class pretensions, radical politics and aesthetics, but also because it
                    seemed all too caught up in sensational aspects of popular Regency
                    culture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Christopher Rovee’s <title level="a">Trashing Keats,</title> which
                            concludes: “Taking seriously the wonder of those who most cherished it,
                            we encounter the ‘trash of Keats’ as generative in its own right,
                            supplying a model to subsequent connoisseurs of the second hand,
                            aesthetes and otherwise, who would piece together an oppositional stance
                            from the refuse of consumption’s logic”
                    (1016).</note> As Orrin Wang points out in <title level="a">Coming Attractions: ‘Lamia’ and
                        Cinematic Sensations,</title> “Implicit in the opprobrium of <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>
                        and others is that Keats’s writing is not real poetry,
                    and thus, not real literature. It is sensation as entertainment; sensation not
                    as an elite aesthetic principle, but as one diversion among many for an
                    increasingly commercialized, mass public” (464).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wang’s insights 
                        build on Levinson’s evaluation of Keats’s parodic “non-poetry,” James Chandler’s investigation
                        of Keats’s “cockney sensationalism,” and Nicholas Roe and Jeffrey Cox’s arguments about the
                        significance of ‘Cockney’ literary culture and politics.</note> Wang likens Keats’s sensational
                poetry to pre-cinematic simulations of visual movement, which he aligns with the showmanship of Vauxhall
                Garden’s early nineteenth-century entertainments and “mass public viewings,” particularly phantasmagorias
                (magic lantern shows) and panoramas (enormous circular paintings). In <title level="a">Keats, Popular Culture,
                    and the Sociability of Theatre,</title> Gillian Russell locates Keats’s visual models and sense of class
                mobility in London’s labile, legitimate-illegitimate theatre productions and hybridizing audience demographics.
                Within that shifting theatre culture, Jane Moody, John Kandl and Jonathan Mulrooney have focused our attention
                on Keats’s admiration for Edmund Kean’s popular acting style and his identification with Kean’s controversial
                professional and cultural status.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="m">Illegitimate Theatre,
                                1770–1840</title>, Moody points out that an
                                “interesting parallel exists between the mockery of Edmund Kean’s
                                lowly social origins and illegitimate apprenticeship in the role of
                                Harlequin, and the critical disdain which greeted John Keats. In
                                both cases, the language of vulgarity neatly encompasses accusations

                (2019), Mulrooney argues that Keats emulated Kean’s
                    performative mixing and questioning of already slippery high, low, and middling
                    aesthetic distinctions: “Keats began in 1818 to represent aesthetic experience
                    as a continual, undecided negotiation that treated the high culture of art and
                    the low culture of daily life with equal force and attention” (194). Through his
                    alignments with Hunt’s new school of poetry, metropolitan visual entertainments,
                    and Kean’s sensational Shakespeare performances, Keats wittingly and unwittingly
                    drew his poetry into public debates about what popular and high literary culture
                    were and might become and how they should be valued.</p>
               <p>Whether liking, loving, disliking, or hating, such
                    valuations of Keats have often involved strong affective responses, which his
                    poetry actively courts and self-consciously dramatizes. Keats’s affective turns
                    have led several twenty-first century scholars and creative writers to posit
                    “untoward” questions and statements about Keats’s readerly effects.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The following statement from Stillinger captures the intimacy of such
                        responses: “The accumulation of information from so many sources allows us to know
                        Keats better than most of Keats’s contemporaries knew him, even those who saw him
                        every day; and modern scholars who study the record undoubtedly know Keats better
                        than they do most people whom they see in everyday life” (<title level="m">John Keats</title> ix).</note> For
                example, in <title level="a">A Friendly Return of the Author,</title> Eric
                    Eisner asks, “How does a shared feeling for Keats unite (or divide) communities
                    of his readers? How have later readers with no direct relation to Keats
                    understood themselves as ‘friends’ or ‘lovers’ of the poet?” (27). Most
                    pointedly, in <title level="a">Loving, Knowing, and Illustrating Keats,</title> Ann Wierda Rowland
                    asks, “What might it mean to ‘love’ John Keats?” (267). Rowland focuses her
                    answer on Louis Arthur Holman, “‘the world’s foremost amateur collector of
                    ‘Keatsiana’ in the first decades of the twentieth century,” who neither had a
                    college education nor seemed interested in writing a conventional biography of
                    Keats (268).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Rowland’s
                            quotation is from the <title level="j">Daily Boston Globe</title>, Dec.
                            15, 1939, p. 21.</note> Rowland argues that Holman’s decades-long work—a
                labor of imagined friendship and love for Keats spent collecting, assembling, and publicly
                sharing his visual ephemera—exemplifies Keats’s popular following, which first took
                off in the late nineteenth century. Rowland maintains that Holman deeply valued “the portability
                of ‘Keats,’ above all” and understood his unparalleled collection of images, ranging from
                illustrations to postcards, as a testament to Keats’s “procreativity” and capacity to inhabit
                and inform multiple media contexts and walks of life (287). In <title level="a">That Crafty Feeling,</title>
                Zadie Smith provides a more recent testimony about Keats’s enduring amateur appeal:
            <quote>
                Keats offers his readers the possibility of entering writing from a side door, the
                one marked ‘Apprentices Welcome Here’ […] Keats slogging away, devouring
                books, plagiarizing, impersonating, adapting, struggling, growing, writing many
                poems that made him blush and then a few that made him proud, learning
                everything he could from whomever he could find, dead or alive, who might have
                something useful to teach him. (105)
            </quote>
            If in 1818 John Wilson Lockhart could derisively sentence
                    Keats behind commercial, class-signifying doors—“so back to the shop Mr.
                    John”—in 2009 Zadie Smith could trumpet that Keats’s poetry and biography had
                    unlocked a side-door entrance into the “shop” of writing—a space previously
                    closed to aspirants without proper high culture writing credentials.</p>
               <p>In the late twentieth- and early twenty-first century,
                    this emphasis on reader-author intimacy, participatory poetics, and popularizing
                    high literary forms has coincided with the rise of what Beth Driscoll calls “the
                    new literary middlebrow.” Driscoll argues that new literary middlebrow culture
                    has eight family attributes: “middle class, reverential towards elite culture,
                    entrepreneurial, mediated, feminized, emotional, recreational, and earnest” (6).
                    Through her amendments to what she describes as Pierre Bourdieu’s rigid,
                    polarizing theories (art for art’s sake vs. mass market productions) about the
                    field and habitus of literary production and cultural capital, Driscoll examines
                    a neglected “middle space” in which the “middlebrow’s expansive, colonizing
                    activities continually shift the boundaries between cultural categories, while
                    the new relationships it creates between mass audiences and intermediaries
                    recalibrate lines of authority” (17). Although Kelvin Everest does not mention
                    middlebrow culture in <title level="a">Why Read Keats?</title> (2002), he proffers a new literary
                    middlebrow educational ideal: “[Keats’s] example affirms that English poetry is
                    an art form for the people as a whole, and not the preserve of a privileged
                    elite. In Keats’s poetry the English poetic tradition is claimed for a
                    fundamentally democratic future, in which high aesthetic experience is the
                    possession of a wider and socially inclusive readership” (3).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nicholas Roe
                            maintains a similar view in his biography <title level="m">John Keats:
                                A New Life</title>. Roe, however, identifies Leigh Hunt as the
                            catalyst: “Two hundred years on, we can see how Hunt’s ‘New School’
                            anticipated modern ideas of poetry as a form of expression open to and
                            enjoyed by all” (188).</note> For Stanley Plumly—perhaps Keats’s
                most ardent poet-scholar advocate—associating Keats with anything middlebrow
                (even some of Keats’s own poetry) degrades his greatness and, thus, should be
                discarded. Plumly’s conviction leads him in <title level="m">Posthumous Keats: A Personal Biography</title>
                (2008) to eschew influential pre-Raphaelite tastes
                    involving the “luxury, drapery, weft, and rich weave of the texture and rhythmic
                    structure in Keats’s romances and ballads” because “such qualities tend to
                    confirm rather than challenge, reinforce rather than resist convention, and
                    meet—in spite of counter-Victorian and post-Victorian protestations of art for
                    art’s sake—mostly middle-brow nineteenth-century expectations” (321). Despite
                    his elegant protestation, Plumly’s concerns about the “irresistible,”
                    convention-reinforcing “qualities” of Keats’s narrative verse underscore Keats’s
                    powerful middlebrow appeal as well as Plumly’s own personalized literary
                    middlebrow treatment of Keats’s biography and poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his
                            <title level="a">Preface,</title> Plumly describes his desire to create a fitting voice and
                            point of view as “a middle way of discovering and articulating Keats in
                            his possible and potential afterlife, not only his life. I needed to be
                            able to think with a warm mind through the mortality—and its
                            meander—that helped bring about his ultimate immortality” (17). For an
                            incisive critique of Plumly’s “middle way,” see Michael Theune’s review

               </p>
               <p>Undoubtedly, Keats’s most popular instantiation in new
                    literary middlebrow culture has been his negative capability concept: “when man
                    is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
                    reaching after fact &amp; reason—”. Negative capability has garnered this
                    currency largely because it suggests an adaptable, betwixt-and-between subject
                    position within a non-systematic philosophy for considering life and art while
                    “remaining content with half knowledge” in the midst of unreconciled
                    contradictions (<title level="m">Letters</title>. I. 193, 194). Far from a limiting
                cultural shibboleth, negative capability describes being in the middle as a virtue,
                which can foster mental lability and creative ways of thinking about and between different
                epistemologies of human knowledge. As Brian Rejack and Michael Theune maintain in their introduction to
                <title level="m">Keats’s Negative Capability: New Origins and Afterlives</title> (2019), Keats’s concept has “escaped the gravitational
                    pull of Keats studies” to emerge not only in contemporary poetics but also in
                    young adult literature, music, psychology, medicine, Zen philosophy, and
                    business marketing and management (3-4). I also would add that discussions of
                    negative capability have significantly influenced recent public education
                    theories and transmedia story-telling practices for mass market
                    productions.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the former, see Elaine

                            Also relevant is Marcello Giovenalli’s characterization of a Keats 2.0
                            whose works offer a “cognitive poetics of texture” (7).</note> Within Rejack

                        Reaching’ and the Conditions of Romantic Mediation</title> draw our attention to
                proto-interdisciplinary education theories and intermedial artistic practices.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On ways of
                            distinguishing between transmediation, intermediation, and remediation,
                            see: Bolter and Grusin, Rajewski, Hayles, and Rippl.</note> While Hessel characterizes
                Keats’s negative capability as “an openness to the intermedium between thought systems,” exemplified
                by his “new theory of allegory” in <title level="a">Lamia,</title> Britton argues that negative capability “identifies
                conditions of mediation” that “must be understood in relation to the body and, specifically,
                the writing hand” (99, 115). Through their essays, negative capability emerges as an intermingling
                of thought systems, processes of composition, and the feigned presence of  bodily movements—a
                middling mode characterized by a constantly shifting, amalgamating, but never fully reconciled, center.</p>
               <p>Although Keats associated negative capability with William
                    Shakespeare as the prime example of a “Man of Achievement,” Keats’s popular
                    culture reception pales in comparison with Shakespeare’s unparalleled
                    ‘Shakespop’ industry. Nor does Keats come close to Mary Shelley’s and Jane
                    Austen’s standing, which like Shakespeare’s has involved Hollywood movies,
                    television shows, and a host of multi-genre and digital media forms.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Keats’s less prevalent afterlives come into focus most
                    clearly in the context of the ‘Big Six’ male Romantic poets: William Blake, Lord
                    (George Gordon) Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Wordsworth, and Samuel
                    Taylor Coleridge. Of the six, Blake and Byron have garnered the largest popular
                    culture following. As Steven Clark and Jason Whittaker’s <title level="m">Blake, Modernity, and Popular Culture</title>
                    has shown, Blake’s afterlives as a political radical and
                    visionary iconoclast have appeared most influentially in music, experimental
                    film, and graphic novels.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See as well

                        Notably, the ‘Big Six’ and Mary Shelley have helped
                            shape prominent aspects of John Milton’s enduring presence in pop

                        <title level="m">Milton in Popular Culture</title>.</note>
                Arguably even more so than Blake, Byron’s rock-star
                    charisma has thriven in music, film, and popular literature.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In

                    not surprising, Keats’s recent afterlives suggest
                    his appeal as a poet who is more accessible and less radically visionary than
                    Blake, less egocentric and aggressive than Byron or (a more staid and stuffy)
                    Wordsworth, more psychologically stable and invitingly intimate than Coleridge,
                    and less elevated and politically idealistic than Shelley.</p>
               <p>Ranking fittingly in the middle of these six, Keats’s new
                    literary middlebrow popularity involves intense, personal connections based on
                    deep feeling for his short life and tubercular death, doomed romance with Fanny
                    Brawne and poetry, underdog status and outsized writing ambitions, capacity for
                    friendship and broad-minded sociality, and sense of identity as transformable
                    and mobile. Like Shakespeare’s and Austen’s, Keats’s recent afterlives represent
                    and inflect our myths about creative genius, romantic love, and individual
                    agency. Reactions to his short biography, however, separate Keats’s afterlives
                    from theirs. His young-adult romance with Fanny Brawne, rapid mastery of writing
                    poetry, and death at twenty-five well before his achievements were widely
                    recognized speak readily to post-1950s youth cultures focused on (and often
                    marketed to) under-appreciated young adults trying to define their shifting,
                    middle-class identities. Given Keats’s new literary middlebrow popularity, I
                    wonder too if currently we are seeing (to borrow Gregory Dart’s term) an
                    outsized, fun-house mirror, “Cockney moment” reflecting authors and readers.
                    Though not focused on political enfranchisement like the “moment” (1810–1840)
                    Dart describes, our quasi- “Cockney moment” (I submit 1990ish–present) has many
                    of the “amphibious qualities” that he details—exemplified by Leigh Hunt’s
                    writing, which “hovers uncertainly between the polite and the plebeian” (203).
                    We too are immersed in a rapidly-shifting, and now expressly global,
                    metropolitan climate, which is “liberal and open in some respects, but also
                    superficial and fashion-hungry in others.” Marked by “very broad tastes in
                    literature” and an “expanded field of print journalism,” our climate teems with
                    debates about the “cultural legitimacy” of “the so-called ‘middle
                    class’”—pointed by its young adult avatars (first Gen X, then Millennials, and
                    now Gen Z) who continue to “transform traditional aesthetic norms” in new
                    digital mass media (Dart 204, 205).</p>
               <p>New literary middlebrow culture has challenged high
                    canonical gatekeeping, but its inherited tastes and largely reverential
                    attitudes toward highbrow culture predominate, as Jane Campion’s commercially
                    successful film <title level="m">Bright Star</title> (2009) and “Introduction” to
                    <title level="m">Love Letters and Poems of John Keats to
                    Fanny Brawne</title> (2009) demonstrate. In Campion’s transmedia introduction,
                    “<title level="m">Bright Star</title>—the Story of Keats and Fanny,” she not only summarizes the major biographical
                    plot points informing her literary biopic; she also enthuses:
            <quote>
                    The poems, the love letters, the love story are all part
                    of the alchemy that makes Keats so special, so available to successive
                    generations of readers. The young man who died devastated, convinced that he
                    would be forgotten, has been repeatedly re-discovered. For many people, he is
                    the first point of entry into poetry and his life story is a big part of that
                    magical equation. (vi–vii)
            </quote>
            Campion’s affection and marketing for this Keats-Brawne story celebrate alchemical auto-biographical
            processes, an intensely engaging romance and devastating tragedy, and a near complete loss followed
            by paths of rediscovery that continually draw readers into poetry. For Campion, what makes Keats so
            “special” is his affective, textually embodied capacity for revival—a “magical equation” that
            involves his discoverers in recognizing parts of themselves which, like Keats, may appear to have been
            nearly lost. Campion’s biopic immerses us in melodrama and sentimentality, but it also plays high
            art-for-art’s sake ideals against mass commercialization and suggests an intermedium between the two:
            an intermingling of canonical Keats aesthetics and Brawne’s stylish stitch-work. Moreover, with Brawne
            as our focalizer and emotional surrogate, <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                    grants us visual access to Keats’s personality and
                    artistic genius while blocking any close textual/bodily understanding as Keats
                    disappears off-screen into near-deathly anonymity while Brawne remains on screen
                    to elicit our compassion.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Jacques
                            Khalip’s argument in <title level="m">Anonymous Life: Romanticism and
                                Dispossession</title>, which describes, among other Romantic period
                            writers, Keats’s “fascination with anonymity as an ethics of engaged
                            withdrawal or strategic reticence” that “resists the requirement to
                            inhabit a social category and remains open to change and re-description
                            (3). Khalip contends that “since [Keats] the poet cedes his identity to
                            those around him, it is only through his expropriated creations that he
                            can be known” (46).</note>
                  <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                    leaves us with a heightened semblance of deep and
                    abiding, romantic (authorial) love as Brawne’s (Abbie Cornish’s) mourning
                    recital of Keats’s sonnet fades into the film’s rolling credits, which feature
                    Keats’s (Ben Wishaw’s) disembodied voice reciting <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> with a
                    poignant mixture of elegiac celebration and mystification.</p>
               <p>As Jacqueline Peppal’s recent short film <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title>
                suggests, Keats’s new literary middlebrow following is
                    not just reverential toward highbrow literary culture.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  </note> To Driscoll’s eight family characteristics,
                I would add that new literary middlebrow culture also traffics in comedic, witty, and satirical
                reconfigurations of highbrow culture and its gatekeepers. If in Campion’s biopic <title level="a">Ode
                    to a Nightingale</title> represents and elicits the elegiac depth of middlebrow reverence, in
                Peppal’s short the nightingale appears as a “deceiving elf” that chides high aesthetic ideals and the
                notion of having “front-door” access to Keats with a popular science fiction intervention that recalls
                mass commercialized products, communication technologies, and serendipitous happenstance.<note place="foot" resp="author">  For related recent Keats scholarship, see Turley’s edited collection
                    <title level="m">Keats’s Places</title>.</note> Winner of the 2016 New York City Independent
                Film Festival’s “Best Short,” <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title> spotlights the overweening
                drive of university academics who seek to control the reception and cultural significance of
                canonical writers such as Keats. <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title> literalizes the
                notion that professors can transport students back to the very historical moment of an author’s
                writings, and it features an English professor (Bell), who can travel back in time, and one of
                her graduate students, whom she has chosen to take on a research trip to Keats’s Hampstead
                residence in the spring of 1819. Posing in early nineteenth-century garb as a weaver (pseudonym
                Cornelius Green) and his mother, this ambitious graduate student and his domineering professor
                visit Keats at home with Charles Brown with the stated intention of asking Keats one question:
                what did Keats mean in the first line of <title level="m">Endymion</title>,
                    “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”? Both student and professor fritter away
                    their opportunity by passive-aggressively arguing to such an extent that Brown
                    politely asks them to leave. As the graduate student hurriedly bids adieu to a
                    nonplussed Keats with an unwitting parody of Keats’s own line, “a joy forever,”
                    the professor—contrary to her own student-directed admonishments about not
                    violating time-travel protocols—carelessly leaves behind her iPhone with its
                    nightingale image on the casing. At the film’s close, viewers are left with a
                    tongue-in-cheek (inverse, interrupting man from Porlock) notion that Keats
                    composed his fabled “Ode to a Nightingale” that very night after finding this
                    left-behind nightingale icon from the future.</p>
               <p>Although Keats’s own humorous and pun-full personality does not appear directly in
            <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title> (he remains mostly silent and bemused), the
                film’s sendup of academics captures Keats’s enthusiasm in his letters and poetry for
                challenging and mocking highbrow culture while inviting his audience to play alongside
                him, even at his own expense. Keats’s delight in elaborate word play and intense
                speculation informs this collection’s interlacing cultural studies, formalist, reception
                and reader response methodologies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Speculation
                            was a signal word for Keats, which figures prominently in several of his
                            most famous letters, including <title level="a">Adam’s dream,</title>

                    the necessarily speculative dimension of
                    this critical task, each essay embraces the wager of what kind of methodology
                    and type of proof might convincingly tie together the multiple Keatsian archives
                    of past and present, canon and popular culture, knowing full well that this is
                    an ongoing challenge for those invested in connecting our modern age with a
                    relevant Romanticism. Rather than provide one monolithic answer to the question
                    of methodology, causation, and proof, these essays instead foreground our
                    awareness of and excitement over the challenge of this query. In this
                    collection, we have delighted in Keats’s playful afterlives and in what Brian
                    McGrath (following Gerard Manley Hopkins) describes as a “Keats for
                    Beginners.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> I follow McGrath’s assertion that early
                        reviews of <title level="m">Endymion</title> reveal how “Keats’s focus on words
                        makes something happen in the writing of those attempting to respond to and curtail
                        the forms of attention Keats’s writing makes possible. Keats’s readers bear witness
                        to his beginnings” (366).</note> This Keats is an amateur’s amateur (as well as a
                    poet’s poet) who exuberantly incorporates popular culture into his poetry, mimics and
                    calls into question highbrow aesthetics, and appeals to others to follow (on the wing)
                    his beginning essaies, as in “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> My
                        characterization of Keats as an amateur’s amateur builds on John Fiske’s description in
                        <title level="m">Understanding Popular Culture</title> of creative amateurs who engage
                            in acts of “excorporation” that coopt, transform, and make use of mass market consumer
                            productions to create bricolages, new art forms, and even subcultures. Fiske’s work
                            builds on Michel De Certeau’s <title level="m">The Practice of Everyday Life</title>
                            (1984) and Raymond Williams’s <title level="a">Culture is Ordinary</title> in

               <p>Brian Rejack’s <title level="a">Quoting Keats</title> points the way into this space of seeing
                and listening to Keatsian echoes, iterations, and re-creations. His tracing of the popularity of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    first line provides a backward- and forward-turning meditation on what quoting
                    and misquoting Keats can teach us about our own mass cultural fixations on
                    engines of authorship and textual reproduction. In <title level="a">Reading Keats Together:
                    Cleanth Brooks and the Collegiate Public,</title> Christopher Rovee reminds us of how
                    Keats’s amateurish, ‘Cockney’ qualities were widely excised by Brooks’s
                    influential, New Critical touting of Keats’s “well-wrought,” expert
                    craftsmanship. Rovee contends that Brooks’s Keats-centered work played a
                    significant role in transforming post-World War II university literature
                    classrooms into places (perhaps even mediums) that rejected mass consumer
                    culture and, instead, encouraged a new mass influx of college students to create
                    with their professors an authentic, socially valuable, popular culture through
                    communal acts of close reading. Forest Pyle’s <title level="a">Keats Effects</title> theorizes about
                    how we can identify overlooked and under-heard networks of poetic influence and
                    sonic effects—whether “obstructive enthusiasms” or “shrines of no prospect.”
                    Pyle’s focus on poetry, music, and image in “Cockney pop” signals this
                    collection’s intention to describe new constellations of Keats’s presence in our
                    contemporary skylines. Betsy Tontiplaphol’s <title level="a">
                     <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                        and the Etsy Effect</title> prompts us to recognize one such constellation in Campion’s
                        <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Tontiplaphol argues that Campion’s film
                    lauds an imperfectly material Keats
                    whose dynamic avatars can be found on the social media website Etsy, which
                    celebrates the labor of amateur hands in a personalized handicrafts movement.
                    Noah Comet’s Bridget Jones-enthused response draws these essays into
                    stereoscopic view, suggesting what we might look and listen to as we move
                    forward with Keats studies in the twenty-first century. In popular culture,
                    Keatsian in-betweenness is legion.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Twenty-first

                                <title level="m">Apotheon</title> led one (albeit factually inaccurate) reviewer to exclaim:
                        “If Keats had been alive 200 years later, he might have quit his job and become a game developer,
                        not a poet. And if he had, <title level="m">Apotheon</title>, a new game for the PC and PS4, might
                        be his ‘Ode To A Grecian Urn.’ It takes the gameplay of classic side-scrollers like
                        <title level="m">Legend of Zelda
                                II</title> and <title level="m">Castlevania</title> and applies it to the side of an Athenian
                        amphora, bringing the art of ancient Greece to vivid life” (Brownlee).</p>
                     <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">E) The San Francisco conceptual, performance artist and experimental philosopher Jonathon Keats
                        continues to stretch the bounds of Keats’s namesake and negative capability concept. Most prominently,
                        see <title level="m">Forged: Why Fakes are the Great
                                Art of Our Age</title>. His major claim—“No authentic masterpiece is as provocative as
                        a great forgery. Forgers are the foremost artists of our age”—uncannily echoes John Keats’s
                        appreciations of Thomas Chatterton’s <title level="m">Rowley</title> forgeries (4).</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount"> This essay traces aspects of Keats’s legacy across popular
                    culture through instances and mechanisms of quoting (or misquoting) his work.
                    The essay begins in periodical culture soon after Keats’s death (the late 1820s
                    and early 1830s), then moves to the discourse around the Manchester Art
                    Treasures Exhibition in 1857 (which, I suggest somewhat speculatively,
                    intersects with Keats in striking ways around quoting), and concludes with a
                    bigger leap ahead in time, to contemporary practices of quoting Keats through
                    various internet technologies and platforms. In each case the opening line to
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title> (“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever”) serves as the focal point
                    around which the networked connections of quoting practices and Keats’s
                    posthumous life circulate. Ultimately, the essay contends that a history of
                    Keats’s varied emanations across and through popular culture must of necessity
                    be a history of mediation, and the essay models a way of enacting that kind of
                    work. </p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>We see this logic play out already in <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                opening passage as Keats explains his decision to take up this
                tale of a Cockney/Classical dreamer overwhelming himself with poesy. The examples of
                things of beauty that “bind us to the earth” and “Haunt us till they become a
                cheering light / Unto our souls” emphasize processes of repetition (7, 30–1). We
                have the sun and the moon with their various daily, monthly, and yearly cycles;
                trees sprouting, clear rills cooling themselves, forest brakes rich with blooming
                flowers, all in their cyclical manners; and lastly poems, which recur in the form of
                repeated readings: “All lovely tales that we have heard or read” (22). The things
                themselves are all variable, repeatable things, but they also replicate insofar as
                they become “bound to us so fast / That […] / They always must be with us, or we
                die” (31–3). The joy of beauty both is and is not a part of the thing itself—it
                inheres in the object and in the relation that forms between the object and the
                observer of it. This logic continues in the poem’s narrative, as Endymion suffers
                over his repeated viewings, remembrances, and retellings of his encounters with
                Cynthia, “that completed form of all completeness” (606). Of course, the “completed
                form” of Cynthia is apparently incomplete until she returns in a new body (that of
                the Indian Maid), which turns out to have been a sort of clone of the original all
                along. Only by such repetition does anything ever happen in the poem. And even then,
                very little does, as ultimately Endymion ascends with his lover as the poem promptly
                and without fanfare ends. Yet as Noel Jackson suggests, the poem’s “inconsequential
                fulfillment, its fulfillment of inconsequence” functions as a “site of contingency,
                vitality, and (indeed) promise” (329). From one perspective the poem represents
                stagnation, but from a more properly Keatsian one, that stagnation appears
                dynamic.</p>
                  <p>That this opening line from <title level="m">Endymion</title> becomes (arguably)
                Keats’s most frequently quoted verse is fitting given that quoting operates in a
                manner similar to Keats’s beauty and joy. Quotation, too, must be reiterated. It
                also does not need to emerge from a position of authenticity or originality.
                Particularly in the nineteenth century as his posthumous reputation slowly took
                shape, Keats was a poet more quoted than read. While it’s certainly true that some
                instances of quoting Keats resulted from a reader drawing on deep engagement with
                his work, it’s also true that the prevalence of quoting Keats during his first
                half-century or so of posthumous existence meant that many could interact with his
                work primarily through quotation without access to reading the work in other forms.
                Furthermore, quoting begets more quoting. Precisely because of the iterability of
                quoting, one could regularly <emph>quote</emph> Keats without having
                really ever <emph>read</emph> Keats.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her book <title level="m">Quotation
                                Marks</title>, Marjorie Garber poses a similar sort of iterability with
                            respect to quoting’s relationship to authority: “It instates an
                            authority elsewhere, and, at the same time, it imparts that authority,
                            temporarily, to the speaker or writer” (2). While Keats may not have had
                            much cultural authority in the first decade when he began to be quoted
                            (the 1820s), the authority accrued to him and to writers quoting him
                            gained further relevance precisely through the nature of quotation which
                            Garber identifies.</note> In short, the mechanisms of quotation
                play a large part in the shaping and spread of Keats’s legacy. This is certainly
                true today when we can encounter quotations from Keats across a wide range of
                websites, not to mention the many misquotations and wild misattributions that mingle
                with the more accurate materials. As ubiquitous as Keats is now, quoting Keats in
                the nineteenth century was widespread as well. One particularly influential instance
                occurred at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, when more than one
                million visitors over the space of five months contemplated paintings, drawings,
                photographs, and examples of other arts while the opening line of 
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> was presiding over them, the words emblazoned on the arch above
                the building’s entrance. Keats’s line was positioned so as to condition exhibition
                viewers’ responses to a wide variety of media forms, including the nascent form of
                photography, which raised significant questions about beauty’s thing-ness due to
                the technology’s relationship to reproducibility.</p>
                  <p>The logics of cultural and aesthetic reproducibility in the nineteenth century have
                informed many scholarly treatments of Keats, which view his poetic project as a
                belated one, but one which nonetheless attempts an intervention, even if it occurs
                only through secondary, indirect, or remediated forms.<note place="foot" resp="author"> One thinks, for instance, of
                            Marjorie Levinson’s argument in <title level="m">Keats’s Life of
                                Allegory</title> that Keats develops his poetics out of his position of
                            alienation with respect to his class identity. In more positive terms,
                            both Charles Rzepka, in his reading of <title level="a">On First Looking Into Chapman’s
                            Homer,</title> and Jeffrey Cox, in his analysis of “Cockney classicism,” suggest
                            how we might view Keats’s alienation and belatedness as more unalloyed
                            advantages, as opposed to causes of symptomatic anxious
                        responses.</note> That last term, <emph>remediated</emph>,
                has become of particular interest to many romanticists currently
                engaging in what has been dubbed “Romantic Media Studies.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> An important
                            early articulation of this term comes via the title of Lauren Neefe and
                            Yohei Igarashi’s 2013 MLA roundtable devoted to the topic. More
                            recently, in his <title level="m">Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and
                            British Romanticism</title>, Andrew Burkett offers a rich overview of,
                            and exciting ways forward for, the subfield. His book shows how writers
                            in the romantic period “express[ed] diverse, flexible conceptions of
                            both media and mediation … before the media concept became distilled
                            later in the nineteenth century into its modern sense as the notion of
                            the technological channel of communication” (3).</note>
                Romantic media studies includes not only the many exciting works devoted to the
                textuality of the period (book history approaches like William St. Clair’s, media
                ecological work like Maureen McLane’s, and media-theory-inflected work like Celeste
                Langan’s and Andrew Burkett’s); it also extends to projects that situate romanticist
                scholarship within contemporary issues of mediation (digitally-built projects like
                NINES and the Blake Archive, but also traditional scholarly works that explore the
                implications of contemporary digital culture, such as Jerome McGann’s
                <title level="m">A New Republic of Letters</title>). With specific regard to Keats, I
                share Yohei Igarashi’s contention that “communicative mediation constitutes a
                significant, although still largely unremarked, concern of Keats’s poetry and
                letters” (173). By opening with the iterability of beauty in
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, then, I suggest that when we speak of aesthetics in Keats, we
                must also speak of mediation in Keats. If beauty must be reproduced in order to
                persist as a joy, then it must also be remediated. </p>
                  <p>This essay approaches Keats’s afterlife in popular culture by examining how he has
                been, and continues to be, quoted. I argue that quoting ought to be understood as a
                material and medial practice, not merely a discursive one. In order to grasp the
                significance of Keats’s place within popular culture, we need to attend to the
                material mechanisms of quotation—which requires asking questions about access,
                distribution, remediation, replication, and transformation, among other material
                processes related to reading—and we need to place those mechanisms in a historical
                frame which allows for both continuity and tension between materialities past,
                present, and future. To explore some of these dynamics with respect to quoting
                Keats, I examine three different broadly construed moments and media technologies:
                periodical magazines in the decades immediately after Keats’s death, photography in
                the mid-to-late-nineteenth century, and the internet in our contemporary moment. In
                each case, as I will show, we cannot treat these moments and technologies in their
                own vacuums. The practices of quoting Keats, both past and present, always operate
                within a media ecology that operates through networks of association between various
                media and through different temporal frames.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Kate Rumbold’s <title level="m">Shakespeare and
                            the Eighteenth-Century Novel: Cultures of Quotation
                            from Samuel Richardson to Jane Austen</title> provides a useful analog
                            for how quotation operates with respect to different genres and media.
                            Her focus is on how quotations of Shakespeare in novels serve to
                            buttress Shakespeare’s growing reputation, while also helping to lend
                            cultural significance to the novel form itself. The “cultures of
                            quotation” that influence the novelistic treatments involve other forms
                            of media, including the stage, periodicals, and the conventions of
                            polite conversation. See especially 21–48.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As is the case with the other essays assembled in this volume, such work benefits
                from probing the borders between scholarly and popular discourse. This is
                particularly true for studying Keats, since he was and is a figure with pop-cultural
                standing alongside his revered place in literary studies. These borders are porous,
                and to better conceive of Keats and his work, we need to understand not just popular
                Keats and scholarly Keats, but also the web of relations linking the two.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Garber
                            discusses the closing lines of Keats’s <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title> and the
                            thorny issue of who speaks them, as an exemplary case of “the quotation
                            as floating signifier” (29). While in scholarly contexts there has been
                            much debate about what precisely Keats quotes the urn saying, in the
                            many examples Garber cites from a variety of pop cultural sources, the
                            lines are unambiguously credited as something Keats himself uttered. I
                            suggest a similar dynamic plays out with the opening line of
                            <title level="m">Endymion</title>, which signifies in vastly different
                            ways as it moves from and between scholarly and popular
                        contexts.</note> Particularly for those of us invested in doing
                public humanities work, knowledge of popular discourse around figures, works, or
                issues with which we engage in scholarly ways becomes crucial for bridging such
                divides, crossing such borders, or perhaps shifting the borders themselves. Work on
                the reception of Keats demonstrates that he has always been taken up in a number of
                disciplines and cultural contexts, and thus provides a historical frame and model
                for engagement with literary work that eschews our conventional notions of
                disciplinary borders.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See for instance Sarah Wooton’s work on
                            representations of Keats in nineteenth-century visual art, and Ann
                            Weirda Rowland’s work on Keats’s reception in turn-of-the-century
                            Boston.</note> We continue the legacy of Keats and his
                afterlives by understanding how he continues to be taken up in widely differing
                contexts, and we participate in extending that legacy particularly when we break
                boundaries separating domains like the scholarly and the popular.</p>

                public school, Harrow. In the closing article (<title level="a">The Editor Out of Bounds</title>) of the
                July 1828 issue, we encounter Keats’s opening lines of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> used to characterize the joyful way in which the young approach the
                world (192).<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                            Keats appears elsewhere in the <title level="j">Harrovian</title>,
                            including on the third page of the first issue’s opening essay, <title level="a">The
                            Greek Drama,</title> where “the lamented Keats” is referred to as “the most
                            pure and imaginative poet of the age, and one in whom the springs of
                            sweet and honied thoughts, were more bright and beautiful than in any
                            writer, Shakespeare excepted, since the days of Homer” (3).</note> The editor,
                Robert Aris Willmott, gets the second line a bit
                wrong (“The loveliness increaseth,” instead of “Its loveliness increases”), which is
                commonplace in an era when one could not simply Google a line to check for accuracy
                (why such misquotations still occur in an era when one <emph>can</emph>
                Google for accuracy is a question I address in this essay’s final section). In 1828
                Keats had also yet to be republished, so the Harrow students would have relied on
                being some of the lucky few who had access to a copy of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> (or perhaps only read extracts from the poem printed in reviews
                from the time of its initial publication ten years before). In the next issue
                (August 1828) the lines appear again, this time coming as an epigraph to Edward
                Seymour’s essay on John Moultrie’s poetry, and this time with greater
                accuracy—“Its,” instead of “the,” but still “increaseth” instead of “increases”
                (198).</p>
                  <p>As far as I’ve been able to discover, with the exception of quotations of the poem in
                reviews from around the time of its publication, these quotations from the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title> in summer 1828 are the earliest instances of the
                line being quoted.<note place="foot" resp="author">  It would be difficult if not impossible to rule out
                            that other earlier examples exist. And of course there are limitations
                            to relying on digital databases in performing such searches, given that
                            they are incomplete and are prone to errors of both the technical sort
                            (text searches in such databases rely on optical character recognition
                            software, which can have high error rates) and the human variety (as when
                            metadata about a digitized text’s publication date is incorrect).
                            However, based on searches for “thing of beauty is a joy” across
                            multiple databases (HathiTrust, Google Books, British Periodicals,
                            <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title>), there are almost no results in the 1820s, a
                            clear but slow uptick in the 1830s and 40s, and sizable jump in the
                            1850s. In the <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title>, for instance, there are no
                            results until 1832, and almost eight times as many results for 1850–9 as
                            for 1830–49. As I discuss later in this essay, the jump in the 1850s is
                            largely thanks to the line’s presence at the Manchester Art Treasures
                            Exhibition in 1857 (in that year the <title level="m">British Newspaper Archive</title> returns
                            123 results for the phrase).</note> Just over twenty years
                later, in July 1849, the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title> could refer to the
                line as “Keats’ often-quoted line” (<title level="a">To Correspondents</title>). But how exactly did that
                come to be the case? <title level="m">Endymion</title> was not exactly a bestseller,
                and editions of Keats’s poetry were few and far between before the late 1840s.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The first
                            collected edition of Keats’s work appeared in 1829 in Paris in a volume
                            collecting Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats together, published by the
                            Galignani brothers. While other editions appeared in the 1830s from
                            American publishers (who were not constrained by copyright), it was not
                            until 1840 that an edition appeared in England. See J. R. MacGillivray’s
                                <title level="m">Keats: A Bibliography and Reference Guide</title> for
                            more detail.</note> I suspect that schools in the 1820s and
                1830s were a vital breeding ground for Keats’s legacy, in part because of the access
                to books otherwise inaccessible which they may have enabled. Clearly there were some
                Keats fans at Harrow in 1828, and we know as well that a few years later at
                Cambridge, Keats was one of the favored poets discussed at the meetings of the
                Apostles Club, whose members included Alfred Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, and Keats’s
                eventual biographer, Richard Monckton Milnes. One institutional factor which affects
                the early history of quoting Keats, then, is the nature of the elite educational
                system in the decades after Keats’s death. </p>
                  <p>With the case of Harrow and <title level="m">The Harrovian</title> one must also place
                quoting Keats within the broader context of periodical writing at the end of the
                Regency period. Of course, during Keats’s career periodical criticism played a
                significant part in shaping his contemporary reception as well as setting the stakes
                for his posthumous life (<title level="m">Adonais</title> begins with a preface
                blaming Keats’s death on the cruelty and bad taste of reviewers). During Willmott’s
                precocious entry into the world of periodical magazines in 1828, his quoting of
                Keats slots into a still ongoing debate about poetry, of which Keats and the Cockney
                School attacks were just one example of the broader transformations in periodical
                culture which had been in process since the end of the eighteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Much has been
                            written about Keats and the Cockney School attacks in recent decades,
                            including the significant reappraisals in the late-90s by Nicholas Roe
                            and Jeffrey Cox. Duncan Wu offers this helpful summation of current
                            critical consensus about what the attacks meant: “In Z.’s anatomy, a
                            ‘Cockney’ lacked taste and education but was full of ‘vulgar’
                            pretension. The term was a class slur by which the well-educated Tories
                            portrayed their liberal counterparts as ill-bred social climbers” (37).
                            As both Roe and Cox argue, the attacks signaled a recognition, from the
                            attackers themselves, of the potential social and cultural power that
                            such “ill-bred” figures represented. For treatments of the broader
                            dynamics at play in periodical writing and literary reviewing during the
                            period, see Richard Cronin’s <title level="m">Paper Pellets</title>, Karen

                cultural influence of periodicals during the early-nineteenth century, it’s not
                surprising that Harrow’s school newspaper would be modelled on popular periodicals
                of the day, nor is it surprising that after editing the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title> Willmott contributed to
                <title level="j">Fraser’s Magazine</title> and the <title level="j">London Magazine</title>
                in the years immediately after completing his
                schooling at Harrow. In June 1830, Willmott publishes his first of many pieces for
                <title level="j">Fraser’s</title>, and he opens his discussion of “The Minor Greek
                Poets” by quoting the opening to <title level="m">Endymion</title> yet again. In his
                praise of Keats in the essay, Willmott buttresses his judgment by quoting the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> ascribing to Keats “‘a pervading tunefulness
                of nature’” (<title level="a">Greek Poets</title> 608). At first glance one might assume that Willmott
                quotes from Francis Jeffrey’s tentative defense of Keats published in August 1820,
                but it actually comes from Thomas Carlyle’s review of John Gibson Lockhart’s
                <title level="m">The Life of Robert Burns</title> in the <title level="j">Edinburgh</title>
                in December 1828. In context, Carlyle’s comment is more faint
                praise than Willmott makes it seem: the full quotation is “a certain vague pervading
                tunefulness of nature” (281). More importantly, the full context also makes the
                connection to the attacks on Keats clearer: Lockhart was, of course, the writer of
                the Cockney School essays in <title level="j">Blackwood’s Magazine</title>. All of
                this is to say, when Willmott quotes Keats in <title level="j">Fraser’s</title> in
                1830, and when he and others quote Keats in the <title level="j">Harrovian</title> in
                1828, they are continuing the periodical jockeying over Keats’s reputation that
                began a decade earlier with the famous attacks in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>,
                the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>, and elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>While we may tend to look toward Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title> as the most
                significant early shaper of Keats’s posthumous reputation, it’s worth recalling that
                the periodical wars to which Shelley was responding by elegizing Keats continued to
                be fought long after they first began when Keats was still alive. Willmott’s defense
                of Keats (and his marshalling of the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>’s
                opinion as evidence in his favor) no doubt felt necessary when one could encounter
                fresh attacks on Keats such as John Wilson Croker’s in the
                <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> in 1833. Fifteen years
                after his notoriously caustic review of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, Croker
                deliberately sets out to do the same to Alfred Tennyson’s 1832 volume. In a letter
                to <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title> publisher John
                Murray, Croker promised to “undertake Tennyson and … make another Keats of him”
                (qtd. in Sherwood 41). It was not only that Croker wanted to create a similar effect
                on Tennyson. He saw the two poets as committing similar affronts to appropriate
                poetic taste. Croker opens the review by noting that Tennyson is “another and a
                brighter star of that galaxy or <emph>milky way</emph> of poetry of which
                the lamented Keats was the harbinger” (81). Quickly, though, a surprising turn of
                humility seems to occur, as Croker claims to “take this occasion to sing our
                palinode on the subject of ‘Endymion’” (82). He goes on to apologize for his
                short-sightedness, which prevented him from “foresee[ing] the unbounded popularity
                which has carried it through we know not how many editions.” Lastly he requests that
                “the publisher of the new and beautiful edition of Keats’s works now in the press,
                with graphic illustrations by Calcott and Turner, will do us the favour and the
                justice to notice our conversion in his prolegomena” (82). </p>
                  <p>Of course, <title level="m">Endymion</title> had not gone through
                any editions beyond the first, and no such edition of his collected works existed
                except as a fiction employed by Croker to mock any who might be trying to rescue
                Keats from the stigma placed upon him by the <title level="j">Quarterly</title> back
                in 1818. The fiction demonstrates that Keats’s posthumous reputation was continually
                affected by actual material bibliographic practices and figural representations of
                them. And what matters here is that, according to Croker, not only is Keats not
                being read, he’s not being published, and not being published in particular ways:
                namely, with the elaborations of visual elements provided by fashionable painters
                like Callcott and Turner. He <emph>was</emph> being published, however, in
                one of the most popular venues for poetry publishing during the late 1820s and
                1830s: in the literary annuals and gift books which were adorned with engravings of
                paintings by figures like Callcott and Turner. Keats’s <title level="a">On a Picture of Leander</title> and
                “In drear nighted December” had appeared in Thomas Hood’s <title level="m">The
                Gem</title> (in 1829 and 1830, respectively). We might thus read Croker’s crass
                posthumous mockery as rooted in defensiveness. Seeing that poetry was being
                published in other forms than expensive illustrated editions, and seeing that the
                dastardly sapling Keats was taking root in the popular soil of the annuals, Croker
                feels compelled to lash out not only at the individual poet, but also at the
                systemic shifts in the publishing of poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Lee Erickson argues that economic forces
                            were largely to blame for the steep drop in the numbers of poetry books
                            published in England after 1820, when the market for such books hit its
                            peak. He notes that the popularity of annuals and gift books helped to
                            exacerbate the other forces that were making it difficult for publishers
                            to invest in the publication of volumes of poetry. See especially
                            26–48.</note> Just as with the initial attacks on Keats, this
                later one can be read as a sign of concern about the change Keats represented. </p>
                  <p>Given that in the 1820s and 30s Keats’s reputation was still being wrestled over in
                the pages of the same magazines which sought to silence him when he was still
                breathing, we ought to read Willmott’s instances of quoting Keats in periodicals not
                simply as neutral expressions of appreciation, but as willful acts of contestation.
                Willmott and his young peers at the <title level="j">Harrovian</title> were seeking to
                make names for themselves within the periodical arena, and one strategy for so doing
                was to renew and extend the cause of defending another youngster who had fought in
                the same space a decade before. In short, these early instances of quoting Keats’s
                most famous line play a part in making it the most famous of his lines, and they
                ought to be understood as responses to the material and medial conditions of
                late-Regency/early-Victorian periodical writing, through which Keats’s steady spread
                into popular discourse had to be negotiated and actively pursued.</p>
                  <p>While the <title level="j">Literary Gazette</title> calls the opening line of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> “Keats’ often-quoted line” in 1849, its popularity
                surely experienced a surge after 1857. The clear reason for the spike is the line’s
                presence over the archway at the entrance to the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition, which ran from May to October 1857. Visitors would have seen it there,
                but it also became a common reference point in writings about the exhibition in
                newspapers and periodicals during that year. Announcements in April describing the
                upcoming exhibition often noted the presence of Keats’s verse: on 10 April 1857 both
                the <title level="j">Globe</title> and <title level="j">Morning
                    Chronicle</title> used the same notice from the <title level="j">Manchester
                    Guardian</title>, which noted, “At the eastern (or entrance) end, we find the
                well-known and very appropriate line—‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever!’” Over
                the next few weeks, leading up to the opening of the exhibition on 5 May, similar
                notices appeared in newspapers across the country, giving Keats’s line probably its
                most concentrated period of quotation since the first publication of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> nearly four decades prior. One wonders if John
                Wilson Croker came across any of these newspaper articles, and if he did, was he
                perhaps still galled that his attempts to relegate <title level="m">Endymion</title>
                to obscurity in 1818 had failed, thanks in part to the popularity of that one
                eminently quotable opening line? While I am generally disinclined to dance on
                anyone’s grave, I also cannot help noting that Croker died just a few months after
                so many newspapers admiringly quoted Keats in April 1857. Perhaps it was Croker who
                ultimately found himself snuffed out by an article. </p>
                  <p>If it’s any consolation to Croker, at least he wasn’t alive in October to witness an
                even greater concentration of approving quotations of Keats. During the months the
                exhibition was open, reviews and notices of it frequently mentioned Keats’s line,
                but it garnered even greater attention at the exhibition’s final day, 17 October
                1857. After an orchestra played music to mark the conclusion, Thomas Fairbairn,
                Chairman of the Executive Committee for the exhibition, offered a brief speech to
                officially close the exhibition: “… when you have left this building the Exhibition
                of Art-Treasures is closed. I hope that you will never forget the liberality which
                has enabled that Exhibition to be formed, and that hereafter all of you will be
                enabled to realise, the truth of the poet’s line—‘A thing of beauty is a joy for
                ever’” (<title level="a">Close</title>). By all accounts these remarks were met with robust cheers from the
                nearly twenty-thousand assembled guests. Keats’s words thus announced the exhibition
                in early advertisements for it, they oversaw visitors over the course of five months
                as they entered the building, and they echoed throughout that structure amid the
                applause marking the end of the exhibition.</p>
                  <p>In this instance we again see the importance of the periodical press, although not
                with respect to the same culture of literary reviewing as that which animates
                Wilmott’s quoting of Keats in 1828–30. This case also involves multiple media
                through which the quoting of Keats occurs (architecture, image, print, voice). To
                further establish the connection between this example and my final section focused
                on quoting Keats via image-sharing websites, there is one additional
                nineteenth-century medium to which I will briefly turn: photography. The connection
                between Keats and photography is an indirect and subtle one, but the presence of his
                opening line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> at the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition suggests potential ways we might illuminate that connection further. </p>
                  <p>As photographic technologies continued to evolve in the first few decades after Louis
                Dageurre and Henry Fox Talbot in the 1830s each separately developed and promoted
                their image-making methods, several common aspects of photography’s cultural
                significance began to emerge. As Steve Edwards notes in <title level="m">The Making
                of English Photography</title>, “The most striking feature of nineteenth-century
                English writing on photography is its overall sense of unease” (15). One primary
                form of that unease had to do with its uncertain status as art. Even though Talbot
                referred to his process as “the Art of Photogenic Drawing,” many viewed photography
                as no more than a purely mechanical process, one which involved little to no
                intervention of the artistic mind. Photographers and advocates for photography had
                to work hard to convince people that, as one correspondent in <title level="j">The
                Photographic Journal</title> put it in May 1859, “photographers can think with
                their cameras as well as painters can with their brushes, or sculptors with their
                chisels” (<title level="a">Photography and Art</title>). Even as late as 1861, The Royal Commissioners
                responsible for organizing the International Exhibition of 1862 thought otherwise
                about the apparatus and products of the camera. In deciding on the taxonomy for that
                exhibition, they followed the Great Exhibition of 1851 in classing photography among
                the “Machinery” section instead of among the “Fine Arts,” to the great
                disappointment and ire of the members of the Photographic Society. A great debate
                ensued, with the Photographic Society attempting to convince the Commissioners that
                photography did not belong “among the ploughs, harrows, and watering cans!” as one
                writer for the <title level="j">Photographic Journal</title> put it (Edwards 165–7).
                Sadly for the photographers, they did not prevail, and in a rather nasty twist of
                fate, many of their works of art (or rather, works of manufacture) were damaged,
                since the pictures were displayed on an upper floor, where intense heat and humidity
                caused many to start decaying (Edwards 189). </p>
                  <p> Although Edwards does not discuss it in his book, which treats at length the 1862
                International Exhibition controversy, there was an earlier exhibition at which
                photography was displayed unambiguously as a fine art: the Manchester Art Treasures
                Exhibition. The executive committee designed the exhibition to demonstrate Britain’s
                wealth of privately owned art works (on loan from the nation’s nobility), and, in a
                similarly nationalistic vein, to educate the public about art and cultural history.
                As Elizabeth Pergam argues in her book-length study of the Exhibition, there was
                also a clear commercial impulse at work, even though the organizing committee
                members tried hard to divorce those concerns from the supposedly more lofty cultural
                and artistic ones. It’s not entirely clear why the committee so readily defined “Art
                Treasures” as inclusive of “Oil Paintings, Water-colour Drawings, Engravings, and
                Photographs” along with various kinds of plastic and decorative arts (Pergam 245).
                But whatever the reasoning (commercial, educational, art historical, or otherwise),
                the Manchester Exhibition represents one of the first times that mass numbers of
                people would have experienced photography in the context of an art exhibition. Some
                1.3 million people visited it, and when they did, they were encouraged by Keats’s
                words to think of photographs as things of beauty capable of providing as much joy
                as any others. </p>
                  <p> In addition to its uneasy cultural status, one of the key issues for photography in
                its infancy revolves around the uncertain ontology of the photographic image. In the
                early decades of photographic images, writers often explored the tension between the
                material and (seemingly) immaterial properties of those images. That is, in
                attempting to explain what precisely photographs were, writers frequently took
                recourse to quasi-magical explanations, as in Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s 1843
                letter to Mary Russell Mitford, where she describes her wonder at the daguerreotype:
                “Think of a man sitting down in the sun and leaving his facsimile in all its full
                completion of outline and shadow, steadfast on a plate, at the end of a minute and a
                half! The Mesmeric disembodiment of spirits strikes one as a degree less marvelous”
                (qtd. in Fraser 138). Barrett Browning recognizes the material processes at work—the
                interaction of light and shadow with a chemically treated plate—but as did many
                other writers, she also poses this interaction as a kind of spiritual, immaterial,
                magical process. </p>
                  <p> The tenuous materiality of photography, then, made it difficult for writers to
                articulate what exactly was the thing of beauty that might be a joy for ever. And
                moreover, that tenuous materiality was even more tenuous over time. As the
                <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title> wrote of photographic processes in 1843,
                they offered the potential of collapsing time into minute durations that seemed
                capable of preserving those times and places: “The self-delineated landscape is
                seized at one epoch of time, and is embalmed amid all the co-existing events of the
                social and physical world […]; and every picture becomes an authentic chapter in the
                history of the world” (<title level="a">Photogenic Drawing</title> 330). A further temporal complication,
                however, is raised by the increasing prevalence, over the next few decades, of
                photographic processes which employed multiple stages. Whereas the daguerreotype, as
                discussed by both Barrett Browning and the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>,
                involved a single process (light acting upon a plate to produce a positive image
                thereon), what became the standard later was the dual, negative-positive process.
                One advantage of this two-part method was that multiple copies could be produced
                from a single negative. That reproducibility, as in Keats, meant that permanence was
                more likely, since an object could be made and remade again and again. But that dual
                process also rendered less clear the ontology of the image. We see this tension on
                display in one of the reviews of the photographic gallery at the Manchester Art
                Treasures Exhibition, where a writer for the
                <title level="j">Liverpool and Manchester Photographic Journal</title> (later
                the <title level="j">British Journal of Photography</title>) begins by noting the
                “striking omission” of “direct photography” (such as daguerreotypes, which by 1857
                were becoming far less common). He regrets that “all that we see here are the result
                of a subsequent process […] the original negatives are nowhere visible”
                (<title level="a">Exhibition</title> 126). It might seem odd to us that a visitor to a gallery of
                photography would complain about not having the negatives on display, but that fact
                demonstrates the extent to which the photographic object was not yet a culturally
                fixed one. All of this is to say, early photographic discourse shows how the
                technology posed challenges for how to locate the materiality of this particular
                aesthetic object. It offered the sense of an eternally fixed image, “an authentic
                chapter in the history of the world,” as the <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>
                puts it. But it also seemed multiply-distributed across space and time thanks to its
                reproducibility, and as would later become clear, due to its liability to
                change.</p>
                  <p> We see these dynamics play out in the commercial realm of photography as well, where
                once again Keats’s words prove rather useful in their elasticity and applicability.
                There are scores of examples from the late-nineteenth century of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s opening line being used in advertisements, for everything from
                clothing to stove polish, and, in a number of examples, for photography. Take the
                case of John Rowlinson of Bury, who in 1857 owned a “Photographic and Fine Art
                Gallery.” In the <title level="j">Bury Times</title> in October of 1857, as the
                Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition was coming to a close, Rowlinson was promoting
                his services by using the opening line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> as the
                epigram for his advertisements. The notice refers to the “beautiful Art of
                Photography,” and encourages patrons to take advantage of the ample natural light
                which flows into his newly constructed gallery for the purposes of “tak[ing] Correct
                Likenesses in any kind of weather.” The advertisement concludes with this rather
                macabre warning: “Call at JOHN ROWLINSON’S Photographic Establishment, 17,
                PRINCESS-STREET, BURY, and have your shadow taken before the substance fades away.”
                Besides reminding potential customers of their own mortality, Rowlinson’s
                advertisement capitalizes on the tensions inherent to the nature of photography
                which Keats’s line captures as well. Photographs are mere shadows, and yet they
                persist and endure after the substance fades away; things of beauty have a material
                basis, and yet the joy which they also are transcends that finitude. Even if this
                advertisement were not inspired by the presence of Keats’s words at the Manchester
                Art Treasures Exhibition, the congruence of the three—the line from
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, the popularization of photography as art at the
                exhibition, and Rowlinson’s advertisements in the same month that Keats’s words and
                the exhibition were being linked in numerous newspapers across the
                country—nonetheless creates a moment during which the quoting of Keats’s most famous
                sentiment was closely associated with this new media form and how it was understood
                in relation to aesthetics. </p>
                  <p>One way to link my first two stories with my last is with the concept of the
                middlebrow, which Brian Bates, in the introduction to this collection, offers as a
                valuable heuristic for making sense of Keats and/in popular culture. Both periodical
                culture—which during the Romantic period moved more and more towards democratization
                and away from its roots in gentility—and photography—which began as the product of
                Talbot’s aristocratic leisure but quickly transformed into a mass, popular
                technology—fulfill several of Beth Driscoll’s eight family attributes of the
                middlebrow: “middle class, reverential towards elite culture, entrepreneurial,
                mediated, feminized, emotional, recreational, and earnest” (6). The story of quoting
                Keats across the nineteenth century is undoubtedly one told through and enabled by
                the particular affordances of the media cultures of the time; it is also a story of
                how those media-ecological entanglements emerge from and help shape ideas about the
                aesthetic, about class, and about the democratization of culture. Keats becomes, and
                continues to be, an effective tool for these mechanisms at least in part because of
                his own work’s status as decidedly middlebrow, whether conceived of through
                Christopher Ricks’s embarrassed Keats, Marjorie Levinson’s illegitimate Keats,
                Nicholas Roe’s unapologetically Cockney Keats, or any number of other accounts which
                position Keats in the liminal spaces between the high and the low, the elite and the
                popular. The forms of mediation which give us quoted Keats in the nineteenth century
                are themselves likewise situated in the space of the middlebrow.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Driscoll’s
                            focus is on the contemporary texts and institutions of the middlebrow,
                            but she (and other scholars of the middlebrow) have stressed the
                            importance of the concept’s emergence at the turn of the twentieth
                            century, and the “family resemblance” definitional approach Driscoll
                            takes also allows for a fluid application across different periods and
                            contexts (5–6). With respect to Keats, his early critics certainly cast
                            him as what would become recognizable as middlebrow about a century
                            later (the Cockney School attacks arguably characterize Keats’s poetry
                            with all eight of Driscoll’s features of the middlebrow); Keats slowly
                            becomes associated with high culture as he enters the canon by the
                            early-twentieth century; and he then
                            increasingly becomes associated with middlebrow institutions later in
                            the century, in part through his quotability in various popular culture
                            contexts.</note> I turn lastly, then, to that intensely
                middlebrow contemporary realm of mediation, the internet, and especially that corner
                of the internet through which individuals self-fashion themselves through acts of
                quotation.</p>
                  <p> My significant jump forward in time may seem to place us in a wildly different media
                environment than that of the nineteenth century. As I’ve shown, however, a focus on
                quoting Keats in popular culture in the past is one that leads us into a rich,
                multiply-mediated ecosystem. The mechanisms of contemporary new media are certainly
                different in kind and degree, but they nonetheless exist in relation to the broader
                history of media that helps illuminate Keats’s reception beginning two hundred years
                ago. Just as a focus on quoting Keats in the periodicals of the 1820s and 30s can
                help reveal the particularities of that media-specific moment; and just as a focus
                on quoting Keats around the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition shows a confluence
                between the democratization of art, the continuing spread of periodical culture, and
                the emergence of the photographic arts; so too does a focus on quoting Keats on the
                wilds of the internet demonstrate the way that the middlebrow propagates through
                non-human media agents as much as through conscious intentional human actors. With
                respect to Keats’s presence on quotation websites, and particularly on image-sharing
                sites like Instagram and Pinterest, my primary interests lie with what happens when
                quoting goes awry. As I suggested with the initial examples of the
                <title level="j">Harrovian</title>’s slight misquotations, the internet is not where
                misinformation, misattribution, and other forms of departures from reality and fact
                began; however, I focus on the mistaken examples of quoting Keats on the internet
                because they are particularly intriguing for their connections with how quoting
                propagates through digital platforms. </p>
                  <p>The variety of misquotations and misattributions associated with Keats floating
                around the internet is impressive, though not necessarily atypical. Garson O’Toole,
                the pseudonymous founder of the website, Quote Investigator (quoteinvestigator.com),
                and author of <title level="m">Hemingway Didn’t Say That: The Truth Behind Familiar
                Quotations</title>, has spent nearly a decade attempting to catalogue, correct, and
                explain the origins of the many spurious quotations that circulate on the internet
                in various fora.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The pseudonym belongs to Gregory F. Sullivan, a

                twentieth-century American writer who wrote a biography of Dorothy Parker. Even so,
                the range of misattributed Keats quotations helps to illuminate some of O’Toole’s
                types of misattributions and the mechanisms that produce them.<note place="foot" resp="author">  O’Toole

                  <p>Among the examples I’ve found related to Keats are the following: lines from W. B.
                Yeats’s poem, <title level="a">Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,</title> which likely emerges from the
                similarity of their names (not to mention the fact that The Smiths have long
                asserted that Keats and Yeats are on your side).<note place="foot" resp="author">  O’Toole classes “similar names” as one
                            common form in the Reader Error category.</note> Another
                example of this sort, which involves both the similarity of their names and their
                alphabetical proximity, is this section from a speech by John F. Kennedy: “The
                problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics, whose
                horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things
                that never were.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a thorough explanation on the origin of this
                            misattribution, see Sue Brewton’s blog post devoted to the topic: <ref target="https://suebrewton.com/tag/we-need-men-who-can-dream-of-things-that-never-were/">suebrewton.com/tag/we-need-men-who-can-dream-of-things-that-never-were/</ref>.
                        </note> Thanks to Jane Campion’s film <title level="m">Bright
                    Star</title>, which featured a significant amount of dialogue lifted directly from
                Keats’s letters alongside invented sentences and conversations, one can find at
                least one example of what O’Toole calls the “historical fiction” mechanism, or when
                a quotation from a piece of historical fiction gets attributed directly to the
                person depicted in the fiction. In <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, for instance,
                Keats as portrayed by Ben Whishaw says to Abbie Cornish as Fanny Brawne, “We have
                woven a web, you and I, attached to this world but a separate world of our own
                invention.” The sentence has circulated widely, sometimes with images from the scene
                in the film, but more commonly with simply a textual attribution to Keats. While
                many misquotations and misattributions have fairly transparent explanations behind
                them, others confound (at least my) understanding. I’ve yet to concoct a plausible
                explanation for how these lines from Demi Lovato’s song, <title level="a">Skyscraper,</title> came to be
                connected with Keats:
                <quote>

                To the credit of the internet and
                its users, some sharing the image clearly do so in jest and in appreciation of the
                absurdity. One reblogger on tumblr offers this valuable corrective: “Obviously it
                wasn’t John Keats, it was Sylvia Plath.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p>Other examples fall under O’Toole’s “ventriloquy” category, which involves statements
                that seem plausible to attribute to the person in question. For instance, one can
                perhaps understand why Keats might have written something like “I am profoundly
                enchanted with the flowing complexity in you” to Fanny Brawne. A variety of
                quotations about failure have also been attributed to Keats, perhaps because of his
                statement from the preface to <title level="m">Endymion</title>, “There is not a
                fiercer hell than the failure in a great object” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 102),
                as well as his more accepting perspective on failure from his 8 October 1818 letter
                to James Augustus Hessey: “I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail
                than not be among the greatest” (<title level="m">Letters</title> I: 374). While those
                two quotations do appear in results for a Google search for “Keats failure,” the far
                more common results, at least in the case of images, involve some version of this
                misattribution: “Don’t be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience.
                Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success.” What’s distinctive about this last
                quotation, though, is that it’s been around (in this form or in similar ones) and
                attributed to Keats since the late-nineteenth century. We see the collision of
                quoting practices from 140 years ago and those of today when encountering, for
                instance, the 1877 <title level="m">New Cyclopedia of Prose Illustrations</title> via
                Google Books.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                            The full quotation in Elon Foster’s <title level="m">New
                                Cyclopedia</title> is as follows: “Albeit failure in any cause produces
                            a correspondent misery in the soul, yet it is, in a sense, the highway
                            to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to
                            seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out
                            some form of error which we shall afterward carefully eschew” (320).
                            Other books attribute the quotation in this form to Keats, but as far as
                            I have discovered, Foster’s is the earliest one.</note> Here
                quoting Keats (although through a misattribution) occurs in a particular print
                context in 1877 which persists and evolves as it enters into the digital context of
                2019, and it does so through the particularities of mass digitization efforts, OCR
                technologies, and search capabilities.</p>
                  <p>Although O’Toole uses the resources of the twenty-first century to do the work of
                tracking misquotations and misattributions, and he does also gesture toward the
                causal relationship between the proliferation of misinformation and digital media, I
                suggest that understanding the mechanisms of (mis)quoting in our era requires more
                attention to that causality. That is not to say that in the era of print periodicals
                and books that those media did not exert a causal force on such dynamics. How Keats
                became associated with the failure quotation in the <title level="m">New Cyclopedia
                    of Prose Illustrations</title> likely involved the specific ways that books like it
                were produced, as much as the association of Keats and some of his writing with
                failure. In the digital context, however, the mechanisms involved are often further
                removed from human activity and rooted more deeply in the materiality of
                computational processes. As such, the nature of quoting Keats (or anyone else) in
                contemporary media needs to be understood as part of a broader history of mediation,
                while also recognizing the distinctiveness of new media.</p>
                  <p>My final example gestures toward some of the specific ways in which the
                particularities of digital media drive potential misattributions in ways distinct
                from the earlier history I’ve discussed thus far. The misattribution in question
                (“Life is divine Chaos. It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way”) I first
                encountered by searching for #johnkeats on Instagram, and have since encountered it
                on several other sites. There is perhaps an argument to be made that this example
                falls under the “ventriloquy” category, given that Keats’s famous coinage, negative
                capability, has led to a wide range of ideas associating Keats with “being in
                uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp;
                reason” (<title level="m">Letters</title> I: 193). Keats fans might thus find it
                plausible to attribute to him the notion of life as divine chaos, the messiness of
                which must be accepted and not irritably resisted. More importantly, though, this
                example illustrates some of the nebulous computational processes that likely led to
                the misattribution happening in the first place and contributed to its spread. A
                longer and slightly different version of the quotation (without the messiness
                phrase) is elsewhere attributed to solbeam, which is the pen name of a blogger who
                runs a site called “seekingsol.” In a post from August 2005 she wrote that the bit
                about life being divine chaos was what she would say to her 14-year-old self, had
                she the opportunity to do so. How, then, does that post from 2005 end up as a
                quotation misattributed to Keats?</p>
                  <p>The quotation first started circulating and became popular on the internet in the
                form of a few similar images, with the attribution always to solbeam (a reverse
                image search for one of the popular iterations of this image comes up with matches
                as far back as February 2008). The shift to Keats appears to have resulted from the
                quotation being used in <title level="m">The Keatyn Chronicles</title>, a YA romance
                series by Jillian Dodd, published since 2012, and now on its twelfth volume. Keatyn
                is the name of the protagonist, which could have led to confusion on its own merits,
                but the confusion gets even worse because Keatyn’s nickname is Keats. One of her
                boyfriends, Brooklyn, likes to quote John Keats to her, which he does on multiple
                occasions while saying, “Keats for my Keats” (55, 160, 208). Early in the first book
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> gets a nod from Brooklyn, who
                utters the poem’s opening line while cuddling with Keatyn (53). Soon after this
                first romantic encounter, another tryst likewise involves quotation, but in this
                case he notes, “‘Life is messy. Like that quote we like … <emph>Life is
                    divine chaos</emph>. It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way’” (163). The
                italics seem to indicate that only “<emph>Life is divine chaos</emph>”
                refers to “that quote we like,” but in the instances when the sentences are
                attributed to Keats, the second sentence, which in the novel is Brooklyn’s gloss on
                the quotation, is always included as part of the quotation. Neither character in
                this scene refers to any part of the quotation as coming from Keats, but Brooklyn
                does refer to Keatyn as Keats just a few lines after he says the phrase. The simple
                textual proximity of “Keats” and the two sentences which get attributed to the poet
                seems unlikely to be the result of some individual’s misreading of the scene.
                Instead, it seems more likely that the algorithmic processes underlying the complex
                workings of internet virality, textual transformation, and memetic recirculation are
                responsible. </p>
                  <p>One final detail adds to the likelihood that this particular misattribution results
                as much from machine readers as from human ones. In one image attributing “Life is
                divine chaos” to Keats, the attribution is actually to “Jhon Keats.” While a simple
                typo is a possibility, and Jhon is a rare alternative spelling for John, it is also
                a common mistake that occurs with optical character recognition software (OCR).
                Whitney Trettien writes about print-on-demand editions of Milton’s
                <title level="m">Areopagitica</title>, including one titled <title level="m">English Reprints Jhon
                    Milton Areopagitica</title>, and analyzes the “remediated,
                <emph>dis</emph>mediated strangeness” of OCR reprints.<note place="foot" resp="author">  Trettien distinguishes between
                            print-on-demand facsimile editions (produced using images of scanned
                            books) and OCR editions (which harvest text from scanned images and then
                            create print books meant to resemble modern typography). Currently on
                            Amazon one can find two different copies of facsimile editions of
                            Keats’s 1820 volume which list the author’s name as “Jhon Keats.” With
                            the facsimile editions, OCR is still used to automate information about
                            the texts, such as the title and author’s name.</note> Print
                books which have been scanned (or microform versions of print books that have been
                scanned) and then have OCR performed upon them often result in high error rates,
                especially with older typographical conventions. But OCR is unreliable with other
                forms of text as well, such as the cursive scripts used to create image-based memes
                with quotations from, or misattributions to, famous writers like Keats. And so we
                arrive at an image attributing “Life is divine chaos” to Jhon Keats, a process which
                begins with a popular meme attributing the same words to solbeam, which then appears
                in a novel featuring a character nicknamed Keats, which then transmigrates into a
                new meme attributing the words to John Keats, and through further machinic
                processes, John becomes Jhon. As digitized texts like Dodd’s
                <title level="m">Keatyn Chronicles</title> get acted upon by human users <emph>and</emph>
                by automated processes, strange new mechanisms produce unexpected instances of
                quoting like this one. While such mechanisms surely differ in degree and kind from
                the mechanisms of, say, periodical writing in the 1820s and 30s, or newspaper
                accounts of the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, we ought to treat each
                as part of a broader history of Keats’s pop cultural afterlife, which is always
                necessarily a history of mediation.</p>
                  <p>One further scene from Dodd’s book nicely illustrates the overlapping of differently
                mediated engagements with Keats’s legacy and how they shape what quoting Keats means
                now. A few chapters after Brooklyn’s “divine chaos” comments, he presents Keatyn
                with a birthday gift: “an old book, the cover faded and the words
                <title level="m">Poetical Works</title> by John Keats embossed on the spine.” After Brooklyn
                describes the gift as “‘Keats for my Keats,’”
                <emph>his</emph> Keats looks into <emph>the other</emph> Keats, where she finds “an old inscription” reading
                “1903, To my love. / —S,” and a new one, from Brooklyn, reading 
                <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Even Keats speaks of chaos.</l>
                           <l>
                              <emph>There is nothing stable in the world; uproar’s your only music</emph>.</l>
                           <l>All my love,</l>
                           <l>B. (208)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
                The palimpsestic inscriptions layer
                together a history of affective relationships crafted through the nexus of Keats’s
                poetry. First, a complete edition from around the turn of the century, when many
                monumentalizing editions of Keats’s work were being published (contra Croker’s
                mocking reevaluation of Keats’s legacy in 1833), remediates Keats to his posthumous
                audience, and a member of that audience uses the book to transfer the cathected
                emotions linked to Keats to his “love.” That engagement is then furthered by
                Brooklyn’s new annotation, where he characterizes this twenty-first-century
                attachment through “that quote we like” about “divine chaos,” which he connects to
                Keats with an accurate quotation (Keats does indeed write about there being “nothing
                stable in the world” in a letter to his brothers in January 1818). The final piece
                of this complicated web of connections exists outside of Dodd’s novel, where the
                collocation of Keats, Keatyn, and “divine chaos” establishes a new, not entirely
                human-made node in the network of quotations which help to create our popular Keats. </p>

                    Brooks’s unpublished personal and professional papers to place his work in the
                    context of mid-century disciplinary and methodological changes. At a time when
                    greater access to American higher education created what we might call a
                    “classroom public” for poetry, Brooks’s study of Keats advocates for and models
                    the close, collective reading of poetry, idealistically figuring the university
                    classroom as a site of social inclusion while also summoning the conservative
                    historical fantasies associated with Southern Agrarianism. </p>

                  <p>It’s not uncommon for readers to cite John Keats’s Grecian urn as if it were the main piece in one of modern criticism’s
                    most consequential titles, Cleanth Brooks’s
                <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The phrase “Keats’s well-wrought urn”
                    appears, for instance, in Bornstein, p. 265; Dass, p. 36; Fairer, p. 32; Haw, p. 187; Richard Keller Simon,
                    p. 123; and Vinegar and Golec, p. 85.</note> The confusion between Keats’s “bride of quietness” and the
                    “well-wrought urn” of John Donne’s <title level="a">The Canonization</title> can be chalked up to the
                prevalence of the conceit: urn as self-contained text-object. Brooks himself encouraged the misidentification
                by making <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> his book’s central case study, and his self-declared
                goal, “to bridge the gap between metaphysical poetry and other poetries” (<title level="m">Postscript</title> 698),
                    is in keeping with just such a mix-up. Keats’s poem abets in its own way, embedding the key adjective
                    (“O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede / Of marble men and maidens <emph>overwrought</emph>…”)
                    and thus suggesting Brooks’s title as an allusion to the poetic differential in which he was so heavily
                    invested, between content (overwrought expression) and structure (well-wrought achievement), between
                    the depiction of emotion (pictures on the side of an urn) and the complex aesthetic form that contains
                    such depiction (the urn itself).</p>
                  <p>That Keats’s urn has become so readily identifiable with a touchstone of twentieth-century formalist criticism speaks to his exceptional status among American New Critics, who were famously—if somewhat disingenuously—dismissive of the romantics. As Frank Jordan explains in his overview of modern romantic criticism, the New Critics’ “sharpshooting was chiefly aimed at Shelley (a poet of adolescent ideas for readers of adolescent enthusiasms) and Wordsworth… Only Keats escaped their fire virtually unharmed” (62). Ernest Bernbaum’s tabular accounting of romantic scholarship in the 1940s shows that Keats was the most written-about of the romantics in that decade (73), and in 1948 J. R. MacGillivray remarks on the “almost unqualified praise” of Keats by “the ‘New Criticism’ of the thirties and forties” (still “new” enough to need quotation marks; lxxxi). Frederick Pottle, colleague and sparring-partner of Brooks at Yale, introduced his classes on Keats in the 40s and 50s by summarizing the poet’s relatively high standing among contemporary critics:
                <quote>
                    Probably now at the highest point of
                    critical acclaim. Some attempt to make him out the greatest of the Romantics.
                    Essays on positive values by Leavis, Brooks, Tate, Burke…. Basic reason for
                    their approval: however far Keats may be from the tradition of wit or the kind
                    of imagery exemplified by the metaphysicals and the moderns, he invariably shows
                    a firm grasp of objective reality in the mode of common concrete dense
                    perception. Disciplines and impersonalizes his personal emotions by developing
                    them out of real objects. ‘Sensuous’—cf. what the Victorian critics thought
                    ‘Adolescence.’ More dramatic than Shelley. Less direct statement than W.W.
                    Humor. Awareness of complexity. Skepticism. Doesn’t run to easy solutions.

            Realistic, concrete, disciplined,
                    impersonal, dramatic, undogmatic, ironic, skeptical, and above all—as the sum of
                    these qualities—<emph>mature</emph>: “John Keats is not one of the villains of modern
                    criticism,” Brooks declared in 1957, indeed he “may well prove to be one of
                    [its] heroes” (<title level="a">Artistry</title> 246).</p>
                  <p>Though he came to believe that he would “be
                    among the English poets” after his death, Keats could hardly have foreseen being
                    a hero of academic critics. The gap between popular appeal and critical respect
                    was an ongoing source of ambivalence for him, as his need to make money from
                    poetry proved bewilderingly hard to separate from his grander sense of vocation.
                    “I equally dislike the favor of the public with the love of a woman—they are
                    both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence,” he wrote his publisher
                    John Taylor (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 144), aligning the allure of popular
                approval (and the money that came with it) with the allure of beauty for the errant knight
                in <title level="a">La Belle Dame sans Merci</title> (or more personally, the allure of
                Fanny Brawne for a young poet in need of funds to marry her while he still could). Keats
                played out his resistance to that allure in romances like <title level="a">Isabella,</title>
                whose gross and “wormy circumstance” mocked the standard romance-reader, and <title level="a">The
                Eve of St. Agnes,</title> where a sexually explicit depiction of Porphyro’s encounter with
                “hoodwinked” Madeline was deemed “unfit for ladies” by his friend Richard Woodhouse and frustrated
                Taylor by tacitly refusing a wider readership (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 163). “I feel
                it in my power to become a popular writer—I feel it in my strength to refuse the poisonous
                suffrage of a public” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 146): Keats distinguished his ability
                to produce sensational, “overwrought” content from the “strength” required to assimilate that
                content to a rigorously wrought form. That capacity to aesthetically process and transform sensuous
                and complex experience would come to be seen as the hallmark of Keatsian maturity—as in his
                acclaimed ode, which distills the romances’ “unfit” sexual scenarios into an aesthetic encounter
                fit for a museum, with a male viewer who “haunts about th[e] shape” of an ancient artifact figured
                as an inaccessible “bride,” and a “leaf-fring’d legend” whose images of “violent love-making” (as
                Brooks describes) merge with the total form of a Greek vase (<title level="a">History Without
                Footnotes</title> 93).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On eroticism in the ode, see Johnson, pp. 129–35; Pope; and Zeitlin.
                    As Pope summarizes, the specter of sexual violence in the poem has long been recognized as
                    a feature of the poem by canonical Keats criticism, though with quite variable emphases (46).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Keats’s ambivalence about “the poisonous
                    suffrage of the public,” which in the Keatsian narrative connotes his “maturity”
                    as well, offers an alternative way of understanding his exceptional appeal to
                    New Critics, who evince a similar jumble of popularizing and gatekeeping
                    impulses. The rise of close reading in the mid-twentieth-century classroom, in
                    Doug Mao’s words, “seemed happily timed to address the newly broad composition
                    of collegiate student bodies, and in this sense to participate in a further
                    democratization of American society” (246). But Mao’s judicious phrasing
                    reflects some of the contentious assertions about readers made by the New
                    Criticism’s leading figures—John Crowe Ransom railing against what he called the
                    “low grade” taste of “the participating millions” (<title level="m">World’s
                    Body</title> 280); Allen Tate condemning “egalitarian superstition” (<title level="m">Essays</title> 527); Brooks pitting the mature reader of poetry against
                    the “desperately bad” taste of a “young lady … in raptures over her confessions
                    magazine” (<title level="m">Well Wrought
                    Urn</title> 233). In <title level="m">Cultural Capital</title>, John Guillory gives
                such assertions an institutional context, by presenting the New Criticism as an attempt
                to re-order the field of literary studies and, with it, American culture as a whole.
                “The retreat of literary culture into the university can be understood as a kind of
                transcendence of the cultural conditions of modernity” (165), writes Guillory: “In
                discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, students also discovered at
                the same moment why it needed to be studied <emph>in the university</emph>” (173).
                Approaching the formalist turn as a disciplinary response to a looming sense of cultural
                disorder, Guillory argues that the withdrawal of poetry into the seminar-room made
                literature “more difficult to consume outside the school” (174). The blossoming of close
                reading as the central activity of literary studies, in this thesis, corresponds with
                poetry’s retreat from public culture into a mature and masculine exclusivity, with
                “the urn as a figure for the enclosure of literary culture in the academy” (166).</p>
                  <p>Brooks’s writing, which frequently turns polemical, gives the critic of elitism plenty
                to work with. Even when displaying his belief in what could make poetry genuinely popular,
                he laments those forms of popular culture that serve as distracting alternatives. “Even
                people who think that they care nothing for poetry have interests which are the same as
                those satisfied by poetry,” he tells us; “they listen to speeches, go to church, view
                television programs, read magazine stories or the gossip columns of newspapers” (Brooks
                and Warren, <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title> 21). These distractions are
                associated with an urgent crisis of language and imagination: “Never has language taken
                such a pounding perhaps in our history,” Brooks says, citing “what happens to [it] as it
                is used day in and day out by the journalist, the advertising man, the Tin Pan Alley
                lyricist, the class B movie script writer, the politician, and the bureaucrat” (<title level="a">Literature as Paideia</title>). In <title level="m">The Hidden
                    God</title> (1963), he cites “the pressure of the popular arts” as particularly damaging,
                noting that if Wordsworth “claimed that the imagination was being strangled by the more
                sensational popular arts,” then “cheap fiction, Tin Pan Alley, the movies, the radio,
                and now television makes what Wordsworth faced in 1800 seem very mild indeed” (3). Brooks
                was every bit at ease in dismissing popular culture as he was in citing Cole Porter or
                Alley-Oop to do so, and this rhetorical flair is part of his power as a prose stylist.</p>
                  <p>Approaching the question of access to
                    literary culture in terms of Brooks’s cultural polemics, however, keeps us from
                    seeing the more paradoxical aspects of a close-reading practice that would come
                    to be widely understood as a catalyst for inclusivity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Graff
                        writes that “putting the emphasis on the literary text itself … seemed a tactic ideally
                        suited to a new, mass student body that could not be depended on to bring to the university
                        any common cultural background” (173). As Guillory points out (168), Graff makes no claim
                        for the democratizing intentions of new-critical pedagogy, yet the basic association between
                        the democratization of culture and new-critical pedagogy is nonetheless common. For an
                        example of the optimistic rhetoric, see Holland: “The ‘New Criticism’ opened the great
                        tradition of English literature to people of any or no cultural inheritance…. In an
                        upwardly mobile society, students whose parents had never graduated from high school
                        could be <emph>littérateurs</emph>” (68). More nuanced, Mao enriches our understanding
                        of this counter-hierarchical tendency by arguing that the New Criticism’s emphasis on
                        the text-object in itself, rather than on the scholarly origins and contexts that
                        enable its study, served a paradoxically leveling function: “the primary aim of the
                        New Critics in this area was … to bring ‘difficult’ poetry to the widest possible
                        audience by showing that one can engage complexity without devoting one’s lifetime
                        to the mastery of historical and biographical contexts” (248).</note> We do better
                by attending to the exacting labor that most preoccupied Brooks and his colleagues:
                close reading itself. In this essay I turn to his central methodological demonstration,
                <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History Without Footnotes.</title> Despite its
                starring role in <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>, this study of <title level="a">Ode
                    on a Grecian Urn</title> is known more for
                    its broadest strokes than for its finer brushwork. But it rewards careful
                    scrutiny. The essay shows Brooks dramatizing close reading as a collective
                    practice that hedges against the alienation of modern life by nourishing an
                    intimate community whose members attend, all at once, to the same thing. Indeed,
                    in the idealized new-critical seminar, poetry becomes genuinely popular again:
                    the modern reading public may be defined by the fact that authors no longer know
                    the people for whom they write, but Brooksian reading turns back the clock, not
                    only by drawing a poem near to its reader, but by drawing readers near to one
                    another. More restrained than, say, the radical formalism of Theodor Adorno,
                    which allowed art to float free of social instrumentality as part of a broader
                    revolutionary program, the reading-practice Brooks articulates in his study of
                    Keats respects the autonomy of art but is itself infused with social and moral
                    purpose. The scene of close reading brings into being a communal formation, call
                    it “the classroom public,” which is not easily pinned down, politically
                    speaking, and which idealistically figures present as well as future scenes of
                    reading as sites of social inclusion, even as it nostalgically summons some of
                    Agrarianism’s more conservative historical fantasies.</p>

                  <head>II. ‘On a level’: Close Readers in the Ivory Tower</head>
                  <p>The idea that close reading enabled “a
                    counter-hierarchical pedagogy” has been part of the discipline’s self-narration
                    dating back almost to the new-critical era itself. Addressing Yale’s incoming
                    graduate cohort in 1966, Pottle, who was then the English department’s DGS,
                    described the vivifying effect of new-critical pedagogy. An eminent historicist
                    and one of Brooks’s most formidable antagonists in the 1940s and 1950s, Pottle
                    told the new arrivals that the entrenched practice of close reading had
                    effectively lightened the weight of canonical authority. Graduate students were
                    no longer “over-awed by previous judgments,” he said; “No doubt this has made
                    the study of literature more exciting.” And as with canonical authority, so too
                    with professorial authority: the student now is “on a level with the instructor,
                    or even above him. Nobody has to be a specialist or even learned.” The result
                    was “a sense of wide horizons, room for discovery, [and] encouragement of the
                    combative sense” (<title level="a">Current Developments</title>)—this latter
                    encouragement hinting that
                    students were freshly empowered to wage intellectual battle with their
                    professors.</p>
                  <p>To an extent, we discern in these words a kindly welcome meant to put an anxious clatch
                of doctoral candidates at ease. <emph>Don’t be nervous about your seminar with
                Misters Brooks, Wimsatt, or even Bloom</emph>, Pottle implies; <emph>nowadays
                the student is on a level with the instructor, or even above him</emph>.
                Pottle also reproduces a familiar image of the New Critic as pedagogue, one that was
                born with the 1938 publication of the teaching anthology <title level="m">Understanding
                    Poetry</title> and flourished with the democratization of higher education:
                    <emph>Nobody has to be a specialist or even
                    learned</emph>. But while the New Critics’ close reading techniques facilitated
                participation among students of varying educational backgrounds, a new academic
                egalitarianism was not in their purview. The odd mixture of anti-industrialist populism
                and aristocratic sensibility that defines the original Agrarian position in part helps
                to explain this split-seam within new-critical thought. At issue here are two competing
                notions of humanities education prominent in the emerging modern university of the 1930s
                and 1940s: the <emph>liberal-free</emph> and the <emph>oratorical</emph>. The liberal-free
                ideal, grounded in the Enlightenment, is critical in orientation, devoted to open-ended
                inquiry and to the production and accumulation of knowledge, as opposed to the dissemination
                of information (Harpham 11–13). Its concern is for students’ growth; in the liberal-free
                university, “maturity” is about learning how to think and is achieved through “an emphasis
                on freedom, especially freedom from tradition and a priori strictures and standards”
                (Kimball 119). Conversely, in the oratorical tradition, “maturity” is about learning
                <emph>what</emph> to think. Grounded in Plato and fortified by thinkers like Arnold and
                Newman, the oratorical approach is cultural in orientation, devoted to the passing-down
                of specific knowledge, “the tradition of great texts” (Kimball 238), moral values, and
                the preservation of an existing idea of culture (Harpham 12–13). The mainstream of
                new-critical practice effectively straddled these two approaches to education. It combined
                a potentially disruptive emphasis on criticism (versus philology, historicism, ethics) with
                a countervailing dedication to high culture. In this doubled thinking, the New Criticism
                practically wrote its own contradictory legacy as a movement that is as much praised for
                its progressive and egalitarian tendencies as disparaged for its consolidation of a
                restrictive view of the literary.</p>
                  <p>On the one hand, then, the new-critical emphasis on <emph>understanding</emph> poetry suited
                a disciplinary ideal of literature as a subject distinct from the sciences, a subject in which
                knowledge was a process rather than an outcome. It could not be properly understood through
                the dissemination of facts, or through the paraphrasing of its content, or through the appreciation
                of its aesthetic pleasures; it was instead a provocation, a focus for hard thinking, a basis for
                maturation. By engaging meaningfully with literature, adolescents learning to navigate the modern
                world learned how to think and act like adults. As they learned to take responsibility for their
                independent taste-judgments, though, they did so under the tutelage of professors who espoused and
                maintained a definite taste-hierarchy, in which the most difficult of literary works, which challenged
                readers with their ambiguities, tensions, and paradoxes, were explicitly set above the modern forms of
                cultural production that were so alluring to young people—radio, films, magazines, as well as
                the supposedly “immature” and “sentimental” poetry by writers like Shelley or Joyce Kilmer. A mature
                literature was touted as a difficult literature, and by providing students the tools to decipher its
                meanings, the New Criticism could be seen as providing access to the cultural capital that it historically
                represented, while securing the legitimacy of humanities study more generally.</p>
                  <p>The collegiate public was beginning to look different in the 1940s: if the public for classic poetry in
                America was coming to be centered in the universities, those universities were themselves becoming more
                representative of a wider public. Enrollments soared through the decade, as media coverage popularized
                the idea of common Americans “storming the ivory tower” (Clark 174). Although this expansion of opportunity
                did not yet extend to American minorities, who remained subject to both explicit and de facto forms of
                segregation, nonetheless “the college degree itself was transformed in the 1940s from a document earned
                primarily by members of the American upper class” (Ciabattari xix). The reading community taking shape
                in the American classroom during and after the second World War, drawn from a range of educational
                backgrounds, was thus a “fit audience though few” in the most perverse of ways, for it was precisely
                its uneven fitness that conditioned its receptivity to the poetry that New Critics wanted to teach.</p>
                  <p>Not all professors of poetry were at ease with this shift toward a restricted collegiate sphere. The
                poet Karl Shapiro, holding onto a romantic notion of the individual genius, criticized the move of
                creative production into institutional settings, writing that “Writers and artists have become
                professors, and young people of talent meet with the creative spirit in an academic world” (208).
                For Shapiro, the influence of Brooks and Warren, and the fact that <title level="m">Understanding
                Poetry</title> represented “one of the most important works of the twentieth century,” was the sign
                of a bigger problem:
            <quote>
                It is the book that took poetry off the street and put it in the laboratory. It has not only
                revolutionized the teaching of literature; it has practically put a stop to genius. Every
                composition test and anthology shows its influence; the brainless and beautiful poetry of
                our leading verse magazines derives from <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>.
                The objectivity of such teaching tools prevents the young
                writer from creating standards of his own. (208)
            </quote>
            Shapiro’s perception of student passivity (he calls this “the Brain-Washed Generation”) is echoed
            by Joseph E. Baker, professor at Iowa, who grouses about the effect of close reading on “young
            intellectuals” who “find no message in literature and therefore as a literary generation have no
            message at all to give to the public.” Baker blames “a demolition squad of English professors, a
            small but aggressive minority within their own departments, hard at work with the efficiency of
            doctrinaires,” for training students to “handle a poem like a cross-word puzzle” (2). The new-critical
            assumption, according to Baker, was that the “general public” for poetry was “in the classroom”—“that
            literature is mainly to be written, and even read, in ivory towers”—but that the classroom did
            not allow for conversation “about human problems, about life, about ideals and eternal verities (3).</p>
                  <p>Brooks’s assumptions about the so-called Ivory Tower,
                    though, were different; he sought to transform the concept. In a kind of
                    urn-like chiasmus, he saw the popular as literary, and the literary as popular:
                    “it is possible to prove that certain … poets inhabit the Ivory Tower by
                    measuring the size of the reading public which appreciates them,” he argued,
                    “but it would be better to say that the public is in the Ivory Tower” because of
                    the “greater scope and breadth which the poetry of the obscure poets
                    assimilates” (<title level="m">Modern Poetry</title> 67–68). In Brooks’s view, a
                public composed of student-readers would encounter through poetry a totality of
                experience that belies the very concept of the Ivory Tower. This was in keeping with
                the contemporary push to view College English as a curricular space dedicated, in the
                words of Esther Raushenbush (who taught at Sarah Lawrence and later became its president),
                to “helping [students] grow out of their adolescence and become mature human beings” (v).
                The seminar promised a sort of coming-of-age, in which students would learn to subordinate
                their personal interests to a supposedly more mature and objective criticism. It also
                promised opportunities for moral edification—a humanist aim that formalist readers
                were only too happy to claim for their own approach, by suggesting the spiritual benefit
                that would come with practicing critical rigor.</p>
                  <p>The transformation of the collegiate public
                    intensified after the war, when government investment contributed to a
                    near-total makeover of the nation’s classrooms. Under the $5.5 billion GI Bill,
                    war veterans became a prominent presence on campus, by dint of sheer numbers and
                    by their visible maturity and academic success. Keith Olson, the leading
                    historian of the GI Bill, reports that more than two million veterans attended
                    university in the half-decade following the war, one million in 1947–48 alone
                    (596, 602). Seventy percent of the class of 1949 were veterans (596). College
                    attendance was no longer the exclusive preserve of wealthy young elites, which
                    it had been even as late as the 1930s; it was “established as a social norm”
                    (McGurl 66), more diverse in terms of class, ethnicity, and religion, and with
                    so many ex-servicemen, there were even students of various age- and
                    maturity-levels.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the other hand, the impact
                        of the G.I. Bill on racial equality was disappointing. As Bailey explains,
                        “Though African Americans and Latinos were as fully entitled to benefits as
                        white veterans, they faced much greater obstacles, from racial segregation
                        and discrimination in higher education to a much lower high-school graduation
                        rate that left black veterans less able to take advantage of education benefits”
                        (98). See also Frydl pp. 222–62.</note> Marriage had been grounds for dismissal
                before the war (Olson 606), but one of every five veterans arrived on campus with a spouse,
                and many of them had babies (Frydl 314), meaning that for the first time there
                were students on campus who, instead of being children, were themselves parents. In this
                way more than others, perhaps, the GI Bill helped to unsettle the seemingly natural
                equivalence between college and a specific period of life, “the adolescent years.” College
                came into its modern identity as a mechanism or social instrument potentially applicable
                to all age-groups—“the essential technology,” as Mark McGurl says, “for producing
                American egalitarianism through meritocratic class mobility” (61).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Findeisen counters that McGurl “misinterprets mass education
                    as a form of egalitarianism” (296) and refers to mass education as one of neoliberal
                    America’s most successful ideological tools: “During the past sixty years or so, the
                    higher-educational system has been one of America’s most effective technologies for
                    sustaining the ideology of equal opportunities, and it has done this by orchestrating
                    the myth of systemic inclusion” (294).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>With enrollments nearly eighty percent higher than at the start of the decade, there developed
                an “uncritical acceptance of largeness” (Olson 607) as a governing reality of higher education:
                overcrowded sections, longer teaching hours, expanded course offerings, towering dorms, and so
                forth (Frydl 316–18). The New Critics were alert to this aspect of modern mass education, and
                in their pedagogy they sought ways of containing or re-unifying its potentially disparate energies.
                In his 1938 essay <title level="a">The Teaching of Poetry,</title> Ransom had predicted that the
                radically non-historical approach of <title level="m">Understanding
                Poetry</title> would make the classroom a space for active critical assessment rather than for the
                passive reception of information—liberal-free rather than oratorical—changing the very
                nature of English instruction while bringing new texts into discussions long-dominated by classic
                ones (82–3). Ransom and his fellow Agrarians viewed lecture-style teaching as “a technique of
                mass-production” (Davidson 34), whereas <emph>criticism</emph>, instead, was conceived as the basis
                for active and inclusive “public discussion”:
                <quote>
                    The official Chaucer course is probably over
                    ninety-five percent historical and linguistic, and less than five percent
                    aesthetic or critical. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. But it is not
                    improved because the student has had to tie his tongue before it. It is an
                    artistic object, with a heroic human labor behind it, and on these terms it
                    calls for public discussion. The dialectical possibilities are limitless, and
                    when we begin to realize them we are engaged in criticism. (<title level="a">Criticism, Inc.</title>
                    102–3)
                </quote>
            The prevailing classroom approach, Ransom
                    implies, was coercive. The student must “tie his tongue” in a system of
                    instruction based on the entrenched authority of “dryasdust philology” (McGann
                    49) or professorial whimsy. Oratorical teaching was a form of discipline,
                    performed by “men who do little more than read well aloud, enforcing a private
                    act of appreciation upon the students” (99). Ransom’s antipathy to the existing
                    curricular order is crystalized by his comparison of the literature curriculum
                    to a previous generation’s idea of the art museum. “The professors so
                    engaged”—that is, the professors seeking to cultivate among students an
                    unthinking reverence for the status quo—“are properly curators,” he
                    provocatively argues, “and the museum of which they have the care is furnished
                    with the cherished literary masterpieces, just as another museum might be filled
                    with paintings” (100).</p>
                  <p>Yet his idealization of the seminar’s “public discussion” nonetheless drew on other
                forms of scholarly authority. As Bonnie Smith has shown in
                <title level="m">The Gender of History</title>, when the nineteenth-century concept and practice of the
                    History Seminar traveled from Europe to the United States, it conferred
                    scientific legitimacy on historical study (105–116; see also Mommsen 81–99 and
                    Turner 299–310). The Johns Hopkins professor Herbert Baxter Adams said that
                    seminars were like “laboratories where books are treated like mineralogical
                    specimens, passed about from hand to hand examined, and tested”; at Harvard,
                    Ephraim Everton claimed that the “scientific method” embedded in the seminary
                    structure “would transform knowledge” (qtd. in Smith 105, 106). The seminar was
                    egalitarian in concept, a “<foreign xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft</foreign>, a
                society, a club,” as Everton put it, “presided over by a professor, but
                    composed, not of subject students, but of members” (qtd. in Smith 107). It was
                    also a specifically masculine space, as Smith argues: “From the beginning, the
                    seminar member was considered a kind of participatory, universal citizen who was
                    implicitly gendered male and whose autonomy was shored up by the excluded and
                    dependent status of women” (113). Ransom’s liberal-free ideal of the
                    new-critical seminar was a similarly legitimizing concept, which coopted the
                    prestige and the manliness of historiography, as it merged (through the close
                    reading of individual poems) professional training and evidentiary
                pursuit.</p>
                  <p>This ideal of the seminar as an egalitarian space, dedicated to “public discussion”
                among mature participants, is one of the enduring legacies of the American New
                Criticism. But this even plane was hard to actualize, particularly given the
                knowledge hierarchy endemic to the academy. At LSU in the 1930s, Brooks tried to
                foster discussion by freely incorporating popular culture in his teaching, both
                to help him connect with students and to help students connect with the world of
                poetry. Teaching metaphor, for instance, he used cigarette ads to show how the girl
                in an advertisement bears a merely metaphorical relationship to the taste of the
                cigarette, a strategy designed (as he recalls) “to pry off the museum glass” from
                poems. Making poems more accessible, though, hardly erased his evident authority—if
                anything, it enhanced it. In the 1960s, under pressure to get more popular culture
                into later editions of <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>, in order to appeal
                more directly to the student market, Brooks and (Robert Penn) Warren set Cole Porter’s
                <title level="a">You’re the Top</title> alongside Cleopatra’s lament for Mark Antony.
                “Cole Porter is no Shakespeare,” Brooks clarified in his <title level="a">Instructor’s
                Manual</title>—addressed to teachers, not students—but the comparison between
                Tin Pan Alley lyricist and Renaissance poet would nonetheless helpfully “remind the student
                that interesting metaphor can be found outside the collected poems of a renowned author.”</p>
                  <p>It was a delicate balance to strike, between appealing to students’ sensibilities and preserving
                the centrality of the literary work. The seminary imperative required a certain give-and-take
                on the part of professors, a softening of some distinctions and a reinforcement of others, and
                this was an even more delicate matter when it came to the choreography of the discussion. The
                Keats scholar Jack Stillinger describes the challenges of his own early pedagogy. Stillinger,
                who entered college in the late 1940s and started teaching in the mid 1950s, recalls “posing
                Brooks-and-Warren-like questions” to his classes but finding dialogue almost impossible to
                sustain: “class ‘discussion’ inevitably turned into lecture,” he writes, and “the students
                didn’t seem to mind”: “when it came to class discussion—Ph.D. professor in the front
                of the room, face to face with freshman and sophomores who had hardly any experience of life
                or literature or even much knowledge of the English language—some individual readers
                were thought to be superior to some others” (Stillinger). Anyone who has facilitated a close
                reading among a group of students can probably identify with Stillinger’s struggle, and it
                could only have been harder at mid-century, when it was so novel a classroom approach that
                students were unprepared to play along. When Ransom joined the Vanderbilt faculty in 1914,
                the curriculum was organized entirely along historical lines: students were expected to
                remember “the names, titles, and facts of English literature” and “to memorize the five
                thousand or so lines that in the opinion of their instructor were most representative of
                their literary heritage.” Yet Ransom “almost immediately” began teaching in the mode that
                Brooks and Warren would later codify in <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>, and
                a Kenyon undergraduate in the 1950s recalled Ransom as “very nearly incapable of giving a
                formal lecture”: “The effect was one of complete formlessness, but, in retrospect, it all
                seems to have been done with a great deal of precision” (qtd. in Young 417).</p>
                  <p>The ability to straddle the line separating “formlessness” and “precision” was essential
                for teachers who brought collective close reading to the center of their classroom practice.
                Not everyone succeeded. Despite the mythology, New Critics were sometimes thought of as
                <emph>bad</emph> teachers: “the ‘new critics’ often talk over their students’ heads,”
                Robert Withington, a professor at Smith College, wrote in <title level="j">College
                English</title> in 1950; “The critic is, too often, not a teacher” (282). This was rivalry,
                in part—the pushback of the historicist lecturer for whom facilitating critical
                discussion did not count as “teaching”—but the praise lavished on certain New
                Critics nonetheless indicates that great teaching was neither easy to come by nor often found.</p>
                  <p>One iconic new-critical pedagogue, Austin Warren, excelled by negotiating so adeptly the
                conflicting demands of class discussion. Though he is best known for co-authoring
                <title level="m">Theory of Literature</title> with his Iowa colleague Renê Wellek,
                Warren took special pride (and found his deepest sustenance) in teaching. His
                new-critical style is Keatsian, predicated on empathy and an almost novelistic
                ability to inhabit other voices: reluctant “to argue for a position put forward
                as my own,” he sought instead “to exposit sympathetically the view of the author
                whose text was before us, or to articulate for an inarticulate student what I
                divined his own views to be” (<title level="a">In Search</title> 25). Myron Simon,
                a longtime UC Irvine professor who took Warren’s undergraduate American literature
                survey at Michigan in 1948, recalled how the teacher “promptly disturbed the mild
                air of the lecture room” with his care for “rebel voices” (118), seeking “to build
                a community in the classroom by making the relation between teacher and student a
                reciprocal one” (125–26). Yet Warren’s explicit deferral of authority was shadowed
                by an awareness of his power. He reflected that, in ceding authority to students by
                placing their arguments at the center of discussion, he still could call on “the
                seductive powers of a teacher’s personality and voice” (<title level="a">In Search</title>
                25). In a short tract on teaching which he contributed to <title level="j">PMLA</title>
                in 1955 (which he believed to be the very first pedagogical piece ever to appear in that
                journal), he wrote that “intellectual honesty” demanded “that the teacher shall not
                limit himself to asking the students: ‘what do <emph>you</emph> think?’,” adding:
                “Empathy is next to essential, but it is dangerous also.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                  <p>Brooks’s own, famously agile teaching was distinguished by the ability to manage these contradictions
                of the new-critical style. His reputation as an exemplary choreographer of discussion preceded him
                when he moved from LSU to Yale in the late 1940s. A comic poem published in
                <title level="j">The Yale Record</title>, <title level="a">Mistah Brooks – he here,</title>
                commemorated his arrival in New Haven by detailing how “carefully, intimately” he performed his role as a
                    close reader at the head of the classroom:

            What stands out here is the way the
                    student-writer portrays Brooks’s careful calibration of professorial authority.
                    As a teacher he meticulously stages a nearly invisible authority, the appearance
                    of reciprocity masking the fact that authority moves in one direction only: “He
                    suggests”; “And they listen”; “And they understand.” Whereas Stillinger in the
                    1950s—and many of us still today—struggled with the contradictory demands of the
                    student-oriented classroom, Brooks displays an agility that would be unique in
                    any case, but which is especially striking for the 1940s, when “straightaway
                    lecturing” was the norm (Stewart 107).</p>
                  <p>Brooks no doubt would have felt the
                    difference between teaching at a large land-grant institution and at an elite
                    private university, no matter how much the GI Bill unsettled the cozy
                    homogeneity of the seminar room after the war. His students in Louisiana would
                    mostly have arrived at college with the expectation of learning a trade; the
                    older pedagogical model in which pedantic professors dispensed facts about
                    literature would not have roiled their expectations in the least. At Yale,
                    though, students mostly hailed from New England boarding schools, and Brooks
                    would have met there with a confident and cliquish sense of privilege that made
                    student participation both easier to come by and more crucial to keep in check.
                    While the diminished stress on learnedness contributed to leveling the relations
                    between professor and student, we should not overstate the degree to which close
                    reading superseded context in Brooks’s classes. Brooks took a pragmatically
                    eclectic approach to teaching. Former students have remarked on his inclusive,
                    outside-in classroom approach, by which he framed the work of close reading by
                    always beginning with historical and biographical details external to the text.
                    Susan Wolfson writes, citing the Shakespearean Lawrence Danson (a former student
                    of Brooks), that in graduate seminars “the first half of the term was spent
                    reading historical background, biography, and literary history, the second half
                    reading the poetry. While the curriculum was not dialectical, it was also not
                    exclusionary.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wolfson,
                            <title level="m">Formal Charges</title>, p. 239, n.14.</note> This feature of Brooks’s
                teaching method is confirmed by the many typed-out lectures preserved among his papers, which
                regularly intersperse historical and biographical information with occasional close readings.
                In guiding students through poems, as Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernan have recently shown,
                he “works to make his classroom as self-contained as good poems should be and guards against
                a referentiality that would connect his classroom to the world in nonfigural ways.” But he
                also freely brings biographical and cultural contexts to bear when they can be of assistance,
                and rather than belabor the “unity” of individual poems, he more often attends to the images,
                metaphors, and diction of individual passages read in isolation, often in an appreciative mode.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For further details on Brooks’s teaching style, see Buurma and
                    Heffernan’s alert reading, pp. 120–21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Still, if Brooks was more permissive of historical study in his teaching than he lets on in
                his criticism, among undergraduates—who could compare his approach with traditional,
                historical professors—he seemed downright revolutionary. In the
                <title level="j">Yale Course Critique</title> of 1963 a student publication, a review of his
                course on <title level="a">Contemporary Poetic Theory and Practice</title> praised his “informal
                approach” in the classroom as a consequence of his formal approach to poems:
                <quote>
                    Few students take notes. Aesthetic analysis
                    in the manner of the New Critics is stressed while the historical, sociological,
                    and psychological aspects are necessarily de-emphasized. A great deal of
                    personal interest and initiative are necessary for the student to gain from the
                    informal approach since Mr. Brooks emphatically does not ‘spoon-feed’ his
                    students with factual information about the modern poets. (<title level="a">English 71</title> 28)
                </quote>
            Transcripts of this same class, preserved in
                    Yale’s Beinecke Library, confirm this informality. At one point, when one of the
                    students is trying to describe his boredom at Archibald Macleish’s insistence on
                    illustrating every one of his poetic statements, the transcriber inserts a
                    stage-direction: “as opens eye with a thumb.” This moment (the student
                    gesturally describing his boredom) shows how easy Brooks’s students felt in
                    class; they did not always passively follow him and apparently felt comfortable
                    engaging with him in spite of his professorial mastery. Brooks, for his part,
                    handles the moment with characteristic complaisance: “Quite right. I don’t think
                    we have any basic disagreement here.” Students continue to break in on the
                    lecture with questions and comments, and he seamlessly merges each of their
                    points into his flow. Analogous to his work with poems, Brooks’s unifying
                    impulse transforms haphazard classroom repartee into the coherent discussion of
                    a community bonded by his almost imperceptible guidance.</p>

                  <head>III. ‘The poem is to be read’: The Critic’s Role</head>
                  <p>“Brooks the critic emerged from Brooks the pedagogue,” Jewel Spears Brooker appreciatively
                wrote in a 1995 review of his final, posthumous essays (131). But it works the other way
                around, for Brooks, as well. The critic <emph>is</emph> a pedagogue, whose prose models
                the work of teaching and thematizes the teacher’s orchestration of a reading undertaken
                by many people at once.</p>
                  <p>The gently wielded authority of the pedagogue and expert close reader features in Brooks’s
                essay on Keats’s <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title> a landmark in the history
                of romantic criticism and his signature study “in the structure of poetry.” First published
                in the 1944 <title level="j">Sewanee Review</title> as <title level="a">History without
                    Footnotes: An Account of Keats’s Ode,</title> the piece reappeared as chapter 7 of
                    <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>, title slightly modified: <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History without Footnotes.</title> (In both titles,
                    Brooks playfully linked the essay’s
                    lone footnote to that word.) In it, Brooks answers the criticisms of T. S.
                    Eliot, John Middleton Murry, and H. W. Garrod, by accounting for the speech of
                    the urn at the poem’s conclusion, what Eliot had called “a serious blemish on a
                    beautiful poem.” Brooks observes that “some critics have felt that the
                    unravished bride protests too much,” and he catalogs the complaints, noting that
                    the lines have been cast as “an intrusion on the poem,” as a descent into
                    messaging that “injures the poem” because it “does not grow out of it”
                    organically (89–90).<note place="foot" resp="author"> I cite parenthetically from
                    the initial printing in the <title level="j">Sewanee Review</title>.</note> This
                language of violation and injury was part of the new-critical playbook. Allen Tate
                called the last stanza “an illicit commentary” and a “radical violation” (<title level="a">Reading</title> 195–6), and Earl Wasserman later observed that New Critics
                tended to figure the crossing from one disciplinary mode or discourse into another as
                a sexual “transgression,” with the act of “reaching outside the text for information”
                akin to straying beyond the marital bond between text and reader. “Most explicators
                are sensible men,” Wasserman writes, who “wish the work of art were so self-sufficient
                it could not tempt them to sin” (3).</p>
                  <p>This question of formal “violation” is
                    precisely what Brooks claims as his special interest in the ode. It is “as neat
                    an instance as one could wish” (92) of “the problem of belief” (90), as I. A.
                    Richards termed the relation between a poem’s aesthetic quality and the verity
                    of its assertions. Exploring this instance, Brooks recasts the urn’s speech as a
                    problem not of content (the closing statement’s “truth or falsity”) but of
                    context (whether the statement “was properly prepared for”). “The very ambiguity
                    of the statement, ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’ ought to warn us against
                    insisting very much on the statement in isolation,” he argues, “and to drive us
                    back to a consideration of the context in which the statement is set” (90). The
                    poem’s most celebrated lines, in other words, should matter less than the
                    structure in which they appear. Brooks thus pursues his account of Keats’s ode
                    as what he calls a “test”—an endeavor to see whether those lines are indeed a
                    “blemish,” or whether they are “dramatically appropriate” (91).</p>
                  <p>Brooks begins his essay by casting
                aside extra-poetic materials (“Keats’ reading, his conversation, his letters”),
                leaving a reader face-to-face with the poem itself (91). The effect is both
                personalizing and de-personalizing. On the one hand, the reader is enfranchised to
                make judgments; on the other hand, those judgments are to be based on an empirical
                procedure. Accordingly, Brooks relinquishes his own speaking “I,” writing in the
                passive voice: “The poem is to be read in order to see whether the last lines of the
                poem are not, after all, dramatically prepared for” (92). What Brooks calls “the
                paradox of the speaking urn” (100)—the notion, quoting Archibald Macleish, that
                “poems should not mean / But be” (89)—morphs into a matching paradox, that of the
                speaking critic. Just as poems should avoid making direct statements, so critics
                should demonstrate like scientists. <emph>The poem is to be
                read.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>This distancing of the reader, however, is followed by a
                    minor crisis in the identity of that reader, who Brooks exhorts:
                    <quote>
                    Yet there are some claims to be made upon
                    the reader too, claims which he, for his part, will have to be prepared to
                    honor. He must not be allowed to dismiss the early characterizations of the urn
                    as merely so much vaguely beautiful description. He must not be too much
                    surprised if ‘mere decoration’ turns out to be meaningful symbolism—or if
                    ironies develop where he has been taught to expect only sensuous pictures. Most
                    of all, if the teasing riddle spoken finally by the urn is not to strike him as
                    bewildering break in tone, he must not be too much disturbed to have the element
                    of paradox latent in the poem emphasized, even in those parts of the poem which
                    have none of the energetic crackle of wit with which he usually associates
                    paradox. This is surely not too much to ask of the reader—namely to assume that
                    Keats meant what he said and that he chose his words with care. (92)
                    </quote>
            While there’s some risk in
                over-reading Brooks’s characteristically qualified idiom, it is not at all clear
                just who this “reader” is—whether Brooks is describing, in the third-person,
                <emph>his own task</emph> in the essay, or whether he is simply
                dramatizing a reading-practice that he expects <emph>his readers</emph> to
                imitate. Helen Vendler writes that “lyric is a role offered to a reader” (181); for
                Brooks, <emph>criticism</emph> is a role offered to a reader, with
                detailed stage directions. The refrain “He must not be,” repeated three times,
                catalogs the trained responses to Keats’s ode that readers should resist. With the
                flatly ironic “This is surely not too much to ask,” Brooks admits that to pay strict
                attention to the words on the page is, in fact, a lot to ask for readers accustomed
                to seeking out messages or history. Even beyond these echoing <emph>musts</emph>, a
                subtle air of coercion haunts the essay’s vocabulary—readers are
                “<emph>forced</emph> to conclude” (90), or “<emph>forced</emph> to accept” (94)—suggesting that
                good close reading means repeatedly resisting one’s scholarly conditioning. This
                recurrent idiom of force suggests that it’s not the artwork that awaits ravishment
                by a reader, but readers who are always potentially ravished by conventional
                disciplinary practices. </p>
                  <p>Within <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian,</title> Brooks reveals his own coercive
                streak as an integral part of the drama of reading. For all his probity and care to anchor
                statements in the evidence supplied by the poem, he also has a penchant for drawing
                attention to those moments when probity fails him. A seemingly minor instance occurs
                early in the essay, when he somewhat misleadingly quotes from stanza five: “…the urn,
                like the ‘leaf-fring’d legend’ which it tells, is covered with emblems of the fields and
                forests: ‘Overwrought / With forest branches and the trodden weed’” (92). Is it the
                <emph>urn</emph> that is <emph>overwrought with natural emblems</emph>, as Brooks here
                suggests, or the <emph>maidens</emph> pictured on its side who are <emph>overwrought with
                emotion</emph>? We can read it either way; the ambiguity lies in the enjambment. This
                movement of poetry in time, the way its meanings shift with the turn of the line, is an
                important feature of a poem that in Brooks’s own account pits the nominal against the
                participial and verbal—“frozen, fixed, arrested” figures against “flesh-and-blood
                men and women,” a world “beyond time” against “our time-ridden minds” (99). But Brooks
                does not acknowledge this other way of reading “overwrought”; indeed by capitalizing the
                word he actively dismisses any other reading, giving the impression that the reference
                moves only forward. Can he have missed the ambiguity? It’s not likely—and later in
                the essay he quotes the very same passage from the other side: “…the rich, almost breathing
                world which the poet has conjured up for us contracts and hardens into the decorated motifs
                on the urn itself: ‘with brede / Of marble men and maidens over-wrought’” (99). Here
                “over-wrought”—now hyphenated, but neither capitalized nor enjambed—is presented
                (again unambiguously) as a postpositive adjective. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to
                catch Brooks out in a bit of expository duplicity, or to suggest a lack of care for words
                that Keats “chose … with care,” but simply to show how peculiar, even playful, his reading
                practice can be. It is possible that he’s making, or more properly <emph>dramatizing</emph>,
                a point, namely that poetic evidence is never entirely stable. The figure of
                    the “well wrought urn,” often misread as a figure for radically internalist
                    understandings of the autonomous aesthetic object, allows room for deviance. The
                    poet chooses his words with care—but so does the critic. The notion of an
                    impartial reader who dutifully extricates and explicates the truth of the text
                    itself is something of a fiction, and as much as we think of Brooks as a careful
                    reader always faithful to the text itself, here is a counter-instance in which
                    he proves liberal, careless, mischievous with the text (readers can decide which
                    it is). And, for an even more striking example of this, I turn in closing to
                    what I consider the essay’s strangest moment: when Brooks considers the “little
                    town” and “green altar” of stanza four.</p>

                  <head>IV. ‘A poignance beyond anything else’: Brooks’s Stranger</head>
                  <p>William Empson complained of
                Brooks’s “anti-emotional bias” (<title level="a">Darling</title> 697), but there is none of that in
                Brooks’s admiring consideration of stanza four. Drawn to its “poignance beyond
                anything else in the poem” (97–98), Brooks is especially taken with the way that the
                fancied town in this stanza embodies his notion of rural “communal life” (96), its
                “strange emptiness” implying a vanishing world whose culture was rural and organic,
                rather than urban and commercial. Though Keats “goes out of his way to leave us the
                widest possible option in locating” the town—“It may be a mountain town, or a river
                town, or a tiny seaport”—its “essential character” is clear enough to him:
                <quote>
                it is small, it is quiet, its people
                are knit together as an organic whole, and on a ‘pious morn’ such as this, its whole
                population has turned out to take part in the ritual…. [T]here is the suggestion
                that the little town is caught in a curve of the seashore, or nestled in a fold of
                the mountains—at any rate, is something secluded and something naturally related to
                its terrain. (97)
                </quote>
                Brooks’s description of this
                notional town, whose “people are knit together as an organic whole,” brings to mind
                the fading agricultural communities of the deep South, which the Agrarian polemics
                of <title level="m">I’ll Take My Stand</title> (1930) had idealized. He once argued
                that <title level="m">Light in August</title> could not survive a transplant “to the
                east side of Manhattan Island” because “community, in Faulkner’s sense, does not
                exist” there (<title level="a">Southern</title> 250). But it exists here in stanza four.</p>
                  <p> Something quietly troubles Brooks
                about this stanza, though, and in an odd parenthesis, he admits to being puzzled by
                one of its lines, the line addressed to the abandoned town: “and not a soul to tell
                / Why thou art desolate, can ere return.” He solves his confusion by devising an
                anonymous stranger, a future visitor who has stumbled into the abandoned town, to
                stand in as the object of the line’s address: “(I can see no other interpretation of
                the line, ‘and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate can ere return’)” (98).
                William Empson would solve it differently, paraphrasing the line, instead, as
                addressed to the members of the procession: “none of them will ever go home again,
                so that their town will be mysteriously desolate” (<title level="m">Structure</title>
                369). Oddly, neither of these exemplary close readers, Brooks nor Empson, can abide
                an apostrophe to a merely hypothetical, empty locale; both are compelled to read the
                address as directed to <emph>somebody</emph>. But Brooks, unlike Empson,
                invents his human addressee, casually inserting the stray detail of this “stranger”
                into the poem:
                <quote>
                The little town which has been
                merely implied by the procession portrayed on the urn is endowed with a poignance
                beyond anything else in the poem. Its streets will ‘for evermore be silent,’ its
                desolation forever shrouded in a mystery. <emph>No one in the figured
                    procession will ever be able to go back to the town to break the silence there,
                    not even one to tell the stranger there why the town remains desolate.</emph>
                (97–98; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                Who is “the stranger there,” and
                where did he come from? However one reads the ode, <emph>there is no
                stranger there</emph>. Practically winking at his reader, Brooks adds: “If one
                attends closely to what Keats is doing here, he may easily come to feel that the
                poet is indulging himself in an ingenious fancy” (98).</p>
                  <p> Of course it is the critic
                “indulging himself in an ingenious fancy,” inventing a human figure who mediates the
                affect, the “poignance,” of the town for the community of readers attending closely
                to Keats’s poem:
                <quote>
                The poet, by pretending to take the
                town as real—so real that he can imagine the effect of its silent streets upon the
                stranger who chances to come into it—has suggested in the most powerful way that he
                can its essential reality for him—<emph>and for us</emph>. It is a case of
                the doctor’s taking his own medicine: the poet is prepared to stand by the illusion
                of his own making. (101; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                Analysis has brought Brooks so far
                into the poem’s world, has made him so alive to its conjurings, that he and his
                fellow readers (now generously included in the consensual “us”) encounter this
                enigmatic wanderer on the little town’s silent streets as a real being, and enter
                into a “mythic history” of this fictional town that he calls “richer and more
                interesting than the history of actual cities” (98). Why does Brooks insert this
                stranger, an “illusion of his own making” (101)? Why insist on a human recipient of
                the speaker’s address, a human witness to the town’s poignancy, a human wonderer at
                its incomprehensible emptiness? Might the stranger be a figure for Brooks
                himself—the professional critic gazing longingly upon the Agrarian origins that he
                has since abandoned on the procession toward the green institutional altars of
                academe?</p>
                  <p> Ruminating on this stranger’s
                presence can help us to understand why Keats’s Ode suits Brooks’s purpose in
                <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>. The poem may represent a free-standing
                aesthetic artifact, but this is finally less significant than the fact that it
                represents a <emph>reader</emph>, interrogating the urn to make human
                sense of it (see Wolfson 301–5, 317–28). By inventing this stranger, Brooks
                effectively duplicates the dramatic tableau of the poem as a whole. The stranger in
                an abandoned town—like the questioner of the urn and like the reader of the
                poem—wonders at a past that he cannot begin to comprehend. Moreover, that act of
                reading calls into existence a small community of <emph>other
                readers</emph>, who attend all at once to the same thing—to the urn, the pictures
                on its surface, and the conjurings beyond it. By becoming one of those readers
                ourselves, reading Brooks reading, we join this quasi-organic community. </p>
                  <p> It is a dynamic that, for Brooks,
                bears a clear moral and social value. This is evident in his affection for the
                imaginary town as the lost site of a genuinely popular form of art. There are two
                ways of thinking about popular art: as an art of the people, which organically
                expresses the will of the community from which it emanates (this is the idealized
                sense of a socialist art that is so well-integrated into society that one ceases
                even to recognize it as art); and as an art that is artificially popularized by
                modern means (this is the vitiated sense of mainstream media and consumable mass
                entertainment). Brooks might accept that a genuinely and organically popular form of
                culture is no longer possible in a modern world, but he locates in close, collective
                reading an antidote to the enervating and commercial versions of popular culture. By
                turning Keats’s imaginary town into a version of the Southern agricultural idyll, he
                also reminds us of something that’s easy to forget in our disciplinary histories:
                that the Agrarian ethos that helped give rise to close reading lingers on in the
                nostalgic practices of modern literary studies, as a residual affect of that
                original ethos.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>V. ‘Distrust is healthy’: A Community of Readers</head>
                  <p> In its idealized recuperation of
                this communal rapport, Brooks’s “agrarian anticapitalism”—Frederic Jameson’s phrase
                for “the early New Criticism” (374)—departs from the aestheticist anticapitalism of
                an avant-gardist like Adorno, for whom the purposelessness of the artwork is
                precisely its parody of means-end capitalism. As Adorno writes in his late
                fragmentary work, <title level="m">Aesthetic Theory</title>, the displacement of the
                artwork from its native soil allows for a salutary destruction of its
                meaningfulness. It falls “helplessly mute before the question ‘What’s it for?’”; its
                significance is its insignificance (121). For Adorno, it is when art is most visibly
                estranged from the social, paradoxically, that society most powerfully exerts
                itself. Brooks, on the other hand, evinces discomfort with “the strange emptiness of
                the little town,” insisting instead on a human “stranger” to serve as recipient for
                the poem’s apostrophe and as stand-in for the community of readers engaged with the
                poem. Where Adorno would argue that “only what exists for its own sake, without
                regard to those it is supposed to please, can fulfill its human end” (<title level="a">Valéry</title> 181),
                Brooksian analysis valorizes that human end. The “masochistic” project of
                “autonomous art,” Sianne Ngai argues in an essay on Adorno, is “an incessant,
                guilt-ridden meditation on its own social impotence” (843), but Brooks denies that
                impotence, viewing close reading as an activity imbued with social and moral value,
                in its potential for returning a less alienated relationship with the products of
                culture and, in an sense, with the community that those products stand in for.</p>
                  <p>In 1949, Brooks went on a New Haven
                radio program, <title level="m">Yale Interprets the News</title>, to discuss “the
                difficulty of teaching literature to persons preoccupied by such mass information
                media as the movies.” He explained afterwards to a reporter: “Small wonder that the
                student sometimes feels that Shakespeare is dry and that modern poetry is
                incomprehensible—remember that he is unconsciously measuring both by popular
                entertainment” (<title level="a">Brooks Warns of Jeopardy to Education</title>). Such moments, in which
                Brooks registers a cultural polemical against popular consumer culture, are among
                the loudest notes in his corpus, and they speak to his deeply felt sense that
                something substantial was at stake in the direction of literary studies and the
                practice of close reading. They are hardly representative, however, of a critic
                whose main labors were the intensive and often playful analysis of literary texts,
                and the genial modeling of such analysis in the literature classroom. By the 1950s
                Brooks could jokingly refer to himself as “the monster” when introducing himself to
                a new group of students, aware of the distance between his radical reputation and
                genial demeanor:
                <quote>
            “I want to warn you, you’re in the hands of the monster now.” These words, delivered in
            the gentlest of border-state accents, were the first I ever heard Cleanth Brooks utter.
            The year was 1951, the setting was a Yale College classroom. I was a junior, and this
            was the opening session of Brooks’s class in modern poetry. (Gollin 257)
                </quote>
            This habit of self-deprecation belies the image of the cultural radical spearheading
                    a conservative revolution, while also indicating that the real revolution was
                    taking place more quietly, not in inflammatory claims about the dangers of
                    popular culture, but in the day-to-day work of a reading practice that was
                    simultaneously public and private.</p>
                  <p>	We learn more about Brooks, and more about new-critical cultural politics in general,
                by carefully attending to this great bulk of his professional output. Brooks’s practice
                as a close reader is more complex than its reputation suggests; indeed as we have seen,
                it is sometimes downright bemusing, though to trace that bemusement can lead us quite
                unexpectedly to the center of his thought. By reading Brooks reading, we learn how to
                read some of his more extreme judgments as forays into the sensational and too-loud world
                of public language—necessary advertising for a reticent practice. And we might at
                the same time ponder the paradox at the end of <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian,</title>
                where he presents to readers (by this point a communal “we” encompassing teacher, student,
                and colleague), as the poem’s ultimate assertion, a “healthy” skepticism toward the
                free-standing statement—a “distrust” of the poem’s own words. He repeats the word four
                times in his essay’s final three sentences, culminating in a statement that might itself tease
                us out of thought: “Such a distrust is healthy. Keats’ sylvan historian, who is not above teasing
                us, exhibits such a distrust, and perhaps the point of what the sylvan historian ‘says’ is to
                confirm us in our distrust” (101). The danger, it seems, is not that students might <emph>dislike</emph>
                poetry, that they might find Shakespeare “dry” or Eliot “incomprehensible,” but that they might
                <emph>trust it</emph>,
                    rather than training in themselves a healthy attitude of resistance—not just
                    toward poetry, but toward all of the claims that culture, in its disparate
                    forms, makes on us.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">How is the image of Keats “constellated,” as Walter Benjamin
                    might say, in the romanticisms of our contemporary popular culture? This essay
                    attempts to answer that question by exploring the “Keats effects” or what the
                    poet Frank O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the particular pulses of his poetic and
                    cultural charge, at the charged moment of his own popularity in and outside his
                    circle and as his poems and images have entered the currency of our own
                    contemporary cultural discourses, what biographers of Romantic poets like to
                    call our “popular imagination.” This essay pursues two discursive strains of the
                    Keats effects: on the one hand, the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider
                    and outsized Cockney ambitions, restless experimentation with revered and
                    popular forms, artistic and poetic allusions, complete with devoted fans and
                    fiercely reactionary enemies; and on the other hand, the indelible and affecting
                    record of personal pathos, the doomed poet whose fragile beauty is inseparable
                    from the poems themselves, their making, their reception, and the fate of their
                    maker. I consider how both of these Keats effects posit modes of impossibility
                    that remain impossibly beautiful. </p>

                  <head>I. Two Images</head>
                  <p>I begin with two charged examples of the Keats effects. The first, an image of
                    Keats in one of the last poems Frank O’Hara composed before he was killed by a
                    dune-buggy on Fire Island in the summer of 1966. It’s an eleven-line poem called
                    <title level="a">Again, John Keats, Or the Pot of Basil</title> which arrives at a Keatsian impasse:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>I have a pot of basil a friend gave</l>
                           <l>me and am reading Keats and realize</l>
                           <l>that everything is impossible in a different way</l>
                           <l rendition="#indent2">(<title level="m">Collected
                                Poems</title> 471–72, lines 7–10)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
                    The gift of the basil from an unspecified
                    friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats that results in the poem’s central
                    event, a “realization” which offers no vision into the future, no way beyond the
                    impasse. I want to understand this last line, one arrived at by reading Keats
                    again: how is everything impossible <emph>but</emph> in a different
                    way? What does this revised impossibility mean for Keats and his historical
                    currency?</p>
                  <p> For the second version of the Keats effects, I invoke the famous penciled image
                    Keats’s friend and companion Joseph Severn drew of the poet during a
                    long-suffering night in Rome in the weeks before his death: “Keats on his
                    death-bed,” an image that quickly became an icon of the passion of the poet,
                    that failing “lunger,” who knew long before the fact that “his name was writ in
                    water.” In Severn’s picture, Keats’s head rests on a pillow and in bed clothes
                    more suggested than drawn. More prominently, the artist has penciled two
                    concentric cones, a light exterior and dark interior cone which serve as contrast
                    to the three-quarter image of the sleeping poet. Thus does Severn, drawing this
                    picture at 3am to “keep awake,” have the face of Keats propped directly against
                    a figured oblivion, his own impossibility.

                  </p>
                  <p> Neither item is likely to be what first comes to mind for the topic of “Keats
                    in Popular Culture.” Neither was composed by the poet; and neither would seem to
                    belong to what in the most restricted sense we presently call “popular culture.”
                    But the rubric is capacious enough to invite many permutations of the topic. I
                    hope to demonstrate that both of these tokens are examples of Keats’s “currency”
                    for popular Anglo-American culture, more expansively construed. What interests
                    me here are the “Keats effects,” what O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the particular
                    pulses of his poetic and cultural charge, at the charged moment of his
                    “popularity” in and outside his “circle” and as his poems and images have
                    entered the currency of our own contemporary cultural discourses, what
                    biographers of Romantic poets like to call our “popular imagination.” While I’ll
                    be making some direct references to Keats’s poetry in our contemporary culture,
                    I’m more interested in two discursive strains of the Keats effects. On the one
                    hand, there is the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider and outsized
                    Cockney ambitions, restless experimentation with revered and popular forms,
                    artistic and poetic allusions, complete with devoted fans and fiercely
                    reactionary enemies. On the other hand, there’s the indelible and affecting
                    record of personal pathos, the doomed poet whose beauty—fragile and fractured—is
                    inseparable from the poems themselves, their making, their reception, and the
                    fate of their maker. We all know this image, and we know it <emph>as
                    image</emph> more than story or fact, an image Karen
                    Swann describes as the “beautiful dreamer” who “lives a posthumous life, beyond
                    life and death, but transcending neither” (<title level="a">
                        <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    Dreamers</title> 21). I want to consider how both of these Keats effects posit modes of
                    impossibility that remain impossibly beautiful. </p>

                  <head>II. Romantic Constellations, Pop Cultural Effects</head>
                  <p>The conceptual model I take for my thinking about the relationship between Keats
                    and contemporary popular culture is Walter Benjamin’s poetics of history,
                    especially the <title level="a">Theses on the Concept of History</title> and his earlier scattered
                    methodological formulations in <title level="m">The Arcades Project</title>.
                    Turning to Benjamin means dispensing with the themes that drive most narratives
                    of literary or cultural history—tradition, influence, progression—and learning
                    instead to attend to the historical “constellations” between Romanticism and the
                    contemporary and to measure the specific charge of the “Keats effect” in the
                    images and dispositions of contemporary popular culture. Elsewhere,
                    Jacques Khalip and I have invoked Benjamin to suggest
                    that Romanticism offers <emph>images</emph> of itself to the future
                    which may be reclaimed or, as Benjamin puts it, redeemed in a present, including
                    the present of our contemporary popular culture. Benjamin describes this
                    fortuitous convergence of past and present as a constellation
                    (<title level="m">Konstellation</title>). Like the arrangements of stars in the night, these
                    constellations are shifting and contingent, and they offer no promise of
                    alignment. Therefore, the dispositions of Romantic constellations are by no
                    means uniform, especially in what we have come to call popular culture. My
                    project here, as in my collaboration with Khalip, is to find a way to “grasp the
                    constellation” into which our “own era has formed with a definite earlier one,”
                    in this case the era we designate as Romantic (<title level="a">Present Darkness</title> 1). For
                    Benjamin, “the constellation as <emph>image</emph> serves less as the
                    temporal measure of the difference between the past and the present (and, as a
                    consequence, their seemingly inextricable relationship), and more as a structure
                    for interpreting the ‘now’ as the event of a seizure, a grasping of the past as
                    if for an emergent intelligibility,” something that occurs,
                    often inconspicuously, in a contemporary poem or a song or a film (<title level="a">Concept of
                    History</title> 397). Benjamin understood that each work of art—any document of
                    culture, popular or otherwise—might be “redeemed” or “cashed in” through the
                    constellations that materialize between past and present and crystallize in an
                    image such as those that populate our poems, paintings, or pop songs. We look
                    “with awaken’d eyes”—as Keats says of himself as he sees “his Psyche true”—for a
                    sight to behold and to which we become beholden. For Benjamin, the past makes
                    itself available as “true images” that single out their beholders who may be
                    separated from that past by hundreds and even “thousands of years” (<title level="a">Concept of
                    History</title> 397). These “images flash at the moment of their recognizability,” or
                    as in the idiom of Shelley’s <title level="m">Adonais</title>—itself profoundly
                    charged with the Keats effect that it is also generating—as “incarnations of the
                    stars, when splendour / Is changed to a fragrance” and descends to earth (lines
                    173­–74). Keats’s “splendours,” as Shelley calls them, are the images that
                    populate his poetry, both the images he made and the image he became, what made
                    him reviled and has made him adored. “It seems,” Frances Jeffrey famously says
                    of <title level="m">Endymion</title> only in order to dismiss it, “as if the
                    author had ventured everything that occurred to him in the shape of a glittering
                    image” (203).</p>
                  <p> What Jeffrey dismisses I want to redeem. What this means, methodologically
                    speaking, is attending to the appearances of these “glittering images,”
                    discerning their “shape” in order to attune oneself to their reconstellation in
                    the present as a distinctively Keatsian currency in the genres of popular
                    culture. In his own poetic thinking about the Keats effect, Shelley coined the
                    best name for this currency: a “transmitted effluence,” one which “outlives the
                    parent spark” (lines 407–8). If what Shelley writes is true, the distinctive
                    charge or “transmitted effluence” of particular texts or authors will prove to
                    have many distinctive permutations and prove to be far more varied than the
                    rubric of Romanticism often implies. This means something other than, say,
                    depictions of Romantic authors in our contemporary popular narratives, of which
                    the biopic is the default genre and Jane Campion’s 2009 film
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title> its most compelling example. But, however accomplished and
                    nuanced, the biopic is a dead-end genre, one not capable of accounting for the
                    ways in which the migratory effect of a writer’s work might well take its
                    impulse far beyond its own historical context and far beyond its medium of
                        origin.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I can be certain that there
                        are exceptions to this rule because I am aware of one: Derek Jarman’s
                        <title level="m">Caravaggio</title> (1986) which, despite certain explicit
                        anachronisms, conforms in the main to the narrative expectations of the
                        genre except at the decisive level of the shot where it often depicts a
                        <emph>transfer</emph> of images that activates the currencies
                        between the film and this most cinematic of painters. The best account of
                        this relationship is Leo Bersani and Ulysses Dutoit, <title level="m">Caravaggio</title>.
                        To my mind the most vitally true deployment of a
                        Romantic poet in Anglophone cinema is Jim Jarmusch’s <title level="m">Dead
                        Man</title> (1995) which features Johnny Depp as an accountant from
                        Cleveland named William Blake who travels west and “finds himself” in a
                        surreal Western. After being shot in the chest while in bed with Thel, Blake
                        is revived and taken on a trip by Nobody (“Exaybachay”), a Native American
                        without a tribe (played by Gary Farmer) who learned by heart the poetry of
                        this “dead man” in the “white men’s schools” in England. Over the course of
                        their travels further west, Blake “becomes” the poet, a “killer of white
                        men,” whose poetry is written with his gun. <title level="m">Dead Man</title>
                        is both visionary and revisionary, a “reconstellation” of the poetry of
                        Blake in the redeeming of the genre of the Western.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, there might be a distinctive “Byron Effect” or a “Blake Effect” (or, for
                    that matter, with a poet such as Southey, <emph>no effect</emph>, at
                    least in this moment of his “unrecognizability”) that inhabit and inform other
                    genres or media as well as the specifically Keastian effects I’m identifying
                    here. Not only are these effects potentially registered in any popular medium or
                    genre, their manifestations often make legible certain aspects of the “original”
                    which were yet to find their expressive medium. For instance, the “Mary Shelley
                    effect” seems exclusively cinematic in nature; and Mary’s account in 1831 of how
                    the story came into existence not only offers a paradigmatic version of the
                    “unbidden” Romantic imagination and its powers of self-origination, but in her
                    characterization of “the successive images that arose in [her] mind,” the “gift”
                    of a cinema “the usual bounds of reverie”: “When I placed my head on my pillow,
                    I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think,” she recounts, “my imagination,
                    unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in
                    my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw—with shut
                    eyes, but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling
                    beside the thing he had put together” (<title level="m">Frankenstein</title>
                        168).<note place="foot" resp="author"> The Mary Shelley effect operates
                        on an altogether different scale for popular culture, dwarfing in
                        consequence any of the effects we might discern from her contemporaries,
                        including her husband, father, and mother. Shelley’s novel deploys Milton’s
                        poetry to displace his version of the Adamic myth with the Frankenstein
                        creation myth as the popular cultural paradigm for creation. A subset of
                        that popular effect is the way in which the creature’s “subversive
                        eloquence” was one of the first and consistent casualties. In the first and
                        very popular stage adaptation of the novel in 1823—retitled as
                        <title level="m">Presumption, or The Fate of Frankenstein</title>—the creature
                        is rendered mute and has essentially remained that way on stage and screen
                        ever since. In a form of narrative arrested development, theatrical and
                        cinematic productions—the latter beginning with a silent film in 1910 in
                        Thomas Edison’s film studios—the creature remains the “wretch,” the
                        “miserable monster whom” Victor “beholds” at the moment of his “birth.” In
                        the countless versions of the story for stage and screen that have mined the
                        tale for its horror and its kitsch, the creature’s eloquence, his aesthetic
                        sensibilities, and his capacity for poetry have been muted into their
                        opposite, the “muttering” of “inarticulate sounds,” that not only drain the
                        story of the novel’s lyricism but avoid the more threatening undecidability
                        that attends to the creature: how can we not call this cyborg human if he is
                        “moulded” of our same “clay” or if he can express our deepest ethical
                        longings and aesthetic judgments, and turn his demands into a Miltonic prose
                        poem?</note> This famous bit of text not only tells the origin story of the
                    story of a new origin, it refers itself to a new narrative technology and two of
                    its genres that had yet to come into existence, the medium of film and the
                    cinematic genres of horror and of kitsch. </p>
                  <p> To sketch a wider range of reference, I turn briefly to two other versions of
                    this Romantic effectivity. Unlike the “Mary Shelley effect,” the pop cultural
                    effect I associate with Byron is not discernible in film as such but activates
                    the commencement of “celebrity culture” and circulates in certain influential
                    pop musical modes or poses. When, for example, Morrissey, lead singer for the
                    1980’s Manchester band The Smiths, opens the plaintive anthem <title level="a">How Soon is Now?</title>
                    to the iconic wails of Johnny Marr’s shimmering guitar with the following lines,
                    no one who has read Byron can miss the reference, intended or not, to
                    <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>:

                What at first sounds like an anthem triumphantly declaring that he’s “the sun and
                    the air” is undone by a homophonic pun (“son and heir”) and diminished further
                    by the slack lines that follow the declarations: “nothing in particular.” The
                    effect of these mock anthems is an affective irony that turns the song into the
                    pop melodrama that defines most every anthem by The Smiths or by
                    Morrissey.<note place="foot" resp="author"> While I believe that the pop cultural

                When we hear those lines and that particularly dead-pan irony, we don’t need to
                    see Morrissey sitting in his bath with a volume of Byron (as he does in the
                    video to <title level="a">Suedehead</title>) to feel the songs permeated by the poet, affectively and
                    tonally. Morrissey’s songs allow us to <emph>hear</emph> the campy

                        one of the most literate—and literary—of pop
                        singers, has been written about often and well, most notably by Morrissey
                        himself: <title level="m">Autobiography</title> chronicles the story of
                        Morrissey’s cultural education from the point of view of the streets of
                        Manchester, almost as much a literary as a musical education, though more
                        modernist (Housman, Auden) than Romantic in its engagements. Above all, it’s
                        Wilde. As he writes in <title level="a">Cemetery Gates,</title> “Keats and Yeats are on your side
                        and Wilde is on mine.” Musically, his points of departure are Bowie, of

                        among others. The book-length study most relevant to my discussion is Gavin

                  <p> If the first and most obvious example of the “Blake Effect” for the last half
                    century of North American popular culture that comes to mind will be The Doors,
                    only their name and the early song <title level="a">Break on Through</title> feel genuinely charged by
                    a Blakean energy or thematics. Without question, Patti Smith is the contemporary
                    artist most “plugged” into the Blake effect, formally, thematically, even
                    scholarly. From the eruptive event of 1975’s <title level="m">Horses</title> to the
                    present, Smith’s sung poetry and garage music embraced the full visionary mode
                    of Blake’s poetics, a unique “marriage” of Innocence (<title level="a">Wave</title>) and experience
                    (<title level="a">Horses</title>) with a religious ferocity (<title level="a">In Excelsis Deo</title>) and a transgressive
                    proto-punk ethos (<title level="a">Pissing in a River</title>). Not only does she sing Blake’s
                    “songs”—most notably <title level="a">The Tyger</title>—she has selected and introduced a popular
                    collection of his poems and speaks and writes on the poet who is as much her
                    muse as Genet, Rimbaud, or the Beat Poets. But for Morris Eaves, neither the
                    Doors nor Patti Smith represents a version of the Blake he “wants.” In an essay
                    called <title level="a">On Blakes We Want and Blakes We Don’t,</title> Eaves bemoans the very aspect of
                    the “Blake effect” that I seek: “Blake’s durability seems to depend partly on
                    his ready reproducibility in simple forms as a cultural marker—memorable
                    images to decorate dust jackets, startling proverbs to launch book chapters,
                    catchy phrases to name rock bands” (414). Eaves’s lament serves as an epigraph
                    to Mike Goode’s <title level="a">Blakespotting,</title> a brilliant and pathbreaking exploration of the
                    poetics of the Blake effect. Goode argues that Blake’s work circulated from the
                    outset as detached pieces and images—poems, pictures, proverbs—and that this
                    “detachability” is fundamental to Blake’s artistic project and its effectivity.
                        <note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="a">On the Currency of Images: Percy
                        Shelley’s Minor Cinema,</title> I explore the principle of the detachability of the
                        image in poetry and film. There I argue that the image’s “detachability”
                        makes it available as a historical and transmedial “current,” one which
                        “charges” a constellation between such unlikely texts as Shelley’s
                        <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> and Todd Haynes’s
                        <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>.</note> Blake’s deployment of the
                    proverb form and especially what Goode calls “the largely unmappable circulation
                    of his proverbs” generate an anonymous textual system that is characteristically
                    Blakean” (<title level="a">Blakespotting</title> 773). Ironically, proverbial anonymity is Blake’s
                    signature, the distinctive idiom of the “Blake effect.” For his methodological
                    point of reference to this mode of poetic historicity, Goode turns not to
                    Benjamin but to the “rhizomatics” of Deleuze and Guattari: “Blake, in his
                    transformation of the proverb genre, created a medium that is its own
                    heterogeneous message, and that message, like the ‘rhizomatic’ forms that Gilles
                    Deleuze and Felix Guattari celebrate, becomes senderless and receiverless over
                    time, directed toward everybody and by everyone” (775). </p>
                  <p> Over time many of Keats’s own phrases and formulations have also achieved the
                    status of the proverb; but the signature of their “sender” is far too
                    identifiable and too deeply marked with his poetic currency to produce the
                    “rhizomatics” that Goode persuasively locates in Blake’s poetic effect. For
                    Keats I discern two distinct but inextricable effects, something like the A-side
                    and B-side of a vinyl record. For the first of these effects, I borrow Peter
                    Szendy’s notion of “obstructive enthusiasm,” a term which I think characterizes
                    an important impulse in the poetry both early and late, not only the vexed
                    exuberances of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, but the excesses in the late
                    odes, for which the cascade of declared “happies” that get the speaker nowhere
                    in the third stanza of <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> can serve as an emblem. </p>
                  <p> The second Keats effect I call “the shrine of no prospects,” one which counts
                    Severn’s drawing as among its first collected items. I think this is the best
                    term for the aura of painful regret which shrouds the poet much like Severn’s
                    drawing and which connects him not only to that phenomenon of the singer dead
                    “before his time” but to an affective and figurative temporality in Keats’s
                    poems and letters that reappears—reconstellated—as the pop cultural image of
                    certain singer-songwriters, contemporary death-bound troubadours. The rhetorical
                    signature of this current of pop music is the Keatsian oxymoron in the affective
                    dimension—“pleasant pain,” “half in love with easeful death,” and so on—and the
                    plaintive and absorptive register of the poems, as if they were always composed
                    in the minor key. But the curious “time signature” of this effect generates
                    something other than straight melancholy. In this version of “the Keats effects,”
                    we find a pop image of something which, quite like the poet himself, is always
                    projective and already posthumous.</p>

                  <p>The historicist turn in Romantic studies has demonstrated that Keats
                    <emph>was</emph> in popular culture all along,
                    a vibrant urban culture of art and politics, sedition and experimentation,
                    famously derided in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> as “the Cockney School of
                    versification, morality, and politics” (qtd. in Roe 203).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Andrew Motion’s outstanding <title level="m">Keats</title>
                        is the first sustained biography to emphasize the depth of the poet’s
                        engagement with the radical, dissenting political culture of the
                        period.</note> We owe our understanding of this pop Keats to critics such as
                    Nicholas Roe, Jeffrey N. Cox, and others who have unearthed the ways in which
                    Keats was both indebted to and a principal contributor for what we would today
                    call an “alternative” or “counter-hegemonic” culture, one in which his poems
                    both originate and reiterate. Roe explains that the “Cockney” label was a
                    multiform epithet, one linked explicitly to the seditions of Leigh Hunt and to
                    the popular culture of “the London mob” and to the threat the urban experience
                    posed for the reactionary circle of <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, a threat
                    marked by class and gendered affect. Citing Samuel Johnson’s
                    <title level="m">Dictionary</title>, Roe notes that while “the leading sense of ‘Cockney’ is ‘a
                    native of London,’ its second definition of the word is ‘any effeminate, low
                    citizen’” (212). Thus does Keats belong to a particular poetic form of urban
                    effeminacy, the “lisping sedition” of “the affected school of our metropolitan
                    poets” (qtd. in Motion 523). The Cockney politics of Keats’s “metropolitan”
                    poetry is always marked with an erotic charge. Jeffrey Cox illustrates how the
                    erotic and even pornographic nature of this Cockney culture and the excesses of
                    its Catullan resonances—both explicit and elliptical—not only form the popular
                    historical context for Keats’s poems but inform their rhetorical and formal
                    textures: “If we fail to notice the density of the punning in the ode [on a
                    Grecian Urn], we lose a sense of the poem’s playfulness, of the experimental,
                    even quirky nature of Keats’s language . . . and of the Catullan and Cockney
                    delight in toying with what others considered serious in the name of a
                    linguistic and also finally an erotic delight” (620).<note place="foot" resp="author"> On Keats’s deep engagements with his own popular

                    this most auratic of Keats’s poems shot through with a sexual charge. It’s not
                    that Keats doesn’t love the art of the “Grecian Urn” or the Portland Vase; it’s
                    that with his “human breathing passion,” he loves it <emph>too
                    much</emph>. Once we feel his desire for knowledge of the urn become erotic,
                    we see how the poem participates in a subterranean pop cultural eroticism that
                    veers to the pornographic, precisely like the urn itself: “a pornographic text
                    offers the identical pleasure over and over again,” writes Cox, adding, “every
                    time we read Keats’s urn we will see the same love ‘ever warm and still to be
                    enjoyed’” (625).<note place="foot" resp="author">  On the relationship
                        between the pornography and the “popular culture” of the period, see
                        Bradford K. Mudge, <title level="a">Romanticism, Materialism, and the Origins of Modern
                        Pornography</title>: “Late Romantic ‘pornography,’ even that which originated in
                        ancient Greece and Rome, was asked to assume subterranean accommodations in
                        the cultural scheme of things…. Certain kinds of obscenity flourished during
                        the period in enlightened and self-conscious opposition to both the
                        philosophical assumptions and institutional practices of elite culture”
                        (25).</note> The result of Cox’s reading is not so much to resituate Keats’s
                    poetry in the context of popular discourses of classical and Cockney eroticism
                    as to reinject these ostensibly “timeless” poems with what Benjamin calls the
                    anachronistic “now-time” (<foreign xml:lang="de">Jetzeit</foreign>) of their own popular
                    culture. In this charged moment of British cultural politics, the status of
                    Keats’s poems could shift in an instant from what Cox describes as “a coterie
                    favorite” to “that of a target of the Cockney School attacks” (616); and Keats’s
                    aspirations of high literary art reduced to the parody of a gross popular
                    culture and, as in the words of the <title level="j">British Critic</title>, “the
                    gross slang of voluptuousness” committed by “the meanest and filthiest” of
                    “Cockney poetasters” (249). </p>
                  <p> As hateful and reactionary as these attacks were, I count myself as one who
                    prefers the Keats of the urban gutter to the Keats of the British Museum,
                    <emph>until</emph> we reach the precious point at which those two
                    versions of the poet become indistinguishable. This is the sweet spot often
                    crystallized in Keats at which the most auratic of objects are simultaneously
                    objects of explicit erotic desire, the sexual and popular “undersong” of the
                    ode’s elevated lyric address. This is how Simon Jarvis teaches us to read
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>, by carefully excavating Keats’s “undersong” in
                    that poem, one which recognizes that the poet’s “ceaseless work on verse
                    language, the invention of a verse repertoire every bit as consequential for
                    nineteenth-century English poetry as Wordsworth’s” is also inseparable from its
                    “systematic assault on taste” (<title level="a">Undersong</title> 147). For Jarvis,
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s “own grandeur,” one both fine and dirty, “looks forward” to
                    “Picasso’s <title level="m">Vollard Suite</title>” or to Frank O’Hara’s <title level="a">Ode on
                    St. Cecelia’s Day.</title> In this way Jarvis discerns a scandalizing pop-cultural
                    current—what he calls “a partial countertradition”—that runs from Keats’s
                    (early) <title level="m">Endymion</title> through (early) Wallace Stevens and is
                    plugged in to the O’Hara of this (again, early) ode. O’Hara acknowledges the
                    saint’s day by doing precisely what Keats would have done: run as far as
                    possible from Pope’s famous ode commemorating St. Cecilia’s Day. O’Hara’s poem,
                    which Jarvis invokes without a gloss, is more a Keatsian hymn to Pan than a
                    celebration of “impoverished Cecilia”:

                Ultimately the poem is addressed not to St. Cecila or to Pan but to “the rest of
                    us,” those who like Pan, like Keats, like O’Hara, “play and are played / seeking
                    … the pattern of our true desire.” In Jarvis’s reading, the “countertradition”
                    initiated by Keats’s “masterpiece” and its “deep thicket of new verse rhythms,
                    textures, sentences, techniques” arrives smack in the middle of a brief
                    quotation from O’Hara’s brilliant mock manifesto, <title level="a">Personism</title>:

                    For Jarvis the literary “counter tradition” that leads from Keats to O’Hara—what
                    I am calling its Romantic currency—gives up the “lofty ideas” once they are
                    lofty enough for the refreshments to arrive and for the pleasures to begin for
                    real. It is “the line of reviled virtuosity and of dandyism in deadly earnest”
                    (163); and we should be clear that this “line” or trajectory of “Keatsness” is
                    queer in <emph>effect</emph> if not in origin, what Khalip has in a
                    different context called “tacitly queer” (<title level="m">Last
                        Things</title>).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Khalip’s book
                        constitutes a decisive and ongoing engagement with the queerness and
                        “lastness” of Romanticism, including a compelling account of the “tacit”
                        queerness of Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (74–91).
                        By now, the queering of Keats should be
                        beyond dispute. The issue of <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net
                        </title> edited by Michael O’Rourke and David Collings features important
                        essays—and an excellent introduction by O’Rourke and Collings—which address
                        the queer or “proto-queer” aspect of Romantic discourse. On the queering of
                        Keats, see in particular Caroline E. Kimberly, <title level="a">Effeminacy, Masculinity, and
                        Homosocial Bonds: The (Un)Intentional Queering of John Keats.</title> On this

                        for any scholar pursuing this queer strain in Romanticism, we are indebted
                        to Andrew Elfenbein’s <title level="m">Romantic Genius: The Prehistory of a
                        Homosexual Role</title>. While completing my essay, I came across Eric
                        Eisner’s brilliant <title level="a">Drag Keats: Mark Doty’s Cockney Poetics</title> and felt
                        confirmed in the direction of my argument. Eisner invokes Keats’s Cockney
                        currency as a way of reading Doty’s poetry and its special debts to Keatsian
                        glitter and excess. As Eisner puts it, Doty’s “Keats is in fact a Cockney
                        Keats, and … Doty’s queer poetics of excess—its campiness, its glitter,
                        even its ostentatious derivativeness—can be understood as a kind of
                        Cockney poetics,” with “Keats [as] … the signal poet of the simulated,
                        impure, and over-the-top” (388).</note> This particular current of the
                    “Keats effect”—the one that leads us from <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    “glittering images” to O’Hara’s popular cultures—I call “obstructive
                    enthusiasm.”</p>

                  <p>“The ‘Cockney’ poem and its scandalized responses,” says Swann, “produced the
                    Keats that even cool modernism came to love” (21). Perhaps none cooler than
                    O’Hara, urban lyric poet in the era of Abstract Expressionism, Billie Holiday,
                    and James Dean. O’Hara’s poetry is shot through with so many of the most vital
                    currents of mid-century cosmopolitan culture—popular, elite, emergent,
                    experimental—that he should have a cultural constellation named for himself. In
                    the introduction to Donald Allen’s edition of <title level="m">The Collected
                    Poems of Frank O’Hara</title>, John Ashbery maps out this vast constellation of
                    the poet’s influences and engagements and many of the relevant strains of
                    nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and art, from the French Symbolists and
                    Surrealists through the Russian experiments of Pasternak and Mayakovsky as well
                    as the Abstract Expressionism of de Kooning, Pollock, and Kline. Of artists who
                    would find their fame after this moment of Abstract Expressionism, Philip Guston
                    and Cy Twombly and the music of Cage, Schoenberg, Satie and even Paul Bowles,
                    the experimental poetry of the Soviet Union and Africa. To Ashbery’s catalogue
                    of persons, many of whom he might have found in his own rolodex, we must surely
                    add the pulsing and tawdry kaleidoscope of mid-century popular culture, not just
                    film or cinema but <emph>the movies</emph> and the catalogue of movie
                    <emph>stars</emph>, such as Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, William
                    Powell and Lana Turner, and above all James Dean: “the heavens operate on the
                    star system,” O’Hara writes in <title level="a">To the Film Industry in Crisis,</title> his paean to
                    that constellation: “It is a divine precedent / you perpetuate!” and “it’s you I
                    love!” (232.43–45, 7). O’Hara’s poetry is charged with the enthusiasm of
                    infatuation, one which attaches itself “variously.” “I don’t prefer one ‘strain’
                    to another,” he writes in <title level="a">My Heart,</title> perhaps closer to a manifesto of his
                    poetry and his criticism than “Personism”:

                    The disregard for “strains” extends to music, where he could adore
                    Cage and Rachmaninoff, opera and jazz, and the popular jazz singers, including
                    the greatest of them all.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Dean’s death
                        in September 1955 prompted O’Hara to write three elegies, the third (and
                        best) of which—<title level="a">Thinking of James Dean</title>—conveys the nature of the poet’s
                        immersion in cultural worlds in which there are no distinctions other than
                        vitality, “nerve,” and “variousness.” Like many of O’Hara’s best works, the
                        poem is both panoramic and intimate, a “cold last swim / before the city”
                        set against “a sky Tiepolo / and Turner compiled in vistavision” as he
                        imagines what it is like to be “robbed of these suns and knowledges” and
                        writes a name not in water but in sand: “A leaving word in the sand, odor of
                        tides: his name.” Along the way, O’Hara’s conceit careens from the
                        Turner-Tiepolo cinema to a bit part in <title level="m">Julius Caesar</title>
                        at the Brattle Theatre as his friends “listen to <title level="m">La
                        Boheme</title>”: all as way to register, to frame “Each panoramic second,
                        of / his death” (230–31.22–23, 2–3, 20, 32, 26, 3–4.)</note> Thomas Byrom
                    was both condescending and homophobic when he declared that O’Hara’s “aesthetics
                    are from a catalogue of late Victorian camp, a matter of excellent personal
                    taste. He burned hard and gemlike. . . a less frigid version of Paterian
                        pop.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Byrom’s evaluations of O’Hara
                        appeared in his <title level="j">TLS</title> review of Marjorie Perloff’s

                        alongside two published volumes of O’Hara’s poetry. Perloff quotes the
                        passage in her introduction to the second edition of the book, published by
                        the University of Chicago Press in 1998.</note> But, however phobic his
                    impulses and wrong his characterizations of the poetry or the aesthetic, I want
                    to reclaim the very term that Byrom might have regarded as his most decisive
                    dismissal: “Paterian pop.” I think there is no better way to name the cultural
                    vitality of this queer popular current that runs from Keats to O’Hara. </p>
                  <p> “As if I were Endymion,” O’Hara exclaims in “There I could never be a boy,” one
                    of his poems to James Schuyler; and the references to Keats often occur when
                    O’Hara is figuring a limit (excess, abstraction, enthusiasm) by which he
                    measures his own aesthetic trajectory (216.14). This is the “Keats effect” that
                    connects these most famous figures of the Cockney and New York Schools, two
                    “coterie poets” who hail from the “affected school of metropolitan poets” and
                    were both denounced by conservative critics as “poetasters.” To articulate this
                    connection, I turn to Peter Szendy, French philosopher of pop culture, for the
                    term that activates this constellation: “obstructive enthusiasm” or
                    “infatuation” (<foreign xml:lang="fr">engouement</foreign>) Szendy calls it, with
                    reference not to contemporary or Romantic poetry but to the affects and effects
                    of popular music. Drawing on Theodor Reik’s psychoanalytic interest in
                    “obsessive melodies,” Szendy declares something about the effects of popular
                    music that, as Leonard Cohen might say, “everybody knows”: there are certain
                    popular melodies that act “like a ghost that has come to haunt us. Or like a
                    worm, a virus of the ear that keeps reproducing itself in us” (<title level="m">Hits</title>
                    32).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Will Bishop
                        translates <foreign xml:lang="fr">engouement</foreign> as “enthusiasm,” but I also
                        want to activate “infatuation” as the translation that speaks more to the
                        aesthetic affect at work here.</note> But on certain occasions the effect of
                    these melodies is something more than a mere “ear-worm”: in some instances the
                    popular melody manages “to bring some obstructive enthusiasm into our heart of
                    hearts, . . . bursts of enthusiasm, lyrical flights of incomparable force and
                    emotion” (33). None of which get us anywhere: these are lyrical arrests,
                    aesthetic seizures of the sort that O’Hara indelibly stamped at the end of <title level="a">The

                Everything prior to this arrest by the photographic image of “Lady Day” is
                    movement and activity, clocked and named, Baudelaire’s
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">flaneur</foreign> on Manhattan time. It’s aesthetically exclusive (the gift of
                    “a little Verlaine / for Patsy”) and democratically urban (lunch is “a hamburger
                    and a malted”), cosmopolitan and popular (“a bottle of Strega,” French
                    cigarettes, <emph>and</emph> the “NEW YORK POST”). This is O’Hara’s
                    city “circuit” personally and poetically; and it belongs to the genre he made
                    popular—“I did this I did that”—urgently enjambed parataxis until the moment of
                    recognition: “a NEW YORK POST with her face on it,” at which point everything
                    stops as “he is thinking of leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT” and the time
                    suddenly changes and we belong to the memory of a “whispered song” by Lady Day
                    “and everyone and I stopped breathing.” This “inside out” elegy, one in which
                    the singer’s death is marked only in the title and the final brief stanza, is
                    the poem that only a fan could write, one whose movement, direction, and
                    enthusiasm has come to a standstill by the sudden appearance of an image.<note place="foot" resp="author"> This is a poem which has been written
                        about often and well; but I want to note two important and engaged readings
                        of the poem that have long been crucial to my understanding of the poem and
                        of O’Hara: Marjorie Perloff, <title level="m">Frank O’Hara: Poet Among
                        Painters</title> (xvii–xix; 179–83); and Andrew Ross, <title level="a">The Death of Lady

                  </p>
                  <p> “Obstructive enthusiasm” appears in a more specifically Keatsian vein in the
                    O’Hara poem with which I opened this essay, <title level="a">Again, John Keats, or The Pot of
                    Basil.</title> The poem begins with the speaker’s reflection on the condition of an
                    empty blockage, a reflection which relies on the mutually exclusive colloquial
                    definitions of “through” as both adverb and noun: the speaker’s sense of feeling
                    “through” with things is likened to an image in a John Huston film, a
                    “throughness” broken suddenly by the gift of “a pot of basil,” a gift which
                    activates the derived meaning of “through” that prompts the speaker to announce
                    a Keatsian “breakthrough” that turns out to be another limit: “am reading Keats
                    again and realize / that everything is impossible in a different way” (471.7–9).
                    How better to describe O’Hara’s realization of an impossibility “in a different
                    way” than as an “obstructive enthusiasm”? The gift of the basil from an
                    unspecified friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats—himself a serious
                    “re-reader”—that results in the poem’s central event, a “realization” which
                    offers no vision into the future, no way beyond the impasse. O’Hara’s
                    “again-ness” with Keats reiterates the romantic poet’s own repetitive obsessions
                    regarding the <emph>re-reading</emph> of <title level="m">King
                    Lear</title> in <title level="a">On Sitting Down to Read <title level="m">King Lear</title> Once
                    Again,</title> which promises nothing more than a re-visitation of an impossibility,
                    “the fierce dispute betwixt damnation and impassion’d clay.” But the affective
                    charge of O’Hara’s impossibility is not direly obsessive but exuberant: if this
                    is the poetics of the impasse, it is the happy aporia, what in a relevant
                    register Emily Dickinson calls a “bright impossibility.” Keats’s odes are riven
                    with this kind of “obstructive enthusiasm”: not only the famously awkward six
                    “happies” of the third stanza of <title level="a">Ode on Grecian Urn,</title> which emphatically
                    reiterate a happiness denied the speaker, but the urgent desire for the speaker
                    of the <title level="a">Ode to Psyche</title> to be the “pale-mouth’d prophet” that history denied the
                    goddess, “latest born and loveliest vision.” The enthusiasms of the speakers of
                    Keats’s odes may entice us into believing the speaker has gotten somewhere in
                    the course of theode; and indeed, as in the <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> the speaker
                    may have enticed himself into believing that he has done so, until the music
                    “flees.” </p>
                  <p> O’Hara’s own “Keats effect” is registered throughout his poetry in forms both
                    named and implied, often as examples of this “obstructive enthusiasm.” In a
                    sonnet called <title level="a">On a Passage in Beckett’s <title level="m">Watt</title> &amp; About
                    Geo. Montgomery,</title> O’Hara offers an extraordinary passage that marks both his
                    affective debt and rhetorical leave-taking from what he identifies as the Keats
                    effect and that he associates with “excess”:

                    In <title level="a">The ‘Unfinished,’</title> a sprawling name-dropping exercise, Keats is posited as
                    temporal reference: “I suddenly think of the moon, hanging up there / ever since
                    the time of Keats,” as if the lunar object is itself a Keats effect (317.57–58).
                    For O’Hara origins are always aesthetic, and therefore always multiple points of
                    artistic reference and poetic relays that, to invoke Deleuze and Guattari once
                    again, feel more “rhizomatic” than lineal or arboreal. In <title level="a">For Bob
                    Rauschenberg,</title> O’Hara’s often manic name-checks take on a poignant tone, one in
                    which art is enthusiastically registered as failure. “The frail instant” is
                    “drowned in Liszt” and our speaker has come to “despise” his “love for
                    Pasternak” (322.5, 9). The poem’s third stanza creates a constellation of three
                    poets who rarely occupy the same canonical space, from which the speaker, “alone
                    in pain,” is excluded:

                In this triad of “heavenly aspirations,” Keats’s “truth and beauty” gets the
                    upper hand, especially as it is followed immediately by a
                    question—“double-coin?”—an activation of the two-sided nature of the Keats
                    effect.</p>
                  <p> Many of the important impressions of the Keats effects in O’Hara’s poetry take
                    the form of unattributed invocations, like the deployment of a crucial phrase in
                    <title level="a">Light clarity avocado salad in the morning.</title> This astonishing poem closes with

                The opening clause of the final line—“I am sure of nothing but this”—activates
                    the famous line from Keats’s 1817 letter to Bailey, a letter which declares
                    Keats’s agnosticism as well as his poetic project: “I am certain of nothing but
                    of the holiness of the Heart’s affections and the truth of the Imagination.” And
                    when O’Hara wants to pursue this ungrounded Keatsian intensification to the
                    limit place of poetic abstraction, he turns in <title level="a">Personism</title> to Keats’s “negative
                    capability” in order to address the nature of poetic versus painterly
                    abstraction: “Abstraction (in poetry, not in painting) involves personal removal
                    by the poet,” writes O’Hara; and he goes on to link the “abstraction” and
                    “removal” of the poet to “negative capability (as in Keats and Mallarme)” (498).
                    But in order to achieve a “true abstraction for the first time, really, in the
                    history of poetry,” O’Hara’s <title level="a">Personism</title> goes in the opposite direction,
                    restoring, so it would seem, the “person” to the poem, and in the process,
                    “<emph>abstracting</emph>” him. While the irony of this mock manifesto
                    makes it impossible to decide how seriously we are meant to take O’Hara’s
                    formulation as a poetic project, the passage does mark Keats and negative
                    capability as a kind of limit case for the development of a decisive mode of
                    abstraction in contemporary art. And as O’Hara moves in his manifesto from
                    Keatsian negativity capability to Personism, we reach “obstructive enthusiasm,
                    the infatuated “vitality” of the limit: “What can we expect of Personism? (This
                    is getting good, isn’t it?) Everything, but we won’t get it. It is too new, too
                    vital a movement to promise anything” (499). Expect everything, O’Hara’s
                    says—just as it’s “getting good”—but realize that nothing will come of it:
                    <title level="a">Personism,</title> the poetic movement of vitality with no future. Without promise,
                    “you just go on your nerve,” writes O’Hara, identifying a term he invokes often
                    for his account of the fundamental poetic “charge” or impulse. “Implying both
                    spontaneity and outrageousness,” writes Brad Gooch, “‘nerve’ was O’Hara’s campy
                    version of Keats’s prescription of ‘negative capability’ or ‘wise passivity’ for
                    the young lyric Romantic poet. . . .‘Nerve’ was his aesthetic motor, his
                    program” (435). “Nerve” as “aesthetic motor”: “negative capability” with
                    vitality but no promise, “both a plus and a minus” as Gooch characterizes it,
                    the same impulse-blockage two-step that characterizes this version of the Keats
                    effect.</p>

                  <p>If we can assign “a plus and a minus” to the Keats effects, “shrines of no
                    prospect” is the phrase I’d invoke for the “minus sign,” the alternating current
                    to “Obstructive Enthusiasm.” By this term I hope to convey the luxuriant
                    mourning for this doomed poet that Keats’s poetry, his death, and his “circle”
                    put into circulation for our own generation of doomed popular troubadours. What
                    Swann says about the various images of the poet in
                    <title level="m">Endymion</title>—at least in the seductive mythology that is itself a part of
                    this shrine—extends to a rock music constellation we know well: “all abstracted
                    dreamers, all piercingly beautiful, all singled out by the gods, all marvelous
                    fated boys, all destined for celebrity”—and all doomed (20).<note place="foot" resp="author"> And it will not be surprising to know that it is
                        something to which O’Hara would be attracted. Gooch writes that the poet was
                        “addicted to the notion of the tragic romantic artist” (303).</note> This
                    aspect of the Keats effect—the aura of painful regret—forces our hand: as
                    readers we are demanded to make a decision about the poet ahead of time, a
                    decision based on our feelings, a demand that was always in effect for the
                    poet’s first readers. For them and for us, one doesn’t “come around” to Keats
                    the way one might develop an admiration or critical interest in Wordsworth, for
                    instance, or even a fascination with the delirious irony of Byron’s many poses.
                    The affective response produced in advance by this Keats effect is not derived
                    from our understanding of his ethical impulses or his formal achievement or his
                    political engagement. Nor is it the result of careful rhetorical readings,
                    however much the poems may yield to that practice. Though the affective
                    relationship with this poet does not preclude rhetorical analysis or formal
                    interpretation, the Keats effect happens <emph>in advance</emph> of
                    any subsequent critical engagement; and it’s bound up with our image of him.</p>
                  <p> In this context, it’s worth remembering that Keats initiates his own poetic
                    project with a series of poems addressed to popular models of the poet:
                    <title level="a">Imitation of Spenser,</title> the pageant of Western poets in <title level="a">Ode to Apollo,</title> of
                    course, and the sonnets to Byron and to Chatterton, that young suicide, “Dear
                    child of sorrow! Son of misery,” now “among the stars” whose “hymning” is now
                    far “above the ingrate world” (5). Keats’s elegiac outbursts to this tragically
                    dead young poet with whom he identifies establishes the rhetoric of a
                    relationship reactivated in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, arguably the most
                    beautiful British elegy of the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="author"> It depends upon whom you ask, of course. When Shelley
                        wrote to Ollier that he was “composing a poem of the death of Keats,” he
                        called it “a highly wrought <emph>piece of art</emph>, perhaps
                        better in composition than anything I have written.” Not the judgement of
                        the review in <title level="j">The Literary Gazette</title>, Dec. 1821: “The
                        poetry of the work is <emph>contemptible</emph>, a mere collection
                        of bloated words heaped on each other without order, harmony, or meaning”
                        (qtd. in Ann Wroe, <title level="m">Being Shelley</title> 265).</note> With
                    his fifty-five “Spenser stanzas,” Percy Shelley constructs Keats’s first “Sovran
                    shrine,” one which the older poet adorns with his friend’s own poetic images or
                    “splendours” (100, 174, 198, 363, 388). The revisitations of these images are
                    the dead poet’s own special effects in a “Temple” not of “Delight” but of
                    Melodrama, one designed exclusively for a ritualized weeping that is marshaled
                    “against oblivion.” Shelley’s elegy is certainly as responsible for this aspect
                    of the Keats effect as anything the younger poet ever wrote:
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> enshrined an image that almost immediately became inseparable
                    from both poets. Shelley famously inscribes an image of himself in this
                    “enduring monument” as “one frail Form, / A phantom among men, companionless”
                    (271–72), one of the poets who gather to mourn Adonais. As Andrew Motion puts
                    it, the early responses to Keats’s death “took their lead” from
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “the single most famous
                    and influential response to Keats’s tragedy…. [Shelley] turned Keats into an
                    archetype—not someone who had suffered uniquely, but someone who represented all
                    artists oppressed by reactionary regimes” (571). Motion laments the fact that
                    Shelley’s “distortions” became “quickly and firmly rooted in the popular
                    imagination” (572). Shelley’s own biographers agree that these “distortions” are
                    the result of his own projected hyper-identifications that crystallize in this
                    poem, especially the <emph>ad hominem</emph> assaults by conservative
                    reviewers on young poets associated with Hunt and Byron, agents of sedition and
                    immorality. Shelley’s emotional investment in the fate of
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> may have exceeded anything else he wrote; and it prompted him
                    to draft (and subsequently abandon) a preface to the poem which stresses the
                    “calumny” “heaped in so profuse a measure” upon <emph>himself</emph>
                    (qtd. in <title level="m">Being Shelley</title> 264). Given the compounding of
                    these affective substitutions between mourner and mourned, it is not surprising
                    that Shelley would express his hopes for the life of the poem. “I am especially
                    curious to hear the fate of <title level="m">Adonais</title>,” he wrote to Charles
                    Ollier: “I confess I should be surprised if <emph>that</emph> poem
                    were born to an immortality to oblivion.”</p>
                  <p> “Oblivion” is an important word for Shelley, one that appears in many of its
                    forms in his poems and prose, including the lines of the elegy dedicated to “the
                    inheritors of unfulfilled renown” (Chatterton, Sidney, Lucan) from whom
                    “Oblivion … shrank like a thing reproved” (397, 405) and in the closing
                    sentences to his preface in which he praises “Mr. Severn, a young artist of the
                    highest promise.” In return for Severn’s “unwearied attendance” to the dying
                    poet, Shelley invokes the spirit of Keats to bestow a final plea on behalf of
                    the young artist, a plea that has the ring of an aesthetic benediction: “may the
                    unextinguished Spirit of his illustrious friend animate the creations of his
                    pencil and plead against Oblivion for his name!” The irony, of course, is that
                    it is the <emph>extinguishing</emph> body of Severn’s illustrious
                    friend that “animated” the one creation of his pencil to have “defeated oblivion
                    for his name.” Severn made many other pictures, of course, paintings of
                    historical or literary subjects—Keats and Shelley among them—subjects which
                    constituted his ambitions and the miniatures which made him money. But it seems
                    fair to say that the artist’s images of Keats and Shelley were saved from
                    oblivion in part by their affective relation to a poetry
                    and aesthetics of oblivion, the “oblivious spells” and “oblivious
                    melodies” of Shelley and of Keats. But for the circle of friends devoted to the
                    memory and reputation of Keats—a record of devotion which has made his death a
                    genre of its own—the phrase, “against oblivion,” might serve as an alternate
                    caption for Severn’s death-bed drawing. While Keats’s head rests on a pillow
                    more suggested than drawn, Severn has penciled two concentric cones: a light
                    exterior and dark interior cone which serve as contrast to the three-quarter
                    image of the poet. Thus does Severn, drawing this picture at 3am to “keep
                    awake,” have the face of Keats <emph>propped</emph> directly
                    “<emph>against</emph>” a figured oblivion. </p>
                  <p> What are we to do with what Khalip calls “last things”? How do we dispose of
                    Keats’s <emph>effects</emph>, the personal artifacts and cultural
                    remnants that have been saved from oblivion, more “cloudy trophies hung” in the
                    Keats reliquary, none of which we’ve been assigned to study? In <title level="a">The Strange
                    Time of Reading,</title> one of the most beautiful and most moving pieces of literary
                    criticism I know, Karen Swann begins by addressing another item of “Keatsiana,”
                    an “image of Keats’s death mask” (275–82).<note place="foot" resp="author"> The full range of Swann’s thinking and writing about the
                        aesthetic after-lives of Keats and Shelley has been indispensable to my own
                        critical and affective engagements with these poets and their work. But this
                        one essay in particular is special. As with everything Swann writes, it’s
                        exquisitely composed and delicately conveyed: Swann reads “effects” as
                        closely and intimately as she reads texts; and she allows herself the
                        vulnerability of a reader who acknowledges that she “finds herself reading
                        in the manner of Keats,” offering her own critical voice to this affective
                        currency of reading-relays. And in the context of the “Keats Effects” I am
                        describing, it is relevant to note that I heard the “live version” of this
                        article when it was first presented as a conference paper. I was moved in a
                        way I very rarely experience in such venues. At that moment, I found myself
                        listening not only as a Romanticist who learns from Swann’s work but with a
                        fan’s devotion.</note> The effect of the image, she writes, “is haunting,
                    fascinating … precisely because of the way its working depends on a sloughing
                    off of context” (275). Swann’s thinking about this version of Keats—“at once
                    supremely self-conscious and so absorbed in his medium that he can seem lost to
                    us”—poses an important question for the Severn image: is it possible to
                    <emph>read</emph> Severn’s image without inscriptions or captions,
                    whether real or imagined, without the saturation of affect, the genuine pathos
                    that attaches itself to this poet and his artist-caretaker at this “strange time
                    of drawing”: “28 Janry 3o’clock mng. Drawn to keep me awake – a deadly sweat was
                    on him all this night.”</p>
                  <p> Severn records his image of Keats in that late indeterminate period of “no
                    prospect” when, as Rei Terada phrases it, the poet “was able to know” “the
                    experience without poetry” (<title level="a">Looking</title> 301).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Khalip quotes this passage in the course of his own thinking about
                        the temporal force of the “posthumous” in Keats’s last letters: “To read
                        Keats thinking about his posthumous existence in a ‘last letter’ … is to
                        fall into the tangled temporalities of the epistolary form that breaks apart
                        the commemorative containment of something like a ‘life
                        <emph>of</emph> letters’” (70).</note> In the final term of the death
                    sentence, an artist is marking time against the oblivion of sleep in the days
                    before his poet-friend “stopped breathing.” What appears does not belong to the
                    temporal register of the death mask, that cultural relic on which Swann
                    reflects, but a <emph>limit-image</emph>. In the mask, she writes,
                    “‘Keats’ only comes into view … as the bright, aesthetic image peeled away from
                    referent and context,” an image that generates the “elegiac delusion: that
                    impossible feeling that ‘the poet is not dead’—but merely sleeping, dreaming,
                    wasting…. The feeling is … the affective freight or ‘ache’ that becomes attached
                    to the image that comes into view at the vanishing point, as ungraspable and
                    ungeneralizable singularity” (275). Much of what Swann says about Keats’s death
                    mask and its casted finality is transferrable to the hastily drawn image Severn
                    produced at the limit: indeed, the “affective freight or ‘ache’” attaches itself
                    perhaps more acutely to Severn’s sketched image, one which documents how the
                    poet might well be “sleeping, dreaming, wasting.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Severn has drawn a dying face that also resembles what
                        Khalip has called a “sleepy head,” the spot-on phrase he uses to think
                        through Joanna Kane’s arresting photographic portrait series of eighteenth-
                        and nineteenth-century life and death masks collected in the Edinburgh
                        Phrenological Society. She published her treatments of the images in
                        <title level="m">The Somnambulists: Photographic
                            Portraits from Before Photography</title>. If, as Khalip puts it, those
                        “image-masks errantly sleepwalk out of time,” Severn’s image is pinned to
                        its moment (68).</note> But unlike the death mask, the particular “ache”
                    that attaches to Severn’s image is not “ungraspable and ungeneralizable
                    singularity” but is acutely specific, “graspable,” and re-applicable. It’s three
                    in the morning, the end of “Janry,” and he is drawing this picture to keep
                    himself from sleeping while the poet—sweating a lot right now—is sleeping?
                    dreaming? wasting? dying? It’s an image which, as Shelley puts it in
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title>, “can scarce uplift / The weight of the
                    superincumbent hour” (281­–82).</p>
                  <p>If the ephemerality of drawing often conveys the sense of what Rebecca Comay
                    calls “unfinishedness” (or “under-determination”), the sense of “unfinishedness”
                    conveyed by Severn’s quickly drawn image of Keats is “over-determined” by our
                    awareness that the artist is documenting in “real time” the premature finishing
                    off of the poet (<title level="a">Tabula Rasa</title> 142). The drawing is an image of the poet at his
                    limit and, in its own state of “unfinishedness” at the limit of the image. Maybe
                    those of us who confess to be taken by the gifts and the passion of this poet
                    will, when we gaze upon this limit-image, “have grown into the likeness of his
                    death,” as Paul writes in his final letter, the one to the Romans. This is
                    another way of asking the question: can seeing ever lead to reading when the
                    very object we behold is constituted more by the aura of painful regret than the
                    proficiency of the artist? Is this the kind of image that, once beheld, makes us
                    beholden, or puts us “in a thrall”?<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                        “When reading Keats,” says Swann, “at least some readers find themselves
                        reading in the manner of Keats, who was always exceptionally alive to the
                        call of the image, always vulnerable to the sharp ache, the feeling of being
                        ‘drained, without any force’ that it induced” (279).</note> And isn’t this
                    precisely how this “limit-image” becomes an icon? To borrow Swann’s phrasing for
                    my account of Severn’s picture, the image “takes on the force of a relic, …
                    sharply intruding the time of the one who is no longer here into the presence of
                    our” beholding (<title level="a">Strange Time</title> 279). In Severn’s scandalized presence, Shelley
                    seemed to delight in shocking the pious artist with his indictments against
                    Christianity. But when he writes to Severn of his desire to collect the
                    “remnants” of Keats’s compositions in order “to have them published with a Life
                    and Criticism,” even the godless Shelley declares that Severn’s promised picture
                    of the poet will be “considered among the most sacred relics of the past.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Perhaps like the charred remains of
                        Shelley’s heart that Mary wrapped in the pages of
                        <title level="m">Adonais</title> and preserved as a relic to be shared with close
                        friends.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Perhaps the power this image exerts over the beholder is a result of Severn’s
                    depiction of the figure’s solitary and even unconscious absorption. Perhaps in
                    order to examine the properties of this image, we can borrow the principles that
                    Michael Fried derives from Diderot for his defining engagement with eighteenth-
                    and nineteenth-century French painting. If we look at this picture from Fried’s
                    perspective, Severn’s image of the sleeping poet might derive its power from its
                    depiction “of a personage so absorbed [that it] appear[s] unconscious or
                    <emph>oblivious</emph> of everything” (7). In other words, it’s an
                    image that defeats theatricality at the limit of consciousness, by surrendering
                    to oblivion. “Like Adonis,” writes Swann, “Endymion is possessed of a certain
                    stagey dreaminess” (<title level="a">
                        <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    Dreamers</title> 25). Swann names an aspect of Keats’s work that, while
                    crossways with the art historical terms Fried employs, identifies a kind of
                    stage presence charged with this “Keats effect”: “theatrical absorption,” an
                    experience we might have treasured in an acoustic live performance by Elliott
                    Smith or Kurt Cobain. In the drawn or painted representations of sleeping
                    figures, as Fried puts it, the human being abandons “the upright posture that
                    establishes it in perceptual opposition to the object world … surrendering all
                    control or bodily functions as if to a power or rhythm outside oneself” (67):
                    the “deadly sweat was <emph>on</emph> him all night.” If Severn’s
                    absorptive image intends so little and means so much, it’s because this
                    “unfinished” drawing delivers us to limits that it doesn’t know
                    (unconsciousness, death, oblivion) but that it makes iconic in this shrine of no
                    prospect.</p>

                  <head>VI. “So I can sigh eternally”</head>
                  <p>I take this final section title from the second verse of <title level="a">Pennyroyal Tea,</title> a song
                    Kurt Cobain wrote and recorded with Nirvana on their last album,
                    <title level="m">In Utero</title> (1994), and performed most memorably in a solo
                    acoustic version on MTV’s <title level="m">Unplugged</title> four months before
                    his death. “Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld,” begins the verse, “so I can
                    sigh eternally.” Cobain is alluding to <title level="a">The Tower of Song,</title> Leonard Cohen’s
                    sardonic account of a place where our best singers reside, both the dead and the
                    dying. Cohen’s “tower of song”—“far in the unapparent”—sounds a lot like a
                    hotel, maybe even the Chelsea—L. Cohen is “paying [his] rent every day” to be
                    there—but it also, and again like the Chelsea, sounds a lot like a shrine,
                    <emph>the</emph> shrine of the dead or dying troubadours. The only
                    other lodger Cohen identifies is Hank Williams, who “living a hundred floors
                    above him,” is not much of an interlocutor:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>I said to Hank Williams, ‘how lonely does it get?’ </l>
                           <l>Hank Williams hasn’t answered yet;</l>
                           <l>but I hear him coughing all night long</l>
                           <l>oh, a hundred floors above me in the tower of song.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
                One can see why Cohen’s song appealed to Cobain, by turns musically ambitious and
                    personally self-deprecating: the singer’s desire to find oneself in the “tower
                    of song” is not only ironized by the declaration that he is mere “penny
                    royalty,” but by the doubled irony of a desire that he has made into a
                    death-wish.</p>
                  <p> Cohen’s song is saturated by a religious rhetoric which—Christian as well as
                    Jewish—is a feature of so many of his poems and songs and which is always, even
                    when he’s singing his famous “hallelulias,” subjected to the same ironic,
                    “broken” undertow. Here the singer’s prophetic, messianic impulse—“Twenty-seven
                    angels from the great beyond!” “There’s a mighty judgment coming!”—is undone,
                    often in the very next line: “But I may be wrong: / you see you hear these funny
                    voices in the tower of song.” And, however much he might be “crazy for love,”
                    he’s also already singing, posthumously, “with that gift of a golden voice”
                    “from the other side”: “you’ll be hearing from me, baby, long after I’m gone. /
                    I’ll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the tower of song.” The tower
                    of song is this place where the dead are still coughing and the living are
                    “sighing eternally.”</p>
                  <p>It’s as old as poetry itself, of course, this elegiac
                    literary tradition in which poets honor their predecessors by mourning them,
                    fashioning in the process a company of singers they hope to join.
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> makes famous allusions to Bion and to
                    Moschus—both translated by Shelley—and to Milton; and the poem fashions images
                    of Byron, Hunt, and himself. But Shelley’s elegy marks a new and distinctive
                    species of hyper-identification with the dead poet, one which begins with
                    Shelley and his own personal and poetic projections on a poet about whose poems,
                    at least until <title level="m">Hyperion</title>, he felt a genuine ambivalence.
                    <title level="m">Adonais</title> inaugurates a version of this Western elegiac
                    tradition that amplifies the affective dimension of these retrospective lineages
                    at the very moment it drains them of redemptive potential <emph>and
                    sings in praise of that</emph>. Or, more precisely, what Walter Benjamin would
                    call its “redemption value” is rendered into something sheerly aesthetic, weak,
                    impotent, and ineffectual: the shrine of no prospect. In the elegy that mourns
                    and celebrates Keats, Shelley called it “the abode where the Eternal are,” where
                    we mind and tend the effects of what Cohen called the “beautiful losers,”
                    residents of the tower of song, not only Cobain but Hank Williams, Nick Drake,
                    Ian Curtis, Elliott Smith. These singers belong in the same expansive cultural
                    constellation with such figures as Oscar Wilde, Percy Shelley, Frank O’Hara,
                    James Dean, Billie Holiday, Walter Benjamin, and especially John Keats—“lost
                    angels of a ruined paradise” as Shelley would call them, icons whose beauty is
                    inseparable from a suffering that in their “excessive Keatsness,” always
                    belonged to “the other side,” always already posthumous.<note place="foot" resp="author"> I understand that the premature deaths of these poets
                        and singers and actors result from a variety of causes; and I don’t intend
                        to minimize the differences between rock and roll suicides and poetic
                        consumption, drowning, or even accidental death by sports car or dune-buggy.
                        But I believe that in terms of the Keats effect, the mode or manner of death
                        is less important than the image with which it is shrouded and made into
                        something popular even if not biographically accurate. For instance, while
                        composing <title level="m">Adonais</title>, Shelley writes that it was only
                        “by assiduous watching that [Keats] was restrained from effecting purposes
                        of suicide”; and Shelley’s “Inheritors of unfulfilled renown” notably
                        includes poets who died by their own hand.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Among the singer-songwriters of this constellation, it’s possible to discern
                    what Benjamin, following Goethe, called “elective affinities” in form, theme,
                    and presentation; but the most significant aspect of their Keats effect resides
                    in their image, one they sang about—the “afterworld,” for instance, of Cohen and
                    Cobain—and an image they sang “to”: songs that went in search of that image and
                    songs that addressed it. And then in many cases, they became that image, “a
                    portion of the loveliness” they “made more lovely.” I do believe the poets and
                    singers I have gathered as examples of the Keats effects share among many other
                    things a demonstrable commitment to the radical lyricization of the ballad form
                    and—at least in the songs that register their “Keatsness”—an avoidance of the
                    anthem. Self-conscious or not, the Keatsian affective register of the oxymoron
                    is inscribed like a signature in the songwriting of these artists, such as
                    Elliott Smith’s one popular hit single, <title level="a">Miss Misery,</title> in which the plaintive
                    puns on “missing” and “misery” also produce the melancholy effects of those late
                    odes. Or Cobain’s <title level="a">Dumb</title> in which the singer’s experience of the blank emotion
                    of dumbness is, suddenly, “maybe just happy.”</p>
                  <p> What, then, is the Keats effect that connects these singers, their songs, and
                    others who, regardless of genre, belong to this constellation, this special
                    version of Pandora or a “Keatsness mixtape”? It is an image, one which is
                    redeemed without prospects, without futurity. If redemption without futurity
                    sounds incoherent—two fundamentally different discourses yoked together,
                    something like a theologized nihilism—this discursive discordance is precisely
                    what these images invoke: a Leonard Cohen afterworld of sighs and coughs, “the
                    soul of Adonais, like a star,” beckoning a poet’s boat “far from the shore,”
                    where it is “borne darkly, fearfully, afar,” shrines of martyrs, icons of saints
                    and an absent God, an angel of history forever suspended, forever turned from
                    the future, sighing eternally such that it asks whether there can be an
                    <emph>image of the sigh</emph>. </p>
                  <p> The last song of Nirvana’s <title level="m">MTV Unplugged</title> set, performed on
                    a stage covered with candles and Stargazer lilies, was their cover of <title level="a">Where Did
                    You Sleep Last Night?</title> or, as it is most often called, <title level="a">In the Pines.</title> The set
                    of songs Nirvana performed for that show posited its own remarkable
                    constellation: Cobain’s own compositions, of course, but also songs by David
                    Bowie, The Vaselines, and The Meat Puppets, as well as the homage to Leonard
                    Cohen in <title level="a">Pennyroyal Tea,</title> and then, “lastly,” <title level="a">Where Did You Sleep Last
                    Night?</title> Cobain introduces “the last song of the evening” as one written by
                    Leadbelly, his “favorite performer,” though as he had to know, the song was an
                    anonymous ballad performed by artists ranging from Bill Monroe and Roscoe
                    Holcomb to Loretta Lynn and most recently by Fantastic Negrito. The stories told
                    by the ballad differ considerably from version to version—most often a tale of
                    forsaken love—with the chorus as the song’s only constant. In the Leadbelly
                    version that Nirvana covers, the narrative is almost entirely eliminated, and a
                    central haunting question is introduced which distinguishes this version from
                    every other: “where did you sleep last night?” It’s a question posed to a
                    lover—“my girl”—followed by her reply:
                    <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>in the pines, in the pines</l>
                           <l>where the sun don’t ever shine</l>
                           <l>I shivered the whole night through. </l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote>
                The Leadbelly version of the song is almost entirely comprised of the chorus
                    which both introduces the song and is then repeated five times, punctuated by an
                    instrumental interlude and one brief verse, which offers only the sketchy
                    violence of a murdered husband whose severed head is found in a “driving wheel.” </p>
                  <p> Nirvana plays the song as a dirge, its relentless ballad measure slowed
                    painfully: three acoustic guitars, a cello accompaniment, Dave Grohl’s brushed
                    drums. The performance has the feel of inevitability. Throughout the song,
                    Cobain’s aspect is thoroughly absorptive: eyes downturned (reading the music,
                    reading the lyrics?), voice determined but measured until his signature wail
                    erupts in the final explosive chorus. The last line is broken down into the
                    shards of the chorus: “I shiver whole—[pause]—night through.” That final
                    “through” is extended and distended until it is no longer a sung note but a cry
                    hurled from the very end. But the image of the performance I’d like to extract
                    from this final line is the instant before that, the sudden and brief
                    arrest—fleeting standstill—at which the song and its singer reach the limit. In
                    the instant before that final chilling cry, Cobain sighs and for the first time
                    in the performance opens his eyes.

                “With awaken’d eyes,” in that moment “where everyone and I stopped breathing,” he
                    gave a breath to his image. This is not just the image of a sigh, but the
                    instance of visual image and audible sigh converging to make a “sigh-image.” In
                    the form of a sigh, it’s an image which comes only to perish. The Keats effects
                    converge here, not as explicit references from Cobain to Keats, but as the
                    affective register through which we experience the performance of this ballad by
                    a singer made iconic by early posthumousness and his own obstructive
                    infatuations. These Keats effects remain ours.</p>

                  <p>This essay has been long in the works, and some preliminary portions were
                    presented at two venues: first, in 2009 as an invited talk for a special session
                    at the North American Association for the Study of Romanticism in Toronto called
                    <title level="a">Genres of Death,</title> and then in 2012 as an invited lecture for a Colloquium at
                    the University of Massachusetts at Boston called <title level="a">No Prospects: Romanticism at
                    its Edges.</title> I want to thank, respectively, Ian Balfour and Elizabeth Fay for
                    their invitations and for initiating my early thinking on this topic. Every
                    aspect of this essay is the result of ongoing collaborations and conversations
                    with Jacques Khalip, for which I am immensely grateful.</p>

               <p> Jane Austen has a way of horning in on my scholarship. One minute, I’m writing about
                Wordsworth and ballet; the next, I’m citing Mr. Darcy’s famous assertion that “every
                savage can dance” (44). I sit down to meditate on Romantic-era vegetarianism, and I
                end up with an essay about—of all things—<title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> and
                the carnivores who inhabit its eponymous estate. Indeed, Austen has hijacked so many
                projects over the years that I’ve almost come to expect her interference, and I
                wasn’t surprised when she swam into my ken almost as soon as I began, on Brian
                Bates’s kind invitation, to ponder a paper about Jane Campion’s 2009 film
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> for this important collection. What
                <emph>did</emph> surprise me, however, was that this time, Austen’s
                interference manifested in another scholar’s complaint that she does, in fact,
                interfere with everything—or, at least, with every contemporary cinematic portrayal
                of nineteenth-century living, <title level="m">Bright Star</title> included. In a
                compelling essay entitled “The Austen Effect,” Toby Benis argues that “the success
                of screen adaptations of Austen’s novels has been followed by a generation of films
                set during the Romantic period that treat a variety of causes and figures… as if
                they circulated in a novel of manners” (183). Campion’s Fanny Brawne-centered Keats
                biopic, Benis continues, capitulates to that trend by “implicitly equat[ing]
                becoming a great poet with winning the hand of an aspiring lady” (183); the film’s
                Keats is “a lover,” in Benis’s words, “whose successful negotiation of the social
                obstacles to love, most obviously poverty, goes hand in hand with his poetic
                breakthroughs” (185). Benis attributes special influence to Andrew Davies, “the
                force behind the 1995 BBC miniseries of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>”
                (184), and as I pondered that particular connection, the more echoes of Davies’s
                most famous Austenian adaptation I came to see in <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                myself. Benis concentrates on the Austenian-formulaic aspects of Campion’s film—she
                notes, for example, that “Campion makes [Charles] Brown into the third figure… of an
                Austenesque triangle of affection and loyalty” and that she “erases… ambivalence” by
                presenting “Fanny’s attraction to and acceptance of Keats as her lover
                as…straightforward” (185, 186)—but I was struck by the more material parallels
                between Davies’s miniseries and <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, from their
                shared emphasis on scenes at dining tables and in bedchambers to their eerily
                similar opening credit sequences, both of which feature extreme close-ups of
                needlework set to instrumental scores. Parties and balls are central to both
                portrayals—one would expect as much from an adaptation of <title level="m">Pride
                    and Prejudice</title>, but notwithstanding the fact that “every savage can dance,”
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s concentration on such scenes was initially
                a bit of a surprise—and Campion, like Davies, frequently captures lovers and
                would-be lovers as they walk, often with sibling chaperones, across fields and
                through woods.</p>
               <p> As <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> reminds us, however,
                appearances—especially first impressions—can be deceiving, and upon closer
                inspection, Benis’s “Austen effect” begins to seem, as a critical account, a bit
                like George Wickham: too easy and more than a little inconsistent. I’m not sure, on
                second thought, to what degree Campion’s Keats really “negotiat[es]… poverty”—after
                all, he dies as itinerant and dependent as the historical Keats—and I’ve come to
                question the notion that Fanny’s love for Keats, as portrayed by Campion, is
                “straightforward,” devoid of “ambivalence.” When Fanny sends her younger siblings to
                the bookshop to purchase <title level="m">Endymion</title>, Margaret “Toots” Brawne’s
                remark to the bookseller seems directly to contradict Benis’s assertion of
                doubt-free “attraction and acceptance”: “My sister has met the author,” Toots
                explains, “and she wants to read it for herself to see if he is an idiot or not.”
                Fanny’s stated motive, in other words, hardly suggests that her “attraction” to
                Keats is akin to Emma Thompson’s portrayal of Elinor Dashwood’s fast-formed
                devotion to Edward Ferrars, one of the on-screen Austenian love stories to which
                Benis compares it (186). But I was particularly struck by the bookshop episode
                because, upon further consideration, I realized that it complicated my own sense of
                the material parallels between Campion’s film and Davies’s miniseries at least as
                much as it challenged Benis’s argument about the formulaic similarities in question.
                The bookshop is inelegant—dun, dusty, and dim—and the bookseller’s reply to Samuel
                Brawne’s request for <title level="m">Endymion</title> is downright crass: “I’ve not
                sold one and took twenty,” he grouses. From the bookseller’s vantage,
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> is less a poem than a product—a thing, that is, to
                be bound, stocked, stacked, and sold—and in this brief scene and others, Campion
                shows nineteenth-century England’s unvarnished backside to a degree that Davies, in
                his ever-shimmering <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, never approaches.
                For instance, although both productions emphasize scenes at tables, only Campion
                shows the dingy kitchens where food is prepared. Both productions feature social
                dancing, but only Campion portrays the drudgery of a dance lesson, one conducted in
                the Brawnes’ narrow sitting room by a pedantic French instructor. Both productions
                feature sibling-chaperoned walks, but only Campion, who highlights the sometimes
                walk-resistant Toots as well as the lovers’ stolen kisses, captures the tensions and
                limitations inherent in that system of virtue-guarding. And although both
                productions open with images of sewing, only Campion (whose initial needlework shots
                are, thanks to the fabric’s ghostly whiteness, more emotionally ambivalent than
                Davies’s images of colorfully embroidered and warmly lit silk) remains interested in
                the act of stitching and, concomitantly, in the fact that clothes—like habits,
                dancers, food, and, of course, poetry—are <emph>made</emph>, are the
                products of material conditions and human efforts that are often unideal or even
                ugly.</p>
               <p> Campion has acknowledged that she aimed to achieve in <title level="m">Bright
                    Star</title> something other than a Davies-ish sheen, and in various interviews,
                she has described the aesthetic to which she aspired as more flawed than flawless.
                “Most period films,” Campion argued in 2009, “look like antique shops,” and
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, in contrast, is purposely “very bare.” “[We]
                were very strict,” she says, “about what they were allowed to have in the room. And
                out of that authenticity it created some boundaries for us. We wanted, if the film
                could ‘feel’ beautiful, that they would have earned it, rather than saying, this
                sort of thing should ‘look’ beautiful” (Sullivan 86). For Campion, I gather, “bare”
                primarily means uncluttered or even impoverished; the term “bare,” however, also
                connotes nakedness—a lifted veil, so to speak—and I concur with Campion’s assertion
                that <title level="m">Bright Star</title> eschews “thing[s]” that simply “‘look’
                beautiful,” or perfectly finished, in favor of objects and experiences that manifest
                their madeness, that show and even celebrate the productive
                <emph>processes</emph> behind or beneath. I ascribe that aesthetic shift to a new
                pop-cultural influence, a fresh “effect”: In lieu of conventional period-film
                luxury, Campion’s “bare” portrait of the nineteenth-century emphasizes what I would
                describe as the ethos of craft and crafting, and as a result, I argue that if
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> was shaped by cinematic Austeniana, it’s at least
                as indebted to the rise of Etsy, the online handicraft marketplace that was
                established in 2005, four years before <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s release,
                and that remains an internet powerhouse today. The fact that Keatsiana—that is,
                Keats-inspired notecards, broadsides, tote bags, jewelry, decorative
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">objets</foreign>, and other such material—is surprisingly abundant at Etsy.com suggests
                that artisans have intuited a special relationship between their work and Keats’s,<note place="foot" resp="author"> When I use
                    the term “surprisingly abundant,” I’m comparing the quantity of
                    Keatsiana on Etsy to the amount of, say, Wordsworthiana or Shelleyana. I
                    don’t mean to suggest that Keats’s presence on Etsy rivals that of
                    Shakespeare, J.K. Rowling, or other enormous literary and pop-cultural
                    heroes. Specific data appear below.</note>
                and although neither Campion nor the typical Etsy maker-<emph>cum</emph>-seller
                acknowledges the prosodic craftsmanship that, for many literary
                critics, distinguishes Keats’s highly wrought poems, both, I aim to demonstrate,
                appropriately figure Keats as a champion of craft’s pragmatic and ideological
                affiliations with the human hand and, as a result, with human imperfection.</p>
               <p> In her brief history of craft, Michele Krugh doesn’t explicitly posit a relationship
                between crafting and imperfection, but she does dwell on craft’s essential links,
                since William Morris’s late nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, to
                amateurism and handwork, both of which represent alternatives to the flawlessness
                associated with professionalism and/or mechanized fabrication. With Morris as a
                “founding [member],” the “Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed in 1877 in
                reaction against the drive to professionalization within the Royal Institute of
                British Architects, which wanted to make architecture a closed shop like law and
                medicine” (Gilmour 231).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In some ways, the origins of the movement date back
                            to the Great Exhibition of 1851; members of the Arts and Crafts
                            Exhibition Society “publicly rejected the excessive ornamentation and
                            ignorance of materials, which many objects in the Great Exhibition had
                            been criticized for.” Although Morris “only became actively involved
                            with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society a number of years after it
                            was set up,” “his ideas were hugely influential to the generation of
                            decorative artists whose work it helped publicize” (<title level="a">Arts and
                            Crafts</title>).</note> That said, Morris had long been an acolyte of
                John Ruskin, whose anti-industrialist commentary on craftsmanship in
                <title level="m">The Stones of Venice</title> includes an injunction against
                “demand[ing] an exact finish for its own sake,” as well as a warning about
                perfection generally: “No good work whatever can be perfect, and the demand for
                perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of art” (95, 97).
                Ruskin and Morris wrote with profound political goals in mind, but “the most lasting
                contributions of the Arts and Crafts movement,” Krugh argues, were “the
                transformation of craft into a leisure activity and the linking of craft with
                unalienated labour in opposition to mass production” (288). In other words, today’s
                makers and consumers are unlikely to ponder a link between craft and Ruskinian
                theories of social utopia, and although Krugh notes that, “over the course of the
                twentieth century,” craft also lost some of its affiliation with amateurism, “one
                aspect that remained constant was the importance of laboring by hand to the meaning
                of craft” (290). Etsy, which Krugh describes as “the first and largest craft
                e-commerce site” and “a global, online marketplace” (291), has continued to
                compromise craft’s relationship to amateurism by suggesting (somewhat
                disingenuously, it turns out) that the crafter’s “pleasurable and creative work”
                can, more easily than ever, become “a day job” (Krugh 294). Nonetheless, Krugh
                observes, Etsy still celebrates the hand—its intimacy, its idiosyncrasy, its
                authenticity—in a host of ways but most notably through its affiliated blog’s
                “articles on featured shops,” which typically “include interviews with the sellers
                and beautiful photographs of their workspaces and their products, and more
                importantly, of them making their crafts.” As Krugh indicates, these narratives
                “usually [include] close-ups of [sellers’] hands as evidence of the ‘handmade’
                labour of production” (294).</p>
               <p> To my mind, Krugh’s account of the standard imagery in an Etsy Blog
                article—“workspaces,” “products,” “making,” and, most importantly, “hands,” all
                possessed of a constructed, not an innate, beauty—uncannily evokes the aesthetic of
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, in which, as I’ve noted, no object or
                experience (be it dress, dance, or poem) is portrayed as isolated from the human
                forces, the backstage labor, that brought it into existence. The film’s most
                obviously Etsy-ish moments represent Fanny, an aspiring fashion designer who early
                and confidently asserts in the manner of an Etsy ingenue that her work, which Brown
                denigrates as a girlish “obsession with flounce and cross stitch,”
                <emph>will</emph> earn her money—that is, will become “a day job” both satisfying and
                elevating. The work isn’t easy—as Margarida Pereira observes, “Fanny presents her
                stitching as a form of art as difficult and as complex as poetry writing” (163)—and
                Campion treats us to shot after shot of the studio-esque domestic spaces in which
                Fanny’s skilled hands, often shown in “close-ups,” gather, rip, pin, and sew the
                textiles destined to become either pieces in Fanny’s own wardrobe or exquisite
                gifts, such as the pillowslip that she embroiders for the late Tom Keats. However,
                in addition to watching Fanny work with nimble fingers, we hear her describe, with
                enthusiasm and technical specificity, the items that she makes and that other
                stitchers, she boasts, have “copied.” “Craft,” Krugh argues, “is about the
                personality of the maker” (293), and she cites Dixie Laite’s 2013 Etsy Blog piece
                about “branding” a “memorable Etsy shop,” which reminds sellers that “the story
                behind [one’s] products can attract customers because it makes what they’re buying
                special—and by extension, it makes them feel special” (293). Krugh notes that the
                vast majority of Etsy’s vendors are female—eighty-eight percent, according to a 2013
                report from Etsy itself (291)—and Campion’s heroine seems both to intuit and to
                prove the truth of Laite’s advice about craft and narrative. Although Brown
                patronizingly addresses Fanny as “the very well stitched little Miss Brawne, in all
                her detail”—he, it’s clear, has heard her talk shop too many times before—Keats’s
                “attract[ion]” to Fanny takes root in the early scenes in which she explains with
                pride that, among other feats of couture, she has “originated the pleats on [her]
                dress” and devised a one-of-a-kind “triple-pleated mushroom collar.”</p>
               <p> But the episode in which Fanny enthuses, blog-style, about the mushroom collar also
                highlights a problematic aspect of her crafting “personality,” as Campion imagines
                it: Notwithstanding handwork’s innate affiliation with the limitations and
                vicissitudes of human makers, Fanny seeks perfection, not just “special[ness],” in
                craft. Fanny has worn the collar to a dance, and as she stands with her back to a
                large mirror, she says almost smugly to Keats, “This is the first frock in Woolwich
                or Hampstead to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.” When Keats gravely replies,
                “Behind you I see one I fear to be identical,” Fanny’s face falls, and although she
                appreciates the joke when she spins around (the “identical” collar is, of course,
                her own collar reflected in the mirror), her reaction to the prospect of
                imperfection—in this case, to the prospect of being second, not first—indicates that
                she has a significant blind spot with regard to craft and, indeed, “personality,” a
                concept anchored in deviation from (not adherence to) a flawless ideal. Fanny’s
                first speech in the shooting script of <title level="m">Bright Star</title> finds her
                criticizing her little sister’s deficient sewing—“The stitches must be small and
                exactly even,” she complains to their mother (1)—and although that bit was cut from
                the final film, Fanny frequently articulates a taste, even a compulsion, for an
                ultimately unachievable perfection in craft. When, for example, she decides to make
                lemon wafers for Keats’s ill brother, she discards all but the flawless ones
                <emph>and</emph> clips Toots’s ribbon (right off her dress, in fact) to
                decorate the basket: “I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats’s brother anything that is not
                perfect,” she declares. Notwithstanding her mother’s shock and her sister’s
                protestation, Fanny fails to recognize the deficiencies—the waste, the
                inconsideration, and so forth—that, ironically, inhere in her quest to “offer”
                something both crafted <emph>and</emph> “perfect,” and later, upon
                delivering the wafers to Keats, Fanny persists in a futile effort to isolate the
                ideal, to separate the flawless from the flawed, in her evaluation of poetic craft:
                “I am very sorry I could not love your
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> completely, Mr. Keats,” she
                says, “…but I thought the beginning of your poem something very perfect.” Fanny
                means, of course, to elevate <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s renowned opening
                lines, but her remark highlights the fact that, when considered as a whole, Keats’s
                romance <emph>isn’t</emph> whole, isn’t poetically “complete.” In other
                words, Fanny’s attempt to celebrate perfection becomes, even as she shapes her
                compliment, an observation about inadequacy, about the inability of flawlessness to
                    <emph>hold</emph> in something made.</p>
               <p> Fanny’s standard, Campion seems to suggest, is clear but, for a maker, untenable
                and, after a while, even unappealing; like Keats’s doomed and often unsympathetic
                Lamia, Fanny aims to “unperplex bliss from its neighbor pain” by “defin[ing] their
                pettish limits” and “estrang[ing] their points of contact” (I.192-4). Perfection is
                her object, and as she early declares to Brown, critic of “flounce,” she “[doesn’t]
                shake hands with the enemy.” The film’s Keats, in contrast, is much more closely
                associated with makerly <emph>im</emph>perfection—with creative
                inefficiency, expressive immaturity, and physical frailty—and although much of the
                critical discourse surrounding <title level="m">Bright Star</title> emphasizes Fanny’s
                salutary effect on Keats (Julian North, in a representative essay, argues that
                Campion “represents Keats’s genius as nurtured by Fanny and flourishing harmoniously
                within her affectionate, domestic world” [83]), I want to underscore Campion’s
                implicit suggestion that through Keats, Fanny learns, to the ultimate benefit of her
                craft and the “personality” that inspires it, to brook and even to embrace the
                unideal. That rhetoric—<emph>i.e.</emph> “to embrace the unideal”—evokes,
                I hope, the concept of negative capability. Scholarly accounts of
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s engagement with negative capability have focused on Keats’s
                important interest in the obliteration of ego—North, for example, sees Campion
                exploring the “surrender of selfhood” and the “ability to accept the existence of
                other centres of consciousness” (81), while Pereira highlights the film’s “direct”
                reference to Keats’s “poet has… no identity” letter (157)—but Keats explicitly
                <emph>defines</emph> negative capability, in a remark about Samuel Taylor
                Coleridge, as the capacity “[to remain] content with half knowledge,” with a product
                or outcome less than perfect (43). Coleridge, he argues, isn’t negatively capable
                because, rather than accepting the “half” for the fullness it offers, he insists,
                like Fanny, on fullness proper, on “something very perfect.” Keats, in contrast,
                affiliates successful poetic making with accepting the unfinished or misaligned, and
                when, in a subsequent but related letter, he expresses his distaste for perfect
                poems, he portrays such objects (and, metonymically, their authors) as similar to
                Campion’s indignant Fanny, whose Lamian interest in “pettish limits” renders her
                unwilling, as she says, even to “shake hands with the enemy”: “We hate poetry that
                has a palpable design upon us,” Keats writes, “and if we do not agree, seems to put
                its hand in its breeches pocket”
                (<title level="m">Letters</title> 61).</p>
               <p> I highlight this charming image—a petulant poem refusing, Fanny-style, to shake
                hands with a reader who “do[es] not agree” with its “design,” its poetic
                perfection—because although Keats’s hands figure at least as prominently in
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> as Fanny’s, Campion rarely shows them
                <emph>writing</emph>, rarely shows them performing the physical act most
                closely, most perfectly, associated with Keats’s craft. Only Brown, a poetic nobody,
                repeatedly foregrounds the act of writing (“Men’s room—<emph>out</emph>—poets
                got to do a bit of writing,” he barks at Fanny)
                <emph>and</emph> associates Keats’s genius with his quill hand; in an especially
                intimate moment, Brown holds and even addresses Keats’s fingers, murmuring, “You
                wrote this, little hand? Did you do it?” In that episode, Brown is intent on
                rescuing Keats’s “talent” from the “trap” that, in his opinion, is a love affair
                with Fanny, but Keats only smiles because, although poems (again, like gowns,
                collars, and pillowslips) are made, he senses that the <emph>best</emph>
                ones are made in a way that preserves and even celebrates craft’s innate affiliation
                with distraction, inconsistency, misjudgment, and the like—with, that is, the
                reality of human (as opposed to mechanized) experience. “Allow me my happiness,”
                Keats says gently to Brown, “for I am writing again,” and the next scenes, which
                mean to portray the composition of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> in fact portray
                <emph>incidents</emph>, not the scribblings that capture them. Pen, ink,
                paper, and chair are carried outdoors on a bright afternoon that reverberates with
                birdsong, and as pieces of <title level="a">Nightingale</title> are read in voiceover, Keats’s quill
                scratches for just a moment; within seconds, however, his chair is shown empty, and
                Campion has cut back to the “men’s room,” where Brown, not Keats, holds a pen as the
                two friends inspect the completed stanzas together. Put simply, whereas Campion
                primarily films Fanny’s hands sewing, she primarily films Keats’s hands
                <emph>living</emph>—petting the Brawnes’ cat, brandishing celery in a faux
                duel, tap-tapping a teaspoon, and, yes, stroking his beloved’s fingers—and it’s in
                those “close-up” moments, we’re made to understand, that Keats’s poetry gets made.
                The <emph>not</emph> writing is, quite counterintuitively, the craft, and
                when Fanny, who struggles to “work out” poems, asks Keats to “say something of the
                craft of poetry,” Keats replies bluntly that craft—presumably as she, perfectionist
                and advocate of “practice,” understands it—“is a sham.”</p>
               <p>Campion suggests, in sum, that to be a poet is first to fail at writing—when Fanny
                remarks that she isn’t “clever” about poetry, Keats, having just been buffeted by
                <title level="j">Blackwood</title>’s, replies, “Neither, it seems, am I”—and in
                <title level="a">Trashing Keats,</title> which examines Keats’s interest in the relationship between
                “museums and refuse” (993), Christopher Rovee portrays Keats as similarly
                paradoxical, counterintuitive. In Keats’s “museal” poems, Rovee contends, “the work
                of art is revitalized by vigorous acts of removal and displacement, a devaluation of
                treasured origins” (1007): “Far from lamenting it,” Rovee continues, “Keats renders
                the dislocation of art as an aesthetic event in its own right, an opportunity to
                cash in poetically” (1009). My position, albeit comparable to Rovee’s, is that
                “displacement” and “dislocation” of the sort that Campion dramatizes when she shows
                Keats’s hands <emph>not</emph> writing is, in some sense,
                <emph>always</emph> the “treasured [origin]” of Keats’s own art—its very
                basis, not just an “opportunity” that presents itself on those relatively rare
                occasions when, say, Greece’s ancient marbles turn up in London’s glass cases.
                Keats’s fragmentary <title level="a">This living hand</title> is central to Rovee’s argument because it
                “performs an eerie exhumation” (1011)—presents, that is, a thrilling “dislocation”
                of an already disembodied object—but I see that piece reflecting the productive
                (mis)alignment of living hands with crafting hands that Campion posits in
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Campion doesn’t explicitly
                cite <title level="a">This living hand.</title> However, like any period film, <title level="m">Bright
                Star</title> brings “red life… again” to figures long since “cold” (6, 3), and as
                imaged by Campion, Keats, from “the icy silence of the tomb,” becomes, literally and
                repeatedly, a “living hand… warm and capable” (3, 1). Even more importantly,
                Campion’s crafting-without-writing Keats captures the lyric hand’s capacity to
                persist into the future—to “haunt” and to “chill” (4)—without the aid of
                a pen.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her
                            treatment of Keats and the tradition of the Romantic commonplace book,
                            Jillian Hess notes that when Keats “correct[ed] a single word in
                            [Woodhouse’s] commonplace book,” Woodhouse himself was less interested
                            in “the poem’s content”—that is, <emph>what</emph> Keats had
                            written—than in “the imprint of Keats’s body”: “Woodhouse felt that his
                            collection’s value increased merely because Keats had touched it” (19).
                            As in <title level="a">This living hand,</title> the hand—<emph>not</emph> the
                            hand<emph>writing</emph>—carries significance; within
                            Keats’s coterie, the living poet’s acknowledgement of the error was more
                            valuable than the marks he made to repair it.</note> The
                “living hand” <emph>could</emph>, we are assured, hold a quill—it’s
                “capable / Of earnest grasping,” Keats indicates (1–2)—but instead of writing, the
                hand simply exists, forges an enduring spatial and sensory connection with the
                poem’s silent interlocutor: “See here it is— / I hold it toward you” (7–8). There’s
                a lot that’s ugly about that final offer and the threats that precede it—as Rovee
                notes, readers have long “derided… [the poem’s] hostility and aggressiveness, [its]
                seemingly ungenerous stance out of keeping with the likeably selfless Keats”
                (1011)—but that inconsistency is, I argue, in itself
                <emph>consistent</emph> with Keats’s interest in imperfection, in a poetry of halves,
                as he articulates that interest in the negative capability letter and as Campion
                portrays it in <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Indeed, the very text of <title level="a">This
                living hand</title> is, grammatically speaking, so inconsistent as to be almost unreadable,
                even by the standards one might use to judge a poetic fragment. Careening from the
                present to the future and from the blandly indicative (“here it is”) to the
                dramatically subjunctive (“thou would wish… / So… red life might” [5–6]), it’s a
                poem (or a piece of one) that succeeds creatively because it fails discursively.
                <title level="a">This living hand,</title> one might say, resists being written—or read—in favor of being
                lived, of being proved upon our pulses.</p>
               <p> Illegibility, misalignment, failure, and even ugliness: Like <title level="a">Nightingale</title>’s
                “forlorn,” those words “toll me back”—not to “my sole self” but to Etsy, where
                Keatsiana is notably well represented among the handicrafts for sale. To search
                “John Keats” while limiting the results to “handmade” (as opposed to “vintage,” a
                category of goods that Etsy also purveys) was, at the time of this writing,<note place="foot" resp="author"> The data in
                            this essay regarding items on sale at Etsy.com were collected in early
                            October, 2017. In late September, 2019, a search for “John Keats”
                            limited to “handmade” yielded 225 hits. Parallel searches for Blake and
                            Byron yielded 513 and 224 hits, respectively.</note> to get 162
                hits. To search for “handmade” items featuring the other Big Sixers was to find that
                Keats’s number was bested only by Blake (at 349) and by Byron (at 225), and having
                completed some careful sorting, I attribute Blake’s and Byron’s robust Etsy
                presences to the fact that the former’s illuminations make for great t-shirt art
                (and the like), while the latter’s very name can signify gentlemanly luxury, as one
                shop’s “Lord Byron Dandy Handkerchiefs” and another’s “Lord Byron’s Brand Beard Oil”
                suggest. In other words, Blake’s and Byron’s Etsy prominence is inflated by what I
                would describe as extra-literary factors; Keats, in contrast, is primarily
                represented by Etsy sellers through his words—calligraphed onto broadsides,
                embroidered onto sachets, etched onto bracelets—and at the time of my assessment,
                the number of products linked to Keats dwarfed the number of products linked to
                Wordsworth (at 107), Coleridge (at 14), and Shelley (at 61).<note place="foot" resp="author">  In late
                            September, 2019, the numbers for Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley were
                            136, 16, and 40, respectively.</note> What factors, then, are
                responsible for Keats’s relative popularity, his unique appeal to Etsy’s artisans?
                Rovee’s argument makes it easy to imagine the delight that Keats might have
                experienced upon seeing his words “displace[d]” and “dislocat[ed]” onto
                twenty-first-century handicrafts, but unless we believe that, in addition to
                crafting, Etsy’s purveyors of Keatsiana stay abreast of the academy’s discourse,
                Rovee’s argument can’t in itself account for their penchant for Keats in the first
                place. It’s not at all inconceivable that bookish crafters have recognized, without
                the help of Rovee or Adorno, a connection between their own work and Keats’s
                “museal” poems; after all, like the Keats who composed <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title>
                Keatsiana crafters are making new art from old fragments both verbal and, quite
                often, material. However, although <title level="a">Urn</title>’s truth-and-beauty bit—and
                <emph>only</emph> that bit, really—was referenced in a few shops, other
                explicitly “museal” poems (in addition to <title level="a">This living hand,</title> Rovee
                highlights <title level="a">On First Seeing the Elgin Marbles</title>) didn’t figure at all among the Keatsian goods for
                sale on Etsy in October of 2017. Rather, crafters concentrated on Keats’s letters,
                passages from which were featured in a plurality of the marketplace’s Keats things
                (thirty-three, by my count), and, significantly, on the juvenilia—on, that is,
                Keats’s least polished, least finished poetry. “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”
                was a favorite quotation<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Brian Rejack observes in his essay for this
                            collection, the first line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> welcomed
                            visitors to the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857—a
                            circumstance that, in itself, attests to the special place that Keats
                            has long occupied in the hearts and minds of artists and artisans of
                            various types.</note>—eleven items used it—but <title level="a">The Grasshopper
                and the Cricket</title> and <title level="a">Sleep and Poetry</title> were less predictable presences represented
                by excerpts (“the Poetry of earth is never dead” [1] and “stop and consider! Life is
                but a day” [85], respectively) that, like the first line of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, characterize aesthetic pleasure as there for the taking, if only
                one “stop[s]” to “consider” it.</p>
               <p>To my mind, then, Keats’s Etsy prominence is most likely attributable to crafters’
                sense that Keats, like themselves, made <emph>by</emph> living—by feeling,
                piecing, experimenting, and failing—even as he struggled to make
                <emph>a</emph> living. Keats’s iconic sonnet on the sonnet, famously embedded in an
                aggregated, newsy, living-full letter to George and Georgiana Keats, attests to the
                truth in that portrait; the poet-speaker of “If by dull rhymes” identifies as an
                uncertain crafter, a Fanny-esque fashionista (albeit cobbler, not dressmaker) who
                hopes to “find out” “sandals more interwoven and complete / To fit the naked foot of
                poesy” (4–6). “Find out” conveys the pen-less experiences—later specified as
                “inspect[ing],” “weigh[ing],” “see[ing],” and simply paying “attention meet”
                (7–9)—that underwrite his writing, while “more” captures the asymptotic (or,
                perhaps, Ruskinian) character of his larger enterprise, the fact that unqualified
                “interwoven”-ness and “complete”-ness will <emph>remain</emph> unattained,
                unattainable. In addition, “more” corresponds meaningfully with the term “better” in
                the letter’s pre-poem commentary, which explicitly denies that “If by dull rhymes”
                achieves prosodic perfection: “I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet
                Stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language over well from the
                pouncing rhymes—the other kind appears too elegiac—and the couplet at the end of it
                has seldom a pleasing effect.” “I do not pretend to have succeeded,” Keats concludes
                (255), and to examine “sound and syllable” in “If by dull rhymes” is to appreciate
                the fairness of his doubts, to recognize the degree to which his interest in
                loosening the sonnet’s traditional “chain[s]” (10, 1) has resulted in a scheme
                arguably <emph>less</emph> “interwoven” than “more” so.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    I say “arguably” because one’s definition of “interwoven” matters. I offer an
                            alternative reading of the wovenness in “If by dull rhymes” in
                        <title level="m">Poetics of Luxury in the Nineteenth Century: Keats,
                                Tennyson, and Hopkins</title> (63–65).</note> Indeed, it’s
                only in the last four lines that Keats, by nixing the English sonnet’s “seldom…
                pleasing” couplet in favor of alternating (but, in the case of “crown” and “own,”
                slanted) rhymes, manifests something like a sonic weave; the poem’s ninth through
                thirteenth lines constitute a stretch dramatically (for a sonnet, anyway) devoid of
                end rhyme, and by the time we reach line twelve’s “be,” that word’s chance to chime,
                even “[un]pouncing[ly],” with line four’s “poesy” has long since passed. And yet,
                the <emph>presence</emph> of those imperfections, those products of a
                makerly temperament more investigative than ends-obsessed, corresponds quite
                directly with the important sentiment articulated near the sonnet’s close: “Let us
                be / Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown” (11–12). To make anew is first
                to disrupt or even destroy, to <emph>reverse</emph> the finishing process
                by plucking away the old and “dead.” Successful acts of positive creation come much
                later and, still later, again; as the sonnet’s final lines suggest, the lady Poesy’s
                fresh “garlands” have yet to be produced, and this poem, punctuated by three “if”s,
                is less a perfectly finished exemplar than a mock-up, a sketch of a conditional
                future: “So, if we may not let the Muse be free, / She will be bound with garlands
                of her own” (13–14).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See also Emma Suret’s similar claim (realized as a
                            sewing metaphor, no less) that “instead of a sustained description,
                            ‘like Andromeda,’ ‘in spite of painèd loveliness,” and ‘if we must be
                            constrained’ created a patchwork of clauses with their comma-stitched
                            outlines disrupting the continuity of Keats’s argument” (150). Suret’s
                            broader reading of “If by dull rhymes” gestures toward the poem’s
                            numerous successful failures.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Put simply, “If by dull rhymes” embodies, at best, but “half knowledge,” and even the
                post-juvenilia Keats remains, perhaps, the ultimate amateur artisan: He made good
                <emph>because</emph> he wasn’t perfect, because the flaws in his
                application, his taste, and his psyche seeded, not impeded, the work that made his
                name. To creative giggers (I refer, in that term, to Etsy’s role in the so-called
                “gig economy” of the twenty-first century), Keats’s experience must seem both real
                and aspirational, and it’s <emph>their</emph> Keats that Campion captures
                in her craft-centric, handsy portrayal of an imperfect (and ultimately un-Austenian)
                early nineteenth century. Now, I can’t see what Keatsiana was for sale while Campion
                was writing and/or directing <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, and it’s possible
                that I’ve got it backwards, that Etsy’s current Keats-oriented offerings (and their
                relative abundance) were influenced by the film, not vice versa. I acknowledge that
                several items for sale at the time of this composition quoted the poem <title level="a">Bright
                Star,</title> and like Campion, who admitted to having struggled with much of Keats’s
                poetry, Etsy crafters are, as I have noted, especially focused on Keats’s
                letters (Sullivan 87). In an episode at the end of the
                film, however, I see a hint that the Keats imagined—not necessarily unfairly or
                unmeaningfully, I want to emphasize—by contemporary crafters was resonant enough to
                guide Campion’s vision. When Brown delivers the news of Keats’s death to the Brawne
                family, he reads aloud Joseph Severn’s letter describing the poet’s last moments. At
                the line, “Keats died imperceptibly,” Fanny abruptly stops Brown and steps toward
                the staircase, where, quickly engulfed in uncontrollable sobs, she clutches her
                throat and gasps frantically, “Mama! I can’t breathe!” There’s nothing
                “imperceptibl[e]” about Fanny’s pain or panic as her last hopes pass, and she seems,
                somehow, to be living Keats’s blood-choked final days—to be possessed of his
                tubercular chest, which she repeatedly jabs with impotent fingers. It’s a moving
                moment, and it evokes a quotation particularly popular among Etsy’s Keatsiana
                crafters, one that appeared in October 2017, in or on twice as many items as, say,
                lines from <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title>: “Two souls with but a single thought / Two hearts
                that beat as one.” If Campion was inspired by those lines—if, that is, her Fanny
                feels death because <emph>Keats’s</emph> heart no longer beats—I’m certain
                that she didn’t encounter them in a collection of Keats’s writings or in Andrew
                Motion’s biography of the poet, with which she also worked closely. I’m certain
                because, of course, the lines at issue—again, “Two souls with but a single thought /
                Two hearts that beat as one”—weren’t written by Keats at all, though they’re often
                attributed to him. (<title level="m">The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</title>
                identifies the quotation’s true source as Maria Lovell’s <title level="m">Ingomar
                the Barbarian</title>, a translation of a play by Friedrich Halm [Knowles 222].) I
                recognize that even if Campion had those lines in mind, I can’t, obviously, be sure
                that she discovered them while perusing Etsy, since the misattribution in question
                dwells in a variety of the internet’s dark hollows. Still, <title level="m">Bright
                Star</title>’s broader emphases on images of hands and on the notion of life as
                craft—“Buy, Sell, and <emph>Live</emph> Handmade” was, Krugh notes, the
                centerpiece of Etsy’s 2010 mission statement (297; emphasis added)—render the
                prospect appealing. Even more appealing (if, perhaps, less plausible) is the
                possibility that Campion <emph>recognized</emph> the “two souls”/“two
                hearts” passage as <emph>not</emph> belonging to Keats—that, in other
                words, she purposely alluded to the fact that, at the core of Keats’s Etsy presence,
                imperfection resides in its most perfect form: error, plain and simple.</p>
               <p>In fact, error and physiological (in)coordination together constitute the foundation
                of <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s namesake sonnet, which opens with a doomed
                attempt to correct, imaginatively, for the exigencies of immortality and closes with
                a picture of the speaker “pillowed upon [his] fair love’s ripening breast,”
                “feel[ing]” her chest’s “soft fall and swell” and “hear[ing] her tender-taken
                breath” (10–11, 13). The star’s icy isolation can’t be “unperplex[ed]” from its
                “steadfast[ness],” despite Keats’s aggressive “Not” and “No” (1–2, 9); the former is
                a precondition of the latter, since to live in warm proximity is, of course, to be
                subject to the rot that succeeds all “ripening.” The speaker of <title level="a">Bright Star,</title> then,
                <emph>misattributes</emph> pleasure to uncompromised
                fulfilment—ascribes it not to living, but to immortality; not to feeling, but to
                “feel[ing]… <emph>forever</emph>” (11; emphasis added)—and the result is a
                poem whose author seems to reach, like Campion’s crafter-heroine, for absolute
                precision, for an outcome “very perfect.” However, although <title level="a">Bright Star</title> (unlike
                <title level="a">If by dull rhymes</title>) boasts an almost clinically ideal Shakespearean rhyme scheme,
                the subtle misalignment of “unchangeable” (9) and “swell” (11) highlights the
                central Keatsian-<emph>cum</emph>-Etsian truth at play: Living—metonymized
                in the breast that “swell[s]” with “breath”—doesn’t rhyme, literally or
                metaphorically, with perfection, with the “unchangeable” (that is, the ever
                symmetrical, “exactly even,” or otherwise “unperplex[ed]”) forms generated by
                machines and, sometimes, by those misguided human makers who fetishize machine-like
                accuracy. Indeed, to pay “attention meet” to the intimate pleasures described in
                <title level="a">Bright Star</title> is to note that their very wellspring is asymmetry, even distortion.
                Keats’s speaker “hear[s]” and “feel[s]” tonight because he, unlike his sleeping
                beloved, lies awake, and although the sonnet describes his “unrest” as “sweet” (12),
                we can’t but imagine that his partner’s rest is <emph>un</emph>sweet,
                pursued as it is beneath the weight of an insomniac’s head. Is her pleasantly
                “tender” breathing actually labored—that is, <emph>made</emph> audible and
                physically sensible by the less than ideal material circumstances that delimit her
                slumber? Is she, perhaps, nearly as frantic for air as Campion’s Fanny, who, upon
                learning of Keats’s death, claims “I can’t breathe”? Considered in tandem,
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s “two hearts” that seem to “beat as one” and
                <title level="a">Bright Star</title>’s single (and possibly tortured) breast hint at the thready unevenness
                that, more often than not, both defines and energizes Keatsian making.</p>
               <p>It’s worth noting that Etsy’s crafters are also partial to an authentic Keats
                quotation (from one of the poet’s most famous love letters to Fanny Brawne) about
                adoration and respiration. Last fall, the words, “My love is selfish—I cannot
                breathe without you” (335), ornamented a number of the site’s Keats-inspired charms
                and sentimental whatnots, but since that genuine Keatsian construction, which
                Campion seems to reference obliquely much earlier in the film,<note place="foot" resp="author"> When Keats is
                            away from Hampstead, Fanny attests to an inability to breathe. In the
                            shooting script, she declares solipsistically to her mother, “When I do
                            not hear from him it is as if I have died, as if the air is sucked out
                            of my lungs and I am left desolate, but when I receive a letter I know
                            our world is real and it is the only one I care for”
                    (54).</note> fails to capture the sense of <emph>union</emph>—of two
                moving as one—that the misattribution does, it’s less credible as
                a potential inspiration for the perverse “wedding” with which the film concludes. As
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> closes, Campion meaningfully documents the
                good and the goods that derive from Fanny’s experience living failure through Keats,
                and in the scene that follows her episode of panicked gasping, we watch Fanny’s
                fingers stitch some new and very different clothing: widow’s weeds. A made-over
                Fanny soon emerges from the house, a black blot on the bridal-white winter
                landscape, and then the “minx” who once struggled to “work out” poetry recites
                Keats’s <title level="a">Bright Star</title> start to finish. It’s the first poem that Campion incorporates
                in its <emph>entirety</emph>—that is, perfectly—but we’re not allowed to
                forget the partialities and imperfections that, within the context of the film,
                inspired the sonnet’s composition and reflect in Fanny’s pained delivery of its
                paradox-infused lines. In lieu of a traditional wedding—the standard final scene in
                an Austen adaptation, of course—<title level="m">Bright Star</title> concludes, I
                would suggest, by underscoring the uncomfortable union that underlies craft,
                <emph>i.e.</emph> the union of living with making. All things considered,
                then, it may be appropriate (or appropriately inappropriate) that to search Etsy for
                “handmade” items tagged “John Keats” is to find, listed in the midst of bracelets
                and paper goods, a single dress: RanunculusMarket’s “Jane Austen Wedding Dress,”
                complete with ribbon laces that can, the seller assures potential buyers, “be tied
                at a tightness anywhere between ease of breathing and fainting spell.” Wearers, it
                seems, can “live ever—or else swoon to death” (14).</p>

               <p>Midway through <title level="m">Bridget Jones’s Diary</title> (Sharon Maguire’s 2001
                film based on Helen Fielding’s 1996 novel of the same name), the eponymous
                character, played by Renée Zellweger, finds herself enjoying a gorgeous day on the
                water near a country hotel. Rowing a small boat, she is flanked in another by Daniel
                Cleaver (Hugh Grant), her caddish boss with whom she is having a fling. The two
                urbanites look out of place in such a rustic setting, but their tacky and obviously
                drunken behavior has its charm. Indeed, a short distance away, even the restrained
                Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who sullenly pilots a third boat, envies the fun the other
                two are having; he is stuck with his with his icy girlfriend Natasha (Embeth
                Davidtz), who ignores the natural beauty around her and focuses on work
                papers—that is, until Bridget and Daniel’s rowdiness elicits a sneer from her.
                Mark, like his Austenian namesake (and Firthian specialty), is destined to be Mr.
                Wrong until he’s Mr. Right, so, for the moment, he insincerely echoes Natasha’s
                disapproval. Still, his face betrays a muted longing for the frolicsome Bridget.</p>
               <p>Bridget and Daniel’s antics are full of laughs and splashes and a reference to 1997’s
                    <title level="m">Titanic</title>. All of that feels quite expected. Less so is
                Bridget’s botched but emphatically-delivered non-sequitur from Keats’s <title level="a">To Autumn</title>: “Season of mists and… <emph>mellow
                    fruitlessness</emph>!!!”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For this and subsequent
                    references to the finished film—not the screenplay—see the works
                    cited entry for Maguire’s <title level="m">Bridget Jones's Diary</title>; no
                    page references available.</note> Daniel, chomping on a cigarette, shares her
                exuberance: “Ah, f— me, I love Keats!” Then he launches into a bawdy limerick
                (“There was a young woman from Ealing!”).</p>
               <p>This Keatsian moment is brief, but it bears comment, especially in the context of the
                present essay collection on Keats and popular culture. What is <title level="a">To
                    Autumn</title> doing here—in the summer, in a boat, with a couple of
                sozzled yuppies?</p>
               <p>For one thing, there’s the cachet of knowing Keats. Bridget and Daniel work in
                publishing, and such a display—even in mockery, as here—suggests their
                status and erudition. For another, it is a proclamation of belonging: Bridget may be
                a Londoner, but if she can wield her university education in a way that makes nature
                legible, then she needn’t feel lost in the rustic realm. Never mind that Keats is
                arguably the wrong poet for such a green-Romantic purpose and that the season and
                locale ill suit the poem.</p>
               <p>Add to that the Keatsiness of Bridget, the smart but hapless chronicler of personal
                experience who fairly fumbles her way to success—the cash-strapped resident of
                London who struggles with insecurity, self-knowledge, family, love, and professional
                direction. In this way, even if <title level="a">To Autumn</title> is the wrong
                poem, Bridget’s affinity for Keats makes good sense.</p>
               <p>And, of course it also matters that she <emph>mis</emph>quotes the poem, substituting
                “fruitlessness” for Keats’s “fruitfulness.” Whereas Keats’s autumn is a time of
                bounty (and for the sake of brevity I am deliberately ignoring the poem’s well-noted
                ambivalences and political contingencies here), Bridget’s harvest is empty-handed.
                It is in this context that the quote works best. Bridget’s season with Daniel, soon
                to end when she finds him with another woman, is indeed “mellow
                fruitlessness”—that is, quite easy but ultimately pointless. Daniel does
                little to combat this idea in the moment, effectively measuring his lack of worth by
                discarding Keats for substance-less vulgarity, but Bridget is too misty and besotted
                to see it. (Similarly, while the film’s original script does not include the <title level="a">To Autumn</title> quotation, it does have Bridget proposing a visit to
                the house that allegedly inspired <title level="m">The Eve of St Agnes</title>, to
                which Daniel responds by dissing Keats, homophobically, as a “frightful nancy-boy”
                (Fielding 79). Bridget’s more fruitful harvest remains to be sought abroad, and her
                misquotation means more than she means it to.</p>
               <p>I begin my response with this example from <title level="m">Bridget Jones’s
                    Diary</title> not because this collection of essays needs yet another data-point
                for Keats’s relevance to popular culture, but because it’s an uncharacteristically
                diegetic and canny instance of popular culture winkingly weighing itself against
                Keats and literary culture more broadly. Positionally, Keats works here in much the
                same way that Austen’s Darcy does vis-à-vis Mark: an allusive presence that
                establishes generic expectations and rewards the knowingness of a certain portion of
                the film’s audience. The film is hardly high-brow, but such moves are nevertheless
                elevating and distinguishing—as for Bridget within the film, so too for <title level="m">Bridget Jones’s Diary</title> itself. Audiences do indeed fall for
                such things—thus Stephen Holden’s <title level="j">New York Times</title>
                review of the film, which characterized it both as “a delicious piece of candy whose
                amusing package is scrawled with bons mots distantly inspired by Jane Austen” and
                “the best and smartest film of its kind” since 1995’s <title level="m">Emma</title>-inspired <title level="m">Clueless</title> (E14). Cobble together
                BBC-style casting, an awkward cameo by Salman Rushdie, and a quote from <title level="a">To Autumn,</title> and this (very funny) film—which is mainly an
                expletive-laden romantic comedy of errors—gets away with ‘intellectual,’ an
                attribution I find less convincing than Zellweger’s English accent. To my mind, the
                movie’s “best and smartest” reputation says less about its plot and performances
                than it does about its carefully-postured, tongue-in-cheek literariness, which is
                Austenian, yes, but also a testament to the presence of Keats.</p>
               <p>To the matter at hand. While it can hardly take the full measure of Keats’s reception
                in four essays, this remarkable collection finds the aforementioned Keats elevation
                and distinction in academia, cyberspace and beyond. Betsy Winakur Tontiplaphol makes
                a powerful case for Keats as type-specimen of Etsy’s culture of artisanal craft; her
                argument, which sifts through some of the many Keatses to be found among the
                handiworks on that site, has interesting resonances with Brian Rejack’s
                multiply-mediated Keats in quotation: in both of these insightful essays we see the
                emergence of a hall-of-mirrors Keats—a hybrid of his self-making and the
                uncontrollable whims and reduplications of the digital era. Likewise, in Christopher
                Rovee’s and Forest Pyle’s essays, we find a Keats in contention, both within the
                ethereal academic context of competing literary methodologies and in the
                biographical and creative contexts of what Pyle calls the “Keats effects.” In all,
                we appreciate what Brian Bates, in his introduction, refers to as the in-betweenness
                of Keats.</p>
               <p>To that point, it strikes me that this collection, altogether, apprehends a
                particularly new and broad definition of popular culture. If popular sits across the
                line from academic, then we have a collection of essays that flirts with the border
                (Cleanth Brooks staring down Jane Campion across the divide, both popularizing
                agents)—like Keats himself reading Chapman’s Homer—interrogating that
                line from both sides. And this is very apt, for who is more emblematic than Keats of
                the permeable boundaries between low and high culture (per Brian Bates’s
                introduction, a creature of the “middlebrow”), and between what is outside and
                inside the halls of academe? One could also contend that there is—beyond the
                academic/non-academic divide—an inherently popular/populist style, one that
                specifically aims to cultivate the widest possible audience with the broadest
                possible appeal (an ideal of the popular instantiated in the works of Raymond
                Williams, Richard Hoggart, and others), and I wonder how Keats, especially in his
                early poetry with its Huntian, esoteric classical references, sorts with this.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For example, see Williams’s <title level="a">On High
                        and Popular Culture</title> and Hoggart’s <title level="m">The Uses of
                        Literacy</title>.</note> This is all to hedge on issues of class, never far
                from the mind of anyone studying Keats; neither far, I should think, from any study
                of popular culture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Holt N. Parker’s <title level="a">Toward a Definition of Popular Culture</title> updates the
                    discussion usefully.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of course we can’t do everything at once, and as such we’ve not done much with
                gender. Keats and gender is always a fascinating topic, and it’s one that has
                amassed a sizable bibliography already, but it would be interesting to think about
                it in the specific context of popular culture. Twenty-first century
                conceptualizations and representations of gender-fluidity might owe more than we’ve
                appreciated to Keats’s camelionics. More superficially and intertextually, my own
                half-baked ideas draw me to HBO’s <title level="m">Game of Thrones</title> (with the
                admission that I haven’t read George R. R. Martin’s novels and don’t plan to). For
                instance, there are echoes of Keats in the characterization of Melisandre (the
                so-called <title level="a">Red Woman</title>). Like Keats’s femmes fatales—the
                belle dame and especially Lamia—she is an expression of a paranoid sexism and
                a (problematic) gendered metaphorical register. In reductively analogical terms, we
                can draw up a basic scheme: the mysterious/seductive/dangerous woman takes advantage
                of the credulous male victim (or several victims); ultimately a keen-eyed
                seer/sage/elder/narrative voice recognizes the femme fatale for what she is, and
                some kind of skepticism, diminishment or disabuse occurs—all of this depicted
                in an antiquarian setting. (I am not suggesting that <title level="m">GoT</title> is
                consciously cribbing Keats, but there are surely common source-texts: not only
                classical sources, but also Medieval tales of fatal women such as those by Chaucer,
                Malory, Mandeville and the authors of <title level="m">Sir Florent</title> and
                    <title level="m">Dame Ragnelle</title>; also Maeterlinck’s and Debussey’s <title level="m">Pelleas et Melisande</title>.) A consideration of Keats might enrich
                or further disturb our understanding of <title level="m">GoT</title>’s notoriously
                troubling portrayals of women characters. The show’s abjection of masculine
                authority (or emasculation) that in turn marks feminine authority as conniving and
                abusive entails a fantasy/mystery feminine logic that is morally obscurative and
                that is typically exploded (yet again) by the moral, restorative light of masculine
                logic.</p>
               <p>Suffice it to say, what we have done here is to begin what
                    I think is an important discussion, not only about Keats’s influence on popular
                    culture, but also about popular culture’s impact on Keats. The poet of the
                    classroom persists in his popularity both as poetic superstar and as a feature
                    of critical debate, adaptation, quotation, and craft. Keats’s un-living hand has
                    grasped more than it reached for—still capable indeed.</p>
