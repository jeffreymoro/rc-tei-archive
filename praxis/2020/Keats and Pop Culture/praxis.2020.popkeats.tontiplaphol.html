               <h1><span class="head">This Living Hand: <em>Bright Star</em> and the Etsy Effect</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>Jane Austen has a way of horning in on my scholarship. One minute, I’m writing about
               Wordsworth and ballet; the next, I’m citing Mr. Darcy’s famous assertion that “every
               savage can dance” (44). I sit down to meditate on Romantic-era vegetarianism, and
               I end up with an essay about—of all things—<em>Mansfield Park</em> and the carnivores who inhabit its eponymous estate. Indeed, Austen has hijacked
               so many projects over the years that I’ve almost come to expect her interference,
               and I wasn’t surprised when she swam into my ken almost as soon as I began, on Brian
               Bates’s kind invitation, to ponder a paper about Jane Campion’s 2009 film <em>Bright Star</em> for this important collection. What <em>did</em> surprise me, however, was that this time, Austen’s interference manifested in another
               scholar’s complaint that she does, in fact, interfere with everything—or, at least,
               with every contemporary cinematic portrayal of nineteenth-century living, <em>Bright Star</em> included. In a compelling essay entitled “The Austen Effect,” Toby Benis argues that
               “the success of screen adaptations of Austen’s novels has been followed by a generation
               of films set during the Romantic period that treat a variety of causes and figures…
               as if they circulated in a novel of manners” (183). Campion’s Fanny Brawne-centered
               Keats biopic, Benis continues, capitulates to that trend by “implicitly equat[ing]
               becoming a great poet with winning the hand of an aspiring lady” (183); the film’s
               Keats is “a lover,” in Benis’s words, “whose successful negotiation of the social
               obstacles to love, most obviously poverty, goes hand in hand with his poetic breakthroughs”
               (185). Benis attributes special influence to Andrew Davies, “the force behind the
               1995 BBC miniseries of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>” (184), and as I pondered that particular connection, the more echoes of Davies’s
               most famous Austenian adaptation I came to see in <em>Bright Star</em> myself. Benis concentrates on the Austenian-formulaic aspects of Campion’s film—she
               notes, for example, that “Campion makes [Charles] Brown into the third figure… of
               an Austenesque triangle of affection and loyalty” and that she “erases… ambivalence”
               by presenting “Fanny’s attraction to and acceptance of Keats as her lover as…straightforward”
               (185, 186)—but I was struck by the more material parallels between Davies’s miniseries
               and <em>Bright Star</em>, from their shared emphasis on scenes at dining tables and in bedchambers to their
               eerily similar opening credit sequences, both of which feature extreme close-ups of
               needlework set to instrumental scores. Parties and balls are central to both portrayals—one
               would expect as much from an adaptation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, but notwithstanding the fact that “every savage can dance,” <em>Bright Star</em>’s concentration on such scenes was initially a bit of a surprise—and Campion, like
               Davies, frequently captures lovers and would-be lovers as they walk, often with sibling
               chaperones, across fields and through woods.</p>
            <p>As <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> reminds us, however, appearances—especially first impressions—can be deceiving, and
               upon closer inspection, Benis’s “Austen effect” begins to seem, as a critical account,
               a bit like George Wickham: too easy and more than a little inconsistent. I’m not sure,
               on second thought, to what degree Campion’s Keats really “negotiat[es]… poverty”—after
               all, he dies as itinerant and dependent as the historical Keats—and I’ve come to question
               the notion that Fanny’s love for Keats, as portrayed by Campion, is “straightforward,”
               devoid of “ambivalence.” When Fanny sends her younger siblings to the bookshop to
               purchase <em>Endymion</em>, Margaret “Toots” Brawne’s remark to the bookseller seems directly to contradict
               Benis’s assertion of doubt-free “attraction and acceptance”: “My sister has met the
               author,” Toots explains, “and she wants to read it for herself to see if he is an
               idiot or not.” Fanny’s stated motive, in other words, hardly suggests that her “attraction”
               to Keats is akin to Emma Thompson’s portrayal of Elinor Dashwood’s fast-formed devotion
               to Edward Ferrars, one of the on-screen Austenian love stories to which Benis compares
               it (186). But I was particularly struck by the bookshop episode because, upon further
               consideration, I realized that it complicated my own sense of the material parallels
               between Campion’s film and Davies’s miniseries at least as much as it challenged Benis’s
               argument about the formulaic similarities in question. The bookshop is inelegant—dun,
               dusty, and dim—and the bookseller’s reply to Samuel Brawne’s request for <em>Endymion</em> is downright crass: “I’ve not sold one and took twenty,” he grouses. From the bookseller’s
               vantage, <em>Endymion</em> is less a poem than a product—a thing, that is, to be bound, stocked, stacked, and
               sold—and in this brief scene and others, Campion shows nineteenth-century England’s
               unvarnished backside to a degree that Davies, in his ever-shimmering <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, never approaches. For instance, although both productions emphasize scenes at tables,
               only Campion shows the dingy kitchens where food is prepared. Both productions feature
               social dancing, but only Campion portrays the drudgery of a dance lesson, one conducted
               in the Brawnes’ narrow sitting room by a pedantic French instructor. Both productions
               feature sibling-chaperoned walks, but only Campion, who highlights the sometimes walk-resistant
               Toots as well as the lovers’ stolen kisses, captures the tensions and limitations
               inherent in that system of virtue-guarding. And although both productions open with
               images of sewing, only Campion (whose initial needlework shots are, thanks to the
               fabric’s ghostly whiteness, more emotionally ambivalent than Davies’s images of colorfully
               embroidered and warmly lit silk) remains interested in the act of stitching and, concomitantly,
               in the fact that clothes—like habits, dancers, food, and, of course, poetry—are <em>made</em>, are the products of material conditions and human efforts that are often unideal
               or even ugly.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Campion has acknowledged that she aimed to achieve in <em>Bright Star</em> something other than a Davies-ish sheen, and in various interviews, she has described
                  the aesthetic to which she aspired as more flawed than flawless. “Most period films,”
                  Campion argued in 2009, “look like antique shops,” and <em>Bright Star</em>, in contrast, is purposely “very bare.” “[We] were very strict,” she says, “about
                  what they were allowed to have in the room. And out of that authenticity it created
                  some boundaries for us. We wanted, if the film could ‘feel’ beautiful, that they would
                  have earned it, rather than saying, this sort of thing should ‘look’ beautiful” (Sullivan
                  86). For Campion, I gather, “bare” primarily means uncluttered or even impoverished;
                  the term “bare,” however, also connotes nakedness—a lifted veil, so to speak—and I
                  concur with Campion’s assertion that <em>Bright Star</em> eschews “thing[s]” that simply “‘look’ beautiful,” or perfectly finished, in favor
                  of objects and experiences that manifest their madeness, that show and even celebrate
                  the productive <em>processes</em> behind or beneath. I ascribe that aesthetic shift to a new pop-cultural influence,
                  a fresh “effect”: In lieu of conventional period-film luxury, Campion’s “bare” portrait
                  of the nineteenth-century emphasizes what I would describe as the ethos of craft and
                  crafting, and as a result, I argue that if <em>Bright Star</em> was shaped by cinematic Austeniana, it’s at least as indebted to the rise of Etsy,
                  the online handicraft marketplace that was established in 2005, four years before <em>Bright Star</em>’s release, and that remains an internet powerhouse today. The fact that Keatsiana—that
                  is, Keats-inspired notecards, broadsides, tote bags, jewelry, decorative <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">objets</span>, and other such material—is surprisingly abundant at Etsy.com suggests that artisans
                  have intuited a special relationship between their work and Keats’s,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>When I use the term “surprisingly abundant,” I’m comparing the quantity of Keatsiana
                           on Etsy to the amount of, say, Wordsworthiana or Shelleyana. I don’t mean to suggest
                           that Keats’s presence on Etsy rivals that of Shakespeare, J.K. Rowling, or other enormous
                           literary and pop-cultural heroes. Specific data appear below.</span></div>
                  </div> and although neither Campion nor the typical Etsy maker-<em>cum</em>-seller acknowledges the prosodic craftsmanship that, for many literary critics, distinguishes
                  Keats’s highly wrought poems, both, I aim to demonstrate, appropriately figure Keats
                  as a champion of craft’s pragmatic and ideological affiliations with the human hand
                  and, as a result, with human imperfection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In her brief history of craft, Michele Krugh doesn’t explicitly posit a relationship
                  between crafting and imperfection, but she does dwell on craft’s essential links,
                  since William Morris’s late nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, to amateurism
                  and handwork, both of which represent alternatives to the flawlessness associated
                  with professionalism and/or mechanized fabrication. With Morris as a “founding [member],”
                  the “Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed in 1877 in reaction against the
                  drive to professionalization within the Royal Institute of British Architects, which
                  wanted to make architecture a closed shop like law and medicine” (Gilmour 231).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In some ways, the origins of the movement date back to the Great Exhibition of 1851;
                           members of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society “publicly rejected the excessive
                           ornamentation and ignorance of materials, which many objects in the Great Exhibition
                           had been criticized for.” Although Morris “only became actively involved with the
                           Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society a number of years after it was set up,” “his ideas
                           were hugely influential to the generation of decorative artists whose work it helped
                           publicize” (
                           “Arts and Crafts”
                           ).</span></div>
                  </div> That said, Morris had long been an acolyte of John Ruskin, whose anti-industrialist
                  commentary on craftsmanship in <em>The Stones of Venice</em> includes an injunction against “demand[ing] an exact finish for its own sake,” as
                  well as a warning about perfection generally: “No good work whatever can be perfect,
                  and the demand for perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of
                  art” (95, 97). Ruskin and Morris wrote with profound political goals in mind, but
                  “the most lasting contributions of the Arts and Crafts movement,” Krugh argues, were
                  “the transformation of craft into a leisure activity and the linking of craft with
                  unalienated labour in opposition to mass production” (288). In other words, today’s
                  makers and consumers are unlikely to ponder a link between craft and Ruskinian theories
                  of social utopia, and although Krugh notes that, “over the course of the twentieth
                  century,” craft also lost some of its affiliation with amateurism, “one aspect that
                  remained constant was the importance of laboring by hand to the meaning of craft”
                  (290). Etsy, which Krugh describes as “the first and largest craft e-commerce site”
                  and “a global, online marketplace” (291), has continued to compromise craft’s relationship
                  to amateurism by suggesting (somewhat disingenuously, it turns out) that the crafter’s
                  “pleasurable and creative work” can, more easily than ever, become “a day job” (Krugh
                  294). Nonetheless, Krugh observes, Etsy still celebrates the hand—its intimacy, its
                  idiosyncrasy, its authenticity—in a host of ways but most notably through its affiliated
                  blog’s “articles on featured shops,” which typically “include interviews with the
                  sellers and beautiful photographs of their workspaces and their products, and more
                  importantly, of them making their crafts.” As Krugh indicates, these narratives “usually
                  [include] close-ups of [sellers’] hands as evidence of the ‘handmade’ labour of production”
                  (294).</p>
            </div>
            <p>To my mind, Krugh’s account of the standard imagery in an Etsy Blog article—“workspaces,”
               “products,” “making,” and, most importantly, “hands,” all possessed of a constructed,
               not an innate, beauty—uncannily evokes the aesthetic of <em>Bright Star</em>, in which, as I’ve noted, no object or experience (be it dress, dance, or poem) is
               portrayed as isolated from the human forces, the backstage labor, that brought it
               into existence. The film’s most obviously Etsy-ish moments represent Fanny, an aspiring
               fashion designer who early and confidently asserts in the manner of an Etsy ingenue
               that her work, which Brown denigrates as a girlish “obsession with flounce and cross
               stitch,” <em>will</em> earn her money—that is, will become “a day job” both satisfying and elevating. The
               work isn’t easy—as Margarida Pereira observes, “Fanny presents her stitching as a
               form of art as difficult and as complex as poetry writing” (163)—and Campion treats
               us to shot after shot of the studio-esque domestic spaces in which Fanny’s skilled
               hands, often shown in “close-ups,” gather, rip, pin, and sew the textiles destined
               to become either pieces in Fanny’s own wardrobe or exquisite gifts, such as the pillowslip
               that she embroiders for the late Tom Keats. However, in addition to watching Fanny
               work with nimble fingers, we hear her describe, with enthusiasm and technical specificity,
               the items that she makes and that other stitchers, she boasts, have “copied.” “Craft,”
               Krugh argues, “is about the personality of the maker” (293), and she cites Dixie Laite’s
               2013 Etsy Blog piece about “branding” a “memorable Etsy shop,” which reminds sellers
               that “the story behind [one’s] products can attract customers because it makes what
               they’re buying special—and by extension, it makes them feel special” (293). Krugh
               notes that the vast majority of Etsy’s vendors are female—eighty-eight percent, according
               to a 2013 report from Etsy itself (291)—and Campion’s heroine seems both to intuit
               and to prove the truth of Laite’s advice about craft and narrative. Although Brown
               patronizingly addresses Fanny as “the very well stitched little Miss Brawne, in all
               her detail”—he, it’s clear, has heard her talk shop too many times before—Keats’s
               “attract[ion]” to Fanny takes root in the early scenes in which she explains with
               pride that, among other feats of couture, she has “originated the pleats on [her]
               dress” and devised a one-of-a-kind “triple-pleated mushroom collar.”</p>
            <p>But the episode in which Fanny enthuses, blog-style, about the mushroom collar also
               highlights a problematic aspect of her crafting “personality,” as Campion imagines
               it: Notwithstanding handwork’s innate affiliation with the limitations and vicissitudes
               of human makers, Fanny seeks perfection, not just “special[ness],” in craft. Fanny
               has worn the collar to a dance, and as she stands with her back to a large mirror,
               she says almost smugly to Keats, “This is the first frock in Woolwich or Hampstead
               to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.” When Keats gravely replies, “Behind you
               I see one I fear to be identical,” Fanny’s face falls, and although she appreciates
               the joke when she spins around (the “identical” collar is, of course, her own collar
               reflected in the mirror), her reaction to the prospect of imperfection—in this case,
               to the prospect of being second, not first—indicates that she has a significant blind
               spot with regard to craft and, indeed, “personality,” a concept anchored in deviation
               from (not adherence to) a flawless ideal. Fanny’s first speech in the shooting script
               of <em>Bright Star</em> finds her criticizing her little sister’s deficient sewing—“The stitches must be
               small and exactly even,” she complains to their mother (1)—and although that bit was
               cut from the final film, Fanny frequently articulates a taste, even a compulsion,
               for an ultimately unachievable perfection in craft. When, for example, she decides
               to make lemon wafers for Keats’s ill brother, she discards all but the flawless ones
               <em>and</em> clips Toots’s ribbon (right off her dress, in fact) to decorate the basket: “I cannot
               offer poor Mr. Keats’s brother anything that is not perfect,” she declares. Notwithstanding
               her mother’s shock and her sister’s protestation, Fanny fails to recognize the deficiencies—the
               waste, the inconsideration, and so forth—that, ironically, inhere in her quest to
               “offer” something both crafted <em>and</em> “perfect,” and later, upon delivering the wafers to Keats, Fanny persists in a futile
               effort to isolate the ideal, to separate the flawless from the flawed, in her evaluation
               of poetic craft: “I am very sorry I could not love your <em>Endymion</em> completely, Mr. Keats,” she says, “…but I thought the beginning of your poem something
               very perfect.” Fanny means, of course, to elevate <em>Endymion</em>’s renowned opening lines, but her remark highlights the fact that, when considered
               as a whole, Keats’s romance <em>isn’t</em> whole, isn’t poetically “complete.” In other words, Fanny’s attempt to celebrate
               perfection becomes, even as she shapes her compliment, an observation about inadequacy,
               about the inability of flawlessness to <em>hold</em> in something made.</p>
            <p>Fanny’s standard, Campion seems to suggest, is clear but, for a maker, untenable and,
               after a while, even unappealing; like Keats’s doomed and often unsympathetic Lamia,
               Fanny aims to “unperplex bliss from its neighbor pain” by “defin[ing] their pettish
               limits” and “estrang[ing] their points of contact” (I.192-4). Perfection is her object,
               and as she early declares to Brown, critic of “flounce,” she “[doesn’t] shake hands
               with the enemy.” The film’s Keats, in contrast, is much more closely associated with
               makerly <em>im</em>perfection—with creative inefficiency, expressive immaturity, and physical frailty—and
               although much of the critical discourse surrounding <em>Bright Star</em> emphasizes Fanny’s salutary effect on Keats (Julian North, in a representative essay,
               argues that Campion “represents Keats’s genius as nurtured by Fanny and flourishing
               harmoniously within her affectionate, domestic world” [83]), I want to underscore
               Campion’s implicit suggestion that through Keats, Fanny learns, to the ultimate benefit
               of her craft and the “personality” that inspires it, to brook and even to embrace
               the unideal. That rhetoric—<em>i.e.</em> “to embrace the unideal”—evokes, I hope, the concept of negative capability. Scholarly
               accounts of <em>Bright Star</em>’s engagement with negative capability have focused on Keats’s important interest
               in the obliteration of ego—North, for example, sees Campion exploring the “surrender
               of selfhood” and the “ability to accept the existence of other centres of consciousness”
               (81), while Pereira highlights the film’s “direct” reference to Keats’s “poet has…
               no identity” letter (157)—but Keats explicitly <em>defines</em> negative capability, in a remark about Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as the capacity “[to
               remain] content with half knowledge,” with a product or outcome less than perfect
               (43). Coleridge, he argues, isn’t negatively capable because, rather than accepting
               the “half” for the fullness it offers, he insists, like Fanny, on fullness proper,
               on “something very perfect.” Keats, in contrast, affiliates successful poetic making
               with accepting the unfinished or misaligned, and when, in a subsequent but related
               letter, he expresses his distaste for perfect poems, he portrays such objects (and,
               metonymically, their authors) as similar to Campion’s indignant Fanny, whose Lamian
               interest in “pettish limits” renders her unwilling, as she says, even to “shake hands
               with the enemy”: “We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us,” Keats writes,
               “and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket” (<em>Letters</em> 61).</p>
            <p>I highlight this charming image—a petulant poem refusing, Fanny-style, to shake hands
               with a reader who “do[es] not agree” with its “design,” its poetic perfection—because
               although Keats’s hands figure at least as prominently in <em>Bright Star</em> as Fanny’s, Campion rarely shows them <em>writing</em>, rarely shows them performing the physical act most closely, most perfectly, associated
               with Keats’s craft. Only Brown, a poetic nobody, repeatedly foregrounds the act of
               writing (“Men’s room—<em>out</em>—poets got to do a bit of writing,” he barks at Fanny) <em>and</em> associates Keats’s genius with his quill hand; in an especially intimate moment,
               Brown holds and even addresses Keats’s fingers, murmuring, “You wrote this, little
               hand? Did you do it?” In that episode, Brown is intent on rescuing Keats’s “talent”
               from the “trap” that, in his opinion, is a love affair with Fanny, but Keats only
               smiles because, although poems (again, like gowns, collars, and pillowslips) are made,
               he senses that the <em>best</em> ones are made in a way that preserves and even celebrates craft’s innate affiliation
               with distraction, inconsistency, misjudgment, and the like—with, that is, the reality
               of human (as opposed to mechanized) experience. “Allow me my happiness,” Keats says
               gently to Brown, “for I am writing again,” and the next scenes, which mean to portray
               the composition of 
               “Ode to a Nightingale,”
               in fact portray <em>incidents</em>, not the scribblings that capture them. Pen, ink, paper, and chair are carried outdoors
               on a bright afternoon that reverberates with birdsong, and as pieces of 
               “Nightingale”
               are read in voiceover, Keats’s quill scratches for just a moment; within seconds,
               however, his chair is shown empty, and Campion has cut back to the “men’s room,” where
               Brown, not Keats, holds a pen as the two friends inspect the completed stanzas together.
               Put simply, whereas Campion primarily films Fanny’s hands sewing, she primarily films
               Keats’s hands <em>living</em>—petting the Brawnes’ cat, brandishing celery in a faux duel, tap-tapping a teaspoon,
               and, yes, stroking his beloved’s fingers—and it’s in those “close-up” moments, we’re
               made to understand, that Keats’s poetry gets made. The <em>not</em> writing is, quite counterintuitively, the craft, and when Fanny, who struggles to
               “work out” poems, asks Keats to “say something of the craft of poetry,” Keats replies
               bluntly that craft—presumably as she, perfectionist and advocate of “practice,” understands
               it—“is a sham.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Campion suggests, in sum, that to be a poet is first to fail at writing—when Fanny
                  remarks that she isn’t “clever” about poetry, Keats, having just been buffeted by <em>Blackwood</em>’s, replies, “Neither, it seems, am I”—and in 
                  “Trashing Keats,”
                   which examines Keats’s interest in the relationship between “museums and refuse” (993),
                  Christopher Rovee portrays Keats as similarly paradoxical, counterintuitive. In Keats’s
                  “museal” poems, Rovee contends, “the work of art is revitalized by vigorous acts of
                  removal and displacement, a devaluation of treasured origins” (1007): “Far from lamenting
                  it,” Rovee continues, “Keats renders the dislocation of art as an aesthetic event
                  in its own right, an opportunity to cash in poetically” (1009). My position, albeit
                  comparable to Rovee’s, is that “displacement” and “dislocation” of the sort that Campion
                  dramatizes when she shows Keats’s hands <em>not</em> writing is, in some sense, <em>always</em> the “treasured [origin]” of Keats’s own art—its very basis, not just an “opportunity”
                  that presents itself on those relatively rare occasions when, say, Greece’s ancient
                  marbles turn up in London’s glass cases. Keats’s fragmentary 
                  “This living hand”
                   is central to Rovee’s argument because it “performs an eerie exhumation” (1011)—presents,
                  that is, a thrilling “dislocation” of an already disembodied object—but I see that
                  piece reflecting the productive (mis)alignment of living hands with crafting hands
                  that Campion posits in <em>Bright Star</em>. Campion doesn’t explicitly cite 
                  “This living hand.”
                   However, like any period film, <em>Bright Star</em> brings “red life… again” to figures long since “cold” (6, 3), and as imaged by Campion,
                  Keats, from “the icy silence of the tomb,” becomes, literally and repeatedly, a “living
                  hand… warm and capable” (3, 1). Even more importantly, Campion’s crafting-without-writing
                  Keats captures the lyric hand’s capacity to persist into the future—to “haunt” and
                  to “chill” (4)—without the aid of a pen.

                           Hess notes that when Keats “correct[ed] a single word in [Woodhouse’s] commonplace
                           book,” Woodhouse himself was less interested in “the poem’s content”—that is, what
                           Keats had written—than in “the imprint of Keats’s body”: “Woodhouse felt that his
                           collection’s value increased merely because Keats had touched it” (19). As in 
                           “This living hand,”
                           the hand—not the handwriting—carries significance; within Keats’s coterie, the living

                  </div> The “living hand” <em>could</em>, we are assured, hold a quill—it’s “capable / Of earnest grasping,” Keats indicates
                  (1–2)—but instead of writing, the hand simply exists, forges an enduring spatial and
                  sensory connection with the poem’s silent interlocutor: “See here it is— / I hold
                  it toward you” (7–8). There’s a lot that’s ugly about that final offer and the threats
                  that precede it—as Rovee notes, readers have long “derided… [the poem’s] hostility
                  and aggressiveness, [its] seemingly ungenerous stance out of keeping with the likeably
                  selfless Keats” (1011)—but that inconsistency is, I argue, in itself <em>consistent</em> with Keats’s interest in imperfection, in a poetry of halves, as he articulates that
                  interest in the negative capability letter and as Campion portrays it in <em>Bright Star</em>. Indeed, the very text of 
                  “This living hand”
                   is, grammatically speaking, so inconsistent as to be almost unreadable, even by the
                  standards one might use to judge a poetic fragment. Careening from the present to
                  the future and from the blandly indicative (“here it is”) to the dramatically subjunctive
                  (“thou would wish… / So… red life might” [5–6]), it’s a poem (or a piece of one) that
                  succeeds creatively because it fails discursively. 
                  “This living hand,”
                   one might say, resists being written—or read—in favor of being lived, of being proved

                  to find that Keats’s number was bested only by Blake (at 349) and by Byron (at 225),
                  and having completed some careful sorting, I attribute Blake’s and Byron’s robust
                  Etsy presences to the fact that the former’s illuminations make for great t-shirt
                  art (and the like), while the latter’s very name can signify gentlemanly luxury, as
                  one shop’s “Lord Byron Dandy Handkerchiefs” and another’s “Lord Byron’s Brand Beard
                  Oil” suggest. In other words, Blake’s and Byron’s Etsy prominence is inflated by what
                  I would describe as extra-literary factors; Keats, in contrast, is primarily represented
                  by Etsy sellers through his words—calligraphed onto broadsides, embroidered onto sachets,
                  etched onto bracelets—and at the time of my assessment, the number of products linked
                  to Keats dwarfed the number of products linked to Wordsworth (at 107), Coleridge (at
                  14), and Shelley (at 61).

                  </div> What factors, then, are responsible for Keats’s relative popularity, his unique appeal
                  to Etsy’s artisans? Rovee’s argument makes it easy to imagine the delight that Keats
                  might have experienced upon seeing his words “displace[d]” and “dislocat[ed]” onto
                  twenty-first-century handicrafts, but unless we believe that, in addition to crafting,
                  Etsy’s purveyors of Keatsiana stay abreast of the academy’s discourse, Rovee’s argument
                  can’t in itself account for their penchant for Keats in the first place. It’s not
                  at all inconceivable that bookish crafters have recognized, without the help of Rovee
                  or Adorno, a connection between their own work and Keats’s “museal” poems; after all,
                  like the Keats who composed 
                  “Ode on a Grecian Urn,”
                   Keatsiana crafters are making new art from old fragments both verbal and, quite often,
                  material. However, although 
                  “Urn”
                  ’s truth-and-beauty bit—and <em>only</em> that bit, really—was referenced in a few shops, other explicitly “museal” poems (in

                  Rather, crafters concentrated on Keats’s letters, passages from which were featured
                  in a plurality of the marketplace’s Keats things (thirty-three, by my count), and,
                  significantly, on the juvenilia—on, that is, Keats’s least polished, least finished

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To my mind, then, Keats’s Etsy prominence is most likely attributable to crafters’
                  sense that Keats, like themselves, made <em>by</em> living—by feeling, piecing, experimenting, and failing—even as he struggled to make <em>a</em> living. Keats’s iconic sonnet on the sonnet, famously embedded in an aggregated, newsy,
                  living-full letter to George and Georgiana Keats, attests to the truth in that portrait;
                  the poet-speaker of “If by dull rhymes” identifies as an uncertain crafter, a Fanny-esque
                  fashionista (albeit cobbler, not dressmaker) who hopes to “find out” “sandals more
                  interwoven and complete / To fit the naked foot of poesy” (4–6). “Find out” conveys
                  the pen-less experiences—later specified as “inspect[ing],” “weigh[ing],” “see[ing],”
                  and simply paying “attention meet” (7–9)—that underwrite his writing, while “more”
                  captures the asymptotic (or, perhaps, Ruskinian) character of his larger enterprise,
                  the fact that unqualified “interwoven”-ness and “complete”-ness will <em>remain</em> unattained, unattainable. In addition, “more” corresponds meaningfully with the term
                  “better” in the letter’s pre-poem commentary, which explicitly denies that “If by
                  dull rhymes” achieves prosodic perfection: “I have been endeavouring to discover a
                  better Sonnet Stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language over
                  well from the pouncing rhymes—the other kind appears too elegiac—and the couplet at
                  the end of it has seldom a pleasing effect.” “I do not pretend to have succeeded,”
                  Keats concludes (255), and to examine “sound and syllable” in “If by dull rhymes”
                  is to appreciate the fairness of his doubts, to recognize the degree to which his
                  interest in loosening the sonnet’s traditional “chain[s]” (10, 1) has resulted in
                  a scheme arguably <em>less</em> “interwoven” than “more” so.

                           reading of the wovenness in “If by dull rhymes” in Poetics of Luxury in the Nineteenth
                           Century: Keats, Tennyson, and Hopkins (63–65).</span></div>
                  </div> Indeed, it’s only in the last four lines that Keats, by nixing the English sonnet’s
                  “seldom… pleasing” couplet in favor of alternating (but, in the case of “crown” and
                  “own,” slanted) rhymes, manifests something like a sonic weave; the poem’s ninth through
                  thirteenth lines constitute a stretch dramatically (for a sonnet, anyway) devoid of
                  end rhyme, and by the time we reach line twelve’s “be,” that word’s chance to chime,
                  even “[un]pouncing[ly],” with line four’s “poesy” has long since passed. And yet,
                  the <em>presence</em> of those imperfections, those products of a makerly temperament more investigative
                  than ends-obsessed, corresponds quite directly with the important sentiment articulated
                  near the sonnet’s close: “Let us be / Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown”
                  (11–12). To make anew is first to disrupt or even destroy, to <em>reverse</em> the finishing process by plucking away the old and “dead.” Successful acts of positive
                  creation come much later and, still later, again; as the sonnet’s final lines suggest,
                  the lady Poesy’s fresh “garlands” have yet to be produced, and this poem, punctuated
                  by three “if”s, is less a perfectly finished exemplar than a mock-up, a sketch of
                  a conditional future: “So, if we may not let the Muse be free, / She will be bound
                  with garlands of her own” (13–14).

                           and ‘if we must be constrained’ created a patchwork of clauses with their comma-stitched
                           outlines disrupting the continuity of Keats’s argument” (150). Suret’s broader reading
                           of “If by dull rhymes” gestures toward the poem’s numerous successful failures.</span></div>

            </div>
            <p>Put simply, “If by dull rhymes” embodies, at best, but “half knowledge,” and even
               the post-juvenilia Keats remains, perhaps, the ultimate amateur artisan: He made good
               <em>because</em> he wasn’t perfect, because the flaws in his application, his taste, and his psyche
               seeded, not impeded, the work that made his name. To creative giggers (I refer, in
               that term, to Etsy’s role in the so-called “gig economy” of the twenty-first century),
               Keats’s experience must seem both real and aspirational, and it’s <em>their</em> Keats that Campion captures in her craft-centric, handsy portrayal of an imperfect
               (and ultimately un-Austenian) early nineteenth century. Now, I can’t see what Keatsiana
               was for sale while Campion was writing and/or directing <em>Bright Star</em>, and it’s possible that I’ve got it backwards, that Etsy’s current Keats-oriented
               offerings (and their relative abundance) were influenced by the film, not vice versa.
               I acknowledge that several items for sale at the time of this composition quoted the
               poem 
               “Bright Star,”
               and like Campion, who admitted to having struggled with much of Keats’s poetry, Etsy
               crafters are, as I have noted, especially focused on Keats’s letters (Sullivan 87).
               In an episode at the end of the film, however, I see a hint that the Keats imagined—not
               necessarily unfairly or unmeaningfully, I want to emphasize—by contemporary crafters
               was resonant enough to guide Campion’s vision. When Brown delivers the news of Keats’s
               death to the Brawne family, he reads aloud Joseph Severn’s letter describing the poet’s
               last moments. At the line, “Keats died imperceptibly,” Fanny abruptly stops Brown
               and steps toward the staircase, where, quickly engulfed in uncontrollable sobs, she
               clutches her throat and gasps frantically, “Mama! I can’t breathe!” There’s nothing
               “imperceptibl[e]” about Fanny’s pain or panic as her last hopes pass, and she seems,
               somehow, to be living Keats’s blood-choked final days—to be possessed of his tubercular
               chest, which she repeatedly jabs with impotent fingers. It’s a moving moment, and
               it evokes a quotation particularly popular among Etsy’s Keatsiana crafters, one that
               appeared in October 2017, in or on twice as many items as, say, lines from 
               “Ode to a Nightingale”
               : “Two souls with but a single thought / Two hearts that beat as one.” If Campion
               was inspired by those lines—if, that is, her Fanny feels death because <em>Keats’s</em> heart no longer beats—I’m certain that she didn’t encounter them in a collection
               of Keats’s writings or in Andrew Motion’s biography of the poet, with which she also
               worked closely. I’m certain because, of course, the lines at issue—again, “Two souls
               with but a single thought / Two hearts that beat as one”—weren’t written by Keats
               at all, though they’re often attributed to him. (<em>The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</em> identifies the quotation’s true source as Maria Lovell’s <em>Ingomar the Barbarian</em>, a translation of a play by Friedrich Halm [Knowles 222].) I recognize that even
               if Campion had those lines in mind, I can’t, obviously, be sure that she discovered
               them while perusing Etsy, since the misattribution in question dwells in a variety
               of the internet’s dark hollows. Still, <em>Bright Star</em>’s broader emphases on images of hands and on the notion of life as craft—“Buy, Sell,
               and <em>Live</em> Handmade” was, Krugh notes, the centerpiece of Etsy’s 2010 mission statement (297;
               emphasis added)—render the prospect appealing. Even more appealing (if, perhaps, less
               plausible) is the possibility that Campion <em>recognized</em> the “two souls”/“two hearts” passage as <em>not</em> belonging to Keats—that, in other words, she purposely alluded to the fact that,
               at the core of Keats’s Etsy presence, imperfection resides in its most perfect form:
               error, plain and simple.</p>
            <p>In fact, error and physiological (in)coordination together constitute the foundation
               of <em>Bright Star</em>’s namesake sonnet, which opens with a doomed attempt to correct, imaginatively, for
               the exigencies of immortality and closes with a picture of the speaker “pillowed upon
               [his] fair love’s ripening breast,” “feel[ing]” her chest’s “soft fall and swell”
               and “hear[ing] her tender-taken breath” (10–11, 13). The star’s icy isolation can’t
               be “unperplex[ed]” from its “steadfast[ness],” despite Keats’s aggressive “Not” and
               “No” (1–2, 9); the former is a precondition of the latter, since to live in warm proximity
               is, of course, to be subject to the rot that succeeds all “ripening.” The speaker
               of 
               “Bright Star,”
               then, <em>misattributes</em> pleasure to uncompromised fulfilment—ascribes it not to living, but to immortality;
               not to feeling, but to “feel[ing]… <em>forever</em>” (11; emphasis added)—and the result is a poem whose author seems to reach, like
               Campion’s crafter-heroine, for absolute precision, for an outcome “very perfect.”
               However, although 
               “Bright Star”
               (unlike 
               “If by dull rhymes”
               ) boasts an almost clinically ideal Shakespearean rhyme scheme, the subtle misalignment
               of “unchangeable” (9) and “swell” (11) highlights the central Keatsian-<em>cum</em>-Etsian truth at play: Living—metonymized in the breast that “swell[s]” with “breath”—doesn’t
               rhyme, literally or metaphorically, with perfection, with the “unchangeable” (that
               is, the ever symmetrical, “exactly even,” or otherwise “unperplex[ed]”) forms generated
               by machines and, sometimes, by those misguided human makers who fetishize machine-like
               accuracy. Indeed, to pay “attention meet” to the intimate pleasures described in 
               “Bright Star”
               is to note that their very wellspring is asymmetry, even distortion. Keats’s speaker
               “hear[s]” and “feel[s]” tonight because he, unlike his sleeping beloved, lies awake,
               and although the sonnet describes his “unrest” as “sweet” (12), we can’t but imagine
               that his partner’s rest is <em>un</em>sweet, pursued as it is beneath the weight of an insomniac’s head. Is her pleasantly
               “tender” breathing actually labored—that is, <em>made</em> audible and physically sensible by the less than ideal material circumstances that
               delimit her slumber? Is she, perhaps, nearly as frantic for air as Campion’s Fanny,
               who, upon learning of Keats’s death, claims “I can’t breathe”? Considered in tandem,
               <em>Bright Star</em>’s “two hearts” that seem to “beat as one” and 
               “Bright Star”
               ’s single (and possibly tortured) breast hint at the thready unevenness that, more
               often than not, both defines and energizes Keatsian making.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It’s worth noting that Etsy’s crafters are also partial to an authentic Keats quotation
                  (from one of the poet’s most famous love letters to Fanny Brawne) about adoration
                  and respiration. Last fall, the words, “My love is selfish—I cannot breathe without
                  you” (335), ornamented a number of the site’s Keats-inspired charms and sentimental
                  whatnots, but since that genuine Keatsian construction, which Campion seems to reference
                  obliquely much earlier in the film,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">
                           (9)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>When Keats is away from Hampstead, Fanny attests to an inability to breathe. In the
                           shooting script, she declares solipsistically to her mother, “When I do not hear from
                           him it is as if I have died, as if the air is sucked out of my lungs and I am left
                           desolate, but when I receive a letter I know our world is real and it is the only
                           one I care for” (54).</span></div>
                  </div> fails to capture the sense of <em>union</em>—of two moving as one—that the misattribution does, it’s less credible as a potential
                  inspiration for the perverse “wedding” with which the film concludes. As <em>Bright Star</em> closes, Campion meaningfully documents the good and the goods that derive from Fanny’s
                  experience living failure through Keats, and in the scene that follows her episode
                  of panicked gasping, we watch Fanny’s fingers stitch some new and very different clothing:
                  widow’s weeds. A made-over Fanny soon emerges from the house, a black blot on the
                  bridal-white winter landscape, and then the “minx” who once struggled to “work out”
                  poetry recites Keats’s 
                  “Bright Star”
                   start to finish. It’s the first poem that Campion incorporates in its <em>entirety</em>—that is, perfectly—but we’re not allowed to forget the partialities and imperfections
                  that, within the context of the film, inspired the sonnet’s composition and reflect
                  in Fanny’s pained delivery of its paradox-infused lines. In lieu of a traditional
                  wedding—the standard final scene in an Austen adaptation, of course—<em>Bright Star</em> concludes, I would suggest, by underscoring the uncomfortable union that underlies
                  craft, <em>i.e.</em> the union of living with making. All things considered, then, it may be appropriate
                  (or appropriately inappropriate) that to search Etsy for “handmade” items tagged “John
                  Keats” is to find, listed in the midst of bracelets and paper goods, a single dress:
                  RanunculusMarket’s “Jane Austen Wedding Dress,” complete with ribbon laces that can,
                  the seller assures potential buyers, “be tied at a tightness anywhere between ease
                  of breathing and fainting spell.” Wearers, it seems, can “live ever—or else swoon
                  to death” (14).</p>

               Hess notes that when Keats “correct[ed] a single word in [Woodhouse’s] commonplace
               book,” Woodhouse himself was less interested in “the poem’s content”—that is, <em>what</em> Keats had written—than in “the imprint of Keats’s body”: “Woodhouse felt that his
               collection’s value increased merely because Keats had touched it” (19). As in 
               “This living hand,”
               the hand—<em>not</em> the hand<em>writing</em>—carries significance; within Keats’s coterie, the living poet’s acknowledgement of
               the error was more valuable than the marks he made to repair it.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               that, in itself, attests to the special place that Keats has long occupied in the
               hearts and minds of artists and artisans of various types.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               reading of the wovenness in “If by dull rhymes” in <em>Poetics of Luxury in the Nineteenth Century: Keats, Tennyson, and Hopkins</em> (63–65).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “instead of a sustained description, ‘like Andromeda,’ ‘in spite of painèd loveliness,”
               and ‘if we must be constrained’ created a patchwork of clauses with their comma-stitched
               outlines disrupting the continuity of Keats’s argument” (150). Suret’s broader reading
               of “If by dull rhymes” gestures toward the poem’s numerous successful failures.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               shooting script, she declares solipsistically to her mother, “When I do not hear from
               him it is as if I have died, as if the air is sucked out of my lungs and I am left
               desolate, but when I receive a letter I know our world is real and it is the only
               one I care for” (54).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
