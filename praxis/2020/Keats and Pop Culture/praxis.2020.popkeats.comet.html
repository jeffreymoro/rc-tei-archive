            <p>Midway through <em>Bridget Jones’s Diary</em> (Sharon Maguire’s 2001 film based on Helen Fielding’s 1996 novel of the same name),
               the eponymous character, played by Renée Zellweger, finds herself enjoying a gorgeous
               day on the water near a country hotel. Rowing a small boat, she is flanked in another
               by Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), her caddish boss with whom she is having a fling.
               The two urbanites look out of place in such a rustic setting, but their tacky and
               obviously drunken behavior has its charm. Indeed, a short distance away, even the
               restrained Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who sullenly pilots a third boat, envies the fun
               the other two are having; he is stuck with his with his icy girlfriend Natasha (Embeth
               Davidtz), who ignores the natural beauty around her and focuses on work papers—that
               is, until Bridget and Daniel’s rowdiness elicits a sneer from her. Mark, like his
               Austenian namesake (and Firthian specialty), is destined to be Mr. Wrong until he’s
               Mr. Right, so, for the moment, he insincerely echoes Natasha’s disapproval. Still,
               his face betrays a muted longing for the frolicsome Bridget.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Bridget and Daniel’s antics are full of laughs and splashes and a reference to 1997’s <em>Titanic</em>. All of that feels quite expected. Less so is Bridget’s botched but emphatically-delivered
                  non-sequitur from Keats’s 
                  “To Autumn”
                  : “Season of mists and… <em>mellow fruitlessness</em>!!!”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For this and subsequent references to the finished film—not the screenplay—see the
                           works cited entry for Maguire’s Bridget Jones's Diary; no page references available.</span></div>
                  </div> Daniel, chomping on a cigarette, shares her exuberance: “Ah, f— me, I love Keats!”
                  Then he launches into a bawdy limerick (“There was a young woman from Ealing!”).</p>
            </div>
            <p>This Keatsian moment is brief, but it bears comment, especially in the context of
               the present essay collection on Keats and popular culture. What is 
               “To Autumn”
               doing here—in the summer, in a boat, with a couple of sozzled yuppies?</p>
            <p>For one thing, there’s the cachet of knowing Keats. Bridget and Daniel work in publishing,
               and such a display—even in mockery, as here—suggests their status and erudition. For
               another, it is a proclamation of belonging: Bridget may be a Londoner, but if she
               can wield her university education in a way that makes nature legible, then she needn’t
               feel lost in the rustic realm. Never mind that Keats is arguably the wrong poet for
               such a green-Romantic purpose and that the season and locale ill suit the poem.</p>
            <p>Add to that the Keatsiness of Bridget, the smart but hapless chronicler of personal
               experience who fairly fumbles her way to success—the cash-strapped resident of London
               who struggles with insecurity, self-knowledge, family, love, and professional direction.
               In this way, even if 
               “To Autumn”
               is the wrong poem, Bridget’s affinity for Keats makes good sense.</p>
            <p>And, of course it also matters that she <em>mis</em>quotes the poem, substituting “fruitlessness” for Keats’s “fruitfulness.” Whereas
               Keats’s autumn is a time of bounty (and for the sake of brevity I am deliberately
               ignoring the poem’s well-noted ambivalences and political contingencies here), Bridget’s
               harvest is empty-handed. It is in this context that the quote works best. Bridget’s
               season with Daniel, soon to end when she finds him with another woman, is indeed “mellow
               fruitlessness”—that is, quite easy but ultimately pointless. Daniel does little to
               combat this idea in the moment, effectively measuring his lack of worth by discarding
               Keats for substance-less vulgarity, but Bridget is too misty and besotted to see it.
               (Similarly, while the film’s original script does not include the 
               “To Autumn”
               quotation, it does have Bridget proposing a visit to the house that allegedly inspired
               <em>The Eve of St Agnes</em>, to which Daniel responds by dissing Keats, homophobically, as a “frightful nancy-boy”
               (Fielding 79). Bridget’s more fruitful harvest remains to be sought abroad, and her
               misquotation means more than she means it to.</p>
            <p>I begin my response with this example from <em>Bridget Jones’s Diary</em> not because this collection of essays needs yet another data-point for Keats’s relevance
               to popular culture, but because it’s an uncharacteristically diegetic and canny instance
               of popular culture winkingly weighing itself against Keats and literary culture more
               broadly. Positionally, Keats works here in much the same way that Austen’s Darcy does
               vis-à-vis Mark: an allusive presence that establishes generic expectations and rewards
               the knowingness of a certain portion of the film’s audience. The film is hardly high-brow,
               but such moves are nevertheless elevating and distinguishing—as for Bridget within
               the film, so too for <em>Bridget Jones’s Diary</em> itself. Audiences do indeed fall for such things—thus Stephen Holden’s <em>New York Times</em> review of the film, which characterized it both as “a delicious piece of candy whose
               amusing package is scrawled with bons mots distantly inspired by Jane Austen” and
               “the best and smartest film of its kind” since 1995’s <em>Emma</em>-inspired <em>Clueless</em> (E14). Cobble together BBC-style casting, an awkward cameo by Salman Rushdie, and
               a quote from 
               “To Autumn,”
               and this (very funny) film—which is mainly an expletive-laden romantic comedy of errors—gets
               away with ‘intellectual,’ an attribution I find less convincing than Zellweger’s English
               accent. To my mind, the movie’s “best and smartest” reputation says less about its
               plot and performances than it does about its carefully-postured, tongue-in-cheek literariness,
               which is Austenian, yes, but also a testament to the presence of Keats.</p>
            <p>To the matter at hand. While it can hardly take the full measure of Keats’s reception
               in four essays, this remarkable collection finds the aforementioned Keats elevation
               and distinction in academia, cyberspace and beyond. Betsy Winakur Tontiplaphol makes
               a powerful case for Keats as type-specimen of Etsy’s culture of artisanal craft; her
               argument, which sifts through some of the many Keatses to be found among the handiworks
               on that site, has interesting resonances with Brian Rejack’s multiply-mediated Keats
               in quotation: in both of these insightful essays we see the emergence of a hall-of-mirrors
               Keats—a hybrid of his self-making and the uncontrollable whims and reduplications
               of the digital era. Likewise, in Christopher Rovee’s and Forest Pyle’s essays, we
               find a Keats in contention, both within the ethereal academic context of competing
               literary methodologies and in the biographical and creative contexts of what Pyle
               calls the “Keats effects.” In all, we appreciate what Brian Bates, in his introduction,
               refers to as the in-betweenness of Keats.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To that point, it strikes me that this collection, altogether, apprehends a particularly
                  new and broad definition of popular culture. If popular sits across the line from
                  academic, then we have a collection of essays that flirts with the border (Cleanth
                  Brooks staring down Jane Campion across the divide, both popularizing agents)—like
                  Keats himself reading Chapman’s Homer—interrogating that line from both sides. And
                  this is very apt, for who is more emblematic than Keats of the permeable boundaries
                  between low and high culture (per Brian Bates’s introduction, a creature of the “middlebrow”),
                  and between what is outside and inside the halls of academe? One could also contend
                  that there is—beyond the academic/non-academic divide—an inherently popular/populist
                  style, one that specifically aims to cultivate the widest possible audience with the
                  broadest possible appeal (an ideal of the popular instantiated in the works of Raymond
                  Williams, Richard Hoggart, and others), and I wonder how Keats, especially in his
                  early poetry with its Huntian, esoteric classical references, sorts with this.

                  </div> This is all to hedge on issues of class, never far from the mind of anyone studying

            <p>Of course we can’t do everything at once, and as such we’ve not done much with gender.
               Keats and gender is always a fascinating topic, and it’s one that has amassed a sizable
               bibliography already, but it would be interesting to think about it in the specific
               context of popular culture. Twenty-first century conceptualizations and representations
               of gender-fluidity might owe more than we’ve appreciated to Keats’s camelionics. More
               superficially and intertextually, my own half-baked ideas draw me to HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> (with the admission that I haven’t read George R. R. Martin’s novels and don’t plan
               to). For instance, there are echoes of Keats in the characterization of Melisandre
               (the so-called 
               “Red Woman”
               ). Like Keats’s femmes fatales—the belle dame and especially Lamia—she is an expression
               of a paranoid sexism and a (problematic) gendered metaphorical register. In reductively
               analogical terms, we can draw up a basic scheme: the mysterious/seductive/dangerous
               woman takes advantage of the credulous male victim (or several victims); ultimately
               a keen-eyed seer/sage/elder/narrative voice recognizes the femme fatale for what she
               is, and some kind of skepticism, diminishment or disabuse occurs—all of this depicted
               in an antiquarian setting. (I am not suggesting that <em>GoT</em> is consciously cribbing Keats, but there are surely common source-texts: not only
               classical sources, but also Medieval tales of fatal women such as those by Chaucer,
               Malory, Mandeville and the authors of <em>Sir Florent</em> and <em>Dame Ragnelle</em>; also Maeterlinck’s and Debussey’s <em>Pelleas et Melisande</em>.) A consideration of Keats might enrich or further disturb our understanding of <em>GoT</em>’s notoriously troubling portrayals of women characters. The show’s abjection of masculine
               authority (or emasculation) that in turn marks feminine authority as conniving and
               abusive entails a fantasy/mystery feminine logic that is morally obscurative and that
               is typically exploded (yet again) by the moral, restorative light of masculine logic.</p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, what we have done here is to begin what I think is an important
               discussion, not only about Keats’s influence on popular culture, but also about popular
               culture’s impact on Keats. The poet of the classroom persists in his popularity both
               as poetic superstar and as a feature of critical debate, adaptation, quotation, and
               craft. Keats’s un-living hand has grasped more than it reached for—still capable indeed.</p>
