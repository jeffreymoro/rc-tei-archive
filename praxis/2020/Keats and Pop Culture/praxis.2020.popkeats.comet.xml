            <p>Midway through <title level="m">Bridget Jones’s Diary</title> (Sharon Maguire’s 2001
                film based on Helen Fielding’s 1996 novel of the same name), the eponymous
                character, played by Renée Zellweger, finds herself enjoying a gorgeous day on the
                water near a country hotel. Rowing a small boat, she is flanked in another by Daniel
                Cleaver (Hugh Grant), her caddish boss with whom she is having a fling. The two
                urbanites look out of place in such a rustic setting, but their tacky and obviously
                drunken behavior has its charm. Indeed, a short distance away, even the restrained
                Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who sullenly pilots a third boat, envies the fun the other
                two are having; he is stuck with his with his icy girlfriend Natasha (Embeth
                Davidtz), who ignores the natural beauty around her and focuses on work
                papers&#8212;that is, until Bridget and Daniel’s rowdiness elicits a sneer from her.
                Mark, like his Austenian namesake (and Firthian specialty), is destined to be Mr.
                Wrong until he’s Mr. Right, so, for the moment, he insincerely echoes Natasha’s
                disapproval. Still, his face betrays a muted longing for the frolicsome Bridget.</p>
            <p>Bridget and Daniel’s antics are full of laughs and splashes and a reference to 1997’s
                    <title level="m">Titanic</title>. All of that feels quite expected. Less so is
                Bridget’s botched but emphatically-delivered non-sequitur from Keats’s <title
                    level="a">To Autumn</title>: “Season of mists and… <emph>mellow
                    fruitlessness</emph>!!!”<note place="foot" resp="author"> For this and subsequent
                    references to the finished film&#8212;not the screenplay&#8212;see the works
                    cited entry for Maguire’s <title level="m">Bridget Jones's Diary</title>; no
                    page references available.</note> Daniel, chomping on a cigarette, shares her
                exuberance: “Ah, f&#8212; me, I love Keats!” Then he launches into a bawdy limerick
                (“There was a young woman from Ealing!”).</p>
            <p>This Keatsian moment is brief, but it bears comment, especially in the context of the
                present essay collection on Keats and popular culture. What is <title level="a">To
                    Autumn</title> doing here&#8212;in the summer, in a boat, with a couple of
                sozzled yuppies?</p>
            <p>For one thing, there’s the cachet of knowing Keats. Bridget and Daniel work in
                publishing, and such a display&#8212;even in mockery, as here&#8212;suggests their
                status and erudition. For another, it is a proclamation of belonging: Bridget may be
                a Londoner, but if she can wield her university education in a way that makes nature
                legible, then she needn’t feel lost in the rustic realm. Never mind that Keats is
                arguably the wrong poet for such a green-Romantic purpose and that the season and
                locale ill suit the poem.</p>
            <p>Add to that the Keatsiness of Bridget, the smart but hapless chronicler of personal
                experience who fairly fumbles her way to success&#8212;the cash-strapped resident of
                London who struggles with insecurity, self-knowledge, family, love, and professional
                direction. In this way, even if <title level="a">To Autumn</title> is the wrong
                poem, Bridget’s affinity for Keats makes good sense.</p>
            <p>And, of course it also matters that she <emph>mis</emph>quotes the poem, substituting
                “fruitlessness” for Keats’s “fruitfulness.” Whereas Keats’s autumn is a time of
                bounty (and for the sake of brevity I am deliberately ignoring the poem’s well-noted
                ambivalences and political contingencies here), Bridget’s harvest is empty-handed.
                It is in this context that the quote works best. Bridget’s season with Daniel, soon
                to end when she finds him with another woman, is indeed “mellow
                fruitlessness”&#8212;that is, quite easy but ultimately pointless. Daniel does
                little to combat this idea in the moment, effectively measuring his lack of worth by
                discarding Keats for substance-less vulgarity, but Bridget is too misty and besotted
                to see it. (Similarly, while the film’s original script does not include the <title
                    level="a">To Autumn</title> quotation, it does have Bridget proposing a visit to
                the house that allegedly inspired <title level="m">The Eve of St Agnes</title>, to
                which Daniel responds by dissing Keats, homophobically, as a “frightful nancy-boy”
                (Fielding 79). Bridget’s more fruitful harvest remains to be sought abroad, and her
                misquotation means more than she means it to.</p>
            <p>I begin my response with this example from <title level="m">Bridget Jones’s
                    Diary</title> not because this collection of essays needs yet another data-point
                for Keats’s relevance to popular culture, but because it’s an uncharacteristically
                diegetic and canny instance of popular culture winkingly weighing itself against
                Keats and literary culture more broadly. Positionally, Keats works here in much the
                same way that Austen’s Darcy does vis-à-vis Mark: an allusive presence that
                establishes generic expectations and rewards the knowingness of a certain portion of
                the film’s audience. The film is hardly high-brow, but such moves are nevertheless
                elevating and distinguishing&#8212;as for Bridget within the film, so too for <title
                    level="m">Bridget Jones’s Diary</title> itself. Audiences do indeed fall for
                such things&#8212;thus Stephen Holden’s <title level="j">New York Times</title>
                review of the film, which characterized it both as “a delicious piece of candy whose
                amusing package is scrawled with bons mots distantly inspired by Jane Austen” and
                “the best and smartest film of its kind” since 1995’s <title level="m"
                >Emma</title>-inspired <title level="m">Clueless</title> (E14). Cobble together
                BBC-style casting, an awkward cameo by Salman Rushdie, and a quote from <title
                    level="a">To Autumn,</title> and this (very funny) film&#8212;which is mainly an
                expletive-laden romantic comedy of errors&#8212;gets away with ‘intellectual,’ an
                attribution I find less convincing than Zellweger’s English accent. To my mind, the
                movie’s “best and smartest” reputation says less about its plot and performances
                than it does about its carefully-postured, tongue-in-cheek literariness, which is
                Austenian, yes, but also a testament to the presence of Keats.</p>
            <p>To the matter at hand. While it can hardly take the full measure of Keats’s reception
                in four essays, this remarkable collection finds the aforementioned Keats elevation
                and distinction in academia, cyberspace and beyond. Betsy Winakur Tontiplaphol makes
                a powerful case for Keats as type-specimen of Etsy’s culture of artisanal craft; her
                argument, which sifts through some of the many Keatses to be found among the
                handiworks on that site, has interesting resonances with Brian Rejack’s
                multiply-mediated Keats in quotation: in both of these insightful essays we see the
                emergence of a hall-of-mirrors Keats&#8212;a hybrid of his self-making and the
                uncontrollable whims and reduplications of the digital era. Likewise, in Christopher
                Rovee’s and Forest Pyle’s essays, we find a Keats in contention, both within the
                ethereal academic context of competing literary methodologies and in the
                biographical and creative contexts of what Pyle calls the “Keats effects.” In all,
                we appreciate what Brian Bates, in his introduction, refers to as the in-betweenness
                of Keats.</p>
            <p>To that point, it strikes me that this collection, altogether, apprehends a
                particularly new and broad definition of popular culture. If popular sits across the
                line from academic, then we have a collection of essays that flirts with the border
                (Cleanth Brooks staring down Jane Campion across the divide, both popularizing
                agents)&#8212;like Keats himself reading Chapman’s Homer&#8212;interrogating that
                line from both sides. And this is very apt, for who is more emblematic than Keats of
                the permeable boundaries between low and high culture (per Brian Bates’s
                introduction, a creature of the “middlebrow”), and between what is outside and
                inside the halls of academe? One could also contend that there is&#8212;beyond the
                academic/non-academic divide&#8212;an inherently popular/populist style, one that
                specifically aims to cultivate the widest possible audience with the broadest
                possible appeal (an ideal of the popular instantiated in the works of Raymond
                Williams, Richard Hoggart, and others), and I wonder how Keats, especially in his
                early poetry with its Huntian, esoteric classical references, sorts with this.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> For example, see Williams’s <title level="a">On High
                        and Popular Culture</title> and Hoggart’s <title level="m">The Uses of
                        Literacy</title>.</note> This is all to hedge on issues of class, never far
                from the mind of anyone studying Keats; neither far, I should think, from any study
                of popular culture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Holt N. Parker’s <title
                        level="a">Toward a Definition of Popular Culture</title> updates the
                    discussion usefully.</note></p>
            <p>Of course we can’t do everything at once, and as such we’ve not done much with
                gender. Keats and gender is always a fascinating topic, and it’s one that has
                amassed a sizable bibliography already, but it would be interesting to think about
                it in the specific context of popular culture. Twenty-first century
                conceptualizations and representations of gender-fluidity might owe more than we’ve
                appreciated to Keats’s camelionics. More superficially and intertextually, my own
                half-baked ideas draw me to HBO’s <title level="m">Game of Thrones</title> (with the
                admission that I haven’t read George R. R. Martin’s novels and don’t plan to). For
                instance, there are echoes of Keats in the characterization of Melisandre (the
                so-called <title level="a">Red Woman</title>). Like Keats’s femmes fatales&#8212;the
                belle dame and especially Lamia&#8212;she is an expression of a paranoid sexism and
                a (problematic) gendered metaphorical register. In reductively analogical terms, we
                can draw up a basic scheme: the mysterious/seductive/dangerous woman takes advantage
                of the credulous male victim (or several victims); ultimately a keen-eyed
                seer/sage/elder/narrative voice recognizes the femme fatale for what she is, and
                some kind of skepticism, diminishment or disabuse occurs&#8212;all of this depicted
                in an antiquarian setting. (I am not suggesting that <title level="m">GoT</title> is
                consciously cribbing Keats, but there are surely common source-texts: not only
                classical sources, but also Medieval tales of fatal women such as those by Chaucer,
                Malory, Mandeville and the authors of <title level="m">Sir Florent</title> and
                    <title level="m">Dame Ragnelle</title>; also Maeterlinck’s and Debussey’s <title
                    level="m">Pelleas et Melisande</title>.) A consideration of Keats might enrich
                or further disturb our understanding of <title level="m">GoT</title>’s notoriously
                troubling portrayals of women characters. The show’s abjection of masculine
                authority (or emasculation) that in turn marks feminine authority as conniving and
                abusive entails a fantasy/mystery feminine logic that is morally obscurative and
                that is typically exploded (yet again) by the moral, restorative light of masculine
                logic.</p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, what we have done here is to begin what
                    I think is an important discussion, not only about Keats’s influence on popular
                    culture, but also about popular culture’s impact on Keats. The poet of the
                    classroom persists in his popularity both as poetic superstar and as a feature
                    of critical debate, adaptation, quotation, and craft. Keats’s un-living hand has
                    grasped more than it reached for&#8212;still capable indeed.</p>
