            <p class="noCount">How is the image of Keats “constellated,” as Walter Benjamin might say, in the romanticisms
               of our contemporary popular culture? This essay attempts to answer that question by
               exploring the “Keats effects” or what the poet Frank O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the
               particular pulses of his poetic and cultural charge, at the charged moment of his
               own popularity in and outside his circle and as his poems and images have entered
               the currency of our own contemporary cultural discourses, what biographers of Romantic
               poets like to call our “popular imagination.” This essay pursues two discursive strains
               of the Keats effects: on the one hand, the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider
               and outsized Cockney ambitions, restless experimentation with revered and popular
               forms, artistic and poetic allusions, complete with devoted fans and fiercely reactionary
               enemies; and on the other hand, the indelible and affecting record of personal pathos,
               the doomed poet whose fragile beauty is inseparable from the poems themselves, their
               making, their reception, and the fate of their maker. I consider how both of these
               Keats effects posit modes of impossibility that remain impossibly beautiful. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">I. Two Images</span></h2>
               <p>I begin with two charged examples of the Keats effects. The first, an image of Keats
                  in one of the last poems Frank O’Hara composed before he was killed by a dune-buggy
                  on Fire Island in the summer of 1966. It’s an eleven-line poem called 
                  “Again, John Keats, Or the Pot of Basil”
                  which arrives at a Keatsian impasse: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">I have a pot of basil a friend gave</div>
                     <div class="l">me and am reading Keats and realize</div>
                     <div class="l">that everything is impossible in a different way</div>
                     <div class="indent2">(<em>Collected Poems</em> 471–72, lines 7–10)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The gift of the basil from an unspecified friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats
                  that results in the poem’s central event, a “realization” which offers no vision into
                  the future, no way beyond the impasse. I want to understand this last line, one arrived
                  at by reading Keats again: how is everything impossible <em>but</em> in a different way? What does this revised impossibility mean for Keats and his historical
                  currency?</p>
               <p>For the second version of the Keats effects, I invoke the famous penciled image Keats’s
                  friend and companion Joseph Severn drew of the poet during a long-suffering night
                  in Rome in the weeks before his death: “Keats on his death-bed,” an image that quickly
                  became an icon of the passion of the poet, that failing “lunger,” who knew long before
                  the fact that “his name was writ in water.” In Severn’s picture, Keats’s head rests
                  on a pillow and in bed clothes more suggested than drawn. More prominently, the artist
                  has penciled two concentric cones, a light exterior and dark interior cone which serve
                  as contrast to the three-quarter image of the sleeping poet. Thus does Severn, drawing
                  this picture at 3am to “keep awake,” have the face of Keats propped directly against
                  a figured oblivion, his own impossibility. </p>

               <p>Neither item is likely to be what first comes to mind for the topic of “Keats in Popular
                  Culture.” Neither was composed by the poet; and neither would seem to belong to what
                  in the most restricted sense we presently call “popular culture.” But the rubric is
                  capacious enough to invite many permutations of the topic. I hope to demonstrate that
                  both of these tokens are examples of Keats’s “currency” for popular Anglo-American
                  culture, more expansively construed. What interests me here are the “Keats effects,”
                  what O’Hara calls “Keatsness”: the particular pulses of his poetic and cultural charge,
                  at the charged moment of his “popularity” in and outside his “circle” and as his poems
                  and images have entered the currency of our own contemporary cultural discourses,
                  what biographers of Romantic poets like to call our “popular imagination.” While I’ll
                  be making some direct references to Keats’s poetry in our contemporary culture, I’m
                  more interested in two discursive strains of the Keats effects. On the one hand, there
                  is the distinctively Keatsian cocktail of outsider and outsized Cockney ambitions,
                  restless experimentation with revered and popular forms, artistic and poetic allusions,
                  complete with devoted fans and fiercely reactionary enemies. On the other hand, there’s
                  the indelible and affecting record of personal pathos, the doomed poet whose beauty—fragile
                  and fractured—is inseparable from the poems themselves, their making, their reception,
                  and the fate of their maker. We all know this image, and we know it <em>as image</em> more than story or fact, an image Karen Swann describes as the “beautiful dreamer”
                  who “lives a posthumous life, beyond life and death, but transcending neither” (
                  “<em>Endymion</em>’s Dreamers”
                  21). I want to consider how both of these Keats effects posit modes of impossibility
                  that remain impossibly beautiful.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Romantic Constellations, Pop Cultural Effects</span></h2>
               <p>The conceptual model I take for my thinking about the relationship between Keats and
                  contemporary popular culture is Walter Benjamin’s poetics of history, especially the
                  
                  “Theses on the Concept of History”
                  and his earlier scattered methodological formulations in <em>The Arcades Project</em>. Turning to Benjamin means dispensing with the themes that drive most narratives
                  of literary or cultural history—tradition, influence, progression—and learning instead
                  to attend to the historical “constellations” between Romanticism and the contemporary
                  and to measure the specific charge of the “Keats effect” in the images and dispositions
                  of contemporary popular culture. Elsewhere, Jacques Khalip and I have invoked Benjamin
                  to suggest that Romanticism offers <em>images</em> of itself to the future which may be reclaimed or, as Benjamin puts it, redeemed
                  in a present, including the present of our contemporary popular culture. Benjamin
                  describes this fortuitous convergence of past and present as a constellation (<em>Konstellation</em>). Like the arrangements of stars in the night, these constellations are shifting
                  and contingent, and they offer no promise of alignment. Therefore, the dispositions
                  of Romantic constellations are by no means uniform, especially in what we have come
                  to call popular culture. My project here, as in my collaboration with Khalip, is to
                  find a way to “grasp the constellation” into which our “own era has formed with a
                  definite earlier one,” in this case the era we designate as Romantic (
                  “Present Darkness”
                  1). For Benjamin, “the constellation as <em>image</em> serves less as the temporal measure of the difference between the past and the present
                  (and, as a consequence, their seemingly inextricable relationship), and more as a
                  structure for interpreting the ‘now’ as the event of a seizure, a grasping of the
                  past as if for an emergent intelligibility,” something that occurs, often inconspicuously,
                  in a contemporary poem or a song or a film (
                  “Concept of History”
                  397). Benjamin understood that each work of art—any document of culture, popular or
                  otherwise—might be “redeemed” or “cashed in” through the constellations that materialize
                  between past and present and crystallize in an image such as those that populate our
                  poems, paintings, or pop songs. We look “with awaken’d eyes”—as Keats says of himself
                  as he sees “his Psyche true”—for a sight to behold and to which we become beholden.
                  For Benjamin, the past makes itself available as “true images” that single out their
                  beholders who may be separated from that past by hundreds and even “thousands of years”
                  (
                  “Concept of History”
                  397). These “images flash at the moment of their recognizability,” or as in the idiom
                  of Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em>—itself profoundly charged with the Keats effect that it is also generating—as “incarnations
                  of the stars, when splendour / Is changed to a fragrance” and descends to earth (lines
                  173­–74). Keats’s “splendours,” as Shelley calls them, are the images that populate
                  his poetry, both the images he made and the image he became, what made him reviled
                  and has made him adored. “It seems,” Frances Jeffrey famously says of <em>Endymion</em> only in order to dismiss it, “as if the author had ventured everything that occurred
                  to him in the shape of a glittering image” (203).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>What Jeffrey dismisses I want to redeem. What this means, methodologically speaking,
                     is attending to the appearances of these “glittering images,” discerning their “shape”
                     in order to attune oneself to their reconstellation in the present as a distinctively
                     Keatsian currency in the genres of popular culture. In his own poetic thinking about
                     the Keats effect, Shelley coined the best name for this currency: a “transmitted effluence,”
                     one which “outlives the parent spark” (lines 407–8). If what Shelley writes is true,
                     the distinctive charge or “transmitted effluence” of particular texts or authors will
                     prove to have many distinctive permutations and prove to be far more varied than the
                     rubric of Romanticism often implies. This means something other than, say, depictions
                     of Romantic authors in our contemporary popular narratives, of which the biopic is
                     the default genre and Jane Campion’s 2009 film <em>Bright Star</em> its most compelling example. But, however accomplished and nuanced, the biopic is
                     a dead-end genre, one not capable of accounting for the ways in which the migratory
                     effect of a writer’s work might well take its impulse far beyond its own historical
                     context and far beyond its medium of origin.

                              Derek Jarman’s Caravaggio (1986) which, despite certain explicit anachronisms, conforms
                              in the main to the narrative expectations of the genre except at the decisive level
                              of the shot where it often depicts a transfer of images that activates the currencies
                              between the film and this most cinematic of painters. The best account of this relationship
                              is Leo Bersani and Ulysses Dutoit, Caravaggio. To my mind the most vitally true deployment
                              of a Romantic poet in Anglophone cinema is Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man (1995) wh…</span></div>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Thus, there might be a distinctive “Byron Effect” or a “Blake Effect” (or, for that
                     matter, with a poet such as Southey, <em>no effect</em>, at least in this moment of his “unrecognizability”) that inhabit and inform other
                     genres or media as well as the specifically Keastian effects I’m identifying here.
                     Not only are these effects potentially registered in any popular medium or genre,
                     their manifestations often make legible certain aspects of the “original” which were
                     yet to find their expressive medium. For instance, the “Mary Shelley effect” seems
                     exclusively cinematic in nature; and Mary’s account in 1831 of how the story came
                     into existence not only offers a paradigmatic version of the “unbidden” Romantic imagination
                     and its powers of self-origination, but in her characterization of “the successive
                     images that arose in [her] mind,” the “gift” of a cinema “the usual bounds of reverie”:
                     “When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think,”
                     she recounts, “my imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive
                     images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie.
                     I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of unhallowed
                     arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together” (<em>Frankenstein</em> 168).

                              dwarfing in consequence any of the effects we might discern from her contemporaries,
                              including her husband, father, and mother. Shelley’s novel deploys Milton’s poetry
                              to displace his version of the Adamic myth with the Frankenstein creation myth as
                              the popular cultural paradigm for creation. A subset of that popular effect is the

                  <p>To sketch a wider range of reference, I turn briefly to two other versions of this
                     Romantic effectivity. Unlike the “Mary Shelley effect,” the pop cultural effect I
                     associate with Byron is not discernible in film as such but activates the commencement
                     of “celebrity culture” and circulates in certain influential pop musical modes or
                     poses. When, for example, Morrissey, lead singer for the 1980’s Manchester band The
                     Smiths, opens the plaintive anthem 
                     “How Soon is Now?”
                      to the iconic wails of Johnny Marr’s shimmering guitar with the following lines, no
                     one who has read Byron can miss the reference, intended or not, to <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>:

                     the air” is undone by a homophonic pun (“son and heir”) and diminished further by
                     the slack lines that follow the declarations: “nothing in particular.” The effect
                     of these mock anthems is an affective irony that turns the song into the pop melodrama
                     that defines most every anthem by The Smiths or by Morrissey.

                     Morrissey sitting in his bath with a volume of Byron (as he does in the video to 
                     “Suedehead”
                     ) to feel the songs permeated by the poet, affectively and tonally. Morrissey’s songs
                     allow us to <em>hear</em> the campy quality that was always central to the Byron effect, at least in <em>Childe Harold</em>, the poem which “made” him; and Morrissey’s songs allow us to <em>hear</em> for ourselves the queer desire in the poet that recent scholarship has given us to
                     know.

                  <p>If the first and most obvious example of the “Blake Effect” for the last half century
                     of North American popular culture that comes to mind will be The Doors, only their
                     name and the early song 
                     “Break on Through”
                      feel genuinely charged by a Blakean energy or thematics. Without question, Patti Smith
                     is the contemporary artist most “plugged” into the Blake effect, formally, thematically,
                     even scholarly. From the eruptive event of 1975’s <em>Horses</em> to the present, Smith’s sung poetry and garage music embraced the full visionary mode
                     of Blake’s poetics, a unique “marriage” of Innocence (
                     “Wave”
                     ) and experience (
                     “Horses”
                     ) with a religious ferocity (
                     “In Excelsis Deo”
                     ) and a transgressive proto-punk ethos (
                     “Pissing in a River”
                     ). Not only does she sing Blake’s “songs”—most notably 
                     “The Tyger”
                     —she has selected and introduced a popular collection of his poems and speaks and
                     writes on the poet who is as much her muse as Genet, Rimbaud, or the Beat Poets. But
                     for Morris Eaves, neither the Doors nor Patti Smith represents a version of the Blake
                     he “wants.” In an essay called 
                     “On Blakes We Want and Blakes We Don’t,”
                      Eaves bemoans the very aspect of the “Blake effect” that I seek: “Blake’s durability
                     seems to depend partly on his ready reproducibility in simple forms as a cultural
                     marker—memorable images to decorate dust jackets, startling proverbs to launch book
                     chapters, catchy phrases to name rock bands” (414). Eaves’s lament serves as an epigraph
                     to Mike Goode’s 
                     “Blakespotting,”
                      a brilliant and pathbreaking exploration of the poetics of the Blake effect. Goode
                     argues that Blake’s work circulated from the outset as detached pieces and images—poems,
                     pictures, proverbs—and that this “detachability” is fundamental to Blake’s artistic
                     project and its effectivity.

                              I explore the principle of the detachability of the image in poetry and film. There
                              I argue that the image’s “detachability” makes it available as a historical and transmedial
                              “current,” one which “charges” a constellation between such unlikely texts as Shelley’s
                              The Triumph of Life and Todd Haynes’s Velvet Goldmine.</span></div>
                     </div> Blake’s deployment of the proverb form and especially what Goode calls “the largely
                     unmappable circulation of his proverbs” generate an anonymous textual system that
                     is characteristically Blakean” (
                     “Blakespotting”
                      773). Ironically, proverbial anonymity is Blake’s signature, the distinctive idiom
                     of the “Blake effect.” For his methodological point of reference to this mode of poetic
                     historicity, Goode turns not to Benjamin but to the “rhizomatics” of Deleuze and Guattari:
                     “Blake, in his transformation of the proverb genre, created a medium that is its own
                     heterogeneous message, and that message, like the ‘rhizomatic’ forms that Gilles Deleuze
                     and Felix Guattari celebrate, becomes senderless and receiverless over time, directed
                     toward everybody and by everyone” (775).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Over time many of Keats’s own phrases and formulations have also achieved the status
                  of the proverb; but the signature of their “sender” is far too identifiable and too
                  deeply marked with his poetic currency to produce the “rhizomatics” that Goode persuasively
                  locates in Blake’s poetic effect. For Keats I discern two distinct but inextricable
                  effects, something like the A-side and B-side of a vinyl record. For the first of
                  these effects, I borrow Peter Szendy’s notion of “obstructive enthusiasm,” a term
                  which I think characterizes an important impulse in the poetry both early and late,
                  not only the vexed exuberances of <em>Endymion</em>, but the excesses in the late odes, for which the cascade of declared “happies” that
                  get the speaker nowhere in the third stanza of 
                  “Ode on a Grecian Urn”
                  can serve as an emblem.</p>
               <p>The second Keats effect I call “the shrine of no prospects,” one which counts Severn’s
                  drawing as among its first collected items. I think this is the best term for the
                  aura of painful regret which shrouds the poet much like Severn’s drawing and which
                  connects him not only to that phenomenon of the singer dead “before his time” but
                  to an affective and figurative temporality in Keats’s poems and letters that reappears—reconstellated—as
                  the pop cultural image of certain singer-songwriters, contemporary death-bound troubadours.
                  The rhetorical signature of this current of pop music is the Keatsian oxymoron in
                  the affective dimension—“pleasant pain,” “half in love with easeful death,” and so
                  on—and the plaintive and absorptive register of the poems, as if they were always
                  composed in the minor key. But the curious “time signature” of this effect generates
                  something other than straight melancholy. In this version of “the Keats effects,”
                  we find a pop image of something which, quite like the poet himself, is always projective
                  and already posthumous.</p>

                     </div> We owe our understanding of this pop Keats to critics such as Nicholas Roe, Jeffrey
                     N. Cox, and others who have unearthed the ways in which Keats was both indebted to
                     and a principal contributor for what we would today call an “alternative” or “counter-hegemonic”
                     culture, one in which his poems both originate and reiterate. Roe explains that the
                     “Cockney” label was a multiform epithet, one linked explicitly to the seditions of
                     Leigh Hunt and to the popular culture of “the London mob” and to the threat the urban
                     experience posed for the reactionary circle of <em>Blackwood’s</em>, a threat marked by class and gendered affect. Citing Samuel Johnson’s <em>Dictionary</em>, Roe notes that while “the leading sense of ‘Cockney’ is ‘a native of London,’ its
                     second definition of the word is ‘any effeminate, low citizen’” (212). Thus does Keats
                     belong to a particular poetic form of urban effeminacy, the “lisping sedition” of
                     “the affected school of our metropolitan poets” (qtd. in Motion 523). The Cockney
                     politics of Keats’s “metropolitan” poetry is always marked with an erotic charge.
                     Jeffrey Cox illustrates how the erotic and even pornographic nature of this Cockney
                     culture and the excesses of its Catullan resonances—both explicit and elliptical—not
                     only form the popular historical context for Keats’s poems but inform their rhetorical
                     and formal textures: “If we fail to notice the density of the punning in the ode [on
                     a Grecian Urn], we lose a sense of the poem’s playfulness, of the experimental, even
                     quirky nature of Keats’s language . . . and of the Catullan and Cockney delight in
                     toying with what others considered serious in the name of a linguistic and also finally
                     an erotic delight” (620).

                     eroticism, a fascination that makes this most auratic of Keats’s poems shot through
                     with a sexual charge. It’s not that Keats doesn’t love the art of the “Grecian Urn”
                     or the Portland Vase; it’s that with his “human breathing passion,” he loves it <em>too much</em>. Once we feel his desire for knowledge of the urn become erotic, we see how the poem
                     participates in a subterranean pop cultural eroticism that veers to the pornographic,
                     precisely like the urn itself: “a pornographic text offers the identical pleasure
                     over and over again,” writes Cox, adding, “every time we read Keats’s urn we will
                     see the same love ‘ever warm and still to be enjoyed’” (625).

                     “timeless” poems with what Benjamin calls the anachronistic “now-time” (<span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Jetzeit</span>) of their own popular culture. In this charged moment of British cultural politics,
                     the status of Keats’s poems could shift in an instant from what Cox describes as “a
                     coterie favorite” to “that of a target of the Cockney School attacks” (616); and Keats’s
                     aspirations of high literary art reduced to the parody of a gross popular culture
                     and, as in the words of the <em>British Critic</em>, “the gross slang of voluptuousness” committed by “the meanest and filthiest” of

                  <p>As hateful and reactionary as these attacks were, I count myself as one who prefers
                     the Keats of the urban gutter to the Keats of the British Museum, <em>until</em> we reach the precious point at which those two versions of the poet become indistinguishable.
                     This is the sweet spot often crystallized in Keats at which the most auratic of objects
                     are simultaneously objects of explicit erotic desire, the sexual and popular “undersong”
                     of the ode’s elevated lyric address. This is how Simon Jarvis teaches us to read <em>Endymion</em>, by carefully excavating Keats’s “undersong” in that poem, one which recognizes that
                     the poet’s “ceaseless work on verse language, the invention of a verse repertoire
                     every bit as consequential for nineteenth-century English poetry as Wordsworth’s”
                     is also inseparable from its “systematic assault on taste” (
                     “Undersong”
                      147). For Jarvis, <em>Endymion</em>’s “own grandeur,” one both fine and dirty, “looks forward” to “Picasso’s <em>Vollard Suite</em>” or to Frank O’Hara’s 
                     “Ode on St. Cecelia’s Day.”
                      In this way Jarvis discerns a scandalizing pop-cultural current—what he calls “a partial
                     countertradition”—that runs from Keats’s (early) <em>Endymion</em> through (early) Wallace Stevens and is plugged in to the O’Hara of this (again, early)
                     ode. O’Hara acknowledges the saint’s day by doing precisely what Keats would have
                     done: run as far as possible from Pope’s famous ode commemorating St. Cecilia’s Day.
                     O’Hara’s poem, which Jarvis invokes without a gloss, is more a Keatsian hymn to Pan
                     than a celebration of “impoverished Cecilia”:

                     </blockquote> Ultimately the poem is addressed not to St. Cecila or to Pan but to “the rest of us,”
                     those who like Pan, like Keats, like O’Hara, “play and are played / seeking … the
                     pattern of our true desire.” In Jarvis’s reading, the “countertradition” initiated
                     by Keats’s “masterpiece” and its “deep thicket of new verse rhythms, textures, sentences,
                     techniques” arrives smack in the middle of a brief quotation from O’Hara’s brilliant
                     mock manifesto, 
                     “Personism”
                     :

                           it is that when I get lofty enough I’ve stopped thinking and that’s when the refreshment

                     </blockquote> For Jarvis the literary “counter tradition” that leads from Keats to O’Hara—what I
                     am calling its Romantic currency—gives up the “lofty ideas” once they are lofty enough
                     for the refreshments to arrive and for the pleasures to begin for real. It is “the
                     line of reviled virtuosity and of dandyism in deadly earnest” (163); and we should
                     be clear that this “line” or trajectory of “Keatsness” is queer in <em>effect</em> if not in origin, what Khalip has in a different context called “tacitly queer” (<em>Last Things</em>).

                     that even cool modernism came to love” (21). Perhaps none cooler than O’Hara, urban
                     lyric poet in the era of Abstract Expressionism, Billie Holiday, and James Dean. O’Hara’s
                     poetry is shot through with so many of the most vital currents of mid-century cosmopolitan
                     culture—popular, elite, emergent, experimental—that he should have a cultural constellation
                     named for himself. In the introduction to Donald Allen’s edition of <em>The Collected Poems of Frank O’Hara</em>, John Ashbery maps out this vast constellation of the poet’s influences and engagements
                     and many of the relevant strains of nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and art,
                     from the French Symbolists and Surrealists through the Russian experiments of Pasternak
                     and Mayakovsky as well as the Abstract Expressionism of de Kooning, Pollock, and Kline.
                     Of artists who would find their fame after this moment of Abstract Expressionism,
                     Philip Guston and Cy Twombly and the music of Cage, Schoenberg, Satie and even Paul
                     Bowles, the experimental poetry of the Soviet Union and Africa. To Ashbery’s catalogue
                     of persons, many of whom he might have found in his own rolodex, we must surely add
                     the pulsing and tawdry kaleidoscope of mid-century popular culture, not just film
                     or cinema but <em>the movies</em> and the catalogue of movie <em>stars</em>, such as Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, William Powell and Lana Turner, and above all
                     James Dean: “the heavens operate on the star system,” O’Hara writes in 
                     “To the Film Industry in Crisis,”
                      his paean to that constellation: “It is a divine precedent / you perpetuate!” and
                     “it’s you I love!” (232.43–45, 7). O’Hara’s poetry is charged with the enthusiasm
                     of infatuation, one which attaches itself “variously.” “I don’t prefer one ‘strain’
                     to another,” he writes in 
                     “My Heart,”
                      perhaps closer to a manifesto of his poetry and his criticism than “Personism”:

                              —conveys the nature of the poet’s immersion in cultural worlds in which there are
                              no distinctions other than vitality, “nerve,” and “variousness.” Like many of O’Hara’s
                              best works, the poem is both panoramic and intimate, a “cold last swim / before the

                     his poems to James Schuyler; and the references to Keats often occur when O’Hara is
                     figuring a limit (excess, abstraction, enthusiasm) by which he measures his own aesthetic
                     trajectory (216.14). This is the “Keats effect” that connects these most famous figures
                     of the Cockney and New York Schools, two “coterie poets” who hail from the “affected
                     school of metropolitan poets” and were both denounced by conservative critics as “poetasters.”
                     To articulate this connection, I turn to Peter Szendy, French philosopher of pop culture,
                     for the term that activates this constellation: “obstructive enthusiasm” or “infatuation”
                     (<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">engouement</span>) Szendy calls it, with reference not to contemporary or Romantic poetry but to the
                     affects and effects of popular music. Drawing on Theodor Reik’s psychoanalytic interest
                     in “obsessive melodies,” Szendy declares something about the effects of popular music
                     that, as Leonard Cohen might say, “everybody knows”: there are certain popular melodies
                     that act “like a ghost that has come to haunt us. Or like a worm, a virus of the ear
                     that keeps reproducing itself in us” (<em>Hits</em> 32).

               <p>“Obstructive enthusiasm” appears in a more specifically Keatsian vein in the O’Hara
                  poem with which I opened this essay, 
                  “Again, John Keats, or The Pot of Basil.”
                  The poem begins with the speaker’s reflection on the condition of an empty blockage,
                  a reflection which relies on the mutually exclusive colloquial definitions of “through”
                  as both adverb and noun: the speaker’s sense of feeling “through” with things is likened
                  to an image in a John Huston film, a “throughness” broken suddenly by the gift of
                  “a pot of basil,” a gift which activates the derived meaning of “through” that prompts
                  the speaker to announce a Keatsian “breakthrough” that turns out to be another limit:
                  “am reading Keats again and realize / that everything is impossible in a different
                  way” (471.7–9). How better to describe O’Hara’s realization of an impossibility “in
                  a different way” than as an “obstructive enthusiasm”? The gift of the basil from an
                  unspecified friend prompts O’Hara’s rereading of Keats—himself a serious “re-reader”—that
                  results in the poem’s central event, a “realization” which offers no vision into the
                  future, no way beyond the impasse. O’Hara’s “again-ness” with Keats reiterates the
                  romantic poet’s own repetitive obsessions regarding the <em>re-reading</em> of <em>King Lear</em> in 
                  “On Sitting Down to Read <em>King Lear</em> Once Again,”
                  which promises nothing more than a re-visitation of an impossibility, “the fierce
                  dispute betwixt damnation and impassion’d clay.” But the affective charge of O’Hara’s
                  impossibility is not direly obsessive but exuberant: if this is the poetics of the
                  impasse, it is the happy aporia, what in a relevant register Emily Dickinson calls
                  a “bright impossibility.” Keats’s odes are riven with this kind of “obstructive enthusiasm”:
                  not only the famously awkward six “happies” of the third stanza of 
                  “Ode on Grecian Urn,”
                  which emphatically reiterate a happiness denied the speaker, but the urgent desire
                  for the speaker of the 
                  “Ode to Psyche”
                  to be the “pale-mouth’d prophet” that history denied the goddess, “latest born and
                  loveliest vision.” The enthusiasms of the speakers of Keats’s odes may entice us into
                  believing the speaker has gotten somewhere in the course of theode; and indeed, as

               <p>O’Hara’s own “Keats effect” is registered throughout his poetry in forms both named
                  and implied, often as examples of this “obstructive enthusiasm.” In a sonnet called
                  
                  “On a Passage in Beckett’s <em>Watt</em> &amp; About Geo. Montgomery,”
                  O’Hara offers an extraordinary passage that marks both his affective debt and rhetorical
                  leave-taking from what he identifies as the Keats effect and that he associates with
                  “excess”: </p>

               <p> In 
                  “The ‘Unfinished,’”
                  a sprawling name-dropping exercise, Keats is posited as temporal reference: “I suddenly
                  think of the moon, hanging up there / ever since the time of Keats,” as if the lunar
                  object is itself a Keats effect (317.57–58). For O’Hara origins are always aesthetic,
                  and therefore always multiple points of artistic reference and poetic relays that,
                  to invoke Deleuze and Guattari once again, feel more “rhizomatic” than lineal or arboreal.
                  In 
                  “For Bob Rauschenberg,”
                  O’Hara’s often manic name-checks take on a poignant tone, one in which art is enthusiastically
                  registered as failure. “The frail instant” is “drowned in Liszt” and our speaker has
                  come to “despise” his “love for Pasternak” (322.5, 9). The poem’s third stanza creates
                  a constellation of three poets who rarely occupy the same canonical space, from which
                  the speaker, “alone in pain,” is excluded: </p>

               <p> In this triad of “heavenly aspirations,” Keats’s “truth and beauty” gets the upper
                  hand, especially as it is followed immediately by a question—“double-coin?”—an activation
                  of the two-sided nature of the Keats effect.</p>
               <p>Many of the important impressions of the Keats effects in O’Hara’s poetry take the
                  form of unattributed invocations, like the deployment of a crucial phrase in 
                  “Light clarity avocado salad in the morning.”

               <p> The opening clause of the final line—“I am sure of nothing but this”—activates the
                  famous line from Keats’s 1817 letter to Bailey, a letter which declares Keats’s agnosticism
                  as well as his poetic project: “I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the
                  Heart’s affections and the truth of the Imagination.” And when O’Hara wants to pursue
                  this ungrounded Keatsian intensification to the limit place of poetic abstraction,
                  he turns in 
                  “Personism”
                  to Keats’s “negative capability” in order to address the nature of poetic versus painterly
                  abstraction: “Abstraction (in poetry, not in painting) involves personal removal by
                  the poet,” writes O’Hara; and he goes on to link the “abstraction” and “removal” of
                  the poet to “negative capability (as in Keats and Mallarme)” (498). But in order to
                  achieve a “true abstraction for the first time, really, in the history of poetry,”
                  O’Hara’s 
                  “Personism”
                  goes in the opposite direction, restoring, so it would seem, the “person” to the poem,
                  and in the process, “<em>abstracting</em>” him. While the irony of this mock manifesto makes it impossible to decide how seriously
                  we are meant to take O’Hara’s formulation as a poetic project, the passage does mark
                  Keats and negative capability as a kind of limit case for the development of a decisive
                  mode of abstraction in contemporary art. And as O’Hara moves in his manifesto from
                  Keatsian negativity capability to Personism, we reach “obstructive enthusiasm, the
                  infatuated “vitality” of the limit: “What can we expect of Personism? (This is getting
                  good, isn’t it?) Everything, but we won’t get it. It is too new, too vital a movement
                  to promise anything” (499). Expect everything, O’Hara’s says—just as it’s “getting
                  good”—but realize that nothing will come of it: 
                  “Personism,”
                  the poetic movement of vitality with no future. Without promise, “you just go on your
                  nerve,” writes O’Hara, identifying a term he invokes often for his account of the
                  fundamental poetic “charge” or impulse. “Implying both spontaneity and outrageousness,”
                  writes Brad Gooch, “‘nerve’ was O’Hara’s campy version of Keats’s prescription of
                  ‘negative capability’ or ‘wise passivity’ for the young lyric Romantic poet. . . .‘Nerve’
                  was his aesthetic motor, his program” (435). “Nerve” as “aesthetic motor”: “negative
                  capability” with vitality but no promise, “both a plus and a minus” as Gooch characterizes
                  it, the same impulse-blockage two-step that characterizes this version of the Keats
                  effect.</p>

                     Enthusiasm.” By this term I hope to convey the luxuriant mourning for this doomed
                     poet that Keats’s poetry, his death, and his “circle” put into circulation for our
                     own generation of doomed popular troubadours. What Swann says about the various images
                     of the poet in <em>Endymion</em>—at least in the seductive mythology that is itself a part of this shrine—extends
                     to a rock music constellation we know well: “all abstracted dreamers, all piercingly
                     beautiful, all singled out by the gods, all marvelous fated boys, all destined for
                     celebrity”—and all doomed (20).

                              artist” (303).</span></div>
                     </div> This aspect of the Keats effect—the aura of painful regret—forces our hand: as readers
                     we are demanded to make a decision about the poet ahead of time, a decision based
                     on our feelings, a demand that was always in effect for the poet’s first readers.
                     For them and for us, one doesn’t “come around” to Keats the way one might develop
                     an admiration or critical interest in Wordsworth, for instance, or even a fascination
                     with the delirious irony of Byron’s many poses. The affective response produced in
                     advance by this Keats effect is not derived from our understanding of his ethical
                     impulses or his formal achievement or his political engagement. Nor is it the result
                     of careful rhetorical readings, however much the poems may yield to that practice.
                     Though the affective relationship with this poet does not preclude rhetorical analysis
                     or formal interpretation, the Keats effect happens <em>in advance</em> of any subsequent critical engagement; and it’s bound up with our image of him.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In this context, it’s worth remembering that Keats initiates his own poetic project
                     with a series of poems addressed to popular models of the poet: 
                     “Imitation of Spenser,”
                      the pageant of Western poets in 
                     “Ode to Apollo,”
                      of course, and the sonnets to Byron and to Chatterton, that young suicide, “Dear child
                     of sorrow! Son of misery,” now “among the stars” whose “hymning” is now far “above
                     the ingrate world” (5). Keats’s elegiac outbursts to this tragically dead young poet
                     with whom he identifies establishes the rhetoric of a relationship reactivated in <em>Adonais</em>, arguably the most beautiful British elegy of the nineteenth century.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It depends upon whom you ask, of course. When Shelley wrote to Ollier that he was
                              “composing a poem of the death of Keats,” he called it “a highly wrought piece of
                              art, perhaps better in composition than anything I have written.” Not the judgement
                              of the review in The Literary Gazette, Dec. 1821: “The poetry of the work is contemptible,
                              a mere collection of bloated words heaped on each other without order, harmony, or
                              meaning” (qtd. in Ann Wroe, Being Shelley 265).</span></div>
                     </div> With his fifty-five “Spenser stanzas,” Percy Shelley constructs Keats’s first “Sovran
                     shrine,” one which the older poet adorns with his friend’s own poetic images or “splendours”
                     (100, 174, 198, 363, 388). The revisitations of these images are the dead poet’s own
                     special effects in a “Temple” not of “Delight” but of Melodrama, one designed exclusively
                     for a ritualized weeping that is marshaled “against oblivion.” Shelley’s elegy is
                     certainly as responsible for this aspect of the Keats effect as anything the younger
                     poet ever wrote: <em>Adonais</em> enshrined an image that almost immediately became inseparable from both poets. Shelley
                     famously inscribes an image of himself in this “enduring monument” as “one frail Form,
                     / A phantom among men, companionless” (271–72), one of the poets who gather to mourn
                     Adonais. As Andrew Motion puts it, the early responses to Keats’s death “took their
                     lead” from <em>Adonais</em>, “the single most famous and influential response to Keats’s tragedy…. [Shelley]
                     turned Keats into an archetype—not someone who had suffered uniquely, but someone
                     who represented all artists oppressed by reactionary regimes” (571). Motion laments
                     the fact that Shelley’s “distortions” became “quickly and firmly rooted in the popular
                     imagination” (572). Shelley’s own biographers agree that these “distortions” are the
                     result of his own projected hyper-identifications that crystallize in this poem, especially
                     the <em>ad hominem</em> assaults by conservative reviewers on young poets associated with Hunt and Byron,
                     agents of sedition and immorality. Shelley’s emotional investment in the fate of <em>Adonais</em> may have exceeded anything else he wrote; and it prompted him to draft (and subsequently
                     abandon) a preface to the poem which stresses the “calumny” “heaped in so profuse
                     a measure” upon <em>himself</em> (qtd. in <em>Being Shelley</em> 264). Given the compounding of these affective substitutions between mourner and mourned,
                     it is not surprising that Shelley would express his hopes for the life of the poem.
                     “I am especially curious to hear the fate of <em>Adonais</em>,” he wrote to Charles Ollier: “I confess I should be surprised if <em>that</em> poem were born to an immortality to oblivion.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>“Oblivion” is an important word for Shelley, one that appears in many of its forms
                  in his poems and prose, including the lines of the elegy dedicated to “the inheritors
                  of unfulfilled renown” (Chatterton, Sidney, Lucan) from whom “Oblivion … shrank like
                  a thing reproved” (397, 405) and in the closing sentences to his preface in which
                  he praises “Mr. Severn, a young artist of the highest promise.” In return for Severn’s
                  “unwearied attendance” to the dying poet, Shelley invokes the spirit of Keats to bestow
                  a final plea on behalf of the young artist, a plea that has the ring of an aesthetic
                  benediction: “may the unextinguished Spirit of his illustrious friend animate the
                  creations of his pencil and plead against Oblivion for his name!” The irony, of course,
                  is that it is the <em>extinguishing</em> body of Severn’s illustrious friend that “animated” the one creation of his pencil
                  to have “defeated oblivion for his name.” Severn made many other pictures, of course,
                  paintings of historical or literary subjects—Keats and Shelley among them—subjects
                  which constituted his ambitions and the miniatures which made him money. But it seems
                  fair to say that the artist’s images of Keats and Shelley were saved from oblivion
                  in part by their affective relation to a poetry and aesthetics of oblivion, the “oblivious
                  spells” and “oblivious melodies” of Shelley and of Keats. But for the circle of friends
                  devoted to the memory and reputation of Keats—a record of devotion which has made
                  his death a genre of its own—the phrase, “against oblivion,” might serve as an alternate
                  caption for Severn’s death-bed drawing. While Keats’s head rests on a pillow more
                  suggested than drawn, Severn has penciled two concentric cones: a light exterior and
                  dark interior cone which serve as contrast to the three-quarter image of the poet.
                  Thus does Severn, drawing this picture at 3am to “keep awake,” have the face of Keats
                  <em>propped</em> directly “<em>against</em>” a figured oblivion.</p>

                              everything Swann writes, it’s exquisitely composed and delicately conveyed: Swann
                              reads “effects” as closely and intimately as she reads texts; and she allows herself
                              the vulnerability of a reader who acknowledges that she “finds herself reading in
                              the manner of Keats,” offering her own critical voice to this affective currency of

                     of the way its working depends on a sloughing off of context” (275). Swann’s thinking
                     about this version of Keats—“at once supremely self-conscious and so absorbed in his
                     medium that he can seem lost to us”—poses an important question for the Severn image:
                     is it possible to <em>read</em> Severn’s image without inscriptions or captions, whether real or imagined, without
                     the saturation of affect, the genuine pathos that attaches itself to this poet and

                              of the “posthumous” in Keats’s last letters: “To read Keats thinking about his posthumous
                              existence in a ‘last letter’ … is to fall into the tangled temporalities of the epistolary
                              form that breaks apart the commemorative containment of something like a ‘life of
                              letters’” (70).</span></div>
                     </div> In the final term of the death sentence, an artist is marking time against the oblivion
                     of sleep in the days before his poet-friend “stopped breathing.” What appears does
                     not belong to the temporal register of the death mask, that cultural relic on which
                     Swann reflects, but a <em>limit-image</em>. In the mask, she writes, “‘Keats’ only comes into view … as the bright, aesthetic
                     image peeled away from referent and context,” an image that generates the “elegiac
                     delusion: that impossible feeling that ‘the poet is not dead’—but merely sleeping,
                     dreaming, wasting…. The feeling is … the affective freight or ‘ache’ that becomes
                     attached to the image that comes into view at the vanishing point, as ungraspable
                     and ungeneralizable singularity” (275). Much of what Swann says about Keats’s death
                     mask and its casted finality is transferrable to the hastily drawn image Severn produced
                     at the limit: indeed, the “affective freight or ‘ache’” attaches itself perhaps more
                     acutely to Severn’s sketched image, one which documents how the poet might well be
                     “sleeping, dreaming, wasting.”

                              head,” the spot-on phrase he uses to think through Joanna Kane’s arresting photographic
                              portrait series of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century life and death masks collected
                              in the Edinburgh Phrenological Society. She published her treatments of the images
                              in The Somnambulists: Photographic Portraits from Before Photography. If, as Khalip
                              puts it, those “image-masks errantly sleepwalk out of time,” Severn’s image is pinned

                     and re-applicable. It’s three in the morning, the end of “Janry,” and he is drawing
                     this picture to keep himself from sleeping while the poet—sweating a lot right now—is
                     sleeping? dreaming? wasting? dying? It’s an image which, as Shelley puts it in <em>Adonais</em>, “can scarce uplift / The weight of the superincumbent hour” (281­–82).</p>

                  <p>If the ephemerality of drawing often conveys the sense of what Rebecca Comay calls
                     “unfinishedness” (or “under-determination”), the sense of “unfinishedness” conveyed
                     by Severn’s quickly drawn image of Keats is “over-determined” by our awareness that
                     the artist is documenting in “real time” the premature finishing off of the poet (
                     “Tabula Rasa”
                      142). The drawing is an image of the poet at his limit and, in its own state of “unfinishedness”
                     at the limit of the image. Maybe those of us who confess to be taken by the gifts
                     and the passion of this poet will, when we gaze upon this limit-image, “have grown
                     into the likeness of his death,” as Paul writes in his final letter, the one to the
                     Romans. This is another way of asking the question: can seeing ever lead to reading
                     when the very object we behold is constituted more by the aura of painful regret than
                     the proficiency of the artist? Is this the kind of image that, once beheld, makes
                     us beholden, or puts us “in a thrall”?

                              always vulnerable to the sharp ache, the feeling of being ‘drained, without any force’

                     phrasing for my account of Severn’s picture, the image “takes on the force of a relic,
                     … sharply intruding the time of the one who is no longer here into the presence of
                     our” beholding (
                     “Strange Time”
                      279). In Severn’s scandalized presence, Shelley seemed to delight in shocking the
                     pious artist with his indictments against Christianity. But when he writes to Severn
                     of his desire to collect the “remnants” of Keats’s compositions in order “to have
                     them published with a Life and Criticism,” even the godless Shelley declares that
                     Severn’s promised picture of the poet will be “considered among the most sacred relics
                     of the past.”

               <p>Perhaps the power this image exerts over the beholder is a result of Severn’s depiction
                  of the figure’s solitary and even unconscious absorption. Perhaps in order to examine
                  the properties of this image, we can borrow the principles that Michael Fried derives
                  from Diderot for his defining engagement with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French
                  painting. If we look at this picture from Fried’s perspective, Severn’s image of the
                  sleeping poet might derive its power from its depiction “of a personage so absorbed
                  [that it] appear[s] unconscious or <em>oblivious</em> of everything” (7). In other words, it’s an image that defeats theatricality at the
                  limit of consciousness, by surrendering to oblivion. “Like Adonis,” writes Swann,
                  “Endymion is possessed of a certain stagey dreaminess” (
                  “<em>Endymion</em>’s Dreamers”
                  25). Swann names an aspect of Keats’s work that, while crossways with the art historical
                  terms Fried employs, identifies a kind of stage presence charged with this “Keats
                  effect”: “theatrical absorption,” an experience we might have treasured in an acoustic
                  live performance by Elliott Smith or Kurt Cobain. In the drawn or painted representations
                  of sleeping figures, as Fried puts it, the human being abandons “the upright posture
                  that establishes it in perceptual opposition to the object world … surrendering all
                  control or bodily functions as if to a power or rhythm outside oneself” (67): the
                  “deadly sweat was <em>on</em> him all night.” If Severn’s absorptive image intends so little and means so much,
                  it’s because this “unfinished” drawing delivers us to limits that it doesn’t know
                  (unconsciousness, death, oblivion) but that it makes iconic in this shrine of no prospect.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">VI. “So I can sigh eternally”</span></h2>
               <p>I take this final section title from the second verse of 
                  “Pennyroyal Tea,”
                  a song Kurt Cobain wrote and recorded with Nirvana on their last album, <em>In Utero</em> (1994), and performed most memorably in a solo acoustic version on MTV’s <em>Unplugged</em> four months before his death. “Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld,” begins the verse,
                  “so I can sigh eternally.” Cobain is alluding to 
                  “The Tower of Song,”
                  Leonard Cohen’s sardonic account of a place where our best singers reside, both the
                  dead and the dying. Cohen’s “tower of song”—“far in the unapparent”—sounds a lot like
                  a hotel, maybe even the Chelsea—L. Cohen is “paying [his] rent every day” to be there—but
                  it also, and again like the Chelsea, sounds a lot like a shrine, <em>the</em> shrine of the dead or dying troubadours. The only other lodger Cohen identifies is
                  Hank Williams, who “living a hundred floors above him,” is not much of an interlocutor:
                  </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">I said to Hank Williams, ‘how lonely does it get?’ </div>
                     <div class="l">Hank Williams hasn’t answered yet;</div>
                     <div class="l">but I hear him coughing all night long</div>
                     <div class="l">oh, a hundred floors above me in the tower of song.</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> One can see why Cohen’s song appealed to Cobain, by turns musically ambitious and
                  personally self-deprecating: the singer’s desire to find oneself in the “tower of
                  song” is not only ironized by the declaration that he is mere “penny royalty,” but
                  by the doubled irony of a desire that he has made into a death-wish.</p>
               <p>Cohen’s song is saturated by a religious rhetoric which—Christian as well as Jewish—is
                  a feature of so many of his poems and songs and which is always, even when he’s singing
                  his famous “hallelulias,” subjected to the same ironic, “broken” undertow. Here the
                  singer’s prophetic, messianic impulse—“Twenty-seven angels from the great beyond!”
                  “There’s a mighty judgment coming!”—is undone, often in the very next line: “But I
                  may be wrong: / you see you hear these funny voices in the tower of song.” And, however
                  much he might be “crazy for love,” he’s also already singing, posthumously, “with
                  that gift of a golden voice” “from the other side”: “you’ll be hearing from me, baby,
                  long after I’m gone. / I’ll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the tower
                  of song.” The tower of song is this place where the dead are still coughing and the
                  living are “sighing eternally.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It’s as old as poetry itself, of course, this elegiac literary tradition in which
                     poets honor their predecessors by mourning them, fashioning in the process a company
                     of singers they hope to join. <em>Adonais</em> makes famous allusions to Bion and to Moschus—both translated by Shelley—and to Milton;
                     and the poem fashions images of Byron, Hunt, and himself. But Shelley’s elegy marks
                     a new and distinctive species of hyper-identification with the dead poet, one which
                     begins with Shelley and his own personal and poetic projections on a poet about whose
                     poems, at least until <em>Hyperion</em>, he felt a genuine ambivalence. <em>Adonais</em> inaugurates a version of this Western elegiac tradition that amplifies the affective
                     dimension of these retrospective lineages at the very moment it drains them of redemptive
                     potential <em>and sings in praise of that</em>. Or, more precisely, what Walter Benjamin would call its “redemption value” is rendered
                     into something sheerly aesthetic, weak, impotent, and ineffectual: the shrine of no
                     prospect. In the elegy that mourns and celebrates Keats, Shelley called it “the abode
                     where the Eternal are,” where we mind and tend the effects of what Cohen called the
                     “beautiful losers,” residents of the tower of song, not only Cobain but Hank Williams,
                     Nick Drake, Ian Curtis, Elliott Smith. These singers belong in the same expansive
                     cultural constellation with such figures as Oscar Wilde, Percy Shelley, Frank O’Hara,
                     James Dean, Billie Holiday, Walter Benjamin, and especially John Keats—“lost angels
                     of a ruined paradise” as Shelley would call them, icons whose beauty is inseparable
                     from a suffering that in their “excessive Keatsness,” always belonged to “the other
                     side,” always already posthumous.

                              and roll suicides and poetic consumption, drowning, or even accidental death by sports
                              car or dune-buggy. But I believe that in terms of the Keats effect, the mode or manner
                              of death is less important than the image with which it is shrouded and made into
                              something popular even if not biographically accurate. For instance, while composing
                              Adonais, Shelley writes that it was only “by assiduous watching that [Keats] was restrain…</span></div>

               <p>Among the singer-songwriters of this constellation, it’s possible to discern what
                  Benjamin, following Goethe, called “elective affinities” in form, theme, and presentation;
                  but the most significant aspect of their Keats effect resides in their image, one
                  they sang about—the “afterworld,” for instance, of Cohen and Cobain—and an image they
                  sang “to”: songs that went in search of that image and songs that addressed it. And
                  then in many cases, they became that image, “a portion of the loveliness” they “made
                  more lovely.” I do believe the poets and singers I have gathered as examples of the
                  Keats effects share among many other things a demonstrable commitment to the radical
                  lyricization of the ballad form and—at least in the songs that register their “Keatsness”—an
                  avoidance of the anthem. Self-conscious or not, the Keatsian affective register of
                  the oxymoron is inscribed like a signature in the songwriting of these artists, such
                  as Elliott Smith’s one popular hit single, 
                  “Miss Misery,”
                  in which the plaintive puns on “missing” and “misery” also produce the melancholy
                  effects of those late odes. Or Cobain’s 
                  “Dumb”
                  in which the singer’s experience of the blank emotion of dumbness is, suddenly, “maybe
                  just happy.”</p>
               <p>What, then, is the Keats effect that connects these singers, their songs, and others
                  who, regardless of genre, belong to this constellation, this special version of Pandora
                  or a “Keatsness mixtape”? It is an image, one which is redeemed without prospects,
                  without futurity. If redemption without futurity sounds incoherent—two fundamentally
                  different discourses yoked together, something like a theologized nihilism—this discursive
                  discordance is precisely what these images invoke: a Leonard Cohen afterworld of sighs
                  and coughs, “the soul of Adonais, like a star,” beckoning a poet’s boat “far from
                  the shore,” where it is “borne darkly, fearfully, afar,” shrines of martyrs, icons
                  of saints and an absent God, an angel of history forever suspended, forever turned
                  from the future, sighing eternally such that it asks whether there can be an <em>image of the sigh</em>.</p>
               <p>The last song of Nirvana’s <em>MTV Unplugged</em> set, performed on a stage covered with candles and Stargazer lilies, was their cover

                  or, as it is most often called, 
                  “In the Pines.”
                  The set of songs Nirvana performed for that show posited its own remarkable constellation:
                  Cobain’s own compositions, of course, but also songs by David Bowie, The Vaselines,
                  and The Meat Puppets, as well as the homage to Leonard Cohen in 
                  “Pennyroyal Tea,”
                  and then, “lastly,” 
                  “Where Did You Sleep Last Night?”
                  Cobain introduces “the last song of the evening” as one written by Leadbelly, his
                  “favorite performer,” though as he had to know, the song was an anonymous ballad performed
                  by artists ranging from Bill Monroe and Roscoe Holcomb to Loretta Lynn and most recently
                  by Fantastic Negrito. The stories told by the ballad differ considerably from version
                  to version—most often a tale of forsaken love—with the chorus as the song’s only constant.
                  In the Leadbelly version that Nirvana covers, the narrative is almost entirely eliminated,
                  and a central haunting question is introduced which distinguishes this version from
                  every other: “where did you sleep last night?” It’s a question posed to a lover—“my
                  girl”—followed by her reply: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">in the pines, in the pines</div>
                     <div class="l">where the sun don’t ever shine</div>
                     <div class="l">I shivered the whole night through. </div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The Leadbelly version of the song is almost entirely comprised of the chorus which
                  both introduces the song and is then repeated five times, punctuated by an instrumental
                  interlude and one brief verse, which offers only the sketchy violence of a murdered
                  husband whose severed head is found in a “driving wheel.”</p>
               <p>Nirvana plays the song as a dirge, its relentless ballad measure slowed painfully:
                  three acoustic guitars, a cello accompaniment, Dave Grohl’s brushed drums. The performance
                  has the feel of inevitability. Throughout the song, Cobain’s aspect is thoroughly
                  absorptive: eyes downturned (reading the music, reading the lyrics?), voice determined
                  but measured until his signature wail erupts in the final explosive chorus. The last
                  line is broken down into the shards of the chorus: “I shiver whole—[pause]—night through.”
                  That final “through” is extended and distended until it is no longer a sung note but
                  a cry hurled from the very end. But the image of the performance I’d like to extract
                  from this final line is the instant before that, the sudden and brief arrest—fleeting
                  standstill—at which the song and its singer reach the limit. In the instant before
                  that final chilling cry, Cobain sighs and for the first time in the performance opens
                  his eyes. </p>
               <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/popkeats/images/pylefigure2Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 2: Still image of Kurt Cobain performing Where Did You Sleep Last Night? on MTV’s Unplugged" class="inline"/></figure>
               <p> “With awaken’d eyes,” in that moment “where everyone and I stopped breathing,” he
                  gave a breath to his image. This is not just the image of a sigh, but the instance
                  of visual image and audible sigh converging to make a “sigh-image.” In the form of
                  a sigh, it’s an image which comes only to perish. The Keats effects converge here,
                  not as explicit references from Cobain to Keats, but as the affective register through
                  which we experience the performance of this ballad by a singer made iconic by early
                  posthumousness and his own obstructive infatuations. These Keats effects remain ours.</p>

               <p>This essay has been long in the works, and some preliminary portions were presented
                  at two venues: first, in 2009 as an invited talk for a special session at the North
                  American Association for the Study of Romanticism in Toronto called 
                  “Genres of Death,”
                  and then in 2012 as an invited lecture for a Colloquium at the University of Massachusetts
                  at Boston called 
                  “No Prospects: Romanticism at its Edges.”
                  I want to thank, respectively, Ian Balfour and Elizabeth Fay for their invitations
                  and for initiating my early thinking on this topic. Every aspect of this essay is
                  the result of ongoing collaborations and conversations with Jacques Khalip, for which
                  I am immensely grateful.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">I can be certain that there are exceptions to this rule because I am aware of one:
               Derek Jarman’s <em>Caravaggio</em> (1986) which, despite certain explicit anachronisms, conforms in the main to the
               narrative expectations of the genre except at the decisive level of the shot where
               it often depicts a <em>transfer</em> of images that activates the currencies between the film and this most cinematic
               of painters. The best account of this relationship is Leo Bersani and Ulysses Dutoit,
               <em>Caravaggio</em>. To my mind the most vitally true deployment of a Romantic poet in Anglophone cinema
               is Jim Jarmusch’s <em>Dead Man</em> (1995) which features Johnny Depp as an accountant from Cleveland named William Blake
               who travels west and “finds himself” in a surreal Western. After being shot in the
               chest while in bed with Thel, Blake is revived and taken on a trip by Nobody (“Exaybachay”),
               a Native American without a tribe (played by Gary Farmer) who learned by heart the
               poetry of this “dead man” in the “white men’s schools” in England. Over the course
               of their travels further west, Blake “becomes” the poet, a “killer of white men,”
               whose poetry is written with his gun. <em>Dead Man</em> is both visionary and revisionary, a “reconstellation” of the poetry of Blake in
               the redeeming of the genre of the Western.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">The Mary Shelley effect operates on an altogether different scale for popular culture,
               dwarfing in consequence any of the effects we might discern from her contemporaries,
               including her husband, father, and mother. Shelley’s novel deploys Milton’s poetry
               to displace his version of the Adamic myth with the Frankenstein creation myth as
               the popular cultural paradigm for creation. A subset of that popular effect is the
               way in which the creature’s “subversive eloquence” was one of the first and consistent
               casualties. In the first and very popular stage adaptation of the novel in 1823—retitled
               as <em>Presumption, or The Fate of Frankenstein</em>—the creature is rendered mute and has essentially remained that way on stage and
               screen ever since. In a form of narrative arrested development, theatrical and cinematic
               productions—the latter beginning with a silent film in 1910 in Thomas Edison’s film
               studios—the creature remains the “wretch,” the “miserable monster whom” Victor “beholds”
               at the moment of his “birth.” In the countless versions of the story for stage and
               screen that have mined the tale for its horror and its kitsch, the creature’s eloquence,
               his aesthetic sensibilities, and his capacity for poetry have been muted into their
               opposite, the “muttering” of “inarticulate sounds,” that not only drain the story
               of the novel’s lyricism but avoid the more threatening undecidability that attends
               to the creature: how can we not call this cyborg human if he is “moulded” of our same
               “clay” or if he can express our deepest ethical longings and aesthetic judgments,
               and turn his demands into a Miltonic prose poem?</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">While I believe that the pop cultural trajectory from Byron to Morrissey is self-evident,
               what happens if <em>you</em> don’t feel it, especially if you know both Byron and Morrissey? The challenge of
               this essay is to wrestle with how we might measure these effects in forms other than
               cultural allusions or formal influences.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Morrissey, one of the most literate—and literary—of pop singers, has been written
               about often and well, most notably by Morrissey himself: <em>Autobiography</em> chronicles the story of Morrissey’s cultural education from the point of view of
               the streets of Manchester, almost as much a literary as a musical education, though
               more modernist (Housman, Auden) than Romantic in its engagements. Above all, it’s
               Wilde. As he writes in 
               “Cemetery Gates,”
               “Keats and Yeats are on your side and Wilde is on mine.” Musically, his points of

               fact which changes everything we think and say about this artist that meant so much

               “lastness” of Romanticism, including a compelling account of the “tacit” queerness
               of Shelley’s <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (74–91). By now, the queering of Keats should be beyond dispute. The issue of <em>Romanticism on the Net </em> edited by Michael O’Rourke and David Collings features important essays—and an excellent
               introduction by O’Rourke and Collings—which address the queer or “proto-queer” aspect
               of Romantic discourse. On the queering of Keats, see in particular Caroline E. Kimberly,
               
               “Effeminacy, Masculinity, and Homosocial Bonds: The (Un)Intentional Queering of John
               Keats.”
               On this posthumous “queering,” see Amanda Berry’s insightful essay, 
               “Some of My Best Friends are Romanticists: Shelley and the Queer Project in Romanticism.”
               And for any scholar pursuing this queer strain in Romanticism, we are indebted to
               Andrew Elfenbein’s <em>Romantic Genius: The Prehistory of a Homosexual Role</em>. While completing my essay, I came across Eric Eisner’s brilliant 
               “Drag Keats: Mark Doty’s Cockney Poetics”
               and felt confirmed in the direction of my argument. Eisner invokes Keats’s Cockney
               currency as a way of reading Doty’s poetry and its special debts to Keatsian glitter
               and excess. As Eisner puts it, Doty’s “Keats is in fact a Cockney Keats, and … Doty’s
               queer poetics of excess—its campiness, its glitter, even its ostentatious derivativeness—can
               be understood as a kind of Cockney poetics,” with “Keats [as] … the signal poet of
               the simulated, impure, and over-the-top” (388).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               best) of which—
               “Thinking of James Dean”
               —conveys the nature of the poet’s immersion in cultural worlds in which there are
               no distinctions other than vitality, “nerve,” and “variousness.” Like many of O’Hara’s
               best works, the poem is both panoramic and intimate, a “cold last swim / before the
               city” set against “a sky Tiepolo / and Turner compiled in vistavision” as he imagines
               what it is like to be “robbed of these suns and knowledges” and writes a name not
               in water but in sand: “A leaving word in the sand, odor of tides: his name.” Along
               the way, O’Hara’s conceit careens from the Turner-Tiepolo cinema to a bit part in
               <em>Julius Caesar</em> at the Brattle Theatre as his friends “listen to <em>La Boheme</em>”: all as way to register, to frame “Each panoramic second, of / his death” (230–31.22–23,

               the review in <em>The Literary Gazette</em>, Dec. 1821: “The poetry of the work is <em>contemptible</em>, a mere collection of bloated words heaped on each other without order, harmony,

               Keats and Shelley has been indispensable to my own critical and affective engagements
               with these poets and their work. But this one essay in particular is special. As with
               everything Swann writes, it’s exquisitely composed and delicately conveyed: Swann
               reads “effects” as closely and intimately as she reads texts; and she allows herself
               the vulnerability of a reader who acknowledges that she “finds herself reading in
               the manner of Keats,” offering her own critical voice to this affective currency of
               reading-relays. And in the context of the “Keats Effects” I am describing, it is relevant
               to note that I heard the “live version” of this article when it was first presented
               as a conference paper. I was moved in a way I very rarely experience in such venues.
               At that moment, I found myself listening not only as a Romanticist who learns from

               of death is less important than the image with which it is shrouded and made into
               something popular even if not biographically accurate. For instance, while composing
               <em>Adonais</em>, Shelley writes that it was only “by assiduous watching that [Keats] was restrained
               from effecting purposes of suicide”; and Shelley’s “Inheritors of unfulfilled renown”
