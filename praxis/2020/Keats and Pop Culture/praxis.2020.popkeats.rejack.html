            <p class="noCount">This essay traces aspects of Keats’s legacy across popular culture through instances
               and mechanisms of quoting (or misquoting) his work. The essay begins in periodical
               culture soon after Keats’s death (the late 1820s and early 1830s), then moves to the
               discourse around the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857 (which, I suggest
               somewhat speculatively, intersects with Keats in striking ways around quoting), and
               concludes with a bigger leap ahead in time, to contemporary practices of quoting Keats
               through various internet technologies and platforms. In each case the opening line
               to <em>Endymion</em> (“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever”) serves as the focal point around which the
               networked connections of quoting practices and Keats’s posthumous life circulate.
               Ultimately, the essay contends that a history of Keats’s varied emanations across
               and through popular culture must of necessity be a history of mediation, and the essay
               models a way of enacting that kind of work.</p>

            </blockquote><br/><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>We see this logic play out already in <em>Endymion</em>’s opening passage as Keats explains his decision to take up this tale of a Cockney/Classical
                  dreamer overwhelming himself with poesy. The examples of things of beauty that “bind
                  us to the earth” and “Haunt us till they become a cheering light / Unto our souls”
                  emphasize processes of repetition (7, 30–1). We have the sun and the moon with their
                  various daily, monthly, and yearly cycles; trees sprouting, clear rills cooling themselves,
                  forest brakes rich with blooming flowers, all in their cyclical manners; and lastly
                  poems, which recur in the form of repeated readings: “All lovely tales that we have
                  heard or read” (22). The things themselves are all variable, repeatable things, but
                  they also replicate insofar as they become “bound to us so fast / That […] / They
                  always must be with us, or we die” (31–3). The joy of beauty both is and is not a
                  part of the thing itself—it inheres in the object and in the relation that forms between
                  the object and the observer of it. This logic continues in the poem’s narrative, as
                  Endymion suffers over his repeated viewings, remembrances, and retellings of his encounters
                  with Cynthia, “that completed form of all completeness” (606). Of course, the “completed
                  form” of Cynthia is apparently incomplete until she returns in a new body (that of
                  the Indian Maid), which turns out to have been a sort of clone of the original all
                  along. Only by such repetition does anything ever happen in the poem. And even then,
                  very little does, as ultimately Endymion ascends with his lover as the poem promptly
                  and without fanfare ends. Yet as Noel Jackson suggests, the poem’s “inconsequential
                  fulfillment, its fulfillment of inconsequence” functions as a “site of contingency,
                  vitality, and (indeed) promise” (329). From one perspective the poem represents stagnation,
                  but from a more properly Keatsian one, that stagnation appears dynamic.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>That this opening line from <em>Endymion</em> becomes (arguably) Keats’s most frequently quoted verse is fitting given that quoting
                     operates in a manner similar to Keats’s beauty and joy. Quotation, too, must be reiterated.
                     It also does not need to emerge from a position of authenticity or originality. Particularly
                     in the nineteenth century as his posthumous reputation slowly took shape, Keats was
                     a poet more quoted than read. While it’s certainly true that some instances of quoting
                     Keats resulted from a reader drawing on deep engagement with his work, it’s also true
                     that the prevalence of quoting Keats during his first half-century or so of posthumous
                     existence meant that many could interact with his work primarily through quotation
                     without access to reading the work in other forms. Furthermore, quoting begets more
                     quoting. Precisely because of the iterability of quoting, one could regularly <em>quote</em> Keats without having really ever <em>read</em> Keats.

                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In her book Quotation Marks, Marjorie Garber poses a similar sort of iterability with
                              respect to quoting’s relationship to authority: “It instates an authority elsewhere,
                              and, at the same time, it imparts that authority, temporarily, to the speaker or writer”
                              (2). While Keats may not have had much cultural authority in the first decade when
                              he began to be quoted (the 1820s), the authority accrued to him and to writers quoting
                              him gained further relevance precisely through the nature of quotation which Garber
                              identifies.</span></div>
                     </div> In short, the mechanisms of quotation play a large part in the shaping and spread
                     of Keats’s legacy. This is certainly true today when we can encounter quotations from
                     Keats across a wide range of websites, not to mention the many misquotations and wild
                     misattributions that mingle with the more accurate materials. As ubiquitous as Keats
                     is now, quoting Keats in the nineteenth century was widespread as well. One particularly
                     influential instance occurred at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857,
                     when more than one million visitors over the space of five months contemplated paintings,
                     drawings, photographs, and examples of other arts while the opening line of <em>Endymion</em> was presiding over them, the words emblazoned on the arch above the building’s entrance.
                     Keats’s line was positioned so as to condition exhibition viewers’ responses to a
                     wide variety of media forms, including the nascent form of photography, which raised
                     significant questions about beauty’s thing-ness due to the technology’s relationship
                     to reproducibility.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The logics of cultural and aesthetic reproducibility in the nineteenth century have
                     informed many scholarly treatments of Keats, which view his poetic project as a belated
                     one, but one which nonetheless attempts an intervention, even if it occurs only through
                     secondary, indirect, or remediated forms.

                              that Keats develops his poetics out of his position of alienation with respect to
                              his class identity. In more positive terms, both Charles Rzepka, in his reading of
                              
                              “On First Looking Into Chapman’s Homer,”
                              and Jeffrey Cox, in his analysis of “Cockney classicism,” suggest how we might view
                              Keats’s alienation and belatedness as more unalloyed advantages, as opposed to causes
                              of symptomatic anxious responses.</span></div>
                     </div> That last term, <em>remediated</em>, has become of particular interest to many romanticists currently engaging in what
                     has been dubbed “Romantic Media Studies.”

                              Yohei Igarashi’s 2013 MLA roundtable devoted to the topic. More recently, in his Romantic
                              Mediations: Media Theory and British Romanticism, Andrew Burkett offers a rich overview
                              of, and exciting ways forward for, the subfield. His book shows how writers in the
                              romantic period “express[ed] diverse, flexible conceptions of both media and mediation
                              … before the media concept became distilled later in the nineteenth century into its
                              modern sense as the notion of the technological channel of communication” (3).</span></div>
                     </div> Romantic media studies includes not only the many exciting works devoted to the textuality
                     of the period (book history approaches like William St. Clair’s, media ecological
                     work like Maureen McLane’s, and media-theory-inflected work like Celeste Langan’s
                     and Andrew Burkett’s); it also extends to projects that situate romanticist scholarship
                     within contemporary issues of mediation (digitally-built projects like NINES and the
                     Blake Archive, but also traditional scholarly works that explore the implications
                     of contemporary digital culture, such as Jerome McGann’s <em>A New Republic of Letters</em>). With specific regard to Keats, I share Yohei Igarashi’s contention that “communicative
                     mediation constitutes a significant, although still largely unremarked, concern of
                     Keats’s poetry and letters” (173). By opening with the iterability of beauty in <em>Endymion</em>, then, I suggest that when we speak of aesthetics in Keats, we must also speak of
                     mediation in Keats. If beauty must be reproduced in order to persist as a joy, then
                     it must also be remediated.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This essay approaches Keats’s afterlife in popular culture by examining how he has
                     been, and continues to be, quoted. I argue that quoting ought to be understood as
                     a material and medial practice, not merely a discursive one. In order to grasp the
                     significance of Keats’s place within popular culture, we need to attend to the material
                     mechanisms of quotation—which requires asking questions about access, distribution,
                     remediation, replication, and transformation, among other material processes related
                     to reading—and we need to place those mechanisms in a historical frame which allows
                     for both continuity and tension between materialities past, present, and future. To
                     explore some of these dynamics with respect to quoting Keats, I examine three different
                     broadly construed moments and media technologies: periodical magazines in the decades
                     immediately after Keats’s death, photography in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century,
                     and the internet in our contemporary moment. In each case, as I will show, we cannot
                     treat these moments and technologies in their own vacuums. The practices of quoting
                     Keats, both past and present, always operate within a media ecology that operates
                     through networks of association between various media and through different temporal
                     frames.

                              from Samuel Richardson to Jane Austen provides a useful analog for how quotation operates
                              with respect to different genres and media. Her focus is on how quotations of Shakespeare
                              in novels serve to buttress Shakespeare’s growing reputation, while also helping to
                              lend cultural significance to the novel form itself. The “cultures of quotation” that
                              influence the novelistic treatments involve other forms of media, including the stage,
                              periodicals, and the conventions of polite conversation. See especially 21–48.</span></div>

                     from probing the borders between scholarly and popular discourse. This is particularly
                     true for studying Keats, since he was and is a figure with pop-cultural standing alongside
                     his revered place in literary studies. These borders are porous, and to better conceive
                     of Keats and his work, we need to understand not just popular Keats and scholarly
                     Keats, but also the web of relations linking the two.

                              floating signifier” (29). While in scholarly contexts there has been much debate about
                              what precisely Keats quotes the urn saying, in the many examples Garber cites from
                              a variety of pop cultural sources, the lines are unambiguously credited as something
                              Keats himself uttered. I suggest a similar dynamic plays out with the opening line
                              of Endymion, which signifies in vastly different ways as it moves from and between

                     shifting the borders themselves. Work on the reception of Keats demonstrates that
                     he has always been taken up in a number of disciplines and cultural contexts, and
                     thus provides a historical frame and model for engagement with literary work that
                     eschews our conventional notions of disciplinary borders.

                  <p>How exactly, then, might we situate my first example of quoting Keats, from what is
                     essentially a school newspaper in 1828 showing its Keats-fanboy cred? The text in

                     (
                     “The Editor Out of Bounds”
                     ) of the July 1828 issue, we encounter Keats’s opening lines of <em>Endymion</em> used to characterize the joyful way in which the young approach the world (192).

                              where “the lamented Keats” is referred to as “the most pure and imaginative poet of

                     when one could not simply Google a line to check for accuracy (why such misquotations
                     still occur in an era when one <em>can</em> Google for accuracy is a question I address in this essay’s final section). In 1828
                     Keats had also yet to be republished, so the Harrow students would have relied on
                     being some of the lucky few who had access to a copy of <em>Endymion</em> (or perhaps only read extracts from the poem printed in reviews from the time of its
                     initial publication ten years before). In the next issue (August 1828) the lines appear
                     again, this time coming as an epigraph to Edward Seymour’s essay on John Moultrie’s
                     poetry, and this time with greater accuracy—“Its,” instead of “the,” but still “increaseth”
                     instead of “increases” (198).</p>

                     “To Correspondents”
                     ). But how exactly did that come to be the case? <em>Endymion</em> was not exactly a bestseller, and editions of Keats’s poetry were few and far between
                     before the late 1840s.

                     legacy, in part because of the access to books otherwise inaccessible which they may
                     have enabled. Clearly there were some Keats fans at Harrow in 1828, and we know as
                     well that a few years later at Cambridge, Keats was one of the favored poets discussed
                     at the meetings of the Apostles Club, whose members included Alfred Tennyson, Arthur
                     Hallam, and Keats’s eventual biographer, Richard Monckton Milnes. One institutional
                     factor which affects the early history of quoting Keats, then, is the nature of the
                     elite educational system in the decades after Keats’s death.</p>

                     at the end of the Regency period. Of course, during Keats’s career periodical criticism
                     played a significant part in shaping his contemporary reception as well as setting
                     the stakes for his posthumous life (<em>Adonais</em> begins with a preface blaming Keats’s death on the cruelty and bad taste of reviewers).

                     his quoting of Keats slots into a still ongoing debate about poetry, of which Keats
                     and the Cockney School attacks were just one example of the broader transformations
                     in periodical culture which had been in process since the end of the eighteenth century.

                              Cox. Duncan Wu offers this helpful summation of current critical consensus about what
                              the attacks meant: “In Z.’s anatomy, a ‘Cockney’ lacked taste and education but was

                     </div> Given the increase in number and cultural influence of periodicals during the early-nineteenth
                     century, it’s not surprising that Harrow’s school newspaper would be modelled on popular
                     periodicals of the day, nor is it surprising that after editing the <em>Harrovian</em> Willmott contributed to <em>Fraser’s Magazine</em> and the <em>London Magazine</em> in the years immediately after completing his schooling at Harrow. In June 1830, Willmott
                     publishes his first of many pieces for <em>Fraser’s</em>, and he opens his discussion of “The Minor Greek Poets” by quoting the opening to <em>Endymion</em> yet again. In his praise of Keats in the essay, Willmott buttresses his judgment by
                     quoting the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> ascribing to Keats “‘a pervading tunefulness of nature’” (
                     “Greek Poets”
                      608). At first glance one might assume that Willmott quotes from Francis Jeffrey’s
                     tentative defense of Keats published in August 1820, but it actually comes from Thomas
                     Carlyle’s review of John Gibson Lockhart’s <em>The Life of Robert Burns</em> in the <em>Edinburgh</em> in December 1828. In context, Carlyle’s comment is more faint praise than Willmott
                     makes it seem: the full quotation is “a certain vague pervading tunefulness of nature”
                     (281). More importantly, the full context also makes the connection to the attacks
                     on Keats clearer: Lockhart was, of course, the writer of the Cockney School essays
                     in <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em>. All of this is to say, when Willmott quotes Keats in <em>Fraser’s</em> in 1830, and when he and others quote Keats in the <em>Harrovian</em> in 1828, they are continuing the periodical jockeying over Keats’s reputation that
                     began a decade earlier with the famous attacks in <em>Blackwood’s</em>, the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, and elsewhere.</p>
               </div>
               <p>While we may tend to look toward Shelley’s <em>Adonais</em> as the most significant early shaper of Keats’s posthumous reputation, it’s worth
                  recalling that the periodical wars to which Shelley was responding by elegizing Keats
                  continued to be fought long after they first began when Keats was still alive. Willmott’s
                  defense of Keats (and his marshalling of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>’s opinion as evidence in his favor) no doubt felt necessary when one could encounter
                  fresh attacks on Keats such as John Wilson Croker’s in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> in 1833. Fifteen years after his notoriously caustic review of <em>Endymion</em>, Croker deliberately sets out to do the same to Alfred Tennyson’s 1832 volume. In
                  a letter to <em>Quarterly Review</em> publisher John Murray, Croker promised to “undertake Tennyson and … make another
                  Keats of him” (qtd. in Sherwood 41). It was not only that Croker wanted to create
                  a similar effect on Tennyson. He saw the two poets as committing similar affronts
                  to appropriate poetic taste. Croker opens the review by noting that Tennyson is “another
                  and a brighter star of that galaxy or <em>milky way</em> of poetry of which the lamented Keats was the harbinger” (81). Quickly, though, a
                  surprising turn of humility seems to occur, as Croker claims to “take this occasion
                  to sing our palinode on the subject of ‘Endymion’” (82). He goes on to apologize for
                  his short-sightedness, which prevented him from “foresee[ing] the unbounded popularity
                  which has carried it through we know not how many editions.” Lastly he requests that
                  “the publisher of the new and beautiful edition of Keats’s works now in the press,
                  with graphic illustrations by Calcott and Turner, will do us the favour and the justice
                  to notice our conversion in his prolegomena” (82).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, <em>Endymion</em> had not gone through any editions beyond the first, and no such edition of his collected
                     works existed except as a fiction employed by Croker to mock any who might be trying
                     to rescue Keats from the stigma placed upon him by the <em>Quarterly</em> back in 1818. The fiction demonstrates that Keats’s posthumous reputation was continually
                     affected by actual material bibliographic practices and figural representations of
                     them. And what matters here is that, according to Croker, not only is Keats not being
                     read, he’s not being published, and not being published in particular ways: namely,
                     with the elaborations of visual elements provided by fashionable painters like Callcott
                     and Turner. He <em>was</em> being published, however, in one of the most popular venues for poetry publishing
                     during the late 1820s and 1830s: in the literary annuals and gift books which were
                     adorned with engravings of paintings by figures like Callcott and Turner. Keats’s 
                     “On a Picture of Leander”
                      and “In drear nighted December” had appeared in Thomas Hood’s <em>The Gem</em> (in 1829 and 1830, respectively). We might thus read Croker’s crass posthumous mockery
                     as rooted in defensiveness. Seeing that poetry was being published in other forms
                     than expensive illustrated editions, and seeing that the dastardly sapling Keats was
                     taking root in the popular soil of the annuals, Croker feels compelled to lash out
                     not only at the individual poet, but also at the systemic shifts in the publishing
                     of poetry.

                              in the numbers of poetry books published in England after 1820, when the market for
                              such books hit its peak. He notes that the popularity of annuals and gift books helped
                              to exacerbate the other forces that were making it difficult for publishers to invest
                              in the publication of volumes of poetry. See especially 26–48.</span></div>
                     </div> Just as with the initial attacks on Keats, this later one can be read as a sign of

               </div>
               <p>Given that in the 1820s and 30s Keats’s reputation was still being wrestled over in
                  the pages of the same magazines which sought to silence him when he was still breathing,
                  we ought to read Willmott’s instances of quoting Keats in periodicals not simply as
                  neutral expressions of appreciation, but as willful acts of contestation. Willmott
                  and his young peers at the <em>Harrovian</em> were seeking to make names for themselves within the periodical arena, and one strategy
                  for so doing was to renew and extend the cause of defending another youngster who
                  had fought in the same space a decade before. In short, these early instances of quoting
                  Keats’s most famous line play a part in making it the most famous of his lines, and
                  they ought to be understood as responses to the material and medial conditions of
                  late-Regency/early-Victorian periodical writing, through which Keats’s steady spread
                  into popular discourse had to be negotiated and actively pursued.</p>
               <p>While the <em>Literary Gazette</em> calls the opening line of <em>Endymion</em> “Keats’ often-quoted line” in 1849, its popularity surely experienced a surge after
                  1857. The clear reason for the spike is the line’s presence over the archway at the
                  entrance to the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, which ran from May to October
                  1857. Visitors would have seen it there, but it also became a common reference point
                  in writings about the exhibition in newspapers and periodicals during that year. Announcements
                  in April describing the upcoming exhibition often noted the presence of Keats’s verse:
                  on 10 April 1857 both the <em>Globe</em> and <em>Morning Chronicle</em> used the same notice from the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>, which noted, “At the eastern (or entrance) end, we find the well-known and very
                  appropriate line—‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever!’” Over the next few weeks,
                  leading up to the opening of the exhibition on 5 May, similar notices appeared in
                  newspapers across the country, giving Keats’s line probably its most concentrated
                  period of quotation since the first publication of <em>Endymion</em> nearly four decades prior. One wonders if John Wilson Croker came across any of these
                  newspaper articles, and if he did, was he perhaps still galled that his attempts to
                  relegate <em>Endymion</em> to obscurity in 1818 had failed, thanks in part to the popularity of that one eminently
                  quotable opening line? While I am generally disinclined to dance on anyone’s grave,
                  I also cannot help noting that Croker died just a few months after so many newspapers
                  admiringly quoted Keats in April 1857. Perhaps it was Croker who ultimately found
                  himself snuffed out by an article.</p>
               <p>If it’s any consolation to Croker, at least he wasn’t alive in October to witness
                  an even greater concentration of approving quotations of Keats. During the months
                  the exhibition was open, reviews and notices of it frequently mentioned Keats’s line,
                  but it garnered even greater attention at the exhibition’s final day, 17 October 1857.
                  After an orchestra played music to mark the conclusion, Thomas Fairbairn, Chairman
                  of the Executive Committee for the exhibition, offered a brief speech to officially
                  close the exhibition: “… when you have left this building the Exhibition of Art-Treasures
                  is closed. I hope that you will never forget the liberality which has enabled that
                  Exhibition to be formed, and that hereafter all of you will be enabled to realise,
                  the truth of the poet’s line—‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever’” (
                  “Close”
                  ). By all accounts these remarks were met with robust cheers from the nearly twenty-thousand
                  assembled guests. Keats’s words thus announced the exhibition in early advertisements
                  for it, they oversaw visitors over the course of five months as they entered the building,
                  and they echoed throughout that structure amid the applause marking the end of the
                  exhibition.</p>
               <p>In this instance we again see the importance of the periodical press, although not
                  with respect to the same culture of literary reviewing as that which animates Wilmott’s
                  quoting of Keats in 1828–30. This case also involves multiple media through which
                  the quoting of Keats occurs (architecture, image, print, voice). To further establish
                  the connection between this example and my final section focused on quoting Keats
                  via image-sharing websites, there is one additional nineteenth-century medium to which
                  I will briefly turn: photography. The connection between Keats and photography is
                  an indirect and subtle one, but the presence of his opening line of <em>Endymion</em> at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition suggests potential ways we might illuminate
                  that connection further.</p>
               <p>As photographic technologies continued to evolve in the first few decades after Louis
                  Dageurre and Henry Fox Talbot in the 1830s each separately developed and promoted
                  their image-making methods, several common aspects of photography’s cultural significance
                  began to emerge. As Steve Edwards notes in <em>The Making of English Photography</em>, “The most striking feature of nineteenth-century English writing on photography
                  is its overall sense of unease” (15). One primary form of that unease had to do with
                  its uncertain status as art. Even though Talbot referred to his process as “the Art
                  of Photogenic Drawing,” many viewed photography as no more than a purely mechanical
                  process, one which involved little to no intervention of the artistic mind. Photographers
                  and advocates for photography had to work hard to convince people that, as one correspondent
                  in <em>The Photographic Journal</em> put it in May 1859, “photographers can think with their cameras as well as painters
                  can with their brushes, or sculptors with their chisels” (
                  “Photography and Art”
                  ). Even as late as 1861, The Royal Commissioners responsible for organizing the International
                  Exhibition of 1862 thought otherwise about the apparatus and products of the camera.
                  In deciding on the taxonomy for that exhibition, they followed the Great Exhibition
                  of 1851 in classing photography among the “Machinery” section instead of among the
                  “Fine Arts,” to the great disappointment and ire of the members of the Photographic
                  Society. A great debate ensued, with the Photographic Society attempting to convince
                  the Commissioners that photography did not belong “among the ploughs, harrows, and
                  watering cans!” as one writer for the <em>Photographic Journal</em> put it (Edwards 165–7). Sadly for the photographers, they did not prevail, and in
                  a rather nasty twist of fate, many of their works of art (or rather, works of manufacture)
                  were damaged, since the pictures were displayed on an upper floor, where intense heat
                  and humidity caused many to start decaying (Edwards 189).</p>
               <p>Although Edwards does not discuss it in his book, which treats at length the 1862
                  International Exhibition controversy, there was an earlier exhibition at which photography
                  was displayed unambiguously as a fine art: the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition.
                  The executive committee designed the exhibition to demonstrate Britain’s wealth of
                  privately owned art works (on loan from the nation’s nobility), and, in a similarly
                  nationalistic vein, to educate the public about art and cultural history. As Elizabeth
                  Pergam argues in her book-length study of the Exhibition, there was also a clear commercial
                  impulse at work, even though the organizing committee members tried hard to divorce
                  those concerns from the supposedly more lofty cultural and artistic ones. It’s not
                  entirely clear why the committee so readily defined “Art Treasures” as inclusive of
                  “Oil Paintings, Water-colour Drawings, Engravings, and Photographs” along with various
                  kinds of plastic and decorative arts (Pergam 245). But whatever the reasoning (commercial,
                  educational, art historical, or otherwise), the Manchester Exhibition represents one
                  of the first times that mass numbers of people would have experienced photography
                  in the context of an art exhibition. Some 1.3 million people visited it, and when
                  they did, they were encouraged by Keats’s words to think of photographs as things
                  of beauty capable of providing as much joy as any others. </p>
               <p>In addition to its uneasy cultural status, one of the key issues for photography in
                  its infancy revolves around the uncertain ontology of the photographic image. In the
                  early decades of photographic images, writers often explored the tension between the
                  material and (seemingly) immaterial properties of those images. That is, in attempting
                  to explain what precisely photographs were, writers frequently took recourse to quasi-magical
                  explanations, as in Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s 1843 letter to Mary Russell Mitford,
                  where she describes her wonder at the daguerreotype: “Think of a man sitting down
                  in the sun and leaving his facsimile in all its full completion of outline and shadow,
                  steadfast on a plate, at the end of a minute and a half! The Mesmeric disembodiment
                  of spirits strikes one as a degree less marvelous” (qtd. in Fraser 138). Barrett Browning
                  recognizes the material processes at work—the interaction of light and shadow with
                  a chemically treated plate—but as did many other writers, she also poses this interaction
                  as a kind of spiritual, immaterial, magical process. </p>
               <p>The tenuous materiality of photography, then, made it difficult for writers to articulate
                  what exactly was the thing of beauty that might be a joy for ever. And moreover, that
                  tenuous materiality was even more tenuous over time. As the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> wrote of photographic processes in 1843, they offered the potential of collapsing
                  time into minute durations that seemed capable of preserving those times and places:
                  “The self-delineated landscape is seized at one epoch of time, and is embalmed amid
                  all the co-existing events of the social and physical world […]; and every picture
                  becomes an authentic chapter in the history of the world” (
                  “Photogenic Drawing”
                  330). A further temporal complication, however, is raised by the increasing prevalence,
                  over the next few decades, of photographic processes which employed multiple stages.
                  Whereas the daguerreotype, as discussed by both Barrett Browning and the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, involved a single process (light acting upon a plate to produce a positive image
                  thereon), what became the standard later was the dual, negative-positive process.
                  One advantage of this two-part method was that multiple copies could be produced from
                  a single negative. That reproducibility, as in Keats, meant that permanence was more
                  likely, since an object could be made and remade again and again. But that dual process
                  also rendered less clear the ontology of the image. We see this tension on display
                  in one of the reviews of the photographic gallery at the Manchester Art Treasures
                  Exhibition, where a writer for the <em>Liverpool and Manchester Photographic Journal</em> (later the <em>British Journal of Photography</em>) begins by noting the “striking omission” of “direct photography” (such as daguerreotypes,
                  which by 1857 were becoming far less common). He regrets that “all that we see here
                  are the result of a subsequent process […] the original negatives are nowhere visible”
                  (
                  “Exhibition”
                  126). It might seem odd to us that a visitor to a gallery of photography would complain
                  about not having the negatives on display, but that fact demonstrates the extent to
                  which the photographic object was not yet a culturally fixed one. All of this is to
                  say, early photographic discourse shows how the technology posed challenges for how
                  to locate the materiality of this particular aesthetic object. It offered the sense
                  of an eternally fixed image, “an authentic chapter in the history of the world,” as
                  the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> puts it. But it also seemed multiply-distributed across space and time thanks to
                  its reproducibility, and as would later become clear, due to its liability to change.</p>
               <p>We see these dynamics play out in the commercial realm of photography as well, where
                  once again Keats’s words prove rather useful in their elasticity and applicability.
                  There are scores of examples from the late-nineteenth century of <em>Endymion</em>’s opening line being used in advertisements, for everything from clothing to stove
                  polish, and, in a number of examples, for photography. Take the case of John Rowlinson
                  of Bury, who in 1857 owned a “Photographic and Fine Art Gallery.” In the <em>Bury Times</em> in October of 1857, as the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition was coming to a close,
                  Rowlinson was promoting his services by using the opening line of <em>Endymion</em> as the epigram for his advertisements. The notice refers to the “beautiful Art of
                  Photography,” and encourages patrons to take advantage of the ample natural light
                  which flows into his newly constructed gallery for the purposes of “tak[ing] Correct
                  Likenesses in any kind of weather.” The advertisement concludes with this rather macabre
                  warning: “Call at JOHN ROWLINSON’S Photographic Establishment, 17, PRINCESS-STREET,
                  BURY, and have your shadow taken before the substance fades away.” Besides reminding
                  potential customers of their own mortality, Rowlinson’s advertisement capitalizes
                  on the tensions inherent to the nature of photography which Keats’s line captures
                  as well. Photographs are mere shadows, and yet they persist and endure after the substance
                  fades away; things of beauty have a material basis, and yet the joy which they also
                  are transcends that finitude. Even if this advertisement were not inspired by the
                  presence of Keats’s words at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, the congruence
                  of the three—the line from <em>Endymion</em>, the popularization of photography as art at the exhibition, and Rowlinson’s advertisements
                  in the same month that Keats’s words and the exhibition were being linked in numerous
                  newspapers across the country—nonetheless creates a moment during which the quoting
                  of Keats’s most famous sentiment was closely associated with this new media form and
                  how it was understood in relation to aesthetics.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One way to link my first two stories with my last is with the concept of the middlebrow,
                     which Brian Bates, in the introduction to this collection, offers as a valuable heuristic
                     for making sense of Keats and/in popular culture. Both periodical culture—which during
                     the Romantic period moved more and more towards democratization and away from its
                     roots in gentility—and photography—which began as the product of Talbot’s aristocratic
                     leisure but quickly transformed into a mass, popular technology—fulfill several of
                     Beth Driscoll’s eight family attributes of the middlebrow: “middle class, reverential
                     towards elite culture, entrepreneurial, mediated, feminized, emotional, recreational,
                     and earnest” (6). The story of quoting Keats across the nineteenth century is undoubtedly
                     one told through and enabled by the particular affordances of the media cultures of
                     the time; it is also a story of how those media-ecological entanglements emerge from
                     and help shape ideas about the aesthetic, about class, and about the democratization
                     of culture. Keats becomes, and continues to be, an effective tool for these mechanisms
                     at least in part because of his own work’s status as decidedly middlebrow, whether
                     conceived of through Christopher Ricks’s embarrassed Keats, Marjorie Levinson’s illegitimate
                     Keats, Nicholas Roe’s unapologetically Cockney Keats, or any number of other accounts
                     which position Keats in the liminal spaces between the high and the low, the elite
                     and the popular. The forms of mediation which give us quoted Keats in the nineteenth
                     century are themselves likewise situated in the space of the middlebrow.

                              but she (and other scholars of the middlebrow) have stressed the importance of the
                              concept’s emergence at the turn of the twentieth century, and the “family resemblance”
                              definitional approach Driscoll takes also allows for a fluid application across different
                              periods and contexts (5–6). With respect to Keats, his early critics certainly cast
                              him as what would become recognizable as middlebrow about a century later (the Cockney

                     </div> I turn lastly, then, to that intensely middlebrow contemporary realm of mediation,
                     the internet, and especially that corner of the internet through which individuals
                     self-fashion themselves through acts of quotation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>My significant jump forward in time may seem to place us in a wildly different media
                  environment than that of the nineteenth century. As I’ve shown, however, a focus on
                  quoting Keats in popular culture in the past is one that leads us into a rich, multiply-mediated
                  ecosystem. The mechanisms of contemporary new media are certainly different in kind
                  and degree, but they nonetheless exist in relation to the broader history of media
                  that helps illuminate Keats’s reception beginning two hundred years ago. Just as a
                  focus on quoting Keats in the periodicals of the 1820s and 30s can help reveal the
                  particularities of that media-specific moment; and just as a focus on quoting Keats
                  around the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition shows a confluence between the democratization
                  of art, the continuing spread of periodical culture, and the emergence of the photographic
                  arts; so too does a focus on quoting Keats on the wilds of the internet demonstrate
                  the way that the middlebrow propagates through non-human media agents as much as through
                  conscious intentional human actors. With respect to Keats’s presence on quotation
                  websites, and particularly on image-sharing sites like Instagram and Pinterest, my
                  primary interests lie with what happens when quoting goes awry. As I suggested with
                  the initial examples of the <em>Harrovian</em>’s slight misquotations, the internet is not where misinformation, misattribution,
                  and other forms of departures from reality and fact began; however, I focus on the
                  mistaken examples of quoting Keats on the internet because they are particularly intriguing
                  for their connections with how quoting propagates through digital platforms.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The variety of misquotations and misattributions associated with Keats floating around
                     the internet is impressive, though not necessarily atypical. Garson O’Toole, the pseudonymous
                     founder of the website, Quote Investigator (quoteinvestigator.com), and author of <em>Hemingway Didn’t Say That: The Truth Behind Familiar Quotations</em>, has spent nearly a decade attempting to catalogue, correct, and explain the origins

                     </div> Thanks to Jane Campion’s film <em>Bright Star</em>, which featured a significant amount of dialogue lifted directly from Keats’s letters
                     alongside invented sentences and conversations, one can find at least one example
                     of what O’Toole calls the “historical fiction” mechanism, or when a quotation from
                     a piece of historical fiction gets attributed directly to the person depicted in the
                     fiction. In <em>Bright Star</em>, for instance, Keats as portrayed by Ben Whishaw says to Abbie Cornish as Fanny Brawne,
                     “We have woven a web, you and I, attached to this world but a separate world of our
                     own invention.” The sentence has circulated widely, sometimes with images from the
                     scene in the film, but more commonly with simply a textual attribution to Keats. While
                     many misquotations and misattributions have fairly transparent explanations behind
                     them, others confound (at least my) understanding. I’ve yet to concoct a plausible

                     “Skyscraper,”

                     in jest and in appreciation of the absurdity. One reblogger on tumblr offers this
                     valuable corrective: “Obviously it wasn’t John Keats, it was Sylvia Plath.”

                  <p>Other examples fall under O’Toole’s “ventriloquy” category, which involves statements
                     that seem plausible to attribute to the person in question. For instance, one can
                     perhaps understand why Keats might have written something like “I am profoundly enchanted
                     with the flowing complexity in you” to Fanny Brawne. A variety of quotations about
                     failure have also been attributed to Keats, perhaps because of his statement from
                     the preface to <em>Endymion</em>, “There is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object” (<em>Poems</em> 102), as well as his more accepting perspective on failure from his 8 October 1818
                     letter to James Augustus Hessey: “I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner
                     fail than not be among the greatest” (<em>Letters</em> I: 374). While those two quotations do appear in results for a Google search for “Keats
                     failure,” the far more common results, at least in the case of images, involve some
                     version of this misattribution: “Don’t be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive
                     experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success.” What’s distinctive about
                     this last quotation, though, is that it’s been around (in this form or in similar
                     ones) and attributed to Keats since the late-nineteenth century. We see the collision
                     of quoting practices from 140 years ago and those of today when encountering, for
                     instance, the 1877 <em>New Cyclopedia of Prose Illustrations</em> via Google Books.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The full quotation in Elon Foster’s New Cyclopedia is as follows: “Albeit failure
                              in any cause produces a correspondent misery in the soul, yet it is, in a sense, the
                              highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek
                              earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error
                              which we shall afterward carefully eschew” (320). Other books attribute the quotation
                              in this form to Keats, but as far as I have discovered, Foster’s is the earliest one.</span></div>
                     </div> Here quoting Keats (although through a misattribution) occurs in a particular print
                     context in 1877 which persists and evolves as it enters into the digital context of
                     2019, and it does so through the particularities of mass digitization efforts, OCR
                     technologies, and search capabilities.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Although O’Toole uses the resources of the twenty-first century to do the work of
                  tracking misquotations and misattributions, and he does also gesture toward the causal
                  relationship between the proliferation of misinformation and digital media, I suggest
                  that understanding the mechanisms of (mis)quoting in our era requires more attention
                  to that causality. That is not to say that in the era of print periodicals and books
                  that those media did not exert a causal force on such dynamics. How Keats became associated
                  with the failure quotation in the <em>New Cyclopedia of Prose Illustrations</em> likely involved the specific ways that books like it were produced, as much as the
                  association of Keats and some of his writing with failure. In the digital context,
                  however, the mechanisms involved are often further removed from human activity and
                  rooted more deeply in the materiality of computational processes. As such, the nature
                  of quoting Keats (or anyone else) in contemporary media needs to be understood as
                  part of a broader history of mediation, while also recognizing the distinctiveness
                  of new media.</p>
               <p>My final example gestures toward some of the specific ways in which the particularities
                  of digital media drive potential misattributions in ways distinct from the earlier
                  history I’ve discussed thus far. The misattribution in question (“Life is divine Chaos.
                  It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way”) I first encountered by searching for
                  #johnkeats on Instagram, and have since encountered it on several other sites. There
                  is perhaps an argument to be made that this example falls under the “ventriloquy”
                  category, given that Keats’s famous coinage, negative capability, has led to a wide
                  range of ideas associating Keats with “being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without
                  any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” (<em>Letters</em> I: 193). Keats fans might thus find it plausible to attribute to him the notion of
                  life as divine chaos, the messiness of which must be accepted and not irritably resisted.
                  More importantly, though, this example illustrates some of the nebulous computational
                  processes that likely led to the misattribution happening in the first place and contributed
                  to its spread. A longer and slightly different version of the quotation (without the
                  messiness phrase) is elsewhere attributed to solbeam, which is the pen name of a blogger
                  who runs a site called “seekingsol.” In a post from August 2005 she wrote that the
                  bit about life being divine chaos was what she would say to her 14-year-old self,
                  had she the opportunity to do so. How, then, does that post from 2005 end up as a
                  quotation misattributed to Keats?</p>
               <p>The quotation first started circulating and became popular on the internet in the
                  form of a few similar images, with the attribution always to solbeam (a reverse image
                  search for one of the popular iterations of this image comes up with matches as far
                  back as February 2008). The shift to Keats appears to have resulted from the quotation
                  being used in <em>The Keatyn Chronicles</em>, a YA romance series by Jillian Dodd, published since 2012, and now on its twelfth
                  volume. Keatyn is the name of the protagonist, which could have led to confusion on
                  its own merits, but the confusion gets even worse because Keatyn’s nickname is Keats.
                  One of her boyfriends, Brooklyn, likes to quote John Keats to her, which he does on
                  multiple occasions while saying, “Keats for my Keats” (55, 160, 208). Early in the
                  first book <em>Endymion</em> gets a nod from Brooklyn, who utters the poem’s opening line while cuddling with
                  Keatyn (53). Soon after this first romantic encounter, another tryst likewise involves
                  quotation, but in this case he notes, “‘Life is messy. Like that quote we like … <em>Life is divine chaos</em>. It’s messy, and it’s supposed to be that way’” (163). The italics seem to indicate
                  that only “<em>Life is divine chaos</em>” refers to “that quote we like,” but in the instances when the sentences are attributed
                  to Keats, the second sentence, which in the novel is Brooklyn’s gloss on the quotation,
                  is always included as part of the quotation. Neither character in this scene refers
                  to any part of the quotation as coming from Keats, but Brooklyn does refer to Keatyn
                  as Keats just a few lines after he says the phrase. The simple textual proximity of
                  “Keats” and the two sentences which get attributed to the poet seems unlikely to be
                  the result of some individual’s misreading of the scene. Instead, it seems more likely
                  that the algorithmic processes underlying the complex workings of internet virality,
                  textual transformation, and memetic recirculation are responsible.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>One final detail adds to the likelihood that this particular misattribution results
                     as much from machine readers as from human ones. In one image attributing “Life is
                     divine chaos” to Keats, the attribution is actually to “Jhon Keats.” While a simple
                     typo is a possibility, and Jhon is a rare alternative spelling for John, it is also
                     a common mistake that occurs with optical character recognition software (OCR). Whitney
                     Trettien writes about print-on-demand editions of Milton’s <em>Areopagitica</em>, including one titled <em>English Reprints Jhon Milton Areopagitica</em>, and analyzes the “remediated, <em>dis</em>mediated strangeness” of OCR reprints.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Trettien distinguishes between print-on-demand facsimile editions (produced using
                              images of scanned books) and OCR editions (which harvest text from scanned images
                              and then create print books meant to resemble modern typography). Currently on Amazon
                              one can find two different copies of facsimile editions of Keats’s 1820 volume which
                              list the author’s name as “Jhon Keats.” With the facsimile editions, OCR is still
                              used to automate information about the texts, such as the title and author’s name.</span></div>
                     </div> Print books which have been scanned (or microform versions of print books that have
                     been scanned) and then have OCR performed upon them often result in high error rates,
                     especially with older typographical conventions. But OCR is unreliable with other
                     forms of text as well, such as the cursive scripts used to create image-based memes
                     with quotations from, or misattributions to, famous writers like Keats. And so we
                     arrive at an image attributing “Life is divine chaos” to Jhon Keats, a process which
                     begins with a popular meme attributing the same words to solbeam, which then appears
                     in a novel featuring a character nicknamed Keats, which then transmigrates into a
                     new meme attributing the words to John Keats, and through further machinic processes,
                     John becomes Jhon. As digitized texts like Dodd’s <em>Keatyn Chronicles</em> get acted upon by human users <em>and</em> by automated processes, strange new mechanisms produce unexpected instances of quoting
                     like this one. While such mechanisms surely differ in degree and kind from the mechanisms
                     of, say, periodical writing in the 1820s and 30s, or newspaper accounts of the Manchester
                     Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, we ought to treat each as part of a broader history
                     of Keats’s pop cultural afterlife, which is always necessarily a history of mediation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>One further scene from Dodd’s book nicely illustrates the overlapping of differently
                  mediated engagements with Keats’s legacy and how they shape what quoting Keats means
                  now. A few chapters after Brooklyn’s “divine chaos” comments, he presents Keatyn with
                  a birthday gift: “an old book, the cover faded and the words <em>Poetical Works</em> by John Keats embossed on the spine.” After Brooklyn describes the gift as “‘Keats
                  for my Keats,’” <em>his</em> Keats looks into <em>the other</em> Keats, where she finds “an old inscription” reading “1903, To my love. / —S,” and
                  a new one, from Brooklyn, reading </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Even Keats speaks of chaos.</div>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> The palimpsestic inscriptions layer together a history of affective relationships
                  crafted through the nexus of Keats’s poetry. First, a complete edition from around
                  the turn of the century, when many monumentalizing editions of Keats’s work were being
                  published (contra Croker’s mocking reevaluation of Keats’s legacy in 1833), remediates
                  Keats to his posthumous audience, and a member of that audience uses the book to transfer
                  the cathected emotions linked to Keats to his “love.” That engagement is then furthered
                  by Brooklyn’s new annotation, where he characterizes this twenty-first-century attachment
                  through “that quote we like” about “divine chaos,” which he connects to Keats with
                  an accurate quotation (Keats does indeed write about there being “nothing stable in
                  the world” in a letter to his brothers in January 1818). The final piece of this complicated
                  web of connections exists outside of Dodd’s novel, where the collocation of Keats,
                  Keatyn, and “divine chaos” establishes a new, not entirely human-made node in the
                  network of quotations which help to create our popular Keats.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">In her book <em>Quotation Marks</em>, Marjorie Garber poses a similar sort of iterability with respect to quoting’s relationship
               to authority: “It instates an authority elsewhere, and, at the same time, it imparts
               that authority, temporarily, to the speaker or writer” (2). While Keats may not have
               had much cultural authority in the first decade when he began to be quoted (the 1820s),
               the authority accrued to him and to writers quoting him gained further relevance precisely
               through the nature of quotation which Garber identifies.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">One thinks, for instance, of Marjorie Levinson’s argument in <em>Keats’s Life of Allegory</em> that Keats develops his poetics out of his position of alienation with respect to
               his class identity. In more positive terms, both Charles Rzepka, in his reading of
               
               “On First Looking Into Chapman’s Homer,”
               and Jeffrey Cox, in his analysis of “Cockney classicism,” suggest how we might view
               Keats’s alienation and belatedness as more unalloyed advantages, as opposed to causes
               of symptomatic anxious responses.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">An important early articulation of this term comes via the title of Lauren Neefe and
               Yohei Igarashi’s 2013 MLA roundtable devoted to the topic. More recently, in his <em>Romantic Mediations: Media Theory and British Romanticism</em>, Andrew Burkett offers a rich overview of, and exciting ways forward for, the subfield.
               His book shows how writers in the romantic period “express[ed] diverse, flexible conceptions
               of both media and mediation … before the media concept became distilled later in the
               nineteenth century into its modern sense as the notion of the technological channel
               of communication” (3).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Kate Rumbold’s <em>Shakespeare and the Eighteenth-Century Novel: Cultures of Quotation from Samuel Richardson
                  to Jane Austen</em> provides a useful analog for how quotation operates with respect to different genres
               and media. Her focus is on how quotations of Shakespeare in novels serve to buttress
               Shakespeare’s growing reputation, while also helping to lend cultural significance
               to the novel form itself. The “cultures of quotation” that influence the novelistic
               treatments involve other forms of media, including the stage, periodicals, and the
               conventions of polite conversation. See especially 21–48.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Garber discusses the closing lines of Keats’s 
               “Ode on a Grecian Urn,”
               and the thorny issue of who speaks them, as an exemplary case of “the quotation as
               floating signifier” (29). While in scholarly contexts there has been much debate about
               what precisely Keats quotes the urn saying, in the many examples Garber cites from
               a variety of pop cultural sources, the lines are unambiguously credited as something
               Keats himself uttered. I suggest a similar dynamic plays out with the opening line
               of <em>Endymion</em>, which signifies in vastly different ways as it moves from and between scholarly
               and popular contexts.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">See for instance Sarah Wooton’s work on representations of Keats in nineteenth-century
               visual art, and Ann Weirda Rowland’s work on Keats’s reception in turn-of-the-century
               Boston.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Keats appears elsewhere in the <em>Harrovian</em>, including on the third page of the first issue’s opening essay, 
               “The Greek Drama,”
               where “the lamented Keats” is referred to as “the most pure and imaginative poet of
               the age, and one in whom the springs of sweet and honied thoughts, were more bright
               and beautiful than in any writer, Shakespeare excepted, since the days of Homer” (3).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">It would be difficult if not impossible to rule out that other earlier examples exist.
               And of course there are limitations to relying on digital databases in performing
               such searches, given that they are incomplete and are prone to errors of both the
               technical sort (text searches in such databases rely on optical character recognition
               software, which can have high error rates) and the human variety (as when metadata
               about a digitized text’s publication date is incorrect). However, based on searches
               for “thing of beauty is a joy” across multiple databases (HathiTrust, Google Books,
               British Periodicals, <em>British Newspaper Archive</em>), there are almost no results in the 1820s, a clear but slow uptick in the 1830s
               and 40s, and sizable jump in the 1850s. In the <em>British Newspaper Archive</em>, for instance, there are no results until 1832, and almost eight times as many results
               for 1850–9 as for 1830–49. As I discuss later in this essay, the jump in the 1850s
               is largely thanks to the line’s presence at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition
               in 1857 (in that year the <em>British Newspaper Archive</em> returns 123 results for the phrase).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">The first collected edition of Keats’s work appeared in 1829 in Paris in a volume
               collecting Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats together, published by the Galignani brothers.
               While other editions appeared in the 1830s from American publishers (who were not
               constrained by copyright), it was not until 1840 that an edition appeared in England.
               See J. R. MacGillivray’s <em>Keats: A Bibliography and Reference Guide</em> for more detail.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Much has been written about Keats and the Cockney School attacks in recent decades,
               including the significant reappraisals in the late-90s by Nicholas Roe and Jeffrey
               Cox. Duncan Wu offers this helpful summation of current critical consensus about what
               the attacks meant: “In Z.’s anatomy, a ‘Cockney’ lacked taste and education but was
               full of ‘vulgar’ pretension. The term was a class slur by which the well-educated
               Tories portrayed their liberal counterparts as ill-bred social climbers” (37). As
               both Roe and Cox argue, the attacks signaled a recognition, from the attackers themselves,
               of the potential social and cultural power that such “ill-bred” figures represented.
               For treatments of the broader dynamics at play in periodical writing and literary
               reviewing during the period, see Richard Cronin’s <em>Paper Pellets</em>, Karen Fang’s <em>Romantic Writing and the Empire of Signs</em>, David Higgins’s <em>Romantic Genius and the Literary Magazine</em>, Lucy Newlyn’s <em>Reading, Writing, and Romanticism</em>, Mark Parker’s <em>Literary Magazines and British Romanticism</em>, Mark Schoenfield’s <em>British Periodicals and Romantic Identity</em>, and David Stewart’s <em>Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Lee Erickson argues that economic forces were largely to blame for the steep drop
               in the numbers of poetry books published in England after 1820, when the market for
               such books hit its peak. He notes that the popularity of annuals and gift books helped
               to exacerbate the other forces that were making it difficult for publishers to invest
               in the publication of volumes of poetry. See especially 26–48.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Driscoll’s focus is on the contemporary texts and institutions of the middlebrow,
               but she (and other scholars of the middlebrow) have stressed the importance of the
               concept’s emergence at the turn of the twentieth century, and the “family resemblance”
               definitional approach Driscoll takes also allows for a fluid application across different
               periods and contexts (5–6). With respect to Keats, his early critics certainly cast
               him as what would become recognizable as middlebrow about a century later (the Cockney
               School attacks arguably characterize Keats’s poetry with all eight of Driscoll’s features
               of the middlebrow); Keats slowly becomes associated with high culture as he enters
               the canon by the early-twentieth century; and he then increasingly becomes associated
               with middlebrow institutions later in the century, in part through his quotability
               in various popular culture contexts.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               images of scanned books) and OCR editions (which harvest text from scanned images
               and then create print books meant to resemble modern typography). Currently on Amazon
               one can find two different copies of facsimile editions of Keats’s 1820 volume which
               list the author’s name as “Jhon Keats.” With the facsimile editions, OCR is still
               used to automate information about the texts, such as the title and author’s name.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
