                    opposition to (while continuing to inform) the high canon of English literature,
                    and it posits Keats’s two-hundred year reception history as an exemplary case
                    for examining popular culture as a generative, shape-shifting borderland where
                    liking/loving and responding to literature intermingles, sometimes
                    indistinguishably, the tastes of the people and the elite. </p>

                       [Keats] may at present be the best loved English poet of all time, with powerful appeal to every one of the broad categories
                       of audience&#8212;fellow writers, literary professionals and academic specialists, the reading public and the nonreading public alike.
                       He has become iconic, not so much “a writer” as “the writer,” not just canonized but worshipped. (114)<lb/>

            <p>How has John Keats (1795–1821) become such a crossover success with a “powerful appeal” to “academic specialists” and “the nonreading public”? Where and in what forms can we find evidence of Keats’s appeal outside of classrooms and scholarly publications? And, why should we (teachers and scholars) take seriously, let alone value, Keats’s afterlives created by non-academic specialists and non-poets in mediums, genres and modes that we might deem ephemeral, adulterated, and/or reductive instantiations of his high canonical poetic value?
                <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> pursues these questions with the hope of broadening our
                    disciplinary understanding of what Jack Stillinger has termed the “concentrated
                    canonical complexity” of “Multiple Keats.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In
                        <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to John Keats</title>, Stillinger
                            defines “Multiple Keats” as “an internal complexity in the poet
                            constituted primarily by self-division&#8212;a sort of unresolved imaginative
                            dividedness between the serious and the humorous, the straight and the
                            ironic, the fanciful and the real, the high-flying and the
                            down-to-earth, the sentimental and the satiric, the puffed up and the
                            deflated” (253).</note> As Stillinger reminds us in <title level="a">The ‘Story’ of Keats,</title> Keats
                    has been classed since the middle of the nineteenth century “with
                    Shakespeare&#8212;and Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and a handful of others&#8212;at the top of
                    the lists of the most esteemed writers in English poetry” (251).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Keats’s
                            canonicity was already well-established when Matthew Arnold published
                            his essay on Keats in T.H. Ward’s
                            <title level="m">English Poets</title> (1880). Arnold
                            countermands longstanding positive and negative evaluations of Keats as
                            overly sensual and effete, characterizations that peaked dramatically
                            after Harry Buxton Foreman published Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne
                            (1878). On Keats’s shifting nineteenth-century reception, see James
                            Najarian’s <title level="m">Victorian Keats: Manliness, Sexuality and
                                Desire</title>; Jeffrey Robinson’s <title level="m">Reception and
                                Poetics in Keats: My Ended Poet</title>; and Sarah Wootton’s

                                Art and Literature</title>, as well as more recent antipodal arguments
                            in Emily Roerhbach’s <title level="m">Modernity’s Mist: British
                                Romanticism and the Poetics of Anticipation</title>; and William
                            Ulmer’s <title level="m">John Keats: Reimaging History</title>.</note> From that Victorian reception onward,
                Keats’s predominating ‘story’ has been a record of his elevation from a canonical to a hypercanonical poet.<note place="foot"

                    canonical mythos and which foregrounds an overshadowed affinity&#8212;Keats’s
                    longstanding connection with popular culture.</p>
            <p><title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> aims to: 1) spotlight the positive affinity, and not
                    antithesis, between Keats and popular culture in our time and his own; 2) examine Keats’s afterlives in multi-media creations
                    involving authorial fashioning and participatory poetics; 3) posit what we might learn through such creations about
                    how to read, view, and hear Keats in a growing new literary middlebrow culture;
                    and 4) prompt reflections on how we as teachers and scholars can connect with
                    broader mass audiences interested in Keats.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Along with

                            and to lure as many scholars as possible into asking comparable
                            questions and pursuing related lines of research” (<title level="a">Prologue</title> 9)&#8212;and
                            Peter Swirski’s <title level="m">From Lowbrow to Nobrow</title>, which
                            calls for a more incisive investigation of popular culture and maintains
                            that the distinction between “Highbrow” and “Lowbrow” does not suffice
                            in the midst of what he dubs “artertainment” and “popular literature
                            [which] is by now the master currency for cultural transactions as well

                            negotiate the experience of the (post)industrial age” (180). My aims for
                            <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> also align with

                Celeste Langan, Kevis Goodman, Maureen McLane, John
                    Guillory, Clifford Siskin and William Warner have done much to inform our
                    understanding of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as a
                    hyper-mediated age of teeming material and conceptual media. Likewise, Adela
                    Pinch, Jerome McGann, William Ready, Brian Massumi, Rei Tereda, and Thomas Pfau
                    have reinvigorated studies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century
                    as a self-conscious age of sensation, emotional transference, and bodily

                Pfau’s contention that Keats’s “technique of hypersimulation […] baits its audience’s critical and melancholic recognition of
                poetry as semblance, and semblance as socially determined” demonstrates how mediation and affect theories can be combined to
                recast longstanding cruxes in Keats studies concerned with authorial fashioning and reader response (343). In <title level="a">Liking/Loving:
                    Affect Theory for Media Scholars,</title> the closing section of their introduction to <title level="m">Multimedia Romanticisms</title>,
                James Brook-Smith and Andrew Burkett argue further that intermingling media and affect theories can help spotlight a “productive
                openness of Romantic-era media discourse that is neither bounded by the technological channel of communication nor by today’s
                reigning norms of hyper-efficient informatics” (Par. 27). <title level="m">Keats in Popular Culture</title> explores such
                media-affect crossovers between Keats’s age
                    and our own where discipline-specific inquiries and hyper-canonical treatments
                    of his poetry and biography alternately inform and give way to broader networks
                    of connection involving multiple mediums and diverse audiences.</p>
            <p>This inquiry draws our attention beyond discourses focused
                    solely on poetry to consider more unregulated appropriations of and responses to
                    Keats in less specialized and more overtly commercialized mediums. As Yohei
                    Igarashi muses, Romantic period scholars have often overlooked or been reluctant
                    to pursue such connections because of Keats’s own characterizations of his work:
                    “The pertinacity with which Keats strives to align himself with the longstanding
                    medium of poetry and the book may be responsible for the lack of sustained
                    commentary on his relation to the larger ecology of contemporaneous means of
                    communication” (173). Likewise, Keats’s several disparaging comments about
                    popular mass market poetry as debased literature that traffics in
                    commercialized, often all-too “smokeable,” forms has led generations of
                    professional writers and scholars to class his poetry exclusively within
                    highbrow literary discourses.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his

                            ridicule to noticing, seeing through, and understanding

                            206, 217, 221, 244). In his <title level="a">Smokeability</title> section (393–402) in
                            <title level="m">England in 1819</title>, James Chandler provides an
                            incisive gloss of “smokeable” as “an act of
                            <emph>condescension</emph>, toward ‘weakness’ or ‘inadequacy’” (399).
                            Chandler demonstrates Keats’s concern about his poems being publicly
                            “smoked” (seen through, ridiculed) and classed as trendy, light-weight
                            knock-offs in the vein of overly sentimental or sensational poems and
                            novels appealing predominantly to female readers. On highbrow
                            conceptions of Keats, Virginia Woolf’s characterization in her
                            <title level="a">Middlebrow</title> essay offers an apt and influential example: “To be a
                            highbrow, a complete and representative highbrow, a highbrow like
                            Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley, Keats […] is of course beyond the
                            wildest dreams of my Imagination […] Look at Keats, loving poetry and
                            Fanny Brawne so intemperately that he pined and died of consumption at
                            the age of twenty-six” (Par. 3). Woolf closes the essay with a playful
                            threat: “If any human being, man, woman, dog, cat or half-crushed worm
                            dares call me 'middlebrow' I will take my pen and stab him, dead.” (Par. 10).</note>

                Jeffrey Cox&#8212;affect studies about Keats have led the way in unsettling and reevaluating classifications of his

                            reputation begins to rise following the end of that “Cockney
                            Moment.”</note> Most recently, Karen Swann’s <title level="m">Lives of the Dead Poets</title> (2019) examines how reading Keats can “elicit untoward
                    attachments” that “enthrall us despite our suspicion that we may be bound in a
                    calculated effect” (31, 42). Swann’s use of “untoward” suggests that reading
                    Keats’s poetry can draw us into intensely intimate and potentially unseemly,
                    emotional connections that trouble our professional and personal disciplinary
                    boundaries. Such “untoward attachments” obfuscate what Laura Mandell has
                    described as the already blurry line “between the fan’s love for pop culture and
                    the academic’s love for literary history” (Par. 3).</p>

                    routinely have been defined in opposition to (while continuing to inform) the

                            separating Keats from popular culture, media, and affect.</note>
                Although the term popular culture&#8212;“the cultural
                    traditions of the ordinary people of a particular community” (OED)&#8212;first
                    appeared in print in the 1850s, sustained intellectual discourses theorizing
                    about popular culture emerged in the second half of the eighteenth century.
                    These popular culture conceptions often overlapped with debates about how to
                    define an expanding canon of English literature, and they involved proto-media
                    articulations and new ways of describing reader-author relationships as personal
                    affairs of liking and/or loving literature.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Peter

                            late-eighteenth-century intellectuals “invented” two predominating
                            conceptions of popular culture. The first (chronologically) involved
                            idealizations of rural folk culture, and the second involved
                            urban-industrial entertainments.</note> As Lionel Trilling, John Bailey, Christopher Ricks, and
                    Marjorie Levinson have demonstrated, readers of Keats’s poetry are no strangers
                    to feeling embarrassed over Keats’s “badness” in particular lines and even
                    entire poems that fall well short of, or appear to mock, high aesthetic poetry
                    standards.<note place="foot" resp="author"> From his first biographer Richard Monkton Milnes (1848) to Matthew Arnold, F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling, Earl Wasserman, Walter Jackson Bate, David Perkins, and Helen Vendler (among others), arguments for Keats’s elevated place in the canon of English poetry have often involved rear-guard actions to protect his poetry and biography from slighting treatments.</note> Most resoundingly, Levinson argues that Keats had a “legitimacy problem”&#8212;anxiety about his middling social class alienation from the canon&#8212;which manifested itself in a self-consciously artificial “writing which is aggressively <emph>literary</emph> and therefore not just ‘not Literature’ but, in effect, <emph>anti</emph>-literature: a parody” (10, 5). Writing at, though not necessarily for, canonical tastes, Keats fetishizes an aesthetics of betweenness, which sensationalizes high poetic styles, poetry as a constructed medium, and the reading public’s growing desire to experience biographically-infused, authorial emotion.

                    reception history as an exemplary case for examining popular culture as a
                    generative, shape-shifting borderland where liking/loving and responding to
                    literature intermingles, sometimes indistinguishably, the tastes of the people
                    and the elite. To make this case, these essays investigate popular culture
                    artifacts and mediums as well as popular literature involving Keats.</p>
            <p>So, how might studying Keats’s affective, multi-media afterlives help us to read him anew? First, such an approach prompts us to continue reevaluating our profession’s longstanding repudiation of popular literature as solely market-driven, ephemeral, ‘bad’ art (overly simple, not serious, or adulterated). Second, within that reconsideration, we can re-contextualize Keats’s own dismissals of the word popular in ‘popular literature.’
                Andrew Bennett’s <title level="m">Keats, Narrative, and Audience</title> (1994) and <title level="m">Romantic Poets
                    and the Culture of Posterity</title> (1998) remind us of how Keats’s criticisms of fashionable
                    authorship and poetry with a mass market appeal have led generations of Romantic
                    period scholars to align Keats with William Wordsworth’s skewed argument in his
                    <title level="a">Essay Supplementary to the Preface</title> (1815) that a poet’s contemporary
                    popularity rendered them unfit for a future place in the high canon of English
                    poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author">  In the <title level="a">Essay
                            Supplementary to the Preface,</title> Wordsworth declares: “Away, then, with
                            the senseless iteration of the word,
                            <emph>popular</emph>, applied to new
                            works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of
                            the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions, as if
                            urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell” (372). On the
                            double-sidedness of Wordsworth’s use of ‘popular,’ which pits
                            inauthentic and degrading mass cultures against nearly lost authentic
                            cultures, see Ann Wierda Rowland’s <title level="a">The Popular Tradition,</title> pp. 119–26.
                            As Lucy Newlyn has argued in <title level="m">Reading, Writing, and
                                Romanticism: The Anxiety of Reception</title>, “Wordsworth went on
                            courting recognition while also appearing to accept neglect” (98). His
                            market struggles with the tastes of a burgeoning mass reading public
                            multiplied as he sought to differentiate the “pleasure” that his poetry
                            might elicit from more popular gothic sensationalism. See Michael
                            Gamer’s <title level="m">Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception,
                                and Canon Formation</title> as well as Jon Klancher’s argument in
                        <title level="m">The Making of English Reading Audiences</title>: “Having
                            described the middle class audience as consumers of a brutalized culture
                            fashioned for urban readers, Wordsworth seeks in the rustic’s
                            alternative culture a means to reverse that reception into a form of
                            ‘consumption’” (143).</note> By all accounts, Keats was neither a popular nor a
                    well-reviewed Regency poet, and he seemed intent upon establishing a posthumous
                    reputation beyond the transience of what he called the “little famous” of his
                    age so that he could finally be “among the English poets.” Keats undoubtedly had
                    a vexed relationship with popular writing for a consumer culture that was caught
                    up in discourses about fame and celebrity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On Romantic

                (2009), Keats’s poetry and initial reception might best
                    be understood in relation to Cornwall (pseudonym for Bryan Waller Proctor) who
                    after Lord Byron and Felicia Hemans was one of the best-selling and most
                    positively reviewed poets from 1819–1823.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> Turley demonstrates how reading Keats’s
                            poetry alongside Cornwall’s “cast[s] into relief issues of audience,
                            taste, critical reception, ‘high’ versus ‘low’ culture, and literary
                            commercialism,” and he shows how, in contrast to Keats, Cornwall
                            “successfully commodified ‘Cockney’ School’ aesthetics” and
                            “populariz[ed] a filtered version of ‘Cockney Romanticism” by
                            “configuring [his readers] as constituents of a mass audience” and
                            “reassur[ing] book buyers of their competency as readers” (4, 45, 40).

            <p>Conservative-leaning reviewers for <title level="j">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> and
            <title level="j">The Quarterly Review</title> directly connected Keats’s poetry with popular sensational trends,
                particularly a “<emph>Metromanie</emph>”
                    (meter-mania) sweeping across Britain from “farm servants” to “unmarried ladies”
                    and “our very footmen,” which rendered Keats too vulgar (common) to be
                    considered for a pantheon of living poets let alone for an enduring canon of
                    English poets (193).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All

                Their ‘story’ of Keats focused on his cultural and aesthetic betweenness&#8212;a shibboleth that Keats himself
                foregrounds in his 1818 <title level="a">Preface</title> to <title level="m">Endymion</title>:
                <quote>
                The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a
                <emph>space of life between</emph>, in which the soul is in ferment, the character
                    undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence
                    proceeds mawkishness, and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of

                    added)
                </quote>
            Amidst this “space of life between,” Keats describes himself as “in ferment”&#8212;intensely stirred up in a
            transformative process&#8212;and short on measured high culture aesthetics. He owns <title level="m">Endymion</title>
                as a “failure,” resulting from “great inexperience,
                    immaturity, and every error denoting a feverish attempt” (139). Moreover, he
                    archly styles himself as an arrested cultural aspirant who “may be speaking too
                    presumptuously and may deserve a punishment” for having “touched the beautiful
                    mythology of Greece, and [potentially] dulled its brightness” with his
                    adulterated poetic treatment.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Keats also aligns himself with Thomas

                (over-stirred sentimentality) may well serve as self-flagellation before possible critics, but
                that “mawkishness” also stakes a claim for <title level="m">Endymion</title>: it will have a
                sensational, bittersweet effect that high culture reviewers and readers “must necessarily taste
                in going over the following pages” (140).</p>

                reviewers reacted to this taste of Keats by relegating
                    him to the trash bin of literary history not only because his poetry smacked of
                    middle class pretensions, radical politics and aesthetics, but also because it
                    seemed all too caught up in sensational aspects of popular Regency
                    culture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Christopher Rovee’s <title level="a">Trashing Keats,</title> which
                            concludes: “Taking seriously the wonder of those who most cherished it,

                            aesthetes and otherwise, who would piece together an oppositional stance
                            from the refuse of consumption’s logic”

                        and others is that Keats’s writing is not real poetry,
                    and thus, not real literature. It is sensation as entertainment; sensation not
                    as an elite aesthetic principle, but as one diversion among many for an
                    increasingly commercialized, mass public” (464).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wang’s insights 
                        build on Levinson’s evaluation of Keats’s parodic “non-poetry,” James Chandler’s investigation
                        of Keats’s “cockney sensationalism,” and Nicholas Roe and Jeffrey Cox’s arguments about the
                        significance of ‘Cockney’ literary culture and politics.</note> Wang likens Keats’s sensational
                poetry to pre-cinematic simulations of visual movement, which he aligns with the showmanship of Vauxhall
                Garden’s early nineteenth-century entertainments and “mass public viewings,” particularly phantasmagorias
                (magic lantern shows) and panoramas (enormous circular paintings). In <title level="a">Keats, Popular Culture,
                    and the Sociability of Theatre,</title> Gillian Russell locates Keats’s visual models and sense of class
                mobility in London’s labile, legitimate-illegitimate theatre productions and hybridizing audience demographics.
                Within that shifting theatre culture, Jane Moody, John Kandl and Jonathan Mulrooney have focused our attention
                on Keats’s admiration for Edmund Kean’s popular acting style and his identification with Kean’s controversial
                professional and cultural status.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="m">Illegitimate Theatre,
                                1770–1840</title>, Moody points out that an
                                “interesting parallel exists between the mockery of Edmund Kean’s
                                lowly social origins and illegitimate apprenticeship in the role of
                                Harlequin, and the critical disdain which greeted John Keats. In
                                both cases, the language of vulgarity neatly encompasses accusations
                                of stylistic uncouthness and social pretension, as well as charges
                                of unjustified aesthetic innovation” (234). See too John Kandl’s

                            Kean.</title></note> Most recently in <title level="m">Romanticism and Theatrical Experience</title>
                (2019), Mulrooney argues that Keats emulated Kean’s
                    performative mixing and questioning of already slippery high, low, and middling
                    aesthetic distinctions: “Keats began in 1818 to represent aesthetic experience
                    as a continual, undecided negotiation that treated the high culture of art and
                    the low culture of daily life with equal force and attention” (194). Through his
                    alignments with Hunt’s new school of poetry, metropolitan visual entertainments,
                    and Kean’s sensational Shakespeare performances, Keats wittingly and unwittingly
                    drew his poetry into public debates about what popular and high literary culture
                    were and might become and how they should be valued.</p>
            <p>Whether liking, loving, disliking, or hating, such
                    valuations of Keats have often involved strong affective responses, which his
                    poetry actively courts and self-consciously dramatizes. Keats’s affective turns
                    have led several twenty-first century scholars and creative writers to posit
                    “untoward” questions and statements about Keats’s readerly effects.<note place="foot"
                        resp="author"> The following statement from Stillinger captures the intimacy of such
                        responses: “The accumulation of information from so many sources allows us to know
                        Keats better than most of Keats’s contemporaries knew him, even those who saw him
                        every day; and modern scholars who study the record undoubtedly know Keats better
                        than they do most people whom they see in everyday life” (<title level="m">John Keats</title> ix).</note> For
                example, in <title level="a">A Friendly Return of the Author,</title> Eric
                    Eisner asks, “How does a shared feeling for Keats unite (or divide) communities
                    of his readers? How have later readers with no direct relation to Keats
                    understood themselves as ‘friends’ or ‘lovers’ of the poet?” (27). Most
                    pointedly, in <title level="a">Loving, Knowing, and Illustrating Keats,</title> Ann Wierda Rowland
                    asks, “What might it mean to ‘love’ John Keats?” (267). Rowland focuses her
                    answer on Louis Arthur Holman, “‘the world’s foremost amateur collector of
                    ‘Keatsiana’ in the first decades of the twentieth century,” who neither had a
                    college education nor seemed interested in writing a conventional biography of
                    Keats (268).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Rowland’s
                            quotation is from the <title level="j">Daily Boston Globe</title>, Dec.
                            15, 1939, p. 21.</note> Rowland argues that Holman’s decades-long work&#8212;a
                labor of imagined friendship and love for Keats spent collecting, assembling, and publicly
                sharing his visual ephemera&#8212;exemplifies Keats’s popular following, which first took
                off in the late nineteenth century. Rowland maintains that Holman deeply valued “the portability
                of ‘Keats,’ above all” and understood his unparalleled collection of images, ranging from
                illustrations to postcards, as a testament to Keats’s “procreativity” and capacity to inhabit
                and inform multiple media contexts and walks of life (287). In <title level="a">That Crafty Feeling,</title>
                Zadie Smith provides a more recent testimony about Keats’s enduring amateur appeal:
            <quote>
                Keats offers his readers the possibility of entering writing from a side door, the
                one marked ‘Apprentices Welcome Here’ […] Keats slogging away, devouring
                books, plagiarizing, impersonating, adapting, struggling, growing, writing many
                poems that made him blush and then a few that made him proud, learning
                everything he could from whomever he could find, dead or alive, who might have
                something useful to teach him. (105)
            </quote>
            If in 1818 John Wilson Lockhart could derisively sentence
                    Keats behind commercial, class-signifying doors&#8212;“so back to the shop Mr.
                    John”&#8212;in 2009 Zadie Smith could trumpet that Keats’s poetry and biography had
                    unlocked a side-door entrance into the “shop” of writing&#8212;a space previously
                    closed to aspirants without proper high culture writing credentials.</p>
            <p>In the late twentieth- and early twenty-first century,
                    this emphasis on reader-author intimacy, participatory poetics, and popularizing
                    high literary forms has coincided with the rise of what Beth Driscoll calls “the
                    new literary middlebrow.” Driscoll argues that new literary middlebrow culture
                    has eight family attributes: “middle class, reverential towards elite culture,
                    entrepreneurial, mediated, feminized, emotional, recreational, and earnest” (6).
                    Through her amendments to what she describes as Pierre Bourdieu’s rigid,
                    polarizing theories (art for art’s sake vs. mass market productions) about the
                    field and habitus of literary production and cultural capital, Driscoll examines
                    a neglected “middle space” in which the “middlebrow’s expansive, colonizing
                    activities continually shift the boundaries between cultural categories, while
                    the new relationships it creates between mass audiences and intermediaries
                    recalibrate lines of authority” (17). Although Kelvin Everest does not mention
                    middlebrow culture in <title level="a">Why Read Keats?</title> (2002), he proffers a new literary
                    middlebrow educational ideal: “[Keats’s] example affirms that English poetry is
                    an art form for the people as a whole, and not the preserve of a privileged
                    elite. In Keats’s poetry the English poetic tradition is claimed for a
                    fundamentally democratic future, in which high aesthetic experience is the
                    possession of a wider and socially inclusive readership” (3).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Nicholas Roe
                            maintains a similar view in his biography <title level="m">John Keats:
                                A New Life</title>. Roe, however, identifies Leigh Hunt as the
                            catalyst: “Two hundred years on, we can see how Hunt’s ‘New School’
                            anticipated modern ideas of poetry as a form of expression open to and
                            enjoyed by all” (188).</note> For Stanley Plumly&#8212;perhaps Keats’s
                most ardent poet-scholar advocate&#8212;associating Keats with anything middlebrow
                (even some of Keats’s own poetry) degrades his greatness and, thus, should be
                discarded. Plumly’s conviction leads him in <title level="m">Posthumous Keats: A Personal Biography</title>
                (2008) to eschew influential pre-Raphaelite tastes
                    involving the “luxury, drapery, weft, and rich weave of the texture and rhythmic
                    structure in Keats’s romances and ballads” because “such qualities tend to
                    confirm rather than challenge, reinforce rather than resist convention, and
                    meet&#8212;in spite of counter-Victorian and post-Victorian protestations of art for
                    art’s sake&#8212;mostly middle-brow nineteenth-century expectations” (321). Despite
                    his elegant protestation, Plumly’s concerns about the “irresistible,”
                    convention-reinforcing “qualities” of Keats’s narrative verse underscore Keats’s
                    powerful middlebrow appeal as well as Plumly’s own personalized literary
                    middlebrow treatment of Keats’s biography and poetry.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In his
                            <title level="a">Preface,</title> Plumly describes his desire to create a fitting voice and
                            point of view as “a middle way of discovering and articulating Keats in
                            his possible and potential afterlife, not only his life. I needed to be
                            able to think with a warm mind through the mortality&#8212;and its
                            meander&#8212;that helped bring about his ultimate immortality” (17). For an
                            incisive critique of Plumly’s “middle way,” see Michael Theune’s review

            <p>Undoubtedly, Keats’s most popular instantiation in new
                    literary middlebrow culture has been his negative capability concept: “when man
                    is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
                    reaching after fact &amp; reason&#8212;”. Negative capability has garnered this
                    currency largely because it suggests an adaptable, betwixt-and-between subject
                    position within a non-systematic philosophy for considering life and art while
                    “remaining content with half knowledge” in the midst of unreconciled
                    contradictions (<title level="m">Letters</title>. I. 193, 194). Far from a limiting
                cultural shibboleth, negative capability describes being in the middle as a virtue,
                which can foster mental lability and creative ways of thinking about and between different
                epistemologies of human knowledge. As Brian Rejack and Michael Theune maintain in their introduction to
                <title level="m">Keats’s Negative Capability: New Origins and Afterlives</title> (2019), Keats’s concept has “escaped the gravitational
                    pull of Keats studies” to emerge not only in contemporary poetics but also in
                    young adult literature, music, psychology, medicine, Zen philosophy, and
                    business marketing and management (3-4). I also would add that discussions of
                    negative capability have significantly influenced recent public education
                    theories and transmedia story-telling practices for mass market
                    productions.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the former, see Elaine

                            Also relevant is Marcello Giovenalli’s characterization of a Keats 2.0
                            whose works offer a “cognitive poetics of texture” (7).</note> Within Rejack

                Keats’s negative capability as “an openness to the intermedium between thought systems,” exemplified
                by his “new theory of allegory” in <title level="a">Lamia,</title> Britton argues that negative capability “identifies
                conditions of mediation” that “must be understood in relation to the body and, specifically,
                the writing hand” (99, 115). Through their essays, negative capability emerges as an intermingling
                of thought systems, processes of composition, and the feigned presence of  bodily movements&#8212;a
                middling mode characterized by a constantly shifting, amalgamating, but never fully reconciled, center.</p>
            <p>Although Keats associated negative capability with William
                    Shakespeare as the prime example of a “Man of Achievement,” Keats’s popular
                    culture reception pales in comparison with Shakespeare’s unparalleled
                    ‘Shakespop’ industry. Nor does Keats come close to Mary Shelley’s and Jane
                    Austen’s standing, which like Shakespeare’s has involved Hollywood movies,
                    television shows, and a host of multi-genre and digital media forms.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                Keats’s less prevalent afterlives come into focus most
                    clearly in the context of the ‘Big Six’ male Romantic poets: William Blake, Lord
                    (George Gordon) Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Wordsworth, and Samuel
                    Taylor Coleridge. Of the six, Blake and Byron have garnered the largest popular
                    culture following. As Steven Clark and Jason Whittaker’s <title level="m">Blake, Modernity, and Popular Culture</title>
                    has shown, Blake’s afterlives as a political radical and
                    visionary iconoclast have appeared most influentially in music, experimental
                    film, and graphic novels.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See as well

                        Notably, the ‘Big Six’ and Mary Shelley have helped
                            shape prominent aspects of John Milton’s enduring presence in pop

                Arguably even more so than Blake, Byron’s rock-star

                    not surprising, Keats’s recent afterlives suggest
                    his appeal as a poet who is more accessible and less radically visionary than
                    Blake, less egocentric and aggressive than Byron or (a more staid and stuffy)
                    Wordsworth, more psychologically stable and invitingly intimate than Coleridge,
                    and less elevated and politically idealistic than Shelley.</p>
            <p>Ranking fittingly in the middle of these six, Keats’s new
                    literary middlebrow popularity involves intense, personal connections based on
                    deep feeling for his short life and tubercular death, doomed romance with Fanny
                    Brawne and poetry, underdog status and outsized writing ambitions, capacity for
                    friendship and broad-minded sociality, and sense of identity as transformable
                    and mobile. Like Shakespeare’s and Austen’s, Keats’s recent afterlives represent
                    and inflect our myths about creative genius, romantic love, and individual
                    agency. Reactions to his short biography, however, separate Keats’s afterlives
                    from theirs. His young-adult romance with Fanny Brawne, rapid mastery of writing
                    poetry, and death at twenty-five well before his achievements were widely
                    recognized speak readily to post-1950s youth cultures focused on (and often
                    marketed to) under-appreciated young adults trying to define their shifting,
                    middle-class identities. Given Keats’s new literary middlebrow popularity, I
                    wonder too if currently we are seeing (to borrow Gregory Dart’s term) an
                    outsized, fun-house mirror, “Cockney moment” reflecting authors and readers.
                    Though not focused on political enfranchisement like the “moment” (1810–1840)
                    Dart describes, our quasi- “Cockney moment” (I submit 1990ish–present) has many
                    of the “amphibious qualities” that he details&#8212;exemplified by Leigh Hunt’s
                    writing, which “hovers uncertainly between the polite and the plebeian” (203).
                    We too are immersed in a rapidly-shifting, and now expressly global,
                    metropolitan climate, which is “liberal and open in some respects, but also
                    superficial and fashion-hungry in others.” Marked by “very broad tastes in
                    literature” and an “expanded field of print journalism,” our climate teems with
                    debates about the “cultural legitimacy” of “the so-called ‘middle
                    class’”&#8212;pointed by its young adult avatars (first Gen X, then Millennials, and
                    now Gen Z) who continue to “transform traditional aesthetic norms” in new
                    digital mass media (Dart 204, 205).</p>
            <p>New literary middlebrow culture has challenged high
                    canonical gatekeeping, but its inherited tastes and largely reverential
                    attitudes toward highbrow culture predominate, as Jane Campion’s commercially
                    successful film <title level="m">Bright Star</title> (2009) and “Introduction” to
                    <title level="m">Love Letters and Poems of John Keats to
                    Fanny Brawne</title> (2009) demonstrate. In Campion’s transmedia introduction,
                    “<title level="m">Bright Star</title>&#8212;the Story of Keats and Fanny,” she not only summarizes the major biographical
                    plot points informing her literary biopic; she also enthuses:
            <quote>
                    The poems, the love letters, the love story are all part
                    of the alchemy that makes Keats so special, so available to successive
                    generations of readers. The young man who died devastated, convinced that he
                    would be forgotten, has been repeatedly re-discovered. For many people, he is
                    the first point of entry into poetry and his life story is a big part of that
                    magical equation. (vi–vii)
            </quote>
            Campion’s affection and marketing for this Keats-Brawne story celebrate alchemical auto-biographical
            processes, an intensely engaging romance and devastating tragedy, and a near complete loss followed
            by paths of rediscovery that continually draw readers into poetry. For Campion, what makes Keats so
            “special” is his affective, textually embodied capacity for revival&#8212;a “magical equation” that
            involves his discoverers in recognizing parts of themselves which, like Keats, may appear to have been
            nearly lost. Campion’s biopic immerses us in melodrama and sentimentality, but it also plays high
            art-for-art’s sake ideals against mass commercialization and suggests an intermedium between the two:
            an intermingling of canonical Keats aesthetics and Brawne’s stylish stitch-work. Moreover, with Brawne
            as our focalizer and emotional surrogate, <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                    grants us visual access to Keats’s personality and
                    artistic genius while blocking any close textual/bodily understanding as Keats
                    disappears off-screen into near-deathly anonymity while Brawne remains on screen
                    to elicit our compassion.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Jacques
                            Khalip’s argument in <title level="m">Anonymous Life: Romanticism and
                                Dispossession</title>, which describes, among other Romantic period
                            writers, Keats’s “fascination with anonymity as an ethics of engaged
                            withdrawal or strategic reticence” that “resists the requirement to
                            inhabit a social category and remains open to change and re-description
                            (3). Khalip contends that “since [Keats] the poet cedes his identity to
                            those around him, it is only through his expropriated creations that he
                            can be known” (46).</note> <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                    leaves us with a heightened semblance of deep and
                    abiding, romantic (authorial) love as Brawne’s (Abbie Cornish’s) mourning
                    recital of Keats’s sonnet fades into the film’s rolling credits, which feature
                    Keats’s (Ben Wishaw’s) disembodied voice reciting <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> with a
                    poignant mixture of elegiac celebration and mystification.</p>
            <p>As Jacqueline Peppal’s recent short film <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title>
                suggests, Keats’s new literary middlebrow following is
                    not just reverential toward highbrow literary culture.<note place="foot" resp="author"> <ref target="https://vimeo.com/128258657"

                I would add that new literary middlebrow culture also traffics in comedic, witty, and satirical
                reconfigurations of highbrow culture and its gatekeepers. If in Campion’s biopic <title level="a">Ode
                    to a Nightingale</title> represents and elicits the elegiac depth of middlebrow reverence, in
                Peppal’s short the nightingale appears as a “deceiving elf” that chides high aesthetic ideals and the
                notion of having “front-door” access to Keats with a popular science fiction intervention that recalls
                mass commercialized products, communication technologies, and serendipitous happenstance.<note place="foot"

                writings, and it features an English professor (Bell), who can travel back in time, and one of
                her graduate students, whom she has chosen to take on a research trip to Keats’s Hampstead
                residence in the spring of 1819. Posing in early nineteenth-century garb as a weaver (pseudonym
                Cornelius Green) and his mother, this ambitious graduate student and his domineering professor
                visit Keats at home with Charles Brown with the stated intention of asking Keats one question:
                what did Keats mean in the first line of <title level="m">Endymion</title>,
                    “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”? Both student and professor fritter away
                    their opportunity by passive-aggressively arguing to such an extent that Brown
                    politely asks them to leave. As the graduate student hurriedly bids adieu to a
                    nonplussed Keats with an unwitting parody of Keats’s own line, “a joy forever,”
                    the professor&#8212;contrary to her own student-directed admonishments about not
                    violating time-travel protocols&#8212;carelessly leaves behind her iPhone with its
                    nightingale image on the casing. At the film’s close, viewers are left with a
                    tongue-in-cheek (inverse, interrupting man from Porlock) notion that Keats
                    composed his fabled “Ode to a Nightingale” that very night after finding this
                    left-behind nightingale icon from the future.</p>
            <p>Although Keats’s own humorous and pun-full personality does not appear directly in
            <title level="m">Visiting Mr. Keats</title> (he remains mostly silent and bemused), the
                film’s sendup of academics captures Keats’s enthusiasm in his letters and poetry for
                challenging and mocking highbrow culture while inviting his audience to play alongside
                him, even at his own expense. Keats’s delight in elaborate word play and intense
                speculation informs this collection’s interlacing cultural studies, formalist, reception
                and reader response methodologies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Speculation
                            was a signal word for Keats, which figures prominently in several of his
                            most famous letters, including <title level="a">Adam’s dream,</title> <title level="a">Negative Capability,</title>
                            <title level="a">Mansion of Many Apartments,</title> <title level="a">cameleon Poet,</title>
                            and <title level="a">vale of
                            Soul-making.</title> For more, see Lisa Heiserman Perkins’s <title level="a">Keats’s Mere
                            Speculations,</title> which investigates Keats’s aesthetic, medical,
                            philosophical, and economic understanding of speculation.</note> In acknowledging
                    the necessarily speculative dimension of
                    this critical task, each essay embraces the wager of what kind of methodology
                    and type of proof might convincingly tie together the multiple Keatsian archives
                    of past and present, canon and popular culture, knowing full well that this is
                    an ongoing challenge for those invested in connecting our modern age with a
                    relevant Romanticism. Rather than provide one monolithic answer to the question
                    of methodology, causation, and proof, these essays instead foreground our
                    awareness of and excitement over the challenge of this query. In this
                    collection, we have delighted in Keats’s playful afterlives and in what Brian
                    McGrath (following Gerard Manley Hopkins) describes as a “Keats for
                    Beginners.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> I follow McGrath’s assertion that early
                        reviews of <title level="m">Endymion</title> reveal how “Keats’s focus on words
                        makes something happen in the writing of those attempting to respond to and curtail
                        the forms of attention Keats’s writing makes possible. Keats’s readers bear witness
                        to his beginnings” (366).</note> This Keats is an amateur’s amateur (as well as a
                    poet’s poet) who exuberantly incorporates popular culture into his poetry, mimics and
                    calls into question highbrow aesthetics, and appeals to others to follow (on the wing)
                    his beginning essaies, as in “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> My
                        characterization of Keats as an amateur’s amateur builds on John Fiske’s description in
                        <title level="m">Understanding Popular Culture</title> of creative amateurs who engage
                            in acts of “excorporation” that coopt, transform, and make use of mass market consumer
                            productions to create bricolages, new art forms, and even subcultures. Fiske’s work
                            builds on Michel De Certeau’s <title level="m">The Practice of Everyday Life</title>
                            (1984) and Raymond Williams’s <title level="a">Culture is Ordinary</title> in
                            <title level="m">Conviction</title>, edited by Norman McKenzie (1958).</note></p>
            <p>Brian Rejack’s <title level="a">Quoting Keats</title> points the way into this space of seeing
                and listening to Keatsian echoes, iterations, and re-creations. His tracing of the popularity of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s
                    first line provides a backward- and forward-turning meditation on what quoting
                    and misquoting Keats can teach us about our own mass cultural fixations on
                    engines of authorship and textual reproduction. In <title level="a">Reading Keats Together:
                    Cleanth Brooks and the Collegiate Public,</title> Christopher Rovee reminds us of how
                    Keats’s amateurish, ‘Cockney’ qualities were widely excised by Brooks’s
                    influential, New Critical touting of Keats’s “well-wrought,” expert
                    craftsmanship. Rovee contends that Brooks’s Keats-centered work played a
                    significant role in transforming post-World War II university literature
                    classrooms into places (perhaps even mediums) that rejected mass consumer
                    culture and, instead, encouraged a new mass influx of college students to create
                    with their professors an authentic, socially valuable, popular culture through
                    communal acts of close reading. Forest Pyle’s <title level="a">Keats Effects</title> theorizes about
                    how we can identify overlooked and under-heard networks of poetic influence and
                    sonic effects&#8212;whether “obstructive enthusiasms” or “shrines of no prospect.”
                    Pyle’s focus on poetry, music, and image in “Cockney pop” signals this
                    collection’s intention to describe new constellations of Keats’s presence in our
                    contemporary skylines. Betsy Tontiplaphol’s <title level="a"><title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                        and the Etsy Effect</title> prompts us to recognize one such constellation in Campion’s
                        <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Tontiplaphol argues that Campion’s film
                    lauds an imperfectly material Keats
                    whose dynamic avatars can be found on the social media website Etsy, which
                    celebrates the labor of amateur hands in a personalized handicrafts movement.
                    Noah Comet’s Bridget Jones-enthused response draws these essays into
                    stereoscopic view, suggesting what we might look and listen to as we move
                    forward with Keats studies in the twenty-first century. In popular culture,
                    Keatsian in-betweenness is legion.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Twenty-first
                            century popular culture renditions of Keats’s poems offer a synesthetic
                            feast for the senses that welcomes the animating play of his canonical
                            and non-canonical poetry and revels in his experimental, many-chambered,
                            multicursal poetics. As starting points, I suggest the following

                                <title level="m">Apotheon</title> led one (albeit factually inaccurate) reviewer to exclaim:
                        “If Keats had been alive 200 years later, he might have quit his job and become a game developer,
                        not a poet. And if he had, <title level="m">Apotheon</title>, a new game for the PC and PS4, might
                        be his ‘Ode To A Grecian Urn.’ It takes the gameplay of classic side-scrollers like
                        <title level="m">Legend of Zelda
                                II</title> and <title level="m">Castlevania</title> and applies it to the side of an Athenian
