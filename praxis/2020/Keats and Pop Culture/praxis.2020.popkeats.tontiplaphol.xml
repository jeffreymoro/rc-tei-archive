            <p> Jane Austen has a way of horning in on my scholarship. One minute, I’m writing about
                Wordsworth and ballet; the next, I’m citing Mr. Darcy’s famous assertion that “every
                savage can dance” (44). I sit down to meditate on Romantic-era vegetarianism, and I
                end up with an essay about&#8212;of all things&#8212;<title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> and
                the carnivores who inhabit its eponymous estate. Indeed, Austen has hijacked so many
                projects over the years that I’ve almost come to expect her interference, and I
                wasn’t surprised when she swam into my ken almost as soon as I began, on Brian
                Bates’s kind invitation, to ponder a paper about Jane Campion’s 2009 film
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> for this important collection. What
                <emph>did</emph> surprise me, however, was that this time, Austen’s
                interference manifested in another scholar’s complaint that she does, in fact,
                interfere with everything&#8212;or, at least, with every contemporary cinematic portrayal
                of nineteenth-century living, <title level="m">Bright Star</title> included. In a
                compelling essay entitled “The Austen Effect,” Toby Benis argues that “the success
                of screen adaptations of Austen’s novels has been followed by a generation of films
                set during the Romantic period that treat a variety of causes and figures… as if
                they circulated in a novel of manners” (183). Campion’s Fanny Brawne-centered Keats
                biopic, Benis continues, capitulates to that trend by “implicitly equat[ing]
                becoming a great poet with winning the hand of an aspiring lady” (183); the film’s
                Keats is “a lover,” in Benis’s words, “whose successful negotiation of the social
                obstacles to love, most obviously poverty, goes hand in hand with his poetic
                breakthroughs” (185). Benis attributes special influence to Andrew Davies, “the
                force behind the 1995 BBC miniseries of <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>”
                (184), and as I pondered that particular connection, the more echoes of Davies’s
                most famous Austenian adaptation I came to see in <title level="m">Bright Star</title>
                myself. Benis concentrates on the Austenian-formulaic aspects of Campion’s film&#8212;she
                notes, for example, that “Campion makes [Charles] Brown into the third figure… of an
                Austenesque triangle of affection and loyalty” and that she “erases… ambivalence” by
                presenting “Fanny’s attraction to and acceptance of Keats as her lover
                as…straightforward” (185, 186)&#8212;but I was struck by the more material parallels
                between Davies’s miniseries and <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, from their
                shared emphasis on scenes at dining tables and in bedchambers to their eerily
                similar opening credit sequences, both of which feature extreme close-ups of
                needlework set to instrumental scores. Parties and balls are central to both
                portrayals&#8212;one would expect as much from an adaptation of <title level="m">Pride
                    and Prejudice</title>, but notwithstanding the fact that “every savage can dance,”
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s concentration on such scenes was initially
                a bit of a surprise&#8212;and Campion, like Davies, frequently captures lovers and
                would-be lovers as they walk, often with sibling chaperones, across fields and
                through woods.</p>
            <p> As <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title> reminds us, however,
                appearances&#8212;especially first impressions&#8212;can be deceiving, and upon closer
                inspection, Benis’s “Austen effect” begins to seem, as a critical account, a bit
                like George Wickham: too easy and more than a little inconsistent. I’m not sure, on
                second thought, to what degree Campion’s Keats really “negotiat[es]… poverty”&#8212;after
                all, he dies as itinerant and dependent as the historical Keats&#8212;and I’ve come to
                question the notion that Fanny’s love for Keats, as portrayed by Campion, is
                “straightforward,” devoid of “ambivalence.” When Fanny sends her younger siblings to
                the bookshop to purchase <title level="m">Endymion</title>, Margaret “Toots” Brawne’s
                remark to the bookseller seems directly to contradict Benis’s assertion of
                doubt-free “attraction and acceptance”: “My sister has met the author,” Toots
                explains, “and she wants to read it for herself to see if he is an idiot or not.”
                Fanny’s stated motive, in other words, hardly suggests that her “attraction” to
                Keats is akin to Emma Thompson’s portrayal of Elinor Dashwood’s fast-formed
                devotion to Edward Ferrars, one of the on-screen Austenian love stories to which
                Benis compares it (186). But I was particularly struck by the bookshop episode
                because, upon further consideration, I realized that it complicated my own sense of
                the material parallels between Campion’s film and Davies’s miniseries at least as
                much as it challenged Benis’s argument about the formulaic similarities in question.
                The bookshop is inelegant&#8212;dun, dusty, and dim&#8212;and the bookseller’s reply to Samuel
                Brawne’s request for <title level="m">Endymion</title> is downright crass: “I’ve not
                sold one and took twenty,” he grouses. From the bookseller’s vantage,
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> is less a poem than a product&#8212;a thing, that is, to
                be bound, stocked, stacked, and sold&#8212;and in this brief scene and others, Campion
                shows nineteenth-century England’s unvarnished backside to a degree that Davies, in
                his ever-shimmering <title level="m">Pride and Prejudice</title>, never approaches.
                For instance, although both productions emphasize scenes at tables, only Campion
                shows the dingy kitchens where food is prepared. Both productions feature social
                dancing, but only Campion portrays the drudgery of a dance lesson, one conducted in
                the Brawnes’ narrow sitting room by a pedantic French instructor. Both productions
                feature sibling-chaperoned walks, but only Campion, who highlights the sometimes
                walk-resistant Toots as well as the lovers’ stolen kisses, captures the tensions and
                limitations inherent in that system of virtue-guarding. And although both
                productions open with images of sewing, only Campion (whose initial needlework shots
                are, thanks to the fabric’s ghostly whiteness, more emotionally ambivalent than
                Davies’s images of colorfully embroidered and warmly lit silk) remains interested in
                the act of stitching and, concomitantly, in the fact that clothes&#8212;like habits,
                dancers, food, and, of course, poetry&#8212;are <emph>made</emph>, are the
                products of material conditions and human efforts that are often unideal or even
                ugly.</p>
            <p> Campion has acknowledged that she aimed to achieve in <title level="m">Bright
                    Star</title> something other than a Davies-ish sheen, and in various interviews,
                she has described the aesthetic to which she aspired as more flawed than flawless.
                “Most period films,” Campion argued in 2009, “look like antique shops,” and
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, in contrast, is purposely “very bare.” “[We]
                were very strict,” she says, “about what they were allowed to have in the room. And
                out of that authenticity it created some boundaries for us. We wanted, if the film
                could ‘feel’ beautiful, that they would have earned it, rather than saying, this
                sort of thing should ‘look’ beautiful” (Sullivan 86). For Campion, I gather, “bare”
                primarily means uncluttered or even impoverished; the term “bare,” however, also
                connotes nakedness&#8212;a lifted veil, so to speak&#8212;and I concur with Campion’s assertion
                that <title level="m">Bright Star</title> eschews “thing[s]” that simply “‘look’
                beautiful,” or perfectly finished, in favor of objects and experiences that manifest
                their madeness, that show and even celebrate the productive
                <emph>processes</emph> behind or beneath. I ascribe that aesthetic shift to a new
                pop-cultural influence, a fresh “effect”: In lieu of conventional period-film
                luxury, Campion’s “bare” portrait of the nineteenth-century emphasizes what I would
                describe as the ethos of craft and crafting, and as a result, I argue that if
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> was shaped by cinematic Austeniana, it’s at least
                as indebted to the rise of Etsy, the online handicraft marketplace that was
                established in 2005, four years before <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s release,
                and that remains an internet powerhouse today. The fact that Keatsiana&#8212;that is,
                Keats-inspired notecards, broadsides, tote bags, jewelry, decorative
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">objets</foreign>, and other such material&#8212;is surprisingly abundant at Etsy.com suggests
                that artisans have intuited a special relationship between their work and Keats’s,<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> When I use
                    the term “surprisingly abundant,” I’m comparing the quantity of
                    Keatsiana on Etsy to the amount of, say, Wordsworthiana or Shelleyana. I
                    don’t mean to suggest that Keats’s presence on Etsy rivals that of
                    Shakespeare, J.K. Rowling, or other enormous literary and pop-cultural
                    heroes. Specific data appear below.</note>
                and although neither Campion nor the typical Etsy maker-<emph>cum</emph>-seller
                acknowledges the prosodic craftsmanship that, for many literary
                critics, distinguishes Keats’s highly wrought poems, both, I aim to demonstrate,
                appropriately figure Keats as a champion of craft’s pragmatic and ideological
                affiliations with the human hand and, as a result, with human imperfection.</p>
            <p> In her brief history of craft, Michele Krugh doesn’t explicitly posit a relationship
                between crafting and imperfection, but she does dwell on craft’s essential links,
                since William Morris’s late nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, to
                amateurism and handwork, both of which represent alternatives to the flawlessness
                associated with professionalism and/or mechanized fabrication. With Morris as a
                “founding [member],” the “Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed in 1877 in
                reaction against the drive to professionalization within the Royal Institute of
                British Architects, which wanted to make architecture a closed shop like law and
                medicine” (Gilmour 231).<note place="foot" resp="author"> In some ways, the origins of the movement date back
                            to the Great Exhibition of 1851; members of the Arts and Crafts
                            Exhibition Society “publicly rejected the excessive ornamentation and
                            ignorance of materials, which many objects in the Great Exhibition had
                            been criticized for.” Although Morris “only became actively involved
                            with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society a number of years after it
                            was set up,” “his ideas were hugely influential to the generation of
                            decorative artists whose work it helped publicize” (<title level="a">Arts and
                            Crafts</title>).</note> That said, Morris had long been an acolyte of
                John Ruskin, whose anti-industrialist commentary on craftsmanship in
                <title level="m">The Stones of Venice</title> includes an injunction against
                “demand[ing] an exact finish for its own sake,” as well as a warning about
                perfection generally: “No good work whatever can be perfect, and the demand for
                perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of art” (95, 97).
                Ruskin and Morris wrote with profound political goals in mind, but “the most lasting
                contributions of the Arts and Crafts movement,” Krugh argues, were “the
                transformation of craft into a leisure activity and the linking of craft with
                unalienated labour in opposition to mass production” (288). In other words, today’s
                makers and consumers are unlikely to ponder a link between craft and Ruskinian
                theories of social utopia, and although Krugh notes that, “over the course of the
                twentieth century,” craft also lost some of its affiliation with amateurism, “one
                aspect that remained constant was the importance of laboring by hand to the meaning
                of craft” (290). Etsy, which Krugh describes as “the first and largest craft
                e-commerce site” and “a global, online marketplace” (291), has continued to
                compromise craft’s relationship to amateurism by suggesting (somewhat
                disingenuously, it turns out) that the crafter’s “pleasurable and creative work”
                can, more easily than ever, become “a day job” (Krugh 294). Nonetheless, Krugh
                observes, Etsy still celebrates the hand&#8212;its intimacy, its idiosyncrasy, its
                authenticity&#8212;in a host of ways but most notably through its affiliated blog’s
                “articles on featured shops,” which typically “include interviews with the sellers
                and beautiful photographs of their workspaces and their products, and more
                importantly, of them making their crafts.” As Krugh indicates, these narratives
                “usually [include] close-ups of [sellers’] hands as evidence of the ‘handmade’
                labour of production” (294).</p>
            <p> To my mind, Krugh’s account of the standard imagery in an Etsy Blog
                article&#8212;“workspaces,” “products,” “making,” and, most importantly, “hands,” all
                possessed of a constructed, not an innate, beauty&#8212;uncannily evokes the aesthetic of
                    <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, in which, as I’ve noted, no object or
                experience (be it dress, dance, or poem) is portrayed as isolated from the human
                forces, the backstage labor, that brought it into existence. The film’s most
                obviously Etsy-ish moments represent Fanny, an aspiring fashion designer who early
                and confidently asserts in the manner of an Etsy ingenue that her work, which Brown
                denigrates as a girlish “obsession with flounce and cross stitch,”
                <emph>will</emph> earn her money&#8212;that is, will become “a day job” both satisfying and
                elevating. The work isn’t easy&#8212;as Margarida Pereira observes, “Fanny presents her
                stitching as a form of art as difficult and as complex as poetry writing” (163)&#8212;and
                Campion treats us to shot after shot of the studio-esque domestic spaces in which
                Fanny’s skilled hands, often shown in “close-ups,” gather, rip, pin, and sew the
                textiles destined to become either pieces in Fanny’s own wardrobe or exquisite
                gifts, such as the pillowslip that she embroiders for the late Tom Keats. However,
                in addition to watching Fanny work with nimble fingers, we hear her describe, with
                enthusiasm and technical specificity, the items that she makes and that other
                stitchers, she boasts, have “copied.” “Craft,” Krugh argues, “is about the
                personality of the maker” (293), and she cites Dixie Laite’s 2013 Etsy Blog piece
                about “branding” a “memorable Etsy shop,” which reminds sellers that “the story
                behind [one’s] products can attract customers because it makes what they’re buying
                special&#8212;and by extension, it makes them feel special” (293). Krugh notes that the
                vast majority of Etsy’s vendors are female&#8212;eighty-eight percent, according to a 2013
                report from Etsy itself (291)&#8212;and Campion’s heroine seems both to intuit and to
                prove the truth of Laite’s advice about craft and narrative. Although Brown
                patronizingly addresses Fanny as “the very well stitched little Miss Brawne, in all
                her detail”&#8212;he, it’s clear, has heard her talk shop too many times before&#8212;Keats’s
                “attract[ion]” to Fanny takes root in the early scenes in which she explains with
                pride that, among other feats of couture, she has “originated the pleats on [her]
                dress” and devised a one-of-a-kind “triple-pleated mushroom collar.”</p>
            <p> But the episode in which Fanny enthuses, blog-style, about the mushroom collar also
                highlights a problematic aspect of her crafting “personality,” as Campion imagines
                it: Notwithstanding handwork’s innate affiliation with the limitations and
                vicissitudes of human makers, Fanny seeks perfection, not just “special[ness],” in
                craft. Fanny has worn the collar to a dance, and as she stands with her back to a
                large mirror, she says almost smugly to Keats, “This is the first frock in Woolwich
                or Hampstead to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.” When Keats gravely replies,
                “Behind you I see one I fear to be identical,” Fanny’s face falls, and although she
                appreciates the joke when she spins around (the “identical” collar is, of course,
                her own collar reflected in the mirror), her reaction to the prospect of
                imperfection&#8212;in this case, to the prospect of being second, not first&#8212;indicates that
                she has a significant blind spot with regard to craft and, indeed, “personality,” a
                concept anchored in deviation from (not adherence to) a flawless ideal. Fanny’s
                first speech in the shooting script of <title level="m">Bright Star</title> finds her
                criticizing her little sister’s deficient sewing&#8212;“The stitches must be small and
                exactly even,” she complains to their mother (1)&#8212;and although that bit was cut from
                the final film, Fanny frequently articulates a taste, even a compulsion, for an
                ultimately unachievable perfection in craft. When, for example, she decides to make
                lemon wafers for Keats’s ill brother, she discards all but the flawless ones
                <emph>and</emph> clips Toots’s ribbon (right off her dress, in fact) to
                decorate the basket: “I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats’s brother anything that is not
                perfect,” she declares. Notwithstanding her mother’s shock and her sister’s
                protestation, Fanny fails to recognize the deficiencies&#8212;the waste, the
                inconsideration, and so forth&#8212;that, ironically, inhere in her quest to “offer”
                something both crafted <emph>and</emph> “perfect,” and later, upon
                delivering the wafers to Keats, Fanny persists in a futile effort to isolate the
                ideal, to separate the flawless from the flawed, in her evaluation of poetic craft:
                “I am very sorry I could not love your
                <title level="m">Endymion</title> completely, Mr. Keats,” she
                says, “…but I thought the beginning of your poem something very perfect.” Fanny
                means, of course, to elevate <title level="m">Endymion</title>’s renowned opening
                lines, but her remark highlights the fact that, when considered as a whole, Keats’s
                romance <emph>isn’t</emph> whole, isn’t poetically “complete.” In other
                words, Fanny’s attempt to celebrate perfection becomes, even as she shapes her
                compliment, an observation about inadequacy, about the inability of flawlessness to
                    <emph>hold</emph> in something made.</p>
            <p> Fanny’s standard, Campion seems to suggest, is clear but, for a maker, untenable
                and, after a while, even unappealing; like Keats’s doomed and often unsympathetic
                Lamia, Fanny aims to “unperplex bliss from its neighbor pain” by “defin[ing] their
                pettish limits” and “estrang[ing] their points of contact” (I.192-4). Perfection is
                her object, and as she early declares to Brown, critic of “flounce,” she “[doesn’t]
                shake hands with the enemy.” The film’s Keats, in contrast, is much more closely
                associated with makerly <emph>im</emph>perfection&#8212;with creative
                inefficiency, expressive immaturity, and physical frailty&#8212;and although much of the
                critical discourse surrounding <title level="m">Bright Star</title> emphasizes Fanny’s
                salutary effect on Keats (Julian North, in a representative essay, argues that
                Campion “represents Keats’s genius as nurtured by Fanny and flourishing harmoniously
                within her affectionate, domestic world” [83]), I want to underscore Campion’s
                implicit suggestion that through Keats, Fanny learns, to the ultimate benefit of her
                craft and the “personality” that inspires it, to brook and even to embrace the
                unideal. That rhetoric&#8212;<emph>i.e.</emph> “to embrace the unideal”&#8212;evokes,
                I hope, the concept of negative capability. Scholarly accounts of
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s engagement with negative capability have focused on Keats’s
                important interest in the obliteration of ego&#8212;North, for example, sees Campion
                exploring the “surrender of selfhood” and the “ability to accept the existence of
                other centres of consciousness” (81), while Pereira highlights the film’s “direct”
                reference to Keats’s “poet has… no identity” letter (157)&#8212;but Keats explicitly
                <emph>defines</emph> negative capability, in a remark about Samuel Taylor
                Coleridge, as the capacity “[to remain] content with half knowledge,” with a product
                or outcome less than perfect (43). Coleridge, he argues, isn’t negatively capable
                because, rather than accepting the “half” for the fullness it offers, he insists,
                like Fanny, on fullness proper, on “something very perfect.” Keats, in contrast,
                affiliates successful poetic making with accepting the unfinished or misaligned, and
                when, in a subsequent but related letter, he expresses his distaste for perfect
                poems, he portrays such objects (and, metonymically, their authors) as similar to
                Campion’s indignant Fanny, whose Lamian interest in “pettish limits” renders her
                unwilling, as she says, even to “shake hands with the enemy”: “We hate poetry that
                has a palpable design upon us,” Keats writes, “and if we do not agree, seems to put
                its hand in its breeches pocket”
                (<title level="m">Letters</title> 61).</p>
            <p> I highlight this charming image&#8212;a petulant poem refusing, Fanny-style, to shake
                hands with a reader who “do[es] not agree” with its “design,” its poetic
                perfection&#8212;because although Keats’s hands figure at least as prominently in
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> as Fanny’s, Campion rarely shows them
                <emph>writing</emph>, rarely shows them performing the physical act most
                closely, most perfectly, associated with Keats’s craft. Only Brown, a poetic nobody,
                repeatedly foregrounds the act of writing (“Men’s room&#8212;<emph>out</emph>&#8212;poets
                got to do a bit of writing,” he barks at Fanny)
                <emph>and</emph> associates Keats’s genius with his quill hand; in an especially
                intimate moment, Brown holds and even addresses Keats’s fingers, murmuring, “You
                wrote this, little hand? Did you do it?” In that episode, Brown is intent on
                rescuing Keats’s “talent” from the “trap” that, in his opinion, is a love affair
                with Fanny, but Keats only smiles because, although poems (again, like gowns,
                collars, and pillowslips) are made, he senses that the <emph>best</emph>
                ones are made in a way that preserves and even celebrates craft’s innate affiliation
                with distraction, inconsistency, misjudgment, and the like&#8212;with, that is, the
                reality of human (as opposed to mechanized) experience. “Allow me my happiness,”
                Keats says gently to Brown, “for I am writing again,” and the next scenes, which
                mean to portray the composition of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> in fact portray
                <emph>incidents</emph>, not the scribblings that capture them. Pen, ink,
                paper, and chair are carried outdoors on a bright afternoon that reverberates with
                birdsong, and as pieces of <title level="a">Nightingale</title> are read in voiceover, Keats’s quill
                scratches for just a moment; within seconds, however, his chair is shown empty, and
                Campion has cut back to the “men’s room,” where Brown, not Keats, holds a pen as the
                two friends inspect the completed stanzas together. Put simply, whereas Campion
                primarily films Fanny’s hands sewing, she primarily films Keats’s hands
                <emph>living</emph>&#8212;petting the Brawnes’ cat, brandishing celery in a faux
                duel, tap-tapping a teaspoon, and, yes, stroking his beloved’s fingers&#8212;and it’s in
                those “close-up” moments, we’re made to understand, that Keats’s poetry gets made.
                The <emph>not</emph> writing is, quite counterintuitively, the craft, and
                when Fanny, who struggles to “work out” poems, asks Keats to “say something of the
                craft of poetry,” Keats replies bluntly that craft&#8212;presumably as she, perfectionist
                and advocate of “practice,” understands it&#8212;“is a sham.”</p>
            <p>Campion suggests, in sum, that to be a poet is first to fail at writing&#8212;when Fanny
                remarks that she isn’t “clever” about poetry, Keats, having just been buffeted by
                <title level="j">Blackwood</title>’s, replies, “Neither, it seems, am I”&#8212;and in
                <title level="a">Trashing Keats,</title> which examines Keats’s interest in the relationship between
                “museums and refuse” (993), Christopher Rovee portrays Keats as similarly
                paradoxical, counterintuitive. In Keats’s “museal” poems, Rovee contends, “the work
                of art is revitalized by vigorous acts of removal and displacement, a devaluation of
                treasured origins” (1007): “Far from lamenting it,” Rovee continues, “Keats renders
                the dislocation of art as an aesthetic event in its own right, an opportunity to
                cash in poetically” (1009). My position, albeit comparable to Rovee’s, is that
                “displacement” and “dislocation” of the sort that Campion dramatizes when she shows
                Keats’s hands <emph>not</emph> writing is, in some sense,
                <emph>always</emph> the “treasured [origin]” of Keats’s own art&#8212;its very
                basis, not just an “opportunity” that presents itself on those relatively rare
                occasions when, say, Greece’s ancient marbles turn up in London’s glass cases.
                Keats’s fragmentary <title level="a">This living hand</title> is central to Rovee’s argument because it
                “performs an eerie exhumation” (1011)&#8212;presents, that is, a thrilling “dislocation”
                of an already disembodied object&#8212;but I see that piece reflecting the productive
                (mis)alignment of living hands with crafting hands that Campion posits in
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Campion doesn’t explicitly
                cite <title level="a">This living hand.</title> However, like any period film, <title level="m">Bright
                Star</title> brings “red life… again” to figures long since “cold” (6, 3), and as
                imaged by Campion, Keats, from “the icy silence of the tomb,” becomes, literally and
                repeatedly, a “living hand… warm and capable” (3, 1). Even more importantly,
                Campion’s crafting-without-writing Keats captures the lyric hand’s capacity to
                persist into the future&#8212;to “haunt” and to “chill” (4)&#8212;without the aid of
                a pen.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her
                            treatment of Keats and the tradition of the Romantic commonplace book,
                            Jillian Hess notes that when Keats “correct[ed] a single word in
                            [Woodhouse’s] commonplace book,” Woodhouse himself was less interested
                            in “the poem’s content”&#8212;that is, <emph>what</emph> Keats had
                            written&#8212;than in “the imprint of Keats’s body”: “Woodhouse felt that his
                            collection’s value increased merely because Keats had touched it” (19).
                            As in <title level="a">This living hand,</title> the hand&#8212;<emph>not</emph> the
                            hand<emph>writing</emph>&#8212;carries significance; within
                            Keats’s coterie, the living poet’s acknowledgement of the error was more
                            valuable than the marks he made to repair it.</note> The
                “living hand” <emph>could</emph>, we are assured, hold a quill&#8212;it’s
                “capable / Of earnest grasping,” Keats indicates (1–2)&#8212;but instead of writing, the
                hand simply exists, forges an enduring spatial and sensory connection with the
                poem’s silent interlocutor: “See here it is&#8212; / I hold it toward you” (7–8). There’s
                a lot that’s ugly about that final offer and the threats that precede it&#8212;as Rovee
                notes, readers have long “derided… [the poem’s] hostility and aggressiveness, [its]
                seemingly ungenerous stance out of keeping with the likeably selfless Keats”
                (1011)&#8212;but that inconsistency is, I argue, in itself
                <emph>consistent</emph> with Keats’s interest in imperfection, in a poetry of halves,
                as he articulates that interest in the negative capability letter and as Campion
                portrays it in <title level="m">Bright Star</title>. Indeed, the very text of <title level="a">This
                living hand</title> is, grammatically speaking, so inconsistent as to be almost unreadable,
                even by the standards one might use to judge a poetic fragment. Careening from the
                present to the future and from the blandly indicative (“here it is”) to the
                dramatically subjunctive (“thou would wish… / So… red life might” [5–6]), it’s a
                poem (or a piece of one) that succeeds creatively because it fails discursively.
                <title level="a">This living hand,</title> one might say, resists being written&#8212;or read&#8212;in favor of being
                lived, of being proved upon our pulses.</p>
            <p> Illegibility, misalignment, failure, and even ugliness: Like <title level="a">Nightingale</title>’s
                “forlorn,” those words “toll me back”&#8212;not to “my sole self” but to Etsy, where
                Keatsiana is notably well represented among the handicrafts for sale. To search
                “John Keats” while limiting the results to “handmade” (as opposed to “vintage,” a
                category of goods that Etsy also purveys) was, at the time of this writing,<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> The data in
                            this essay regarding items on sale at Etsy.com were collected in early
                            October, 2017. In late September, 2019, a search for “John Keats”
                            limited to “handmade” yielded 225 hits. Parallel searches for Blake and
                            Byron yielded 513 and 224 hits, respectively.</note> to get 162
                hits. To search for “handmade” items featuring the other Big Sixers was to find that
                Keats’s number was bested only by Blake (at 349) and by Byron (at 225), and having
                completed some careful sorting, I attribute Blake’s and Byron’s robust Etsy
                presences to the fact that the former’s illuminations make for great t-shirt art
                (and the like), while the latter’s very name can signify gentlemanly luxury, as one
                shop’s “Lord Byron Dandy Handkerchiefs” and another’s “Lord Byron’s Brand Beard Oil”
                suggest. In other words, Blake’s and Byron’s Etsy prominence is inflated by what I
                would describe as extra-literary factors; Keats, in contrast, is primarily
                represented by Etsy sellers through his words&#8212;calligraphed onto broadsides,
                embroidered onto sachets, etched onto bracelets&#8212;and at the time of my assessment,
                the number of products linked to Keats dwarfed the number of products linked to
                Wordsworth (at 107), Coleridge (at 14), and Shelley (at 61).<note place="foot" resp="author">  In late
                            September, 2019, the numbers for Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley were
                            136, 16, and 40, respectively.</note> What factors, then, are
                responsible for Keats’s relative popularity, his unique appeal to Etsy’s artisans?
                Rovee’s argument makes it easy to imagine the delight that Keats might have
                experienced upon seeing his words “displace[d]” and “dislocat[ed]” onto
                twenty-first-century handicrafts, but unless we believe that, in addition to
                crafting, Etsy’s purveyors of Keatsiana stay abreast of the academy’s discourse,
                Rovee’s argument can’t in itself account for their penchant for Keats in the first
                place. It’s not at all inconceivable that bookish crafters have recognized, without
                the help of Rovee or Adorno, a connection between their own work and Keats’s
                “museal” poems; after all, like the Keats who composed <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title>
                Keatsiana crafters are making new art from old fragments both verbal and, quite
                often, material. However, although <title level="a">Urn</title>’s truth-and-beauty bit&#8212;and
                <emph>only</emph> that bit, really&#8212;was referenced in a few shops, other
                explicitly “museal” poems (in addition to <title level="a">This living hand,</title> Rovee
                highlights <title level="a">On First Seeing the Elgin Marbles</title>) didn’t figure at all among the Keatsian goods for
                sale on Etsy in October of 2017. Rather, crafters concentrated on Keats’s letters,
                passages from which were featured in a plurality of the marketplace’s Keats things
                (thirty-three, by my count), and, significantly, on the juvenilia&#8212;on, that is,
                Keats’s least polished, least finished poetry. “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”
                was a favorite quotation<note place="foot" resp="author"> As Brian Rejack observes in his essay for this
                            collection, the first line of <title level="m">Endymion</title> welcomed
                            visitors to the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857&#8212;a
                            circumstance that, in itself, attests to the special place that Keats
                            has long occupied in the hearts and minds of artists and artisans of
                            various types.</note>&#8212;eleven items used it&#8212;but <title level="a">The Grasshopper
                and the Cricket</title> and <title level="a">Sleep and Poetry</title> were less predictable presences represented
                by excerpts (“the Poetry of earth is never dead” [1] and “stop and consider! Life is
                but a day” [85], respectively) that, like the first line of
                <title level="m">Endymion</title>, characterize aesthetic pleasure as there for the taking, if only
                one “stop[s]” to “consider” it.</p>
            <p>To my mind, then, Keats’s Etsy prominence is most likely attributable to crafters’
                sense that Keats, like themselves, made <emph>by</emph> living&#8212;by feeling,
                piecing, experimenting, and failing&#8212;even as he struggled to make
                <emph>a</emph> living. Keats’s iconic sonnet on the sonnet, famously embedded in an
                aggregated, newsy, living-full letter to George and Georgiana Keats, attests to the
                truth in that portrait; the poet-speaker of “If by dull rhymes” identifies as an
                uncertain crafter, a Fanny-esque fashionista (albeit cobbler, not dressmaker) who
                hopes to “find out” “sandals more interwoven and complete / To fit the naked foot of
                poesy” (4–6). “Find out” conveys the pen-less experiences&#8212;later specified as
                “inspect[ing],” “weigh[ing],” “see[ing],” and simply paying “attention meet”
                (7–9)&#8212;that underwrite his writing, while “more” captures the asymptotic (or,
                perhaps, Ruskinian) character of his larger enterprise, the fact that unqualified
                “interwoven”-ness and “complete”-ness will <emph>remain</emph> unattained,
                unattainable. In addition, “more” corresponds meaningfully with the term “better” in
                the letter’s pre-poem commentary, which explicitly denies that “If by dull rhymes”
                achieves prosodic perfection: “I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet
                Stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language over well from the
                pouncing rhymes&#8212;the other kind appears too elegiac&#8212;and the couplet at the end of it
                has seldom a pleasing effect.” “I do not pretend to have succeeded,” Keats concludes
                (255), and to examine “sound and syllable” in “If by dull rhymes” is to appreciate
                the fairness of his doubts, to recognize the degree to which his interest in
                loosening the sonnet’s traditional “chain[s]” (10, 1) has resulted in a scheme
                arguably <emph>less</emph> “interwoven” than “more” so.<note place="foot" resp="author"> 
                    I say “arguably” because one’s definition of “interwoven” matters. I offer an
                            alternative reading of the wovenness in “If by dull rhymes” in
                        <title level="m">Poetics of Luxury in the Nineteenth Century: Keats,
                                Tennyson, and Hopkins</title> (63–65).</note> Indeed, it’s
                only in the last four lines that Keats, by nixing the English sonnet’s “seldom…
                pleasing” couplet in favor of alternating (but, in the case of “crown” and “own,”
                slanted) rhymes, manifests something like a sonic weave; the poem’s ninth through
                thirteenth lines constitute a stretch dramatically (for a sonnet, anyway) devoid of
                end rhyme, and by the time we reach line twelve’s “be,” that word’s chance to chime,
                even “[un]pouncing[ly],” with line four’s “poesy” has long since passed. And yet,
                the <emph>presence</emph> of those imperfections, those products of a
                makerly temperament more investigative than ends-obsessed, corresponds quite
                directly with the important sentiment articulated near the sonnet’s close: “Let us
                be / Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown” (11–12). To make anew is first
                to disrupt or even destroy, to <emph>reverse</emph> the finishing process
                by plucking away the old and “dead.” Successful acts of positive creation come much
                later and, still later, again; as the sonnet’s final lines suggest, the lady Poesy’s
                fresh “garlands” have yet to be produced, and this poem, punctuated by three “if”s,
                is less a perfectly finished exemplar than a mock-up, a sketch of a conditional
                future: “So, if we may not let the Muse be free, / She will be bound with garlands
                of her own” (13–14).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See also Emma Suret’s similar claim (realized as a
                            sewing metaphor, no less) that “instead of a sustained description,
                            ‘like Andromeda,’ ‘in spite of painèd loveliness,” and ‘if we must be
                            constrained’ created a patchwork of clauses with their comma-stitched
                            outlines disrupting the continuity of Keats’s argument” (150). Suret’s
                            broader reading of “If by dull rhymes” gestures toward the poem’s
                            numerous successful failures.</note></p>
            <p>Put simply, “If by dull rhymes” embodies, at best, but “half knowledge,” and even the
                post-juvenilia Keats remains, perhaps, the ultimate amateur artisan: He made good
                <emph>because</emph> he wasn’t perfect, because the flaws in his
                application, his taste, and his psyche seeded, not impeded, the work that made his
                name. To creative giggers (I refer, in that term, to Etsy’s role in the so-called
                “gig economy” of the twenty-first century), Keats’s experience must seem both real
                and aspirational, and it’s <emph>their</emph> Keats that Campion captures
                in her craft-centric, handsy portrayal of an imperfect (and ultimately un-Austenian)
                early nineteenth century. Now, I can’t see what Keatsiana was for sale while Campion
                was writing and/or directing <title level="m">Bright Star</title>, and it’s possible
                that I’ve got it backwards, that Etsy’s current Keats-oriented offerings (and their
                relative abundance) were influenced by the film, not vice versa. I acknowledge that
                several items for sale at the time of this composition quoted the poem <title level="a">Bright
                Star,</title> and like Campion, who admitted to having struggled with much of Keats’s
                poetry, Etsy crafters are, as I have noted, especially focused on Keats’s
                letters (Sullivan 87). In an episode at the end of the
                film, however, I see a hint that the Keats imagined&#8212;not necessarily unfairly or
                unmeaningfully, I want to emphasize&#8212;by contemporary crafters was resonant enough to
                guide Campion’s vision. When Brown delivers the news of Keats’s death to the Brawne
                family, he reads aloud Joseph Severn’s letter describing the poet’s last moments. At
                the line, “Keats died imperceptibly,” Fanny abruptly stops Brown and steps toward
                the staircase, where, quickly engulfed in uncontrollable sobs, she clutches her
                throat and gasps frantically, “Mama! I can’t breathe!” There’s nothing
                “imperceptibl[e]” about Fanny’s pain or panic as her last hopes pass, and she seems,
                somehow, to be living Keats’s blood-choked final days&#8212;to be possessed of his
                tubercular chest, which she repeatedly jabs with impotent fingers. It’s a moving
                moment, and it evokes a quotation particularly popular among Etsy’s Keatsiana
                crafters, one that appeared in October 2017, in or on twice as many items as, say,
                lines from <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title>: “Two souls with but a single thought / Two hearts
                that beat as one.” If Campion was inspired by those lines&#8212;if, that is, her Fanny
                feels death because <emph>Keats’s</emph> heart no longer beats&#8212;I’m certain
                that she didn’t encounter them in a collection of Keats’s writings or in Andrew
                Motion’s biography of the poet, with which she also worked closely. I’m certain
                because, of course, the lines at issue&#8212;again, “Two souls with but a single thought /
                Two hearts that beat as one”&#8212;weren’t written by Keats at all, though they’re often
                attributed to him. (<title level="m">The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</title>
                identifies the quotation’s true source as Maria Lovell’s <title level="m">Ingomar
                the Barbarian</title>, a translation of a play by Friedrich Halm [Knowles 222].) I
                recognize that even if Campion had those lines in mind, I can’t, obviously, be sure
                that she discovered them while perusing Etsy, since the misattribution in question
                dwells in a variety of the internet’s dark hollows. Still, <title level="m">Bright
                Star</title>’s broader emphases on images of hands and on the notion of life as
                craft&#8212;“Buy, Sell, and <emph>Live</emph> Handmade” was, Krugh notes, the
                centerpiece of Etsy’s 2010 mission statement (297; emphasis added)&#8212;render the
                prospect appealing. Even more appealing (if, perhaps, less plausible) is the
                possibility that Campion <emph>recognized</emph> the “two souls”/“two
                hearts” passage as <emph>not</emph> belonging to Keats&#8212;that, in other
                words, she purposely alluded to the fact that, at the core of Keats’s Etsy presence,
                imperfection resides in its most perfect form: error, plain and simple.</p>
            <p>In fact, error and physiological (in)coordination together constitute the foundation
                of <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s namesake sonnet, which opens with a doomed
                attempt to correct, imaginatively, for the exigencies of immortality and closes with
                a picture of the speaker “pillowed upon [his] fair love’s ripening breast,”
                “feel[ing]” her chest’s “soft fall and swell” and “hear[ing] her tender-taken
                breath” (10–11, 13). The star’s icy isolation can’t be “unperplex[ed]” from its
                “steadfast[ness],” despite Keats’s aggressive “Not” and “No” (1–2, 9); the former is
                a precondition of the latter, since to live in warm proximity is, of course, to be
                subject to the rot that succeeds all “ripening.” The speaker of <title level="a">Bright Star,</title> then,
                <emph>misattributes</emph> pleasure to uncompromised
                fulfilment&#8212;ascribes it not to living, but to immortality; not to feeling, but to
                “feel[ing]… <emph>forever</emph>” (11; emphasis added)&#8212;and the result is a
                poem whose author seems to reach, like Campion’s crafter-heroine, for absolute
                precision, for an outcome “very perfect.” However, although <title level="a">Bright Star</title> (unlike
                <title level="a">If by dull rhymes</title>) boasts an almost clinically ideal Shakespearean rhyme scheme,
                the subtle misalignment of “unchangeable” (9) and “swell” (11) highlights the
                central Keatsian-<emph>cum</emph>-Etsian truth at play: Living&#8212;metonymized
                in the breast that “swell[s]” with “breath”&#8212;doesn’t rhyme, literally or
                metaphorically, with perfection, with the “unchangeable” (that is, the ever
                symmetrical, “exactly even,” or otherwise “unperplex[ed]”) forms generated by
                machines and, sometimes, by those misguided human makers who fetishize machine-like
                accuracy. Indeed, to pay “attention meet” to the intimate pleasures described in
                <title level="a">Bright Star</title> is to note that their very wellspring is asymmetry, even distortion.
                Keats’s speaker “hear[s]” and “feel[s]” tonight because he, unlike his sleeping
                beloved, lies awake, and although the sonnet describes his “unrest” as “sweet” (12),
                we can’t but imagine that his partner’s rest is <emph>un</emph>sweet,
                pursued as it is beneath the weight of an insomniac’s head. Is her pleasantly
                “tender” breathing actually labored&#8212;that is, <emph>made</emph> audible and
                physically sensible by the less than ideal material circumstances that delimit her
                slumber? Is she, perhaps, nearly as frantic for air as Campion’s Fanny, who, upon
                learning of Keats’s death, claims “I can’t breathe”? Considered in tandem,
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title>’s “two hearts” that seem to “beat as one” and
                <title level="a">Bright Star</title>’s single (and possibly tortured) breast hint at the thready unevenness
                that, more often than not, both defines and energizes Keatsian making.</p>
            <p>It’s worth noting that Etsy’s crafters are also partial to an authentic Keats
                quotation (from one of the poet’s most famous love letters to Fanny Brawne) about
                adoration and respiration. Last fall, the words, “My love is selfish&#8212;I cannot
                breathe without you” (335), ornamented a number of the site’s Keats-inspired charms
                and sentimental whatnots, but since that genuine Keatsian construction, which
                Campion seems to reference obliquely much earlier in the film,<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> When Keats is
                            away from Hampstead, Fanny attests to an inability to breathe. In the
                            shooting script, she declares solipsistically to her mother, “When I do
                            not hear from him it is as if I have died, as if the air is sucked out
                            of my lungs and I am left desolate, but when I receive a letter I know
                            our world is real and it is the only one I care for”
                    (54).</note> fails to capture the sense of <emph>union</emph>&#8212;of two
                moving as one&#8212;that the misattribution does, it’s less credible as
                a potential inspiration for the perverse “wedding” with which the film concludes. As
                <title level="m">Bright Star</title> closes, Campion meaningfully documents the
                good and the goods that derive from Fanny’s experience living failure through Keats,
                and in the scene that follows her episode of panicked gasping, we watch Fanny’s
                fingers stitch some new and very different clothing: widow’s weeds. A made-over
                Fanny soon emerges from the house, a black blot on the bridal-white winter
                landscape, and then the “minx” who once struggled to “work out” poetry recites
                Keats’s <title level="a">Bright Star</title> start to finish. It’s the first poem that Campion incorporates
                in its <emph>entirety</emph>&#8212;that is, perfectly&#8212;but we’re not allowed to
                forget the partialities and imperfections that, within the context of the film,
                inspired the sonnet’s composition and reflect in Fanny’s pained delivery of its
                paradox-infused lines. In lieu of a traditional wedding&#8212;the standard final scene in
                an Austen adaptation, of course&#8212;<title level="m">Bright Star</title> concludes, I
                would suggest, by underscoring the uncomfortable union that underlies craft,
                <emph>i.e.</emph> the union of living with making. All things considered,
                then, it may be appropriate (or appropriately inappropriate) that to search Etsy for
                “handmade” items tagged “John Keats” is to find, listed in the midst of bracelets
                and paper goods, a single dress: RanunculusMarket’s “Jane Austen Wedding Dress,”
                complete with ribbon laces that can, the seller assures potential buyers, “be tied
                at a tightness anywhere between ease of breathing and fainting spell.” Wearers, it
                seems, can “live ever&#8212;or else swoon to death” (14).</p>
