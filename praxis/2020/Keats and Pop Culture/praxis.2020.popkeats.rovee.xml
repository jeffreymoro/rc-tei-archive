                <p rend="noCount">This essay considers Keats’s unique appeal to the New Critics of
                    the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. It returns to a landmark in American literary
                    studies&#8212;Cleanth Brooks’s study of Keats’s <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title>&#8212;drawing on
                    Brooks’s unpublished personal and professional papers to place his work in the
                    context of mid-century disciplinary and methodological changes. At a time when
                    greater access to American higher education created what we might call a
                    “classroom public” for poetry, Brooks’s study of Keats advocates for and models
                    the close, collective reading of poetry, idealistically figuring the university
                    classroom as a site of social inclusion while also summoning the conservative
                    historical fantasies associated with Southern Agrarianism. </p>

            <head>I. Overwrought Maidens and Well-wrought Urns</head>
            <p>It’s not uncommon for readers to cite John Keats’s Grecian urn as if it were the main piece in one of modern criticism’s
                    most consequential titles, Cleanth Brooks’s
                <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> The phrase “Keats’s well-wrought urn”
                    appears, for instance, in Bornstein, p. 265; Dass, p. 36; Fairer, p. 32; Haw, p. 187; Richard Keller Simon,
                    p. 123; and Vinegar and Golec, p. 85.</note> The confusion between Keats’s “bride of quietness” and the
                    “well-wrought urn” of John Donne’s <title level="a">The Canonization</title> can be chalked up to the
                prevalence of the conceit: urn as self-contained text-object. Brooks himself encouraged the misidentification
                by making <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn</title> his book’s central case study, and his self-declared
                goal, “to bridge the gap between metaphysical poetry and other poetries” (<title level="m">Postscript</title> 698),
                    is in keeping with just such a mix-up. Keats’s poem abets in its own way, embedding the key adjective
                    (“O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede / Of marble men and maidens <emph>overwrought</emph>…”)
                    and thus suggesting Brooks’s title as an allusion to the poetic differential in which he was so heavily
                    invested, between content (overwrought expression) and structure (well-wrought achievement), between
                    the depiction of emotion (pictures on the side of an urn) and the complex aesthetic form that contains
                    such depiction (the urn itself).</p>
            <p>That Keats’s urn has become so readily identifiable with a touchstone of twentieth-century formalist criticism speaks to his exceptional status among American New Critics, who were famously&#8212;if somewhat disingenuously&#8212;dismissive of the romantics. As Frank Jordan explains in his overview of modern romantic criticism, the New Critics’ “sharpshooting was chiefly aimed at Shelley (a poet of adolescent ideas for readers of adolescent enthusiasms) and Wordsworth… Only Keats escaped their fire virtually unharmed” (62). Ernest Bernbaum’s tabular accounting of romantic scholarship in the 1940s shows that Keats was the most written-about of the romantics in that decade (73), and in 1948 J. R. MacGillivray remarks on the “almost unqualified praise” of Keats by “the ‘New Criticism’ of the thirties and forties” (still “new” enough to need quotation marks; lxxxi). Frederick Pottle, colleague and sparring-partner of Brooks at Yale, introduced his classes on Keats in the 40s and 50s by summarizing the poet’s relatively high standing among contemporary critics:
                <quote>
                    Probably now at the highest point of
                    critical acclaim. Some attempt to make him out the greatest of the Romantics.
                    Essays on positive values by Leavis, Brooks, Tate, Burke…. Basic reason for
                    their approval: however far Keats may be from the tradition of wit or the kind
                    of imagery exemplified by the metaphysicals and the moderns, he invariably shows
                    a firm grasp of objective reality in the mode of common concrete dense
                    perception. Disciplines and impersonalizes his personal emotions by developing
                    them out of real objects. ‘Sensuous’&#8212;cf. what the Victorian critics thought
                    ‘Adolescence.’ More dramatic than Shelley. Less direct statement than W.W.
                    Humor. Awareness of complexity. Skepticism. Doesn’t run to easy solutions.
                    (<title level="a">Current Developments</title>)
                </quote>
            Realistic, concrete, disciplined,
                    impersonal, dramatic, undogmatic, ironic, skeptical, and above all&#8212;as the sum of
                    these qualities&#8212;<emph>mature</emph>: “John Keats is not one of the villains of modern
                    criticism,” Brooks declared in 1957, indeed he “may well prove to be one of
                    [its] heroes” (<title level="a">Artistry</title> 246).</p>
            <p>Though he came to believe that he would “be
                    among the English poets” after his death, Keats could hardly have foreseen being
                    a hero of academic critics. The gap between popular appeal and critical respect
                    was an ongoing source of ambivalence for him, as his need to make money from
                    poetry proved bewilderingly hard to separate from his grander sense of vocation.
                    “I equally dislike the favor of the public with the love of a woman&#8212;they are
                    both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence,” he wrote his publisher
                    John Taylor (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 144), aligning the allure of popular
                approval (and the money that came with it) with the allure of beauty for the errant knight
                in <title level="a">La Belle Dame sans Merci</title> (or more personally, the allure of
                Fanny Brawne for a young poet in need of funds to marry her while he still could). Keats
                played out his resistance to that allure in romances like <title level="a">Isabella,</title>
                whose gross and “wormy circumstance” mocked the standard romance-reader, and <title level="a">The
                Eve of St. Agnes,</title> where a sexually explicit depiction of Porphyro’s encounter with
                “hoodwinked” Madeline was deemed “unfit for ladies” by his friend Richard Woodhouse and frustrated
                Taylor by tacitly refusing a wider readership (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 163). “I feel
                it in my power to become a popular writer&#8212;I feel it in my strength to refuse the poisonous
                suffrage of a public” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II: 146): Keats distinguished his ability
                to produce sensational, “overwrought” content from the “strength” required to assimilate that
                content to a rigorously wrought form. That capacity to aesthetically process and transform sensuous
                and complex experience would come to be seen as the hallmark of Keatsian maturity&#8212;as in his
                acclaimed ode, which distills the romances’ “unfit” sexual scenarios into an aesthetic encounter
                fit for a museum, with a male viewer who “haunts about th[e] shape” of an ancient artifact figured
                as an inaccessible “bride,” and a “leaf-fring’d legend” whose images of “violent love-making” (as
                Brooks describes) merge with the total form of a Greek vase (<title level="a">History Without
                Footnotes</title> 93).<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> On eroticism in the ode, see Johnson, pp. 129–35; Pope; and Zeitlin.
                    As Pope summarizes, the specter of sexual violence in the poem has long been recognized as
                    a feature of the poem by canonical Keats criticism, though with quite variable emphases (46).</note>
            </p>
            <p>Keats’s ambivalence about “the poisonous
                    suffrage of the public,” which in the Keatsian narrative connotes his “maturity”
                    as well, offers an alternative way of understanding his exceptional appeal to
                    New Critics, who evince a similar jumble of popularizing and gatekeeping
                    impulses. The rise of close reading in the mid-twentieth-century classroom, in
                    Doug Mao’s words, “seemed happily timed to address the newly broad composition
                    of collegiate student bodies, and in this sense to participate in a further
                    democratization of American society” (246). But Mao’s judicious phrasing
                    reflects some of the contentious assertions about readers made by the New
                    Criticism’s leading figures&#8212;John Crowe Ransom railing against what he called the
                    “low grade” taste of “the participating millions” (<title level="m">World’s
                    Body</title> 280); Allen Tate condemning “egalitarian superstition” (<title
                    level="m">Essays</title> 527); Brooks pitting the mature reader of poetry against
                    the “desperately bad” taste of a “young lady … in raptures over her confessions
                    magazine” (<title level="m">Well Wrought
                    Urn</title> 233). In <title level="m">Cultural Capital</title>, John Guillory gives
                such assertions an institutional context, by presenting the New Criticism as an attempt
                to re-order the field of literary studies and, with it, American culture as a whole.
                “The retreat of literary culture into the university can be understood as a kind of
                transcendence of the cultural conditions of modernity” (165), writes Guillory: “In
                discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, students also discovered at
                the same moment why it needed to be studied <emph>in the university</emph>” (173).
                Approaching the formalist turn as a disciplinary response to a looming sense of cultural
                disorder, Guillory argues that the withdrawal of poetry into the seminar-room made
                literature “more difficult to consume outside the school” (174). The blossoming of close
                reading as the central activity of literary studies, in this thesis, corresponds with
                poetry’s retreat from public culture into a mature and masculine exclusivity, with
                “the urn as a figure for the enclosure of literary culture in the academy” (166).</p>
            <p>Brooks’s writing, which frequently turns polemical, gives the critic of elitism plenty
                to work with. Even when displaying his belief in what could make poetry genuinely popular,
                he laments those forms of popular culture that serve as distracting alternatives. “Even
                people who think that they care nothing for poetry have interests which are the same as
                those satisfied by poetry,” he tells us; “they listen to speeches, go to church, view
                television programs, read magazine stories or the gossip columns of newspapers” (Brooks
                and Warren, <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title> 21). These distractions are
                associated with an urgent crisis of language and imagination: “Never has language taken
                such a pounding perhaps in our history,” Brooks says, citing “what happens to [it] as it
                is used day in and day out by the journalist, the advertising man, the Tin Pan Alley
                lyricist, the class B movie script writer, the politician, and the bureaucrat” (<title
                    level="a">Literature as Paideia</title>). In <title level="m">The Hidden
                    God</title> (1963), he cites “the pressure of the popular arts” as particularly damaging,
                noting that if Wordsworth “claimed that the imagination was being strangled by the more
                sensational popular arts,” then “cheap fiction, Tin Pan Alley, the movies, the radio,
                and now television makes what Wordsworth faced in 1800 seem very mild indeed” (3). Brooks
                was every bit at ease in dismissing popular culture as he was in citing Cole Porter or
                Alley-Oop to do so, and this rhetorical flair is part of his power as a prose stylist.</p>
            <p>Approaching the question of access to
                    literary culture in terms of Brooks’s cultural polemics, however, keeps us from
                    seeing the more paradoxical aspects of a close-reading practice that would come
                    to be widely understood as a catalyst for inclusivity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Graff
                        writes that “putting the emphasis on the literary text itself … seemed a tactic ideally
                        suited to a new, mass student body that could not be depended on to bring to the university
                        any common cultural background” (173). As Guillory points out (168), Graff makes no claim
                        for the democratizing intentions of new-critical pedagogy, yet the basic association between
                        the democratization of culture and new-critical pedagogy is nonetheless common. For an
                        example of the optimistic rhetoric, see Holland: “The ‘New Criticism’ opened the great
                        tradition of English literature to people of any or no cultural inheritance…. In an
                        upwardly mobile society, students whose parents had never graduated from high school
                        could be <emph>littérateurs</emph>” (68). More nuanced, Mao enriches our understanding
                        of this counter-hierarchical tendency by arguing that the New Criticism’s emphasis on
                        the text-object in itself, rather than on the scholarly origins and contexts that
                        enable its study, served a paradoxically leveling function: “the primary aim of the
                        New Critics in this area was … to bring ‘difficult’ poetry to the widest possible
                        audience by showing that one can engage complexity without devoting one’s lifetime
                        to the mastery of historical and biographical contexts” (248).</note> We do better
                by attending to the exacting labor that most preoccupied Brooks and his colleagues:
                close reading itself. In this essay I turn to his central methodological demonstration,
                <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History Without Footnotes.</title> Despite its
                starring role in <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>, this study of <title level="a">Ode
                    on a Grecian Urn</title> is known more for
                    its broadest strokes than for its finer brushwork. But it rewards careful
                    scrutiny. The essay shows Brooks dramatizing close reading as a collective
                    practice that hedges against the alienation of modern life by nourishing an
                    intimate community whose members attend, all at once, to the same thing. Indeed,
                    in the idealized new-critical seminar, poetry becomes genuinely popular again:
                    the modern reading public may be defined by the fact that authors no longer know
                    the people for whom they write, but Brooksian reading turns back the clock, not
                    only by drawing a poem near to its reader, but by drawing readers near to one
                    another. More restrained than, say, the radical formalism of Theodor Adorno,
                    which allowed art to float free of social instrumentality as part of a broader
                    revolutionary program, the reading-practice Brooks articulates in his study of
                    Keats respects the autonomy of art but is itself infused with social and moral
                    purpose. The scene of close reading brings into being a communal formation, call
                    it “the classroom public,” which is not easily pinned down, politically
                    speaking, and which idealistically figures present as well as future scenes of
                    reading as sites of social inclusion, even as it nostalgically summons some of
                    Agrarianism’s more conservative historical fantasies.</p>

            <head>II. ‘On a level’: Close Readers in the Ivory Tower</head>
            <p>The idea that close reading enabled “a
                    counter-hierarchical pedagogy” has been part of the discipline’s self-narration
                    dating back almost to the new-critical era itself. Addressing Yale’s incoming
                    graduate cohort in 1966, Pottle, who was then the English department’s DGS,
                    described the vivifying effect of new-critical pedagogy. An eminent historicist
                    and one of Brooks’s most formidable antagonists in the 1940s and 1950s, Pottle
                    told the new arrivals that the entrenched practice of close reading had
                    effectively lightened the weight of canonical authority. Graduate students were
                    no longer “over-awed by previous judgments,” he said; “No doubt this has made
                    the study of literature more exciting.” And as with canonical authority, so too
                    with professorial authority: the student now is “on a level with the instructor,
                    or even above him. Nobody has to be a specialist or even learned.” The result
                    was “a sense of wide horizons, room for discovery, [and] encouragement of the
                    combative sense” (<title level="a">Current Developments</title>)&#8212;this latter
                    encouragement hinting that
                    students were freshly empowered to wage intellectual battle with their
                    professors.</p>
            <p>To an extent, we discern in these words a kindly welcome meant to put an anxious clatch
                of doctoral candidates at ease. <emph>Don’t be nervous about your seminar with
                Misters Brooks, Wimsatt, or even Bloom</emph>, Pottle implies; <emph>nowadays
                the student is on a level with the instructor, or even above him</emph>.
                Pottle also reproduces a familiar image of the New Critic as pedagogue, one that was
                born with the 1938 publication of the teaching anthology <title level="m">Understanding
                    Poetry</title> and flourished with the democratization of higher education:
                    <emph>Nobody has to be a specialist or even
                    learned</emph>. But while the New Critics’ close reading techniques facilitated
                participation among students of varying educational backgrounds, a new academic
                egalitarianism was not in their purview. The odd mixture of anti-industrialist populism
                and aristocratic sensibility that defines the original Agrarian position in part helps
                to explain this split-seam within new-critical thought. At issue here are two competing
                notions of humanities education prominent in the emerging modern university of the 1930s
                and 1940s: the <emph>liberal-free</emph> and the <emph>oratorical</emph>. The liberal-free
                ideal, grounded in the Enlightenment, is critical in orientation, devoted to open-ended
                inquiry and to the production and accumulation of knowledge, as opposed to the dissemination
                of information (Harpham 11–13). Its concern is for students’ growth; in the liberal-free
                university, “maturity” is about learning how to think and is achieved through “an emphasis
                on freedom, especially freedom from tradition and a priori strictures and standards”
                (Kimball 119). Conversely, in the oratorical tradition, “maturity” is about learning
                <emph>what</emph> to think. Grounded in Plato and fortified by thinkers like Arnold and
                Newman, the oratorical approach is cultural in orientation, devoted to the passing-down
                of specific knowledge, “the tradition of great texts” (Kimball 238), moral values, and
                the preservation of an existing idea of culture (Harpham 12–13). The mainstream of
                new-critical practice effectively straddled these two approaches to education. It combined
                a potentially disruptive emphasis on criticism (versus philology, historicism, ethics) with
                a countervailing dedication to high culture. In this doubled thinking, the New Criticism
                practically wrote its own contradictory legacy as a movement that is as much praised for
                its progressive and egalitarian tendencies as disparaged for its consolidation of a
                restrictive view of the literary.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, then, the new-critical emphasis on <emph>understanding</emph> poetry suited
                a disciplinary ideal of literature as a subject distinct from the sciences, a subject in which
                knowledge was a process rather than an outcome. It could not be properly understood through
                the dissemination of facts, or through the paraphrasing of its content, or through the appreciation
                of its aesthetic pleasures; it was instead a provocation, a focus for hard thinking, a basis for
                maturation. By engaging meaningfully with literature, adolescents learning to navigate the modern
                world learned how to think and act like adults. As they learned to take responsibility for their
                independent taste-judgments, though, they did so under the tutelage of professors who espoused and
                maintained a definite taste-hierarchy, in which the most difficult of literary works, which challenged
                readers with their ambiguities, tensions, and paradoxes, were explicitly set above the modern forms of
                cultural production that were so alluring to young people&#8212;radio, films, magazines, as well as
                the supposedly “immature” and “sentimental” poetry by writers like Shelley or Joyce Kilmer. A mature
                literature was touted as a difficult literature, and by providing students the tools to decipher its
                meanings, the New Criticism could be seen as providing access to the cultural capital that it historically
                represented, while securing the legitimacy of humanities study more generally.</p>
            <p>The collegiate public was beginning to look different in the 1940s: if the public for classic poetry in
                America was coming to be centered in the universities, those universities were themselves becoming more
                representative of a wider public. Enrollments soared through the decade, as media coverage popularized
                the idea of common Americans “storming the ivory tower” (Clark 174). Although this expansion of opportunity
                did not yet extend to American minorities, who remained subject to both explicit and de facto forms of
                segregation, nonetheless “the college degree itself was transformed in the 1940s from a document earned
                primarily by members of the American upper class” (Ciabattari xix). The reading community taking shape
                in the American classroom during and after the second World War, drawn from a range of educational
                backgrounds, was thus a “fit audience though few” in the most perverse of ways, for it was precisely
                its uneven fitness that conditioned its receptivity to the poetry that New Critics wanted to teach.</p>
            <p>Not all professors of poetry were at ease with this shift toward a restricted collegiate sphere. The
                poet Karl Shapiro, holding onto a romantic notion of the individual genius, criticized the move of
                creative production into institutional settings, writing that “Writers and artists have become
                professors, and young people of talent meet with the creative spirit in an academic world” (208).
                For Shapiro, the influence of Brooks and Warren, and the fact that <title level="m">Understanding
                Poetry</title> represented “one of the most important works of the twentieth century,” was the sign
                of a bigger problem:
            <quote>
                It is the book that took poetry off the street and put it in the laboratory. It has not only
                revolutionized the teaching of literature; it has practically put a stop to genius. Every
                composition test and anthology shows its influence; the brainless and beautiful poetry of
                our leading verse magazines derives from <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>.
                The objectivity of such teaching tools prevents the young
                writer from creating standards of his own. (208)
            </quote>
            Shapiro’s perception of student passivity (he calls this “the Brain-Washed Generation”) is echoed
            by Joseph E. Baker, professor at Iowa, who grouses about the effect of close reading on “young
            intellectuals” who “find no message in literature and therefore as a literary generation have no
            message at all to give to the public.” Baker blames “a demolition squad of English professors, a
            small but aggressive minority within their own departments, hard at work with the efficiency of
            doctrinaires,” for training students to “handle a poem like a cross-word puzzle” (2). The new-critical
            assumption, according to Baker, was that the “general public” for poetry was “in the classroom”&#8212;“that
            literature is mainly to be written, and even read, in ivory towers”&#8212;but that the classroom did
            not allow for conversation “about human problems, about life, about ideals and eternal verities (3).</p>
            <p>Brooks’s assumptions about the so-called Ivory Tower,
                    though, were different; he sought to transform the concept. In a kind of
                    urn-like chiasmus, he saw the popular as literary, and the literary as popular:
                    “it is possible to prove that certain … poets inhabit the Ivory Tower by
                    measuring the size of the reading public which appreciates them,” he argued,
                    “but it would be better to say that the public is in the Ivory Tower” because of
                    the “greater scope and breadth which the poetry of the obscure poets
                    assimilates” (<title level="m">Modern Poetry</title> 67–68). In Brooks’s view, a
                public composed of student-readers would encounter through poetry a totality of
                experience that belies the very concept of the Ivory Tower. This was in keeping with
                the contemporary push to view College English as a curricular space dedicated, in the
                words of Esther Raushenbush (who taught at Sarah Lawrence and later became its president),
                to “helping [students] grow out of their adolescence and become mature human beings” (v).
                The seminar promised a sort of coming-of-age, in which students would learn to subordinate
                their personal interests to a supposedly more mature and objective criticism. It also
                promised opportunities for moral edification&#8212;a humanist aim that formalist readers
                were only too happy to claim for their own approach, by suggesting the spiritual benefit
                that would come with practicing critical rigor.</p>
            <p>The transformation of the collegiate public
                    intensified after the war, when government investment contributed to a
                    near-total makeover of the nation’s classrooms. Under the $5.5 billion GI Bill,
                    war veterans became a prominent presence on campus, by dint of sheer numbers and
                    by their visible maturity and academic success. Keith Olson, the leading
                    historian of the GI Bill, reports that more than two million veterans attended
                    university in the half-decade following the war, one million in 1947–48 alone
                    (596, 602). Seventy percent of the class of 1949 were veterans (596). College
                    attendance was no longer the exclusive preserve of wealthy young elites, which
                    it had been even as late as the 1930s; it was “established as a social norm”
                    (McGurl 66), more diverse in terms of class, ethnicity, and religion, and with
                    so many ex-servicemen, there were even students of various age- and
                    maturity-levels.<note place="foot" resp="author"> On the other hand, the impact
                        of the G.I. Bill on racial equality was disappointing. As Bailey explains,
                        “Though African Americans and Latinos were as fully entitled to benefits as
                        white veterans, they faced much greater obstacles, from racial segregation
                        and discrimination in higher education to a much lower high-school graduation
                        rate that left black veterans less able to take advantage of education benefits”
                        (98). See also Frydl pp. 222–62.</note> Marriage had been grounds for dismissal
                before the war (Olson 606), but one of every five veterans arrived on campus with a spouse,
                and many of them had babies (Frydl 314), meaning that for the first time there
                were students on campus who, instead of being children, were themselves parents. In this
                way more than others, perhaps, the GI Bill helped to unsettle the seemingly natural
                equivalence between college and a specific period of life, “the adolescent years.” College
                came into its modern identity as a mechanism or social instrument potentially applicable
                to all age-groups&#8212;“the essential technology,” as Mark McGurl says, “for producing
                American egalitarianism through meritocratic class mobility” (61).<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Findeisen counters that McGurl “misinterprets mass education
                    as a form of egalitarianism” (296) and refers to mass education as one of neoliberal
                    America’s most successful ideological tools: “During the past sixty years or so, the
                    higher-educational system has been one of America’s most effective technologies for
                    sustaining the ideology of equal opportunities, and it has done this by orchestrating
                    the myth of systemic inclusion” (294).</note></p>
            <p>With enrollments nearly eighty percent higher than at the start of the decade, there developed
                an “uncritical acceptance of largeness” (Olson 607) as a governing reality of higher education:
                overcrowded sections, longer teaching hours, expanded course offerings, towering dorms, and so
                forth (Frydl 316–18). The New Critics were alert to this aspect of modern mass education, and
                in their pedagogy they sought ways of containing or re-unifying its potentially disparate energies.
                In his 1938 essay <title level="a">The Teaching of Poetry,</title> Ransom had predicted that the
                radically non-historical approach of <title level="m">Understanding
                Poetry</title> would make the classroom a space for active critical assessment rather than for the
                passive reception of information&#8212;liberal-free rather than oratorical&#8212;changing the very
                nature of English instruction while bringing new texts into discussions long-dominated by classic
                ones (82–3). Ransom and his fellow Agrarians viewed lecture-style teaching as “a technique of
                mass-production” (Davidson 34), whereas <emph>criticism</emph>, instead, was conceived as the basis
                for active and inclusive “public discussion”:
                <quote>
                    The official Chaucer course is probably over
                    ninety-five percent historical and linguistic, and less than five percent
                    aesthetic or critical. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. But it is not
                    improved because the student has had to tie his tongue before it. It is an
                    artistic object, with a heroic human labor behind it, and on these terms it
                    calls for public discussion. The dialectical possibilities are limitless, and
                    when we begin to realize them we are engaged in criticism. (<title level="a">Criticism, Inc.</title>

                </quote>
            The prevailing classroom approach, Ransom
                    implies, was coercive. The student must “tie his tongue” in a system of
                    instruction based on the entrenched authority of “dryasdust philology” (McGann
                    49) or professorial whimsy. Oratorical teaching was a form of discipline,
                    performed by “men who do little more than read well aloud, enforcing a private
                    act of appreciation upon the students” (99). Ransom’s antipathy to the existing
                    curricular order is crystalized by his comparison of the literature curriculum
                    to a previous generation’s idea of the art museum. “The professors so
                    engaged”&#8212;that is, the professors seeking to cultivate among students an
                    unthinking reverence for the status quo&#8212;“are properly curators,” he
                    provocatively argues, “and the museum of which they have the care is furnished
                    with the cherished literary masterpieces, just as another museum might be filled
                    with paintings” (100).</p>
            <p>Yet his idealization of the seminar’s “public discussion” nonetheless drew on other
                forms of scholarly authority. As Bonnie Smith has shown in
                <title level="m">The Gender of History</title>, when the nineteenth-century concept and practice of the
                    History Seminar traveled from Europe to the United States, it conferred
                    scientific legitimacy on historical study (105–116; see also Mommsen 81–99 and
                    Turner 299–310). The Johns Hopkins professor Herbert Baxter Adams said that
                    seminars were like “laboratories where books are treated like mineralogical
                    specimens, passed about from hand to hand examined, and tested”; at Harvard,
                    Ephraim Everton claimed that the “scientific method” embedded in the seminary
                    structure “would transform knowledge” (qtd. in Smith 105, 106). The seminar was
                    egalitarian in concept, a “<foreign xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft</foreign>, a
                society, a club,” as Everton put it, “presided over by a professor, but
                    composed, not of subject students, but of members” (qtd. in Smith 107). It was
                    also a specifically masculine space, as Smith argues: “From the beginning, the
                    seminar member was considered a kind of participatory, universal citizen who was
                    implicitly gendered male and whose autonomy was shored up by the excluded and
                    dependent status of women” (113). Ransom’s liberal-free ideal of the
                    new-critical seminar was a similarly legitimizing concept, which coopted the
                    prestige and the manliness of historiography, as it merged (through the close
                    reading of individual poems) professional training and evidentiary
                pursuit.</p>
            <p>This ideal of the seminar as an egalitarian space, dedicated to “public discussion”
                among mature participants, is one of the enduring legacies of the American New
                Criticism. But this even plane was hard to actualize, particularly given the
                knowledge hierarchy endemic to the academy. At LSU in the 1930s, Brooks tried to
                foster discussion by freely incorporating popular culture in his teaching, both
                to help him connect with students and to help students connect with the world of
                poetry. Teaching metaphor, for instance, he used cigarette ads to show how the girl
                in an advertisement bears a merely metaphorical relationship to the taste of the
                cigarette, a strategy designed (as he recalls) “to pry off the museum glass” from
                poems. Making poems more accessible, though, hardly erased his evident authority&#8212;if
                anything, it enhanced it. In the 1960s, under pressure to get more popular culture
                into later editions of <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>, in order to appeal
                more directly to the student market, Brooks and (Robert Penn) Warren set Cole Porter’s
                <title level="a">You’re the Top</title> alongside Cleopatra’s lament for Mark Antony.
                “Cole Porter is no Shakespeare,” Brooks clarified in his <title level="a">Instructor’s
                Manual</title>&#8212;addressed to teachers, not students&#8212;but the comparison between
                Tin Pan Alley lyricist and Renaissance poet would nonetheless helpfully “remind the student
                that interesting metaphor can be found outside the collected poems of a renowned author.”</p>
            <p>It was a delicate balance to strike, between appealing to students’ sensibilities and preserving
                the centrality of the literary work. The seminary imperative required a certain give-and-take
                on the part of professors, a softening of some distinctions and a reinforcement of others, and
                this was an even more delicate matter when it came to the choreography of the discussion. The
                Keats scholar Jack Stillinger describes the challenges of his own early pedagogy. Stillinger,
                who entered college in the late 1940s and started teaching in the mid 1950s, recalls “posing
                Brooks-and-Warren-like questions” to his classes but finding dialogue almost impossible to
                sustain: “class ‘discussion’ inevitably turned into lecture,” he writes, and “the students
                didn’t seem to mind”: “when it came to class discussion&#8212;Ph.D. professor in the front
                of the room, face to face with freshman and sophomores who had hardly any experience of life
                or literature or even much knowledge of the English language&#8212;some individual readers
                were thought to be superior to some others” (Stillinger). Anyone who has facilitated a close
                reading among a group of students can probably identify with Stillinger’s struggle, and it
                could only have been harder at mid-century, when it was so novel a classroom approach that
                students were unprepared to play along. When Ransom joined the Vanderbilt faculty in 1914,
                the curriculum was organized entirely along historical lines: students were expected to
                remember “the names, titles, and facts of English literature” and “to memorize the five
                thousand or so lines that in the opinion of their instructor were most representative of
                their literary heritage.” Yet Ransom “almost immediately” began teaching in the mode that
                Brooks and Warren would later codify in <title level="m">Understanding Poetry</title>, and
                a Kenyon undergraduate in the 1950s recalled Ransom as “very nearly incapable of giving a
                formal lecture”: “The effect was one of complete formlessness, but, in retrospect, it all
                seems to have been done with a great deal of precision” (qtd. in Young 417).</p>
            <p>The ability to straddle the line separating “formlessness” and “precision” was essential
                for teachers who brought collective close reading to the center of their classroom practice.
                Not everyone succeeded. Despite the mythology, New Critics were sometimes thought of as
                <emph>bad</emph> teachers: “the ‘new critics’ often talk over their students’ heads,”
                Robert Withington, a professor at Smith College, wrote in <title level="j">College
                English</title> in 1950; “The critic is, too often, not a teacher” (282). This was rivalry,
                in part&#8212;the pushback of the historicist lecturer for whom facilitating critical
                discussion did not count as “teaching”&#8212;but the praise lavished on certain New
                Critics nonetheless indicates that great teaching was neither easy to come by nor often found.</p>
            <p>One iconic new-critical pedagogue, Austin Warren, excelled by negotiating so adeptly the
                conflicting demands of class discussion. Though he is best known for co-authoring
                <title level="m">Theory of Literature</title> with his Iowa colleague Renê Wellek,
                Warren took special pride (and found his deepest sustenance) in teaching. His
                new-critical style is Keatsian, predicated on empathy and an almost novelistic
                ability to inhabit other voices: reluctant “to argue for a position put forward
                as my own,” he sought instead “to exposit sympathetically the view of the author
                whose text was before us, or to articulate for an inarticulate student what I
                divined his own views to be” (<title level="a">In Search</title> 25). Myron Simon,
                a longtime UC Irvine professor who took Warren’s undergraduate American literature
                survey at Michigan in 1948, recalled how the teacher “promptly disturbed the mild
                air of the lecture room” with his care for “rebel voices” (118), seeking “to build
                a community in the classroom by making the relation between teacher and student a
                reciprocal one” (125–26). Yet Warren’s explicit deferral of authority was shadowed
                by an awareness of his power. He reflected that, in ceding authority to students by
                placing their arguments at the center of discussion, he still could call on “the
                seductive powers of a teacher’s personality and voice” (<title level="a">In Search</title>
                25). In a short tract on teaching which he contributed to <title level="j">PMLA</title>
                in 1955 (which he believed to be the very first pedagogical piece ever to appear in that
                journal), he wrote that “intellectual honesty” demanded “that the teacher shall not
                limit himself to asking the students: ‘what do <emph>you</emph> think?’,” adding:
                “Empathy is next to essential, but it is dangerous also.”<note

            <p>Brooks’s own, famously agile teaching was distinguished by the ability to manage these contradictions
                of the new-critical style. His reputation as an exemplary choreographer of discussion preceded him
                when he moved from LSU to Yale in the late 1940s. A comic poem published in
                <title level="j">The Yale Record</title>, <title level="a">Mistah Brooks – he here,</title>
                commemorated his arrival in New Haven by detailing how “carefully, intimately” he performed his role as a
                    close reader at the head of the classroom:

               </quote>
            What stands out here is the way the
                    student-writer portrays Brooks’s careful calibration of professorial authority.
                    As a teacher he meticulously stages a nearly invisible authority, the appearance
                    of reciprocity masking the fact that authority moves in one direction only: “He
                    suggests”; “And they listen”; “And they understand.” Whereas Stillinger in the
                    1950s&#8212;and many of us still today&#8212;struggled with the contradictory demands of the
                    student-oriented classroom, Brooks displays an agility that would be unique in
                    any case, but which is especially striking for the 1940s, when “straightaway
                    lecturing” was the norm (Stewart 107).</p>
            <p>Brooks no doubt would have felt the
                    difference between teaching at a large land-grant institution and at an elite
                    private university, no matter how much the GI Bill unsettled the cozy
                    homogeneity of the seminar room after the war. His students in Louisiana would
                    mostly have arrived at college with the expectation of learning a trade; the
                    older pedagogical model in which pedantic professors dispensed facts about
                    literature would not have roiled their expectations in the least. At Yale,
                    though, students mostly hailed from New England boarding schools, and Brooks
                    would have met there with a confident and cliquish sense of privilege that made
                    student participation both easier to come by and more crucial to keep in check.
                    While the diminished stress on learnedness contributed to leveling the relations
                    between professor and student, we should not overstate the degree to which close
                    reading superseded context in Brooks’s classes. Brooks took a pragmatically
                    eclectic approach to teaching. Former students have remarked on his inclusive,
                    outside-in classroom approach, by which he framed the work of close reading by
                    always beginning with historical and biographical details external to the text.
                    Susan Wolfson writes, citing the Shakespearean Lawrence Danson (a former student
                    of Brooks), that in graduate seminars “the first half of the term was spent
                    reading historical background, biography, and literary history, the second half
                    reading the poetry. While the curriculum was not dialectical, it was also not
                    exclusionary.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wolfson,
                            <title level="m">Formal Charges</title>, p. 239, n.14.</note> This feature of Brooks’s
                teaching method is confirmed by the many typed-out lectures preserved among his papers, which
                regularly intersperse historical and biographical information with occasional close readings.
                In guiding students through poems, as Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernan have recently shown,
                he “works to make his classroom as self-contained as good poems should be and guards against
                a referentiality that would connect his classroom to the world in nonfigural ways.” But he
                also freely brings biographical and cultural contexts to bear when they can be of assistance,
                and rather than belabor the “unity” of individual poems, he more often attends to the images,
                metaphors, and diction of individual passages read in isolation, often in an appreciative mode.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> For further details on Brooks’s teaching style, see Buurma and
                    Heffernan’s alert reading, pp. 120–21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Still, if Brooks was more permissive of historical study in his teaching than he lets on in
                his criticism, among undergraduates&#8212;who could compare his approach with traditional,
                historical professors&#8212;he seemed downright revolutionary. In the
                <title level="j">Yale Course Critique</title> of 1963 a student publication, a review of his
                course on <title level="a">Contemporary Poetic Theory and Practice</title> praised his “informal
                approach” in the classroom as a consequence of his formal approach to poems:
                <quote>
                    Few students take notes. Aesthetic analysis
                    in the manner of the New Critics is stressed while the historical, sociological,
                    and psychological aspects are necessarily de-emphasized. A great deal of
                    personal interest and initiative are necessary for the student to gain from the
                    informal approach since Mr. Brooks emphatically does not ‘spoon-feed’ his
                    students with factual information about the modern poets. (<title level="a">English 71</title> 28)
                </quote>
            Transcripts of this same class, preserved in
                    Yale’s Beinecke Library, confirm this informality. At one point, when one of the
                    students is trying to describe his boredom at Archibald Macleish’s insistence on
                    illustrating every one of his poetic statements, the transcriber inserts a
                    stage-direction: “as opens eye with a thumb.” This moment (the student
                    gesturally describing his boredom) shows how easy Brooks’s students felt in
                    class; they did not always passively follow him and apparently felt comfortable
                    engaging with him in spite of his professorial mastery. Brooks, for his part,
                    handles the moment with characteristic complaisance: “Quite right. I don’t think
                    we have any basic disagreement here.” Students continue to break in on the
                    lecture with questions and comments, and he seamlessly merges each of their
                    points into his flow. Analogous to his work with poems, Brooks’s unifying
                    impulse transforms haphazard classroom repartee into the coherent discussion of
                    a community bonded by his almost imperceptible guidance.</p>

            <head>III. ‘The poem is to be read’: The Critic’s Role</head>
            <p>“Brooks the critic emerged from Brooks the pedagogue,” Jewel Spears Brooker appreciatively
                wrote in a 1995 review of his final, posthumous essays (131). But it works the other way
                around, for Brooks, as well. The critic <emph>is</emph> a pedagogue, whose prose models
                the work of teaching and thematizes the teacher’s orchestration of a reading undertaken
                by many people at once.</p>
            <p>The gently wielded authority of the pedagogue and expert close reader features in Brooks’s
                essay on Keats’s <title level="a">Ode on a Grecian Urn,</title> a landmark in the history
                of romantic criticism and his signature study “in the structure of poetry.” First published
                in the 1944 <title level="j">Sewanee Review</title> as <title level="a">History without
                    Footnotes: An Account of Keats’s Ode,</title> the piece reappeared as chapter 7 of
                    <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>, title slightly modified: <title
                    level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian: History without Footnotes.</title> (In both titles,
                    Brooks playfully linked the essay’s
                    lone footnote to that word.) In it, Brooks answers the criticisms of T. S.
                    Eliot, John Middleton Murry, and H. W. Garrod, by accounting for the speech of
                    the urn at the poem’s conclusion, what Eliot had called “a serious blemish on a
                    beautiful poem.” Brooks observes that “some critics have felt that the
                    unravished bride protests too much,” and he catalogs the complaints, noting that
                    the lines have been cast as “an intrusion on the poem,” as a descent into
                    messaging that “injures the poem” because it “does not grow out of it”
                    organically (89–90).<note place="foot" resp="author"> I cite parenthetically from
                    the initial printing in the <title level="j">Sewanee Review</title>.</note> This
                language of violation and injury was part of the new-critical playbook. Allen Tate
                called the last stanza “an illicit commentary” and a “radical violation” (<title
                level="a">Reading</title> 195–6), and Earl Wasserman later observed that New Critics
                tended to figure the crossing from one disciplinary mode or discourse into another as
                a sexual “transgression,” with the act of “reaching outside the text for information”
                akin to straying beyond the marital bond between text and reader. “Most explicators
                are sensible men,” Wasserman writes, who “wish the work of art were so self-sufficient
                it could not tempt them to sin” (3).</p>
            <p>This question of formal “violation” is
                    precisely what Brooks claims as his special interest in the ode. It is “as neat
                    an instance as one could wish” (92) of “the problem of belief” (90), as I. A.
                    Richards termed the relation between a poem’s aesthetic quality and the verity
                    of its assertions. Exploring this instance, Brooks recasts the urn’s speech as a
                    problem not of content (the closing statement’s “truth or falsity”) but of
                    context (whether the statement “was properly prepared for”). “The very ambiguity
                    of the statement, ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty’ ought to warn us against
                    insisting very much on the statement in isolation,” he argues, “and to drive us
                    back to a consideration of the context in which the statement is set” (90). The
                    poem’s most celebrated lines, in other words, should matter less than the
                    structure in which they appear. Brooks thus pursues his account of Keats’s ode
                    as what he calls a “test”&#8212;an endeavor to see whether those lines are indeed a
                    “blemish,” or whether they are “dramatically appropriate” (91).</p>
            <p>Brooks begins his essay by casting
                aside extra-poetic materials (“Keats’ reading, his conversation, his letters”),
                leaving a reader face-to-face with the poem itself (91). The effect is both
                personalizing and de-personalizing. On the one hand, the reader is enfranchised to
                make judgments; on the other hand, those judgments are to be based on an empirical
                procedure. Accordingly, Brooks relinquishes his own speaking “I,” writing in the
                passive voice: “The poem is to be read in order to see whether the last lines of the
                poem are not, after all, dramatically prepared for” (92). What Brooks calls “the
                paradox of the speaking urn” (100)&#8212;the notion, quoting Archibald Macleish, that
                “poems should not mean / But be” (89)&#8212;morphs into a matching paradox, that of the
                speaking critic. Just as poems should avoid making direct statements, so critics
                should demonstrate like scientists. <emph>The poem is to be
                read.</emph></p>
            <p>This distancing of the reader, however, is followed by a
                    minor crisis in the identity of that reader, who Brooks exhorts:
                    <quote>
                    Yet there are some claims to be made upon
                    the reader too, claims which he, for his part, will have to be prepared to
                    honor. He must not be allowed to dismiss the early characterizations of the urn
                    as merely so much vaguely beautiful description. He must not be too much
                    surprised if ‘mere decoration’ turns out to be meaningful symbolism&#8212;or if
                    ironies develop where he has been taught to expect only sensuous pictures. Most
                    of all, if the teasing riddle spoken finally by the urn is not to strike him as
                    bewildering break in tone, he must not be too much disturbed to have the element
                    of paradox latent in the poem emphasized, even in those parts of the poem which
                    have none of the energetic crackle of wit with which he usually associates
                    paradox. This is surely not too much to ask of the reader&#8212;namely to assume that
                    Keats meant what he said and that he chose his words with care. (92)
                    </quote>
            While there’s some risk in
                over-reading Brooks’s characteristically qualified idiom, it is not at all clear
                just who this “reader” is&#8212;whether Brooks is describing, in the third-person,
                <emph>his own task</emph> in the essay, or whether he is simply
                dramatizing a reading-practice that he expects <emph>his readers</emph> to
                imitate. Helen Vendler writes that “lyric is a role offered to a reader” (181); for
                Brooks, <emph>criticism</emph> is a role offered to a reader, with
                detailed stage directions. The refrain “He must not be,” repeated three times,
                catalogs the trained responses to Keats’s ode that readers should resist. With the
                flatly ironic “This is surely not too much to ask,” Brooks admits that to pay strict
                attention to the words on the page is, in fact, a lot to ask for readers accustomed
                to seeking out messages or history. Even beyond these echoing <emph>musts</emph>, a
                subtle air of coercion haunts the essay’s vocabulary&#8212;readers are
                “<emph>forced</emph> to conclude” (90), or “<emph>forced</emph> to accept” (94)&#8212;suggesting that
                good close reading means repeatedly resisting one’s scholarly conditioning. This
                recurrent idiom of force suggests that it’s not the artwork that awaits ravishment
                by a reader, but readers who are always potentially ravished by conventional
                disciplinary practices. </p>
            <p>Within <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian,</title> Brooks reveals his own coercive
                streak as an integral part of the drama of reading. For all his probity and care to anchor
                statements in the evidence supplied by the poem, he also has a penchant for drawing
                attention to those moments when probity fails him. A seemingly minor instance occurs
                early in the essay, when he somewhat misleadingly quotes from stanza five: “…the urn,
                like the ‘leaf-fring’d legend’ which it tells, is covered with emblems of the fields and
                forests: ‘Overwrought / With forest branches and the trodden weed’” (92). Is it the
                <emph>urn</emph> that is <emph>overwrought with natural emblems</emph>, as Brooks here
                suggests, or the <emph>maidens</emph> pictured on its side who are <emph>overwrought with
                emotion</emph>? We can read it either way; the ambiguity lies in the enjambment. This
                movement of poetry in time, the way its meanings shift with the turn of the line, is an
                important feature of a poem that in Brooks’s own account pits the nominal against the
                participial and verbal&#8212;“frozen, fixed, arrested” figures against “flesh-and-blood
                men and women,” a world “beyond time” against “our time-ridden minds” (99). But Brooks
                does not acknowledge this other way of reading “overwrought”; indeed by capitalizing the
                word he actively dismisses any other reading, giving the impression that the reference
                moves only forward. Can he have missed the ambiguity? It’s not likely&#8212;and later in
                the essay he quotes the very same passage from the other side: “…the rich, almost breathing
                world which the poet has conjured up for us contracts and hardens into the decorated motifs
                on the urn itself: ‘with brede / Of marble men and maidens over-wrought’” (99). Here
                “over-wrought”&#8212;now hyphenated, but neither capitalized nor enjambed&#8212;is presented
                (again unambiguously) as a postpositive adjective. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to
                catch Brooks out in a bit of expository duplicity, or to suggest a lack of care for words
                that Keats “chose … with care,” but simply to show how peculiar, even playful, his reading
                practice can be. It is possible that he’s making, or more properly <emph>dramatizing</emph>,
                a point, namely that poetic evidence is never entirely stable. The figure of
                    the “well wrought urn,” often misread as a figure for radically internalist
                    understandings of the autonomous aesthetic object, allows room for deviance. The
                    poet chooses his words with care&#8212;but so does the critic. The notion of an
                    impartial reader who dutifully extricates and explicates the truth of the text
                    itself is something of a fiction, and as much as we think of Brooks as a careful
                    reader always faithful to the text itself, here is a counter-instance in which
                    he proves liberal, careless, mischievous with the text (readers can decide which
                    it is). And, for an even more striking example of this, I turn in closing to
                    what I consider the essay’s strangest moment: when Brooks considers the “little
                    town” and “green altar” of stanza four.</p>

            <head>IV. ‘A poignance beyond anything else’: Brooks’s Stranger</head>
            <p>William Empson complained of
                Brooks’s “anti-emotional bias” (<title level="a">Darling</title> 697), but there is none of that in
                Brooks’s admiring consideration of stanza four. Drawn to its “poignance beyond
                anything else in the poem” (97–98), Brooks is especially taken with the way that the
                fancied town in this stanza embodies his notion of rural “communal life” (96), its
                “strange emptiness” implying a vanishing world whose culture was rural and organic,
                rather than urban and commercial. Though Keats “goes out of his way to leave us the
                widest possible option in locating” the town&#8212;“It may be a mountain town, or a river
                town, or a tiny seaport”&#8212;its “essential character” is clear enough to him:
                <quote>
                it is small, it is quiet, its people
                are knit together as an organic whole, and on a ‘pious morn’ such as this, its whole
                population has turned out to take part in the ritual…. [T]here is the suggestion
                that the little town is caught in a curve of the seashore, or nestled in a fold of
                the mountains&#8212;at any rate, is something secluded and something naturally related to
                its terrain. (97)
                </quote>
                Brooks’s description of this
                notional town, whose “people are knit together as an organic whole,” brings to mind
                the fading agricultural communities of the deep South, which the Agrarian polemics
                of <title level="m">I’ll Take My Stand</title> (1930) had idealized. He once argued
                that <title level="m">Light in August</title> could not survive a transplant “to the
                east side of Manhattan Island” because “community, in Faulkner’s sense, does not
                exist” there (<title level="a">Southern</title> 250). But it exists here in stanza four.</p>
            <p> Something quietly troubles Brooks
                about this stanza, though, and in an odd parenthesis, he admits to being puzzled by
                one of its lines, the line addressed to the abandoned town: “and not a soul to tell
                / Why thou art desolate, can ere return.” He solves his confusion by devising an
                anonymous stranger, a future visitor who has stumbled into the abandoned town, to
                stand in as the object of the line’s address: “(I can see no other interpretation of
                the line, ‘and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate can ere return’)” (98).
                William Empson would solve it differently, paraphrasing the line, instead, as
                addressed to the members of the procession: “none of them will ever go home again,
                so that their town will be mysteriously desolate” (<title level="m">Structure</title>
                369). Oddly, neither of these exemplary close readers, Brooks nor Empson, can abide
                an apostrophe to a merely hypothetical, empty locale; both are compelled to read the
                address as directed to <emph>somebody</emph>. But Brooks, unlike Empson,
                invents his human addressee, casually inserting the stray detail of this “stranger”
                into the poem:
                <quote>
                The little town which has been
                merely implied by the procession portrayed on the urn is endowed with a poignance
                beyond anything else in the poem. Its streets will ‘for evermore be silent,’ its
                desolation forever shrouded in a mystery. <emph>No one in the figured
                    procession will ever be able to go back to the town to break the silence there,
                    not even one to tell the stranger there why the town remains desolate.</emph>
                (97–98; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                Who is “the stranger there,” and
                where did he come from? However one reads the ode, <emph>there is no
                stranger there</emph>. Practically winking at his reader, Brooks adds: “If one
                attends closely to what Keats is doing here, he may easily come to feel that the
                poet is indulging himself in an ingenious fancy” (98).</p>
            <p> Of course it is the critic
                “indulging himself in an ingenious fancy,” inventing a human figure who mediates the
                affect, the “poignance,” of the town for the community of readers attending closely
                to Keats’s poem:
                <quote>
                The poet, by pretending to take the
                town as real&#8212;so real that he can imagine the effect of its silent streets upon the
                stranger who chances to come into it&#8212;has suggested in the most powerful way that he
                can its essential reality for him&#8212;<emph>and for us</emph>. It is a case of
                the doctor’s taking his own medicine: the poet is prepared to stand by the illusion
                of his own making. (101; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                Analysis has brought Brooks so far
                into the poem’s world, has made him so alive to its conjurings, that he and his
                fellow readers (now generously included in the consensual “us”) encounter this
                enigmatic wanderer on the little town’s silent streets as a real being, and enter
                into a “mythic history” of this fictional town that he calls “richer and more
                interesting than the history of actual cities” (98). Why does Brooks insert this
                stranger, an “illusion of his own making” (101)? Why insist on a human recipient of
                the speaker’s address, a human witness to the town’s poignancy, a human wonderer at
                its incomprehensible emptiness? Might the stranger be a figure for Brooks
                himself&#8212;the professional critic gazing longingly upon the Agrarian origins that he
                has since abandoned on the procession toward the green institutional altars of
                academe?</p>
            <p> Ruminating on this stranger’s
                presence can help us to understand why Keats’s Ode suits Brooks’s purpose in
                <title level="m">The Well Wrought Urn</title>. The poem may represent a free-standing
                aesthetic artifact, but this is finally less significant than the fact that it
                represents a <emph>reader</emph>, interrogating the urn to make human
                sense of it (see Wolfson 301–5, 317–28). By inventing this stranger, Brooks
                effectively duplicates the dramatic tableau of the poem as a whole. The stranger in
                an abandoned town&#8212;like the questioner of the urn and like the reader of the
                poem&#8212;wonders at a past that he cannot begin to comprehend. Moreover, that act of
                reading calls into existence a small community of <emph>other
                readers</emph>, who attend all at once to the same thing&#8212;to the urn, the pictures
                on its surface, and the conjurings beyond it. By becoming one of those readers
                ourselves, reading Brooks reading, we join this quasi-organic community. </p>
            <p> It is a dynamic that, for Brooks,
                bears a clear moral and social value. This is evident in his affection for the
                imaginary town as the lost site of a genuinely popular form of art. There are two
                ways of thinking about popular art: as an art of the people, which organically
                expresses the will of the community from which it emanates (this is the idealized
                sense of a socialist art that is so well-integrated into society that one ceases
                even to recognize it as art); and as an art that is artificially popularized by
                modern means (this is the vitiated sense of mainstream media and consumable mass
                entertainment). Brooks might accept that a genuinely and organically popular form of
                culture is no longer possible in a modern world, but he locates in close, collective
                reading an antidote to the enervating and commercial versions of popular culture. By
                turning Keats’s imaginary town into a version of the Southern agricultural idyll, he
                also reminds us of something that’s easy to forget in our disciplinary histories:
                that the Agrarian ethos that helped give rise to close reading lingers on in the
                nostalgic practices of modern literary studies, as a residual affect of that
                original ethos.</p>

            <head>V. ‘Distrust is healthy’: A Community of Readers</head>
            <p> In its idealized recuperation of
                this communal rapport, Brooks’s “agrarian anticapitalism”&#8212;Frederic Jameson’s phrase
                for “the early New Criticism” (374)&#8212;departs from the aestheticist anticapitalism of
                an avant-gardist like Adorno, for whom the purposelessness of the artwork is
                precisely its parody of means-end capitalism. As Adorno writes in his late
                fragmentary work, <title level="m">Aesthetic Theory</title>, the displacement of the
                artwork from its native soil allows for a salutary destruction of its
                meaningfulness. It falls “helplessly mute before the question ‘What’s it for?’”; its
                significance is its insignificance (121). For Adorno, it is when art is most visibly
                estranged from the social, paradoxically, that society most powerfully exerts
                itself. Brooks, on the other hand, evinces discomfort with “the strange emptiness of
                the little town,” insisting instead on a human “stranger” to serve as recipient for
                the poem’s apostrophe and as stand-in for the community of readers engaged with the
                poem. Where Adorno would argue that “only what exists for its own sake, without
                regard to those it is supposed to please, can fulfill its human end” (<title level="a">Valéry</title> 181),
                Brooksian analysis valorizes that human end. The “masochistic” project of
                “autonomous art,” Sianne Ngai argues in an essay on Adorno, is “an incessant,
                guilt-ridden meditation on its own social impotence” (843), but Brooks denies that
                impotence, viewing close reading as an activity imbued with social and moral value,
                in its potential for returning a less alienated relationship with the products of
                culture and, in an sense, with the community that those products stand in for.</p>
            <p>In 1949, Brooks went on a New Haven
                radio program, <title level="m">Yale Interprets the News</title>, to discuss “the
                difficulty of teaching literature to persons preoccupied by such mass information
                media as the movies.” He explained afterwards to a reporter: “Small wonder that the
                student sometimes feels that Shakespeare is dry and that modern poetry is
                incomprehensible&#8212;remember that he is unconsciously measuring both by popular
                entertainment” (<title level="a">Brooks Warns of Jeopardy to Education</title>). Such moments, in which
                Brooks registers a cultural polemical against popular consumer culture, are among
                the loudest notes in his corpus, and they speak to his deeply felt sense that
                something substantial was at stake in the direction of literary studies and the
                practice of close reading. They are hardly representative, however, of a critic
                whose main labors were the intensive and often playful analysis of literary texts,
                and the genial modeling of such analysis in the literature classroom. By the 1950s
                Brooks could jokingly refer to himself as “the monster” when introducing himself to
                a new group of students, aware of the distance between his radical reputation and
                genial demeanor:
                <quote>
            “I want to warn you, you’re in the hands of the monster now.” These words, delivered in
            the gentlest of border-state accents, were the first I ever heard Cleanth Brooks utter.
            The year was 1951, the setting was a Yale College classroom. I was a junior, and this
            was the opening session of Brooks’s class in modern poetry. (Gollin 257)
                </quote>
            This habit of self-deprecation belies the image of the cultural radical spearheading
                    a conservative revolution, while also indicating that the real revolution was
                    taking place more quietly, not in inflammatory claims about the dangers of
                    popular culture, but in the day-to-day work of a reading practice that was
                    simultaneously public and private.</p>
            <p>	We learn more about Brooks, and more about new-critical cultural politics in general,
                by carefully attending to this great bulk of his professional output. Brooks’s practice
                as a close reader is more complex than its reputation suggests; indeed as we have seen,
                it is sometimes downright bemusing, though to trace that bemusement can lead us quite
                unexpectedly to the center of his thought. By reading Brooks reading, we learn how to
                read some of his more extreme judgments as forays into the sensational and too-loud world
                of public language&#8212;necessary advertising for a reticent practice. And we might at
                the same time ponder the paradox at the end of <title level="a">Keats’ Sylvan Historian,</title>
                where he presents to readers (by this point a communal “we” encompassing teacher, student,
                and colleague), as the poem’s ultimate assertion, a “healthy” skepticism toward the
                free-standing statement&#8212;a “distrust” of the poem’s own words. He repeats the word four
                times in his essay’s final three sentences, culminating in a statement that might itself tease
                us out of thought: “Such a distrust is healthy. Keats’ sylvan historian, who is not above teasing
                us, exhibits such a distrust, and perhaps the point of what the sylvan historian ‘says’ is to
                confirm us in our distrust” (101). The danger, it seems, is not that students might <emph>dislike</emph>
                poetry, that they might find Shakespeare “dry” or Eliot “incomprehensible,” but that they might
                <emph>trust it</emph>,
                    rather than training in themselves a healthy attitude of resistance&#8212;not just
                    toward poetry, but toward all of the claims that culture, in its disparate
                    forms, makes on us.</p>
