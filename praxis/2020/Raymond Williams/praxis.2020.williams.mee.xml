                <p rend="noCount">The concept of "industrialism" was the antithesis of the idea of "culture" 
                    that ran through the work of Raymond Williams. I want to suggest that the dichotomy, which
                    remains remarkably durable even in his later work, represents a reductive account of
                    the complexities of the project of the Industrial Revolution at odds with the way
                    that cultural materialism in the hands of Williams was more generally alert to the
                    contradictions at work in relations between economic developments and cultural
                    forms. Williams on "industrialism" perpetuated the invisibility of the literary and
                    intellectual culture of manufacturing towns like Manchester in traditional Romantic
                    scholarship. This essay uses the method of later Williams against the more
                    "Romantic" Williams to give a sense of the way writing from within the Industrial
                    Revolution might be regarded as a key genre of the literature of the period, one
                    increasingly riven by contradictions between its aspirations towards human
                    flourishing and the emergence of a society of the machine.</p>

            <p>Christine MacLeod’s study of the early nineteenth-century struggle over the memory of
                the inventor James Watt identifies Raymond Williams with a "catastrophist" view of
                the Industrial Revolution (11). She sees Williams as the origin of a powerfully
                influential idea that "culture" in its modern sense(s) developed as the humane
                ethical alternative to industrial capitalism as an irreducible tragedy. "Nothing
                celebratory," writes MacLeod, of "‘the new industrial society’ emerges from beneath
                this condemnatory weight: it is crushed out of the record" (12). Certainly, in <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title> (1958), still probably his most widely
                read work, Williams did claim that culture in its modern sense "came into English
                thinking in the period . . . of the Industrial Revolution" (viii). Little wonder
                that the book is popular among Romanticists. Although his aim may have been to
                describe the evolution of this idea of "culture," rather than advocate it as an
                antidote to what he called "industrialism," the Industrial Revolution as a kind of
                fall recurs even in later works like <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>
                (1973) and <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977). The writing on
                "industrialism"—the term, tellingly enough, he adopted from Thomas Carlyle—often
                seems to elide contradictions that might provide the objects of an immanent
                critique. One does not have to celebrate "industrialism" to see that varieties of
                late eighteenth-century radicalism, for instance, had a complex dialectical
                relationship to nineteenth-century liberalism.</p>
            <p>My own current project concerns the "culture" of improvement in the manufacturing
                towns of the early phases of the Industrial Revolution, but not in any sense of the
                word understood by the "culture and society" tradition. Instead, I want to test the
                possibility of adapting post-Latourian network analysis to attempt a "redescription"
                of a phenomenon that ranged across the domains of literary, scientific, and
                technical invention, but without losing sight of emergent forms of domination
                (Latour 226). "Culture"—in the tradition MacLeod identifies with Williams—has tended
                to place itself <emph>outside</emph> these historical processes, but the
                cultural materialism of Williams’s later career lends itself to an immanent critique
                of contradictions revealed <emph>within</emph> them. Immanent critique, in
                the sense associated with the critical theory of Adorno and the Frankfurt School,
                operates by revealing "the contradictions of claim and context, to transform
                legitimations into emancipatory weapons" (Antonio 338). More than Adorno’s
                characteristic pessimism perhaps, or his Hegelian sense of totality, the later work
                of Williams may help provide an understanding of this culture of improvement as
                something more complicated than the objectivist reflection of epochal relations. It
                might be treated not as anterior to the development of industrial capitalism, nor
                without contradictions as it morphed into an aspect of the dominant culture, but
                instead as "part of the material social process itself" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 60). In this regard, the
                characteristic concern with immanence in Williams—at least in his later cultural
                materialist phase—helps navigate between the tendency to formalism in Bruno Latour’s
                network theory and the epochalism of late Marx (Jones).</p>
             <p>In a belated commentary on <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, Williams
                regretted its neglect of William Godwin because, he said, his book had been blind to
                English radicalism’s "insight—even if from a rather simplified rationalist point of
                view—that you could reform character by environment, that all kinds of error and
                injustice should be seen in a social perspective, and then also in its encounter
                with a more complex experience at the point where its formula broke down" (<title 
                    level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 123). The idea of the reform of
                character through environment was a key aspect of Industrial Enlightenment,<note 
                    place="foot" resp="editors">Mokyr (2009) and others who use the idea of
                                an "Industrial Enlightenment" have not tended to explore these
                                aspects of the technical thinking they see as part of a cultural
                                approach to the Industrial Revolution, but they underpinned ideas
                                about the reorganization of the workforce found in the Kennedy and
                                Baines Jr. texts discussed below.</note> not least in
                the elaboration of work-time discipline, but this thread was not followed by
                Williams. Instead his discussion took the now-familiar route of discussing state
                repression in the 1790s. Much of the literary and cultural criticism devoted to the
                Romantic period, including my own, has focused on this political story rather than
                on the Industrial Revolution’s materialist interest in reshaping human character.
                When the idea of industrial transformation as a kind of revolution started to appear
                in the 1820s, it was often to suggest that the Industrial Revolution represented a
                paradigm shift for the possibilities of human progress at least equal to the effects
                of French Revolution, and even the earlier transformative impact of print, often
                appropriating a language of reform from the 1790s in the process.</p>
            <p>This essay explores the usefulness of cultural materialism to assist with an account
                of this historical process, not least by drawing attention to the way it worked its
                way through networks formed in and between the industrial towns. Places like
                Manchester remain more or less invisible in the literary geography of
                Romantic-period scholarship. True, individuals associated with the region, including
                Anna Barbauld, her brother John Aikin, and their friend William Roscoe, are
                increasingly written about by scholars (James and Inkster; White). There is even a
                developed scholarship now on the literary productivity of the oppositional culture
                of Rational Dissent to which the trio above belonged, but this work rarely follows
                through on the way its values could transmute into forms of dark materialism within
                the historical process, freedom of enquiry turning into a resistance to curbs on
                industrial exploitation, and ideas of reshaping human character through reformed
                institutions producing instead "laboratories of virtue" (Meranze). My version of
                immanent critique contains a geographically literal understanding of the way that
                anxiety about and even criticism of industrialization emerged <emph>within</emph> 
                this networked territory (as well as beyond it). This development
                gives the sense of the ambiguities as a constitutive part of the "structure of
                feeling" articulated in relation to the lived experience within these locations,
                forms that remained "in solution," to use Williams’s characteristic metaphor. In his
                later use of his most famous phrase, where it usually appears as the plural
                "structures of feeling," Williams applies it to groups shaped into "cultural
                formations." As the editors of this volume point out in their <ref 
                    target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.intro.html">introduction</ref>,
                his previous emphasis on social experience in solution develops into a sense of "the
                complex relation of differentiated structures of feeling to differentiated classes"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 134). The formation I discuss
                in this essay only uneasily precipitated into something like liberal ideology,
                itself never without its ambiguities and contradictions, or into literary genres
                like the industrial novel, including Elizabeth Gaskell’s <title level="m">Mary
                    Barton</title> (1848), a novel deeply imbricated in the networks described here.
                Contrary to the binary of Romanticism and industrialism that implicitly informed <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title>, the more nuanced idea of structures of
                feeling found in late Williams allows us to see the writing that emerged in and
                around the Manchester cotton boom between 1780 and 1850 as part of a complicated
                relationship between residual, emergent, and dominant formations that developed as
                the middle class came to know—incompletely—its own power. My approach takes from
                Williams his sense of hegemony as something that needed to be "continually renewed,
                recreated, defended, and modified"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 112). The work of writing the
                "transpennine enlightenment" (Mee and Wilkes) as it territorialized a new domain of
                industrial progress was a practice that continually disclosed possibilities of
                resistance through its own unstable contradictions and conflicts.</p>

            <p>MacLeod’s judgment of Williams’s "catastrophism" draws on Stefan Collini’s account of
                the myth of the village laborer in the historiography of the British Left (11).
                Collini notes that in the 1940s and 50s Williams was trained as a tutor in the adult
                education ethos steeped in the idea of "culture" as a response to the economism
                associated with the Industrial Revolution and the tragic loss of communal village
                life (107–8). In <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, as Collini
                concedes, Williams positioned himself as "a trenchant critic of precisely that kind
                of ‘ruralist nostalgia’" (95). What he retained from his training was a tendency to
                identify the Industrial Revolution with the emergence of a new kind of society
                totally dominated by "industrialism": "His larger ambition was to extrapolate from
                the notion of culture as ‘a whole way of life’ to provide a more inclusive and
                enabling conception which would encompass forms of working-class organization and
                solidarity," Collini rightly notes, but "in so doing, he in effect tied the
                emergence of the concept of culture itself to the great rupture in English history
                which marked the arrival of a ‘new civilization’ at the end of the eighteenth
                century" (108). From this perspective, Williams’s lifelong struggle against
                abstraction in Marxist theory let itself down by losing a proper sense of
                contradictions within the society that produced "industrialism."</p>
            <p>A lack of curiosity about those contradictions that were immanent to "industrialism"
                was exacerbated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> by the structural
                decision to orchestrate key chapters around a series of "contrasts" (see the essays
                by Favret [link] and Gilmartin [link] in this volume). Although this strategy allows
                for some sense of the mutual implication of utilitarian and Romantic ways of
                thinking, the binaries obscured the complexities within the emergent power of the
                industrial classes. Williams later regretted his sense of the heroic status of
                figures like Edmund Burke and Carlyle, but, even then, reiterated his praise for
                Carlyle’s grasp of "fundamental changes within the labor process itself [and] the
                relations between human society and the non-human physical environment" (<title 
                    level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 105). In the original rather
                unsatisfactory chapter on <title level="a">The Romantic Artist</title> in <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "literature" is defined in terms of a critique 
                of economic rationalism in ways that understate, for instance, some of the political
                conservatism of this articulation in its time found in authors like Robert Southey
                (Connell 265–73). Furthermore, and more relevant to my argument here, Williams
                ignores critiques of economic rationalism from within the historical process he
                names "industrialism." <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, for all its
                skepticism about "ruralist nostalgia," retains a melancholy strain attached to the
                fate of the English village. There is an acknowledgement of progressive
                possibilities in the new urban experience, primarily identified for Williams with
                the emergence of the popular press and the spread of literacy, but this note very
                quickly modulates into a critique—quite right in itself—of Marxist celebrations of
                "mastery" over nature (<title level="m">Country</title> 37).</p>
            <p>To note the lack of any real engagement by Williams with the diversity of writing
                emerging from the manufacturing towns is not to dissent from this point about
                mastery over nature, but his chapter on "Change in the City" is instructive in terms
                of the blind spots noted by Collini and MacLeod. It appears to end by opening out to
                a sense of the vitality of urban change beyond London. Quoting percentage statistics
                for urban growth in the manufacturing towns between 1821 and 1841, Williams notes
                that they eclipsed London in the sheer rate of increase: "The industrial cities were
                something different again. Though still in their early stages they announced, even
                more decisively than the growth of capitals, the new character of the city and the
                new relations between city and country" (<title level="m">Country</title> 152). One
                might expect some account of the cultural aspects of this momentous change, but the
                next chapter, <title level="a">People of the City,</title> is focused on the old critical 
                chestnut of Dickens and London. The closest Williams ever really gets to engaging with the
                cultural side of "industrialism" is in his various treatments of Elizabeth Gaskell,
                but these never really progressed beyond his sense of "the intensity of the effort
                to record, in its own terms, the feel of everyday life in the working-class homes"
                (<title level="m">Culture</title> 121). Collini (108n38) finds it
                telling that Williams chose William Cobbett and his attacks on the "Seigneurs of the
                Twist, sovereigns of the Spinning Jenny, great Yeoman of the Yarn" as his author for
                the influential Past Masters series (qtd. in Williams, <title 
                    level="m">Cobbett</title> 37). One implication of this choice is that within the emergent
                formation of "industrialism," to modulate MacLeod’s claim, there seems to be nothing
                that could be called "culture." In this regard, Williams would seem to come close to
                the kind of "‘epochal’ analysis" that
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> very deliberately
                distinguished from his later cultural materialism (121). Against epochal analysis,
                my aim is to develop recent network theory’s concern with "the pattern of recurring
                links," both interpersonal and across "institutional organizations," most obviously
                here the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (DeLanda 56, 66). I map a
                conflicted territory of improvement that shaped an emergent voice of opposition to
                aristocratic hegemony and fed directly, not least via the conflicts within the
                constituency of Protestant Dissent, into contradictions of the kind Williams hinted
                at in his analyses of Gaskell’s fiction.</p>
            <p>Many of the figures mentioned in the final section of my essay played a role in the
                struggle to have James Watt commemorated in Westminster Abbey, a struggle—finally
                successful in 1834—that MacLeod identifies with the articulation of a middle-class
                identity very different to the account of the national imaginary in Linda Colley’s
                <title level="m">Britons</title> (1992). Colley sees two decades of war confirming
                the grasp of an aristocratic elite on power, especially consolidated around the
                figure of the Duke of Wellington (MacLeod 92). The contrast between Watt, as a hero
                of invention, and Wellington was a key aspect of "culture" in the Romantic period
                that finds no place in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. Nor is it much
                discernible anywhere in the many literary studies of the 1810s and 20s. The complex
                structure of feeling that gave affective power to the campaign to install Watt’s
                statue in Westminster Abbey is not reducible to "industrialism," as, for instance,
                MacLeod’s account of the role of working-class agitation on the matter shows. My own
                account here doesn’t pursue this particular aspect of the campaign, but instead
                looks at the emergent insurgency against aristocratic hegemony that in its earlier
                formulations took "invention" to be a quality common to the poet and the engineer.
                My next section looks at this idea in relation to John Aikin’s account of the
                transpennine enlightenment in the region around Manchester.</p>

            <div type="section">
            <head>John Aikin in the Transpennine Enlightenment</head>
            <p>John Aikin’s <title level="m">Description of the Country for Thirty to Forty Miles
                    round Manchester</title> (1795) was published two years into Britain’s war against
                revolutionary France, but it was devised earlier, as a published call for
                subscriptions from 1793 indicates (<title level="m">Proposals</title>). This dating
                matters, as it suggests that Aikin’s project originated in a period when an optimism
                about general improvement was more sustainable than after the political polarization
                of the war years had bitten more deeply, only a few years later. MacLeod sees in
                Aikin and in his collaborations with his sister, Anna Barbauld, the emergence of a
                structure of feeling that precipitated around the figure of Watt (166, 170).
                Certainly, Aikin’s <title level="m">Description of Manchester</title> retained an
                authority for later texts much closer to the ideology of "industrialism" as defined
                by Williams, like Edward Baines Jr.’s <title level="m">A History of the Cotton
                    Manufactures</title> (1835), although even there the dark turn in the transpennine
                enlightenment was not without its contradictions. More striking, perhaps, is the
                fact Aikin’s book made its way into first volume of Marx’s <title 
                    level="m">Capital</title> (1867), probably via the intimate knowledge Engels had 
                of the antinomies of Manchester liberalism (Seed 20). The copy Marx used is still on
                display in the window seat of Cheetham’s Library in Manchester where he worked on
                <title level="m">Capital</title>.</p>
            <p> Marx used Aikin’s book in his account of the transition in the social life of the
                manufacturing classes between what Marx called the "age of manufactures" and "modern
                capitalism":
            <quote>Even in the early part of the 18th century, a Manchester manufacturer, who placed a
                pint of foreign wine before his guests, exposed himself to the remarks and
                headshaking of all his neighbors. Before the rise of machinery, a manufacturer’s
                evening expenditure at the public house where they all met, never exceeded sixpence
                for a glass of punch, and a penny for a screw of tobacco. It was not till 1758, and
                this marks an epoch, that a person actually engaged in business was seen with an
                equipage of his own. "The fourth period," the last 30 years of the 18th century, "is
                that in which expense and luxury have made great progress, and was supported by a
                trade extended by means of riders and factors through every part of Europe." (Marx
                594–95; the phrases in quotation marks are from Aikin, <title 
                    level="m">Description</title> 182)</quote>
              Marx makes the "rise of machinery" the basis for the transformation of social life of
                the middle classes. He quickly moves to describe that transformation in terms of a
                will to capital accumulation:
            <quote>Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets! "Industry furnishes the
                material which saving accumulates." Therefore, save, save, <emph>i.e.</emph>, 
                reconvert the greatest possible portion of
                surplus-value, or surplus-product into capital! Accumulation for accumulation’s
                sake, production for production’s sake: by this formula classical economy expressed
                the historical mission of the bourgeoisie, and did not for a single instant deceive
                itself over the birth-throes of wealth. (595)</quote>
               Here is the "industrialism" of Williams, but what Marx doesn’t quite do is identify
                Aikin with this epochal gospel. Rather, he suggests that Aikin inhabits a
                qualitatively different space and time: "What would the good Dr. Aikin say if he
                could rise from his grave and see the Manchester of today?" (595).</p>
            <p>Aikin is now primarily remembered as Barbauld’s brother. They collaborated on
                various literary and educational projects, but he could hardly be claimed as an
                advocate of "culture" in any binary opposition to "industrialism." <title 
                    level="m">A Description of Manchester</title> is explicitly a celebration of the development
                of the Manchester textile industry and the spirit of technical innovation he saw in
                it, "absolutely unparalleled in the annals of trading nations" (3), but in a way
                that subscribed to a practical project of "improvement" that did not define these
                developments as at odds with an idea of "genius" incorporating forms of artistic
                endeavor. Although the cotton manufactures provide the putative focus of Aikin’s
                volume, it is transport and communications that really seem to fire his imagination.
                Canals, bridges, and aqueducts loom large as media of "internal communication"
                (117), not least because they had allowed information for his volume to reach him in
                London from across the region. Freedom of communication is a key refrain of the
                book, whether of technical innovations or a more general circulation of knowledge.
                Suspicious of court and aristocracy, the volume downplays the region’s old families
                and big houses. Aikin was certainly invested in the idea of the flat network
                promoting the circulation of commerce in goods and ideas against inherited vertical
                hierarchies. Where he differed from the accounts of this phenomenon given recently
                by economic historians like Margaret Jacob and Joel Mokyr, discussed below, was in
                his reservations about the moral implications of the capital accumulation Marx saw
                as powering the rise of machinery. Nor was Aikin comfortable with the idea of his
                communication network as mastery over nature.</p>
            <p>He could sound visionary when it came to hymning this system of improvement:
                "Manchester is, as it were, the heart of this vast system, the circulating branches
                of which spread all around it" (<title level="m">Description</title> 3). His maps of
                the area—with their emphasis on vein-like roads, canals, and bridges—translate the
                geographical space around Manchester into the pumping heart of a renovated body
                politic. Given his wider political and religious affiliations in the 1790s, there
                seems a covert validation of middle-class values against the entrenched interests of
                London. In his political writing from this period, this tendency was much more
                explicit: "<emph>the middle class</emph>," he insisted in his <title 
                    level="m">Address to the Dissidents of England</title> (1790), published after
                the failure to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, were "the most virtuous, the
                most enlightened, the most independent part of the community" (18). "If this nation
                is ever to improve," he insisted, "or even if it is to retain, the freedom it
                possesses, to this class alone must it be indebted for the blessing," but this
                middle-class radicalism is only a muted presence in the Manchester book (<title 
                    level="m">Address</title> 18). His private correspondence, edited by his
                daughter Lucy, show that various colleagues from the area had warned him against
                writing about his political opinions too explicitly (L. Aikin 159–60). Criticism of
                the slave trade and its role in the affluence of Liverpool was also relatively muted
                (<title level="m">Description</title> 339), a factor picked up in another of
                Marx’s references to Aikin’s book (Marx 759).</p>
            <p>In his account of Manchester, Aikin particularly celebrated "the wonderful
                self-instructed genius" James Brindley’s role in the construction of the Duke of
                Bridgewater’s canal as an example of "true <emph>inspiration</emph>, which
                poets have almost exclusively arrogated to themselves, but which men of original
                genius in every walk are actuated by, when from the operation of the mind acting
                upon itself, without the intrusion of foreign notions, they create and invent" (<title 
                    level="m">Description</title> 112, 144). The judgment may sound like the
                displacement of humanistic values by useful knowledge, but to say only this much
                would underestimate Aikin’s concern with literary culture, broadly understood,
                witnessed, for instance, by his collaborations with his sister and his own volume of
                poetry published in 1791 by Joseph Johnson. Aikin was part of an important early
                formation associated with the Dissenters at Warrington Academy, where he was
                educated and his father was a tutor. This cultural formation celebrated commercial
                exchange, because it was seen as the underpinning of moral and cultural improvement,
                but he also worried that it might undermine these benefits though narrow pursuit of
                the profit motive. Like his friend the Liverpool banker and poet William Roscoe, who
                in the late 1780s gave a paper on the relative values of the arts and sciences at
                the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, an institution to which I’ll
                return, Aikin was alarmed at the idea of commercial self-interest breaking free from
                ideas of the public good. These reservations surface even in the paean to Brindley,
                who he described as an "enthusiast" for valuing technical innovation above the
                natural beauties of the rivers he built over: "the triumph of art over nature,"
                Aikin suggested, "led him to view with a sort of contempt the winding stream, in
                which the lover of natural beauty delights" (<title level="m">Description</title>
                141). Against the notion of innovation as the product of mind acting upon itself,
                Aikin tended towards an idea of genius as a social process that ought, at least, to
                be oriented towards the general good rather than profit. Later his weighty <title 
                    level="m">General Biography</title> (1799–1815) insisted on a meritocratic idea
                of genius that emphasized literature, technology, and science at the expense of
                martial heroism. When it came to the sources of "genius," its preface argued, there
                could be no "precise line" between "invention and improvement": all the "great
                discoveries," Aikin argued, are the product of "gradual advances given to them by
                successive improvers" (3–4). From this kind of perspective, ideas of individual
                genius were in a complex loop with an understanding of society and of the mind, not
                to mention roads, bridges, and canals, as material assemblages directed towards the
                public good.</p>
             <p>Aikin’s <title level="m">Description</title> was itself a material product of the
                networks he celebrated in that its information was gathered by informants from
                across the region. Among the key contributors to the volume, acknowledged by Aikin,
                was his friend Thomas Percival. Another literary physician, whose children’s books
                were also published by Joseph Johnson (himself originally from Liverpool), Percival
                had been publishing on the medical effects of the new factories and contributed this
                data, among other things, to Aikin’s volume (<title level="m">Description</title>
                 219–20; cited in Marx 759). <title level="m">A Description of Manchester</title>
                explicitly praised another example of the region’s collaborative enterprise in the
                form of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Founded by Percival in
                1781 with others associated with the Warrington Academy, including the
                chemist-apothecary Thomas Henry and the Unitarian clergyman Thomas Barnes, Aikin
                himself was vigorously involved from early on and contributed papers to the society
                even after he had left the region, including one—read in 1791—on the effect of
                reality in dramatic representations.</p>
            <p>Historians of science have long debated the role of the Literary and Philosophical
                Society in the Industrial Revolution. For some scholars, it was understood fairly
                straightforwardly as a kind of think tank where scientific ideas were circulated
                among men of business for application in Manchester’s textile industry. In the 1970s
                an alternative perspective began to read the society’s role more in terms of the
                developing self-image of the middle classes. At the forefront here were Roy Porter
                and, especially, a classic essay by Arnold Thackeray on the "Manchester model" that
                effectively read the society as the cultural arm of Marx’s "historical mission of
                the bourgeoisie." Although Porter called for scholarship to pay attention to the
                word "literary" in the title of the society (25), his account was largely concerned
                with science as a form of cultural expression: the society was a means by which the
                rising middle classes performed their cultural hegemony through institutions of
                politeness. Thackray understood the literary and scientific interests of the society
                as primarily "ornamental": effectively an epiphenomenal institutional superstructure
                to a socioeconomic base.</p>
            <p>It need hardly be said that any approach indebted to the cultural materialism of
                Williams is not likely to find this functionalist account sufficient. Writing from a
                very different perspective, the recent work of Margaret Jacob and Joel Mokyr avoid
                the class determinism of Porter and Thackray to return to a revamped version of the
                older model that closely linked the domains of scientific knowledge and technical
                innovation. Jacob and Mokyr make the development of the "first knowledge economy"
                the key factor in the early period of the Industrial Revolution. The contemporary
                European appetite for "useful knowledge" is decisive for them, refined by a broader
                Enlightenment faith in progress and commitment to dissemination that ensured that
                the rage for invention was sustained and developed. In their narratives of economic
                growth, networks and cultural institutions do play an important role. Although
                neither see the knowledge economy as a democratic event, they do represent it as
                sustained by relatively marginal figures constellated into flat networks committed
                to the distribution of useful knowledge. In this regard, their work shows some
                overlaps with Bruno Latour’s network theory, even if the references to his work in
                Mokyr’s <title level="m">Gifts of Athena</title> are somewhat wary (61, 63). Jacob and
                Mokyr might well regard my own account as a Latourian redescription too far, but
                their work does retain a role for culture as the domain of these networks, including
                the odd mention, in Jacob’s case at least (105), of the importance of the "liberal
                arts" in the early years of the Manchester society. More generally, though, neither
                allows much of a role for the "literary" in sustaining even the idea of progress.
                Not that the domain of literary studies, for its part, has ever really taken up the
                challenge of thinking about the role of the "literary" in this territory,
                unsurprisingly since the disciplinary authority of the category of Romanticism,
                mediated in part by heavily partisan contemporaries like Thomas De Quincey,
                explicitly defined its keys terms—especially "genius" and "imagination"—against the
                role of networks and related institutions in literary production (Klancher 28–29).
                I’ll return to De Quincey, who grew up in the circles of the Literary and
                Philosophical Society, briefly at the end of this essay.</p>
            <p>The knowledge economy described by Jacob and Mokyr was rather more conflicted than
                their account of flows of information around flat networks implies. Nor was it as
                unambiguously committed to capital accumulation. In order to develop the point, I
                will concentrate on a particular strain of debate concerned with philosophical
                materialism and relations between mind, matter, and machine that came out of the
                Manchester society. These debates were an immanent part of the complex process
                connecting Aikin’s golden vision of Manchester to the dreadful conditions described
                by Marx in <title level="m">Capital</title> as the outcome of the gospel of capital
                accumulation. Part of the dialogue between scientific and literary matters at the
                Manchester society in the 1780s and early 90s were topics like imagination, taste,
                and genius. Recent studies in Romanticism, at least since Alan Richardson’s <title 
                    level="m">British Romanticism and the Science of the Mind</title> (2001), have
                shown a renewed interest in such topics from a materialist perspective, but usually
                in ways that take the intellectual and literary issues out of the domain of changes
                in modes of production. Such issues were a hot topic in in places like Manchester,
                because, more than anywhere else, they revealed the possibilities of reshaping
                biological life through manipulation of the material environment, not least via the
                elaboration of work-time discipline. Perhaps the most obvious early example of the
                region’s interest in these issues were John Howard’s prison reforms, on which he had
                worked with Aikin—whom he also chose as his biographer—at the Warrington Academy (L.
                Aikin 63). Those reforms, which produced concrete changes to the architecture of
                prisons, and eventually, factories, were centered on emancipation from various forms
                of corporeal punishment associated with an unreformed aristocratic order, but the
                ideas of prisons as "laboratories of virtue," to use Meranze’s phrase in its
                original penal context, were to have their part in the dialectic of Enlightenment as
                the darker consequences of the new penitentiary system emerged.</p>
            <p>In the 1780s and early 90s, though, what was constantly being fought over in the
                Manchester society was the extent to which the material processes of the body could
                entirely account for taste, imagination, and the principle of life itself. It was a
                topic at the heart of Aikin’s paper to the society on the reality of dramatic
                performances, for instance, but it became fraught in the debate on materialism
                between Thomas Cooper and his friend John Ferriar, on the one hand, and Thomas
                Barnes, on the other. In a paper given at the Manchester society in 1783, <title 
                    level="a">On the Influence of the Imagination and the Passions upon Our 
                    Understanding,</title> Barnes had
                argued for a view of imagination as one of several mental modes that together made
                up the mind as—following Joseph Priestley here—"ONE UNCOMPOUNDED ESSENCE" (377).
                Cooper thought that the idea of different modes in one essence nonsensical: an
                attempt to preserve a place for "spirit" within the universe of Priestley’s <title 
                    level="m">Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit</title> (1777). In his rebuttal of
                Barnes at the society, published as <title level="a">Sketch of the Controversy on 
                    Materialism</title> in his <title level="m">Tracts</title> (1789), Cooper insisted on 
                the familiar materialist position that the source of life was organization acted upon by external
                stimulation. Cooper was supported by another literary physician, John Ferriar, in
                his attack on modern species of "immaterialism," as they both called it. Ferriar was
                working with Cooper and Percival at the time on wresting control of the Manchester
                infirmary from an entrenched Tory elite (Pickstone 406). Ferriar’s <title level="a">Observations
                Concerning the Vital Principle</title> condemned the vitalism of the Scottish physicians
                John Hunter and Alexander Monro as a throwback to Platonism, but then followed up
                with a paper that rallied his friend Cooper for the mechanism of his version of
                materialism.</p>
            <p>On the face of it, this Manchester debate anticipates the later dispute between John
                Abernethy and William Lawrence now routinely adduced as a context for Mary Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an 
                    account of the Abernethy-Lawrence controversy, see Jacyna, whose survey omits 
                    any mention of the controversy in Manchester.</note> Cooper’s position is
                much like Lawrence’s materialism, but Ferriar’s position is harder to describe as he
                attacked both Abernethy’s hero John Hunter and distanced himself from Cooper’s
                certainty that the brain is the mind. The debate in Manchester was three-cornered
                and harder to read than the dispute between Abernethy and Lawrence. Where it did
                anticipate the later dispute was in the way it was picked up at the national level
                in terms of an ideological binary. The dispute—couched in amiable terms between
                Cooper and Ferriar themselves—was quickly seized upon by the anti-Jacobin campaign
                against "French" materialism. Cooper was its target: he had been named in Parliament
                by Burke for attending the Jacobin Club in Paris, but the debate also made waves in
                its own more sympathetic constituency of Rational Dissent. Hannah Lightbody’s diary
                for February 1788 contains an account of a tea-table discussion of "the dispute
                between Mr. Cooper and Dr. Barnes on Materialism" (14). A few days later her mentor,
                the literary physician James Currie—an honorary member at the Manchester society,
                later famous as the editor and biographer of Burns—restaged the dispute with "a very
                liberal defender of [Cooper’s] doctrine" (23). Hannah Lightbody later moved from
                Liverpool to Manchester and married the millowner Samuel Greg. She had encouraged
                her future husband to worship at a new Unitarian chapel in Mosley Street in
                competition with Barnes’s at Cross Street (Sekers 80). The new
                chapel adopted a liturgy created by Lightbody’s own minister in Liverpool.
                Priestley, who thought it more properly Unitarian, preached at the new chapel in
                1791, and mocked Barnes’s jealousy at its success
                (<title level="m">Life</title> 35, 109). Where these disputes
                about religious forms intersect with the debates on materialism is that the new
                liturgy more clearly parsed Priestley’s monism (which Barnes played down in his
                paper to the Manchester society to Cooper’s disgust). Debates around materialism and
                related doctrinal differences indicate some of the fractures forming around the
                doctrine of materialism in these networks. They also suggest something of what is
                lost in "epochal" accounts of the emergence of middle-class ideology. Attending in
                descriptive detail to the formation of networks in a Latourian manner coincides in
                this regard with the critique of the assumption that the social is "always formed"
                in the later work of Williams
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). Williams denies dominant
                forms ever exhaust "<emph>all human practice, human energy, and human
                    intention</emph>" (125). Redescribing the networks around Manchester can provide a
                sense of "new meanings and values, new practices, new relationships and kinds of
                relationships being created," in ways encouraged by his later cultural materialism,
                while still attending to emergent forms of domination (Williams, <title 
                    level="m">Marxism</title> 123).</p>

                must be "Three around Farnham," which brings together the unlikely trio of Jane
                Austen, William Cobbett, and Gilbert White on the basis of their shared proximity to
                the leafy Surrey town (see the essays by <ref

                    this volume). The choice of writers and location—in the rural home counties—is strange
                given the decisive role that Williams gives to the Industrial Revolution in his
                larger argument, but <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> is suffused
                with a sympathy for "a precarious rural-intellectual radicalism: genuinely and
                actively hostile to industrialism and capitalism; opposed to commercialism and to
                the exploitation of environment; attached to country ways and feelings, the
                literature and the lore" (36). In this final section of my essay, I attempt a
                playful rewriting of the Williams trope that takes the Manchester cotton industry
                and the region territorialized by Aikin’s text as its locus. Selective and sketchy
                my account must be, but placing these writers—Robert Owen, Hannah Greg, John
                Kennedy, John Phillips Kay, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Thomas De Quincey—in relation to
                each other around industrial Manchester helps reveal the tensions and contradictions
                that emerged from within the structures of feeling to be found in <title level="m">A 
                    Description of Manchester</title>.</p>
            <p>Literary scholarship frequently identifies the industrial novel as the place where
                these contradictions emerged most glaringly, as Williams effectively does in <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title>, but Gaskell’s fiction inhabits the
                networked territory that produced Aikin’s book, with some of its contradictions only
                more apparent. As the biographer of Gaskell’s early life has revealed in great
                detail, she was a belated member of the networks that surrounded the Manchester
                Literary and Philosophical Society, including Hannah Lightbody Greg’s circle, and
                even lived in the house of the founder of its offshoot society in Newcastle, the
                Unitarian minister William Turner II, before her marriage (Chapple 351–70). As a
                child, Turner had been the dedicatee and recipient of an early poem of
                Barbauld’s—<title level="a">Verses Written in the Leaves of an Ivory 
                    Pocketbook</title>—inscribed on a
                tablet. The poem has recently been read as a trope for the materialist psychology of
                these groups and their educational interests in the role of environment in shaping
                character (Wharton 31–33). In this regard, Turner stands as a link between the early
                and late phases in the evolution of this distinctive structure of feeling towards a
                broader cultural formation within middle-class liberalism: his career in many ways
                confirms the script written for him in Barbauld’s poem, not least in his
                encouragement of her interest in literary, scientific, and social issues in his
                daughter Mary Turner and in Gaskell.</p>
            <p>I’ve already noted that celebrations of Priestley and associated branches of
                materialism have become a salient part of contemporary Romantic studies,<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Richardson, Wharton, White and others have
                                made significant contributions to this scholarship, which usually

                directed—implicitly or explicitly—against traditional accounts of the
                "Romantic Artist." The progressive aspects of these formations morphed into
                altogether darker shapes across a generation. This claim does not mean that this
                dark materialism always existed as the real meaning of this historical process. It
                certainly fed into versions of work-time discipline found in John Kennedy, and even
                into the parallelograms of paupers associated with Robert Owen, but what also
                remained was a hankering after the emancipatory promise of the project of
                improvement that might be described as residual. Perhaps this is nowhere more
                obvious than in the case of Robert Owen, whose participation in the debates on
                materialism at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society is a routinely
                ignored part of his intellectual formation. By the account in his own <title 
                    level="m">Life of Robert Owen</title> (1857), which is not entirely reliable,
                Owen was encouraged into the Manchester society because of his knowledge of the new
                industrial processes, but there are plenty of signs that he also engaged with its
                debates on philosophical materialism, not least his amusing account of a feisty
                encounter with Ferriar in a debate on "genius" which left the doctor blushing (37).
                Even prior to joining the Manchester society, Owen had been part of a small debating
                club where his friends had dubbed him "the reasoning machine—because they said I
                made man a mere reasoning machine made to be so by nature and society" (36). His
                dispute with Ferriar probably revolved around the doctor’s resistance to the
                mechanical determinism of Owen’s version of materialism glimpsed in these comments.
                None of the papers Owen gave at the Literary and Philosophical Society have
                survived, but a record of their titles exists (Fraser 37–38). They suggest there is
                some truth to Owen’s claims of a lifelong consistency to his belief in the doctrine
                of circumstance: <title level="a">Remarks on the Improvement of the 
                    Cotton Trade</title> (November 1794); <title level="a">The Utility of 
                        Learning</title> (December 1794); <title level="a">Thoughts on the Connection 
                            between Universal Happiness and Practical Mechanics</title> (March 
                1795); <title level="a">On the Origin of Opinions, with a View to the Improvement of 
                    Social Virtues</title> (January 1796). There
                seems a remarkable series here from practical industrial issues to questions of
                social virtue.</p>
             <p>These ideas were elaborated in his time at New Lanark, outside Glasgow, into <title 
                 level="m">A New View of Society</title> (1813) described by Williams in <title 
                     level="m">Culture and Society</title> as "low rationalism" in their "social
                engineering," but "innovating in their humanity and kindness" (44–45). Williams
                didn’t notice the relation to the contradictions within the structure of feeling of
                Manchester materialism. In <title level="m">A New View of Society</title>, Owen
                addressed the cotton manufactures on behalf of the "vital machines" they neglected
                in favor of the "inanimate machines" (5). His metaphor of "vital machines" suggests
                the persistence of a version of materialism closer to Cooper’s mechanistic
                determinism than, for instance, Ferriar’s idea of genius. Certainly, the mechanistic
                aspects of Owen’s thinking—its "low rationalism"—remained in force even as his ideas
                more generally developed towards the abolition of private property. Like the
                reformed prisons encouraged by Howard’s plans, Owen’s utopian factory settlements
                were "laboratories of virtue" that continued to manifest contradictions between the
                promise of human emancipation and definitions of life in terms of productive
                efficiency. Early on, at least, they attracted manufacturers who saw them as
                remodeling factory discipline on a benign basis. Hannah Greg encouraged her husband
                to introduce them to their colony mill at Quarry Bank, but he distrusted Owen
                (Sekers 167–68). Samuel Greg was probably wary of Owen’s irreligion based on their
                time together in Manchester’s textile industry and as members of the Literary and
                Philosophical Society. Of course, as Hazlitt predicted when he first reviewed <title 
                    level="m">A New View of Society</title>, once Owen’s ideas developed towards a
                critique of private property, what support there was among factory owners
                evaporated, but even then, in Owen’s later utopian experiments, there remained a
                sense that the productive machine was a key measure of his ambitions for human being
                (Morris 122).</p>
            <p>Owen’s position on the machine, especially the steam engine, took it to be a social
                evil primarily in so far as it encouraged capital accumulation into fewer hands and
                debased human labor into an easily expendable commodity. His ideas emerged onto the
                national stage at a period in the 1810s when Manchester’s manufacturers were also
                starting to think more broadly about the social effects of improvement, partly in
                response to calls for Parliament to intervene in the factory system on the questions
                of child labour and long hours. In 1815, the Manchester society hosted a paper from
                one of the town’s largest manufacturers, John Kennedy, who had
                worked with Owen there in the early 1790s (Owen 26). Kennedy’s <title 
                    level="a">Observations on the
                Rise and Progress of the Cotton Trade</title> acknowledged the dangers of social
                dislocation in bringing workers from the country to the city, but presented
                work-time discipline as a compensation that offered a new punctual form of being.
                Margaret Jacob has recently used Kennedy as an example of the capitalist motivated
                by technical knowledge as much as by profit, but his paper isn’t so much about
                applied science as it is about forms of social being emerging from the new
                industrial process. This double vision, not entirely squared off in Kennedy’s paper,
                marks his place in a period of transition, as does his rejection of Malthus in his
                defense of poor relief in the next paper he gave to the society. Kennedy’s position
                has at least partly to do the maintenance of a pool of already-disciplined labour to
                await the recovery of the trade cycle, but there is enough revulsion at Malthus’s
                iron laws of nature to suggest the retention of Aikin’s moral vision of improvement
                from a manufacturer who still worshipped—with Hannah Greg and her husband—at the
                Unitarian chapel Priestley had visited back in 1791.</p>
            <p>Kennedy’s first paper was advocating a future in many ways yet to come as well as
                redescribing the improvements celebrated in Aikin’s book. Kennedy praised the steam
                engine for allowing power to be taken into the towns—"instead of carrying people to
                the power, it was preferable to place the power among the people"—but the battle
                between water and steam was not to be decided for several decades, as Andreas Malm
                has shown (Kennedy <title level="a">Observations,</title> 15–16; Malm 148). Kennedy 
                presented the triumph of steam as the inevitable outcome of an internal logic of technical 
                progress that partially elides his own self-interest. His essay is a conspicuous example 
                of the "productive force" of writing as ‘"the application and development of a certain 
                body of social knowledge" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 91), not a simple reflection of
                changes in factory production, but actively contributing to a new kind of
                technodeterminism that justified "industrialism" as a necessary and inevitable part
                of an emancipatory project of modernity. The generic indeterminacy of Kennedy’s
                writing, neither technical in Jacob’s sense, nor quite the condition-of-England
                essay later associated with Carlyle, suggests its relationship to "social
                experiences in solution" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 242).</p>
            <p>By the time James Phillips Kay—another infirmary doctor—joined the Literary and
                Philosophical Society in 1829, the pressure on the manufacturing sector from working
                class organization and from Tory radicals had ratcheted up in ways that intensified
                a felt need to justify the narrative of "improvement" that Kennedy was adapting from
                Aikin. With Edward Baines Jr. and others in the region, Kay represented a vein of
                provincial opinion active in favour of political reform prior to 1832, but, unlike
                some middle-class radicals, one reluctant to interfere in the functioning of the
                factory system. First elaborated in a paper given to the society shortly before its
                publication, Kay’s <title level="m">Condition of the Working Classes</title> (1832)
                isolated the "social" as a specific zone of intervention in the name 
                of physical and moral health (Poovey 7). Early
                on in his pamphlet, Kay acknowledges the psychological and moral effects of the
                division of labour but quickly elides them in an attack on the moral contagion of
                Irish migration. This contagion, Kay suggests, has sapped the ability of the native
                workmen to manage the kind of transition to work-time discipline Kennedy described
                as the gift of the industrial system. A tendency towards abstraction described in
                Mary Poovey’s analysis of Kay’s "social body" looks like a reification of the
                medical materialism of the 1790s. Indeed, the medical historian John V. Pickstone
                contrasted Kay with Ferriar specifically around this issue of abstraction. Where
                Ferriar’s medical materialism operated with a sense of a biosphere inhabited by
                owners and workers alike, their fates necessarily entangled, Phillips Kay’s "social
                body" is a domain of observation and intervention for the scientific observer that
                comprised literacy, moral education, and domestic economy. This sphere was granted a
                position abstracted from the commercial system and its consequences, not unlike the
                position, structurally at least, "culture" occupies in the "Culture and Society"
                tradition, although rarely offering its working-class subjects the pleasures of the
                imaginative arts.</p>
            <p>Kay and his collaborators in the newly founded Manchester Statistical Society,
                Kennedy and the sons of Hannah and Samuel Greg among them, refused to concentrate on
                questions of production and employment—as government enquirers had asked—and focused
                their investigations into social poverty on religion and education. Earlier literary
                physicians, including Ferriar and Percival, had shown an interest in using data
                provided by parish records as the basis of social enquiry, but they did not shy away
                from a critique of the factory system. In the Statistical Society, Phillips Kay and
                his friends turned to methods of social quantification as part of a campaign against
                the reduction of working hours. Political economy was preserved as an inviolable
                separate sphere in the Statistical Society. Nevertheless, as Cullen pointed out,
                these categorical distinctions rarely survived unshaken their encounters with the
                suffering they proposed to solve (106–10). Raymond Williams once suggested that the
                Statistical Society was an institution that linked Gaskell with Engels (<title 
                    level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 116–17). Engels certainly admired—with
                reservations—Phillips Kay’s <title level="m">Condition of the Working Classes</title>
                and Gaskell mixed in the same Manchester intellectual milieu (Selleck 73, 272). In
                many ways, it ought to be regarded as a late intervention in a remarkable range of
                writing generated by medico-literary debates on materialism that emanated from the
                Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Questions about the origins of "life"
                and the fate of the body, especially the bodies of the urban poor, were given
                urgency on the front line where technological innovation was reshaping human being
                and the global ecology. They were not simply circulating knowledge across flat
                knowledge networks. These networks shaped and responded to questions about power,
                progress, and emergent forms of social life.</p>
            <p>Even towards the end of his career, Raymond Williams still read Romanticism as a form
                of resistance "to the socially repressive and intellectually mechanical forms of a
                new social order" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 50). Now, though, he gave more
                attention to the dangers of "a necessarily selective and self-defining area" aligned
                with "a metaphysics of subjectivity and the imaginative process"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 15). One influential statement
                of this "metaphysics" is to be found in Thomas De Quincey’s distinction between
                literatures of knowledge and literatures of power staked around a contrast between
                Watt’s steam engine and Wordsworth’s poetry (De Quincey 10:48). In one version, De
                Quincey traced his revelation of Wordsworth’s poetic power to a moment within the
                networks I have been describing (2:123–29). He contrasted the power of "connexion"
                wielded by the Roscoe circle with his own personal conversion experience. This
                foundation myth was implicitly reinforced in his autobiography by various sallies
                against the pretensions of Roscoe’s friend Thomas Percival. De Quincey’s selective
                definition of Wordsworth’s literary "power" involved the repression of debates
                about, for instance, medico-literary matters that would have made his binary look
                artificial, to say the least, especially in the context of the debates about
                literary genius described earlier. These received a late iteration in John Ferriar’s
                <title level="m">Essay towards a Theory of Apparitions</title> (1813). Ferriar’s
                idea of the imagination outlined there was materialist enough to provoke <title 
                    level="m">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> to declare its "decided
                anti-ferriarism" in the very issue it launched its famously scathing attack on Keats
                (<title level="a">Phantasmagoriana</title> 595). Ferriar’s essay has recently gained attention from
                scholars of Hogg and Scott (Faubert; Ferris 62–69). It deserves attention in its own
                right as part of the "forming and formative processes" of this period of transition
                into Marx’s machinery age (Wiliams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). In this spirit, as part of
                "the multiplicity of writing" (146), texts like Aikin’s <title level="m">Description 
                    of Manchester</title> and Phillips Kay’s <title level="m">Condition
                    of the Working Classes</title> might also repay analysis by Romanticists. Such
                analysis might reshape our understanding of terms like "literary" and "culture"
                beyond the definitions offered by the "Culture and Society" tradition. Attending to
                their development in this context might also tell us something about the "new spirit
                of capitalism" (Boltanski), its current investment in flat networks as productive
                and liberating products of modernity, and related narratives of the development of
                new forms of technology as the necessary future of the human being supposedly freed
                from its past.</p>
