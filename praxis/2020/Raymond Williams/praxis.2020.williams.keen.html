            <p class="noCount">This paper argues that if the tension between Raymond Williams’s inscription within
               many of the very cultural influences that his work was aimed at "clearing" and the
               critical scrutiny that he brought to bear on the historical sources of these limitations
               offered a compelling counterpoint to the strengths and the problems inherent in Romantic
               authors’ own stress on the primacy of lived experience in face of the hostile pressures
               of their day, his understanding of these authors as both a pioneering force in the
               development of new ideas about the role of culture and as cautionary examples of the
               dangerous tug of abstraction may well be more material than ever.</p>

               <p>I want to use this paper to explore what has always been a central paradox for me
                  about Raymond Williams’s work, and to consider how knowing more about the sources
                  and implications of the historical tensions at the heart of this paradox can help
                  to illuminate the intersection between our work as Romantic critics and broader debates
                  about the humanities today. On the one hand, Williams’s writing has been one of the
                  most fundamental influences on my own interest in the changing cultural landscape
                  of the Romantic period, and particularly, in the highly mediated and politically charged
                  struggles over the definition of literature that shaped this period in such memorable
                  and influential ways. On the other hand, I have never found his analyses of particular
                  Romantic authors helpful in ways that resonated with my work despite these larger
                  theoretical convergences. I can think of several reasons for this. Williams’s often-noted
                  preference for fiction and drama directed his attention more to the nineteenth and
                  early twentieth centuries (the worlds of Dickens and Hardy, Ibsen and Brecht), and
                  his inclination to formalist approaches diminished his interest in writing about the
                  intersections between debates about literature and the nitty-gritty world of political
                  struggles that writers such as E. P. Thompson focused on. It may also have had a lot
                  to do with generational differences, though ironically, this is primarily because
                  so much of Williams’s pioneering work has passed into mainstream thought as today’s
                  received wisdom. His analyses, which were usually limited to a few of the canonical
                  poets (mainly Wordsworth and Blake), are often rooted in largely unqualified references
                  to a "Romantic" mindset with the attendant set of implicit assumptions that so much
                  of the best work of the past few decades has been pushing back against. It isn’t that
                  these sorts of analyses are wrong, but as Williams had himself repeatedly argued about
                  the dangers of abstractions generally, they are reductive in ways that distort the
                  historical complexities of the era.</p>
               <p>So how to square these two sides of Williams’s work? Ironically, Williams’s own evolving
                  understanding of the legacy of the cultural dynamics of this period may provide the
                  best answer. As he argued most explicitly in later works such as <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, the Romantic period’s greatest impact may be the enduring influence of the shift
                  towards an ideology of the aesthetic marked by a "false attachment" to literature
                  and art as an autonomous realm, with the related set of assumptions about genius,
                  the imagination, and creativity, that supported this new way of thinking about aesthetic
                  value (43). The impact of this paradigm shift as a form of "abstraction" that alienated
                  literature and art from the stubborn complexities of lived experience (as controversial
                  as his insistence on that phrase has been) would mark his own thinking in fundamental
                  ways, but as he famously pointed out, this period also witnessed the emergence that
                  broader realm hailed as "culture" whose intellectual possibilities would ultimately
                  reinforce his self-reflexive commitment to charting the history of these dynamics
                  (<em>Marxism</em> 47).</p>
               <p>Williams’s awareness of both the theoretical limitations and the political cost of
                  aesthetic forms of abstraction (as well as his sympathetic understanding of the historical
                  pressures that produced them) <em>and</em> of the enabling critical potential of modern ideas of culture as a realm of theoretical
                  engagement helps to explain the paradox that I noted at the outset: in many ways,
                  Williams’s work was driven by his awareness of the vital importance of <em>unlearning</em> the inherited assumptions that had helped to shape his own canonical understanding
                  of literary history. It was, as he put it in the extensive interviews published as
                  <em>Politics and Letters</em>, "a clearing operation" aimed at jettisoning inherited but indefensible assumptions
                  in the hope that "once the ground has been cleared of the received idea of literature,
                  it will be possible to find certain new concepts that would allow for special emphases"
                  (335, 325). Both of these impulses (the commitment to unlearning outmoded assumptions
                  and the need to do so) can, as his own work has demonstrated, be traced back to these
                  contrapuntal developments which emerged in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                  centuries.</p>
               <p>The impact of this intervention was reinforced by the unflinchingly dialectical nature
                  of Williams’s work: it was animated by his abiding interest in knowing more about
                  how these historical dynamics could help him to respond to the political and cultural
                  pressures of his own day, and just as valuably, how a more clearly self-reflexive
                  awareness of his own critical position had shaped his understanding of this history
                  in the first place. If, as he insisted in the conclusion to <em>Culture and Society</em>, "the history of the idea of culture is a record of our reactions, in thought and
                  feeling, to the changed conditions of our modern life," it was equally true that "these,
                  in turn, are only understood within the context of our actions" (295).</p>
               <p>This process of unlearning or "clearing" was at the heart of the genealogical impulse
                  that defined early projects such as <em>Culture and Society</em>, which foregrounded a history of thinking about the phenomenon of culture that had
                  long remained virtually invisible precisely because it <em>was</em> so fundamental, but it also reflects the evolution of his approach as he moved from
                  what Williams himself described as the "first-stage radicalism" of his earlier work
                  towards the more rigorously skeptical perspective that would define his interest in
                  the idea of literature as an historically arbitrary category in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 110). The blind spots that are clearest in the uncritically canonical spirit of Williams’s
                  response to Romantic literature (as feminist critics have long pointed out, one would
                  never guess that there were any women writers in the period, apart from Jane Austen)
                  are themselves the best evidence of the extraordinary importance of this endeavor
                  to come to terms with the shaping influence of the long history of these disciplinary
                  formations and the aesthetic values that supported them.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The real value of understanding these developments in Williams’s work—both the deformations
                     that his work was aimed at "clearing" and the traces of his inscription within these
                     influences—may be the ways that they can in turn help us to think about the challenges
                     that we face in our own struggle to articulate the public value of the humanities
                     today and, like Williams, to bring this public role to bear on the broader political
                     struggles of our day. Williams’s 1984 <em>London Review of Books</em> essay on Georg Lukacs, published just four years before his death, was on one level
                     an eloquent if implicit reflection on many of these aspects of Williams’s own career.
                     Having praised Lukacs as "one of the more interesting and tolerable Marxist critics
                     of literature," Williams attributed his relative obscurity amongst British readers
                     to three principal causes: "the breadth of his learning and his relative freedom from
                     dogmatism"; his alignment with "an old and fruitless kind of Marxism" that was reminiscent
                     of Marxist theory’s "Stalinist phase"; and perhaps worst of all, his alignment with
                     "the ‘humanist fallacy’ in Western Marxism, in his reliance on notions of ‘man as
                     subject’ and more directly in his kind of socialism, which is more properly a ‘romantic
                     anti-capitalism’" (
                     “A Man”
                      14). As a leading proponent of the New Left, Williams was never in much danger of
                     being branded a Stalinist, but arguably, the other two factors might well help to
                     explain Williams’s own shifting stature within theoretical debates. During the heyday
                     of the theory wars when the most damning charge in graduate school was to be guilty
                     of residual humanism, exposed as being still in thrall to all of those ideological
                     forces that one <em>thought</em> one was resisting but apparently was not, Williams’s cultural materialism was overshadowed
                     by the theoretical interventions of French poststructuralists whose work offered an
                     uncompromising critique of humanist thought.

                              gradualist approach, may have been the most prominent of critical arguments that Williams’s
                              work had failed to absorb the important lessons of Marxists such as Louis Althusser,
                              whose work owed its prominence to its deft mixture of Lancanian insight about a radically
                              decentered subjectivity and its scientific claims for Marxism.</span></div>

                  <p>Arguably, this may have had as much to do with image as content. Being Welsh lacked
                     the allure of <em>avant-garde</em> radicalism at a time when being Parisian was an unspoken but crucial ingredient in
                     the cultural capital that was a major part of the attractions of theory on many North
                     American campuses. Being the son of a railway worker from a village called Pandy,
                     a few miles from the market town of Abergavenny, was no match for the <em>frisson</em> of Left Bank intellectualism. But as literary critics have become increasingly wary
                     of what Rita Felski has called "the hermeneutics of suspicion" and dubious of the
                     political upside of the zero-sum version of power implicit in Louis Althusser’s and
                     Michel Foucault’s arguments, which seemed to have thrown any possibility of agency
                     out with the humanist bathwater, Williams’s work has garnered renewed interest.

                  <p>Timothy Brennan, a leading voice within recent debates about globalization, has argued
                     over the course of several essays and books that Williams offers a crucial underacknowledged
                     voice within theoretical debates. Like Williams’s own discussion of Lukacs, Brennan
                     suggests that this may be partly because the extraordinary breadth of Williams’s intellectual
                     scope makes a proper level of engagement with his work especially challenging. As
                     Brennan argues, the "deceptively straightforward" style of Williams’s writing "at
                     the level of the sentence" is belied by the unique level of the challenges posed,
                     both by "the volumes of prior reading required to appreciate his range of reference,"
                     and perhaps even more dauntingly, by the "<em>symphonic</em>" nature of Williams’s work, which channels various currents of thought into a particular
                     argument in ways that make it "extraordinarily difficult to analyze the intricate
                     architecture of its individual components" (
                     “Running”
                      287).

                              a study whose particular approach exemplifies this "symphonic" style: "His work proliferates,
                              spiraling outwards, spun out at a level of complexity, and delivered in a relaxed
                              and knowing comprehensiveness, over the wide ambit of associations, imageries, feelings,
                              attitudes and cultural tics, until one comes to see the unresolved and constantly
                              morphing conflict between country and city as the primary contradiction of all social
                              life" (
                              “On the Image,”
                              38–39).</span></div>
                     </div> As Brennan points out, precisely because of this paradoxical blend of insights and
                     challenges, the influence of Williams’s work is most often felt in indirect or derivative
                     forms. In the opening page of <em>Wars of Position</em>, Brennan excoriates an academic (whom he politely leaves unnamed) who, having been
                     asked about her use of the phrase "structures of feeling," explained that she got
                     it from a book on Hollywood cinema without any apparent recognition of the fact that
                     it had been introduced and popularized by Williams (1). For Brennan, this personal
                     oversight matters because "higher stakes" are involved than a simple failure of attribution
                     (1).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The nature of these "higher stakes" becomes clearer in Brennan’s discussion of Edward
                  Said’s larger attack on the "abdication of responsibility" that characterized poststructuralist
                  theoretical debates (<em>Wars</em> 99). Said’s brand of discourse analysis in <em>Orientalism</em> has often invited assumptions about his debt to Foucault, but as Brennan points out,
                  Said’s sustained critique of the appeal of Foucault’s "flawed attitude to power,"
                  which "captivated not only Foucault himself but many of his readers" as a way of "justify[ing]
                  political quietism with sophisticated intellectualism," stands out especially strongly
                  when set against "the excitement Said has" when he discusses Williams’s work (qtd.
                  in Brennan, <em>Wars</em> 112, 111). This double sense of intellectual debt (theoretical and political) converged
                  in Said’s own call to "reconsider, reexamine, and reformulate the relevance of humanism"
                  as "a useable praxis for intellectuals and academics who want to know what they are
                  doing, what they are committed to as scholars, and who want also to connect these
                  principles to the world in which they live as citizens," particularly in a "turbulent
                  world . . . brimming over with belligerency, actual wars, and all kinds of terrorism"
                  (Said 6, 2).</p>
               <p>Said’s increasingly explicit call for a renewed form of radical humanism underscores
                  the larger importance of Williams’s earlier commitment to mapping out a history of
                  the idea of culture as it emerged "in the last decades of the eighteenth century,
                  and in the first half of the nineteenth century" as part of a broader shift in the
                  meaning of a constellation of words such as "<em>industry</em>, <em>democracy</em>, <em>class</em>, and <em>art</em>" that was driven by more fundamental changes "in our characteristic ways of thinking
                  about our common life: about our social, political and economic institutions; about
                  the purposes which these institutions are designed to embody; and about the relations
                  to these institutions and purposes of our activities in learning, education, and the
                  arts" (Williams, <em>Culture</em> xiii). Williams felt compelled to chart the impact of these earlier shifts in large
                  part because of the parallels he saw between the struggles of early nineteenth-century
                  thinkers for whom the idea of culture offered a powerful basis for resistance and
                  "the post-1945 crisis of belief and affiliation" that Williams himself was confronted
                  by as <em>Culture and Society</em> was taking shape. Understanding the challenges inherent in this earlier epoch that
                  we now think of as the Romantic period was, for Williams, an important "way of finding
                  a position from which I could hope to understand and act in contemporary society,
                  necessarily through its history, which had delivered this strange, unsettling, and
                  exciting, world to us" (<em>Culture</em> xii).</p>
               <p>Returning to this work decades later as he prepared a new introduction to <em>Culture and Society</em> for the Morningside edition in 1982, that sense of a "now major crisis" had only
                  intensified in the face of Thatcherite conservatism (ix). The need for developing
                  a "detailed and complex thinking about culture which has been active and vibrant at
                  every stage" had lost none of its urgency, in large part because the historical turn
                  in <em>Culture and Society</em> anticipated the double imperative inherent in Said’s call for a form of radical humanism
                  as a basis for political engagement that was at the same time driven by self-critique
                  about the limitations of the tradition out of which it emerged (viii). As Williams’s
                  work demonstrated, the modern idea of culture that had developed in the Romantic period
                  was similarly ambivalent: it provided thinkers with an intellectual basis for resisting
                  the contradictions of industrial capitalism, but because it had also tended to be
                  deployed as a bulwark against the perceived excesses of modernity generally (including
                  its more progressive aspects such as democracy and the rise of a mass public culture),
                  its radical potential was, more often than not, compromised by an underlying conservatism.
                  Shining a historical light on both sides of these early debates about the modern idea
                  of culture enabled Williams to demonstrate more clearly how aligning one’s work with
                  this intellectual tradition might provide a "way of finding a position from which
                  [one] could hope to understand and act in contemporary society" even as it foregrounded
                  the need to clarify the historical limitations of these inherited ideas.</p>
               <p>Fortified by what Williams has described as "the key move" in the evolution of his
                  own thinking "to the notion of cultural production as itself material" (an insight
                  that reinforced his challenge to reductive accounts of the notorious Marxist distinction
                  between base and superstructure), his work increasingly foregrounded the underlying
                  classificatory assumptions that structured the literary field as a primary focus of
                  analysis in themselves (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 139). What may be most valuable about Williams’s historicism, though, is the strikingly
                  empathetic nature of his ability to blend critique with a sense of affirmation. Rather
                  than simply debunking these earlier mystifications of literature and art as acts of
                  theoretical bad faith, Williams’s "clearing operation" remained animated by his sense
                  of both the extraordinary efforts of earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures
                  of their own day, and even more importantly, of the extent to which these mystifications,
                  once exposed as "false attachment[s]," could nonetheless also be seen in terms of
                  the positive cultural work they also enabled (<em>Marxism</em> 43). The equation of literature with "creative writing" may have been inherently
                  reductive, but as he also pointed out, critical awareness of the "actively ideological"
                  nature of the "powerful and often forbidding" impact of these ideas needed to be balanced
                  against an appreciation of both the deeply "affirmative" spirit of their origin as
                  a strategy for resisting "the socially repressive and intellectually mechanical forms
                  of a new social order: that of capitalism and especially industrial capitalism," and
                  more broadly, their capacity to manifest themselves in more beneficial ways: "What
                  was laid down as a defensive reaction became in the course of the century a most important
                  positive principle, which in its full implications was deeply and genuinely humane"
                  (<em>Marxism</em> 43, 50; <em>Culture</em> 40). The fact that this new aesthetic ideology would itself often be embraced in
                  "socially repressive" and "intellectually mechanical ways" on behalf of the dominant
                  social order did not negate the legacy of these more positive dimensions. The real
                  challenge was to develop ways of engaging with "the very complicated pressures and
                  limits which, in their weakest forms, these [emerging] definitions falsely stabilized,
                  yet which, in their strongest forms, they sought to emphasize as new cultural practice"
                  (<em>Marxism</em> 145).</p>
               <p>For Williams, "the human commitments of these earlier writers came through, in a majority
                  of cases, as the voices of fellow strugglers rather than of historically dated or
                  periodised thinkers," an archeology of resistance, however imperfect, whose larger
                  effect was to offer an important "sense that such a tradition existed" (<em>Culture</em>, xi, x). As Williams’s language, with its emphasis on a sense of continuity with
                  the "human commitments" of these "fellow strugglers" in their "thinking about our
                  common life" suggests, his work remained unapologetically rooted within precisely
                  the sort of humanist impulse that he cites as a reason for Lukacs’s undeserved neglect:
                  it was a "way of finding a position from which" we in turn can "hope to understand
                  and act in contemporary society" in terms that reinscribed a faith in the possibility
                  of agency even as it rejected any naïve assumptions about the potential of this position
                  (<em>Culture</em> xii). However strongly Williams’s work may have gravitated towards a sense of the
                  need to critique the influence of the ideas about the aesthetic that emerged in the
                  Romantic period, this critical spirit was always balanced against his recognition
                  of the efforts of these earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures of their day,
                  even where the legacy of their ideas remained the focus of his own critical efforts.</p>
               <p>Where New Historicist critics often read the theories of the aesthetic that emerged
                  in this period as a flight from the pressures of history, Williams tended to approach
                  the efforts of these authors as the work of "fellow strugglers" engaged in flawed
                  but still valuable efforts to wrestle with the idea of culture, not as a means of
                  evasion or as a formal and all-encompassing ideological system but as a basis for
                  confronting "the lived dominance and subordination of particular classes" in specific
                  historical contexts (<em>Marxism</em> 110). Williams was definitely not uncritical of Romantic theories of the aesthetic.
                  He warned that the tendency to "isolate art, to specialize the imaginative faculty
                  to . . . one kind of activity" amounted to a "false attachment" to art as an autonomous
                  realm that was little more than "a saving clause in a bad treaty" (<em>Culture</em> 43, 67). This elevation of art into "a symbolic abstraction for a whole range of
                  human experience" may have been a "valuable abstraction" in many ways because of the
                  transformative power that it attributed to art in the face of dehumanizing pressures,
                  but it was "an abstraction nonetheless, because a general social activity was forced
                  into the status of a department or province, and actual works of art were in part
                  converted into a self-pleading ideology" (<em>Culture</em> 47). This process amounted to a "defensive reaction" that legitimated "the separation
                  of poets from other men, and their classification into an idealized general person,
                  ‘Poet’ or ‘Artist,’ which was to be so widely and damagingly received" (<em>Culture</em> 48). But having emphasized the cost of this impulse towards abstraction, Williams
                  refused to allow readers to forget the "deeply and genuinely humane" source of this
                  shift: "What was important at this time was the stress given to a mode of human experience
                  and activity which the progress of society seemed increasingly to deny" (<em>Culture</em> 40, 39). Approached in a spirit of historical complexity, this Romantic-era impulse
                  towards abstraction must be understood, not by imposing further layers of abstraction
                  by imposing our own inadequately historicized interpretations on it but by recognizing
                  it as a flawed but understandable "social activity" in its own right in the face of
                  larger hostile pressures.</p>
               <p>As the renewed critical attention that it has received in recent years suggests, Williams’s
                  work has itself become a crucial part of the history of cultural analysis that his
                  own work charts, an exemplary moment in a tradition of resistance that both focused
                  and intensified the efforts of these earlier "fellow strugglers." In this as in so
                  many other instances, humanism (in both its radical and more conventional forms) remains
                  deeply palimpsestic: a way of responding to the pressures of our own day by understanding
                  more clearly the legacy of the efforts of previous thinkers to wrestle with similar
                  challenges in their earlier forms. If, as Williams suggested, Robert Southey’s invocation
                  of the ghost of Thomas More in <em>Colloquies</em> "indicates a conscious continuity with the first phase of the humanist challenge"
                  that emerged during the Renaissance (<em>Culture</em> 24), Williams’s own engagement with Southey and his contemporaries suggests a similarly
                  "conscious continuity" with this subsequent early nineteenth-century phase in this
                  "humanist challenge." This, for Williams, is why the emergence of our modern idea
                  of culture in the Romantic period was so vital. It offered (in the historical interventions
                  charted by Williams and in his own work) a "special kind of map by means of which
                  the nature of the changes" "in our social, economic and political life" can be charted
                  (<em>Culture</em> xvii). But crucially for Williams, if culture provides a unique way of mapping these
                  changes, the very nature of this map itself was changing in fundamental ways. Its
                  initial function as "a separate body of moral and intellectual activities" and as
                  "a court of human appeal" had extended to a far broader and more fundamental understanding
                  of culture as "a whole way of life, not only as a scale of integrity, but as a mode
                  of interpreting all our common experience, and, in this new interpretation, changing
                  it" (<em>Culture</em> xviii). This understanding of culture has, like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, become
                  both mobile and self-reflexive: a critical disposition focused on charting dynamics
                  rather than fixed topographies and highlighting our own position within them: "Each
                  [literary] convention must be assessed by what it is rooted in and what it does: an
                  assessment that is related to a much more general historical judgment that is also
                  an affiliation—not history as all that has happened, but as where oneself is in it"
                  (<em>Politics</em> 307).</p>

                  <p>However necessary it may be to delineate the theoretical differences between the different
                     stages of Williams’s career, particularly as his work became more overtly engaged
                     with current Marxist debates, on the one hand, and more energized by both his involvement
                     in the radical political struggles associated with the May Day Manifesto and by his
                     theoretical insistence on the materiality of culture, on the other, it remains equally
                     important to emphasize the continuities implicit in Williams’s efforts to chart the
                     relations between different forms of cultural production and broader social and political
                     relations.

                     </div> Reflecting on the enthusiastic response that his more overt engagement with Marxist
                     theory in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> garnered in some quarters—"the positive relief with which some my students said—at
                     last he’s talking about Marxism directly, he’s got over his hang-ups and become a
                     real person"—Williams countered that this sense of a change in his thinking missed
                     the far more fundamental continuities across the whole of his work, in all of which
                     he had been "arguing with what I take to be official English culture," even if he
                     had "done that in different ways in different phases" (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 317, 316). The common thread running through these different phases had been Williams’s
                     interest, not just in mapping out the broader relations that exposed the limitations
                     of this "official" version of culture, but perhaps more importantly, highlighting
                     a history of earlier writers’ similar efforts.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This cartographic impulse to map out the connections that define an increasingly complex
                  understanding of our "whole way of life" has become important in new but familiar
                  ways in the face of the complexities that confront us in the opening decades of the
                  twenty-first century. In <em>Age of Discovery</em>, Ian Goldin and Chris Kutarna argue in a similar spirit that like earlier eras, our
                  age is a precarious but exciting transitional moment faced with enormous possibilities
                  and hazards. Faced with spiralling levels of complexity on multiple fronts, Goldin
                  and Kutarna echo Williams’s fundamental lesson about the challenge this implies: "Every
                  day in which we do not actively map out new connections, we become more lost in their
                  complexity" (255). The key to managing these changes, they argue, is that we emulate
                  earlier thinkers (in their case, the "learned people in the Renaissance" rather than
                  the Romantic period) who, faced with similar pressures and opportunities, "completely
                  changed their mental map of the world to suit the challenges they faced" (251). Williams’s
                  intervention, which was grounded in his study of early nineteenth-century thinkers’
                  efforts to change their own "mental map of the world," has lost none of its urgency
                  or relevance.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For those of us who work in the humanities, these challenges have been felt in especially
                     immediate ways. In her landmark 2010 book, <em>Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</em>, Martha Nussbaum warned that "we are in the midst of a crisis of massive proportions
                     and grave global significance": not "the global economic crisis that began in 2008"
                     whose ultimate outcome may well be the rise of alt-right populist extremism one decade
                     later, but the widespread erosion of support for the humanities both within and outside
                     of universities (1). The urgency of the topic has generated an avalanche of books,
                     studies, and articles in a range of venues, from academic journals to leading magazines
                     and newspapers.

                     and Kutarna remains central to these responses. As humanist thinkers have always recognized,
                     this task of mapping the future begins with a clearer understanding of the historical
                     force of the cultural formations whose stubbornly prescriptive influence did so much
                     to define the disciplines within which we study them.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Stefan Collini’s argument that we need "to start from further away in order to revitalize
                  ways of understanding the nature and importance of universities that are in danger
                  of being lost sight of in the present" underscores the continuing importance of Williams’s
                  historical turn to the project of developing an archeology of ideas forged by earlier
                  thinkers in the face of similar pressures as a basis for responding to current issues
                  (19). Williams’s genealogical work on culture never explicitly engaged with the emergence
                  of modern institutional forms of the humanities in these same decades, however closely
                  intertwined these histories may have been, but as his analyses make clear, the work
                  of these earlier writers amounted to exemplary instances of the humanities in action:
                  critical reflections on the nature and role of culture as a transformative domain
                  within a modern industrial society. If talk of "crisis of the humanities" has declined
                  over the past few years, this may be in part because there are bigger crises to worry
                  about. The issue seems less and less to be what society can do for the humanities,
                  than what the humanities can do for a society in the face of a rising spirit of authoritarianism.
                  But the key, as Williams argued in the face of very different pressures, begins with
                  resisting the lure of reifying supposedly autonomous sites of resistance, whether
                  that be "culture" or its institutional cousin, "the humanities."</p>
               <p>The implications of Williams’s particular form of radical humanism become clearest
                  in his discussion of hegemony in <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, where, aligning his approach with Gramsci, Williams explicitly distinguishes the
                  idea of hegemony as "a lived system of meanings and values" that is fundamentally
                  shaped by "relations of domination and subordination" without ever being reduced to
                  them—"a whole body of practices and expectations, over the whole of living: our senses
                  and assignments of energy, our shaping perceptions of ourselves and our world"—from
                  the more abstracted and endlessly "generalized system" that theorists such as Althusser
                  described as "ideology" (109–10). Where the idea of ideology developed by Althusser
                  implied a "relatively formal and articulated system of meanings, values, and beliefs,
                  of a kind that can be abstracted as a ‘world-view’ or ‘class outlook’" and then mapped
                  onto cultural analyses of "works of art" as "fully articulate and systematic expressions
                  of this ideology," the concept of hegemony favored by Williams suggested a work-in-progress:
                  a sense of contingency rooted in people’s actual struggles to engage with the pressures
                  of their day: "the relatively mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate consciousness
                  of actual men [and women] in that period" (<em>Marxism</em> 109). This shift (from ideology as wall-to-wall consciousness to hegemony as a site
                  of struggle) is crucial because it transforms culture, and therefore, the study of
                  it, from a mere "superstructure" reflecting "a formed social and economic structure"
                  to a vital set of activities that actively help to shape people’s historical moment
                  (<em>Marxism</em> 111). In this sense, the idea of "a lived hegemony" is never, "except analytically,
                  a system or a structure. It is a realized complex of experiences, relationships, and
                  activities, with specific and changing pressures and limits" (<em>Marxism</em> 112).</p>
               <p>This recourse to a rhetoric of the lived experiences of "actual men" was reinforced
                  by the autobiographical dimension of his work, especially in <em>The Country and the City</em>, which was peppered with passages such as his comment that "I know these feelings
                  at once, from my own experience. The only landscape I ever see, in dreams, is the
                  Black Mountain village in which I was born. When I go back to that country, I feel
                  a recovery of a particular kind of life, which appears, as an inescapable identity,
                  a more positive connection than I have known elsewhere" (84). There is, according
                  to the almost Wordsworthian logic of these sorts of invocations, a kind of personal
                  and unmediated "truth" here that can be extrapolated into a broader social truth in
                  opposition to the distortions of power. It was no accident that <em>Culture and Society</em> opens with what, for many critics, was a surprisingly sympathetic discussion of Edmund
                  Burke, the great champion of the importance of feelings to any sustainable vision
                  of common life. Returning to this idea three years later in <em>The Long Revolution</em>, Williams would provide a name for this theoretical focus: "structure[s] of feeling,"
                  a term that would become a hallmark of his work and which was intended to convey a
                  phenomenon that was, paradoxically, both "firm and definite," grounded in particular
                  forms of social organization, and evanescent, operating "in the most delicate and
                  least tangible parts of our activities" (64).</p>
               <p>Williams’s stress on the importance of this fleeting world of deeply felt but sometimes
                  only half-recognized emotional life has rendered his work vulnerable to the criticism
                  that, despite his insistence to the contrary, it presumes the availability of some
                  preideological realm of unmediated self-presence. But as Williams has always argued,
                  this recourse to lived experience was primarily a strategy for resisting the dangers
                  of abstraction (whether it is in the name of poetry or art or culture or the humanities)
                  without denying the unique value of the forms of knowledge and potential for political
                  engagement that these phenomena also afford. This position may have been grounded
                  in an overly confident appeal to the authentic experience of actual men and women,
                  but this interpretive fallacy does not negate the importance of Williams’s related
                  effort to ground the possibility of political resistance in a cultural vision that
                  recognized the transformative promise of affect as a domain that could never be fully
                  recontained within dominant systems of power in terms that reflect Gramsci’s vision
                  of hegemony as process: "the relatively mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate
                  consciousness of actual men [and women] in that period" (<em>Marxism</em> 109). If Williams’s work, both in its limitations and the critical scrutiny that
                  he brought to bear on the historical sources of these limitations, offered a compelling
                  counterpoint to the strengths and the problems inherent in Romantic authors’ own efforts
                  to advance a similar recognition of the primacy of lived experience in face of the
                  hostile pressures of their day, his understanding of these authors as both a pioneering
                  force in the development of new ideas about the role of culture and as cautionary
                  examples of the dangerous tug of abstraction may well be more material than ever.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Terry Eagleton’s strident and often strangely personal critique of his former teacher
               in <em>Criticism and Ideology</em>, which zeroed in on what Eagleton rejected as Williams’s gradualist approach, may
               have been the most prominent of critical arguments that Williams’s work had failed
               to absorb the important lessons of Marxists such as Louis Althusser, whose work owed
               its prominence to its deft mixture of Lancanian insight about a radically decentered
               subjectivity and its scientific claims for Marxism.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               about the excessively accusatory tone of many critics who, as Felski argues, often
               exempt themselves from the suspicions of any possibility of agency that ground their
               analyses.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               proliferates, spiraling outwards, spun out at a level of complexity, and delivered
               in a relaxed and knowing comprehensiveness, over the wide ambit of associations, imageries,
               feelings, attitudes and cultural tics, until one comes to see the unresolved and constantly
               morphing conflict between country and city as the primary contradiction of all social
               life" (
