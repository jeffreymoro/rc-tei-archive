               in part as a way to understand his shifting sense of the literature of the Romantic
               period with respect to the impact of industrialization and social change. I make the
               case for a more nuanced understanding of the well-known contrast in <em>The Country and the City</em> between Austen and Cobbett, as writers on two sides of the park wall, and argue that
               the Past Masters volume on Cobbett deserves to be more fully appreciated as a significant
               late work, both in terms of its historical method and its sense of the significance
               of the Romantic period, which is strikingly aligned with Williams’s own contingent
               historical experience. </p>

            </header><br/><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>In writing a doctoral thesis in English in the late 1980s on the radical journalism
                  of William Cobbett, William Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt, I was assisted by remarkably
                  supportive dissertation committee, and by the way the New Historicism directed attention
                  to literary expression as material practice and to texts that were once regarded as
                  nonliterary. At the same time, I was persistently reminded of resistance within Romantic
                  studies, particularly in North America, to the literary study of nonfiction prose
                  that had little to do with poetry and fiction, and that first appeared in ephemeral
                  newspapers and magazines. In retrospect, a proposed but never written chapter on Percy
                  Shelley became a placeholder for a more direct engagement with the Romantic canon,
                  in a dissertation that wound up instead arguing for the richness and complexity of
                  radical expression on its own terms. While Hazlitt and Hunt had acquired ancillary
                  status through their critical and personal relationships with the major Romantic poets,
                  Cobbett was the real outlier and a source of difficulty as the dissertation project
                  developed. To be sure, there were developments within Romantic studies that encouraged
                  attention to Cobbett and the radical press, notably Marilyn Butler’s <em>Romantics, Rebels, and Reactionaries</em> (1982) and Jon Klancher’s <em>The Making of English Reading Audiences</em> (1987). But through the earliest conceptions of the project, my interest in regarding
                  Cobbett as a matter of <em>literary</em> history was shaped by the work of Raymond Williams. Where Romantic studies typically
                  restricted Cobbett to footnotes, as a source of inert historical fact or distorted
                  polemic, <em>Culture and Society</em> offers a very different critical account of Cobbett, in the company of other major
                  literary figures. In a revealing opening contrast with Edmund Burke, followed by a
                  related pairing of Robert Southey with Robert Owen, Williams situates Cobbett at the
                  head of a strand of cultural discourse that emerges in response to the economic, social,
                  and political changes that shaped modern Britain. Given the limited attention Romanticists
                  then paid to nonfiction prose, the treatment of Burke, Cobbett, Southey, and Owen
                  within a tradition that ran forward through Carlyle, Newman, Arnold, Ruskin, and Morris
                  was remarkable in itself.</p>
               <p>In a casual remark on Orwell in the <em>Politics and Letters</em> interview collection, Williams identifies Cobbett as "a case I often return to" (387).
                  And return he did, across a range of topics—politics, economics, agriculture, education,
                  communication—in nearly all his major historical studies and essay collections, beginning
                  with <em>Culture in Society</em> (1958), and continuing through <em>The Long Revolution</em> (1961), <em>The Country and the City</em> (1973), <em>Keywords</em> (1976), <em>Problems in Materialism and Culture</em> (1980), <em>Writing in Society</em> (1983), and <em>Resources of Hope</em> (1989). Yet the occasional note struck by the sense of a case to which one returns
                  does not capture the way in which Cobbett came increasingly to serve as a key figure—arguably
                  <em>the</em> key figure—connecting Williams and his readers back to the vexed early phase of a
                  long revolution in politics, economics, and communication that shaped British cultural
                  modernity. Williams’s abiding concern for rural life and agricultural experience heightened
                  the affinity, as did a sense of late twentieth-century postwar crisis that echoed
                  back through the experience of the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. Over the course
                  of his life, the account of Cobbett developed in ways that register a growing appreciation
                  for a body of writing that is at once personal and communal, descriptive and imaginative.
                  This line of response culminated in the 1983 Past Masters volume, <em>Cobbett</em>, where what could have been a brief primer on the career of an early nineteenth-century
                  journalist becomes instead a more expansive meditation on essential problems of historical
                  method and contemporary argument, evident in Williams’s searching reflections on what
                  it means to attend closely to a voice from the past and to witness change across two
                  centuries.</p>
               <p>My aim in tracking this critical engagement with Cobbett is in part to provide a sense
                  of development, but also to demonstrate just how fully Cobbett figured in some of
                  Williams’s most significant contributions to literary and cultural studies. Notable
                  here is his rethinking of the literary and the aesthetic in ways that reconfigure
                  the canon of course, but also open up new ways of thinking about transmission and
                  continuity in literary history, in part by considering writing as a material practice
                  that shapes even as it is shaped by social and economic change. As an agrarian countryman
                  who advocated subsistence farming even as he wrote to support himself, Cobbett was
                  distinctively positioned to reveal some of the contradictions at work in early industrial
                  society. At issue here are ways of thinking historically about class, and these will
                  be particularly evident in Williams’s paired treatment of Cobbett and Austen in <em>The Country and the City</em>. But while that discussion has often been noticed because it seems to diminish Austen
                  and restrict her social vision, for Williams it is part of a larger attempt to come
                  to terms with elements of early nineteenth-century society that can challenge some
                  of his own Marxist and socialist conceptions of historical change. And it is finally
                  the willingness to rethink his own historical position and expectations with Cobbett,
                  through the pivotal transitions of early nineteenth-century industrial society, that
                  shapes the Past Masters volume, whose final phases are as provocative and experimental
                  as anything in Williams’s critical prose, particularly as the writer searches for
                  new ways of thinking historically about the literature of the past with respect to
                  the present.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">Literary Tradition and Industrial Transformation</span></h2>
               <p>We can begin as so often for Williams with language. In assessing the difficulty of
                  "history" as a critical and interpretive term, David Simpson has suggested that <em>Keywords</em> offers less a definition than a "compromise," in which "the urgency of history" lies
                  not in wholeness or totality but rather in "its immediate applicability to a range
                  of options for reading the past and projecting the future" (9). He cites a sentence
                  from the close of the <em>Keywords</em> entry on "history," after Williams explores the way that "organized knowledge of
                  the past" came from the eighteenth century to acquire a more general association with
                  "human self-development" through "continuous and connected process," so that "history"
                  potentially lost its "exclusive association with the past" and became "connected not
                  only to the present but also to the future." Noting that "it is . . . not easy to
                  say which sense of <em>history</em> is currently dominant," Williams closes by contrasting the specificity of such variants
                  as "historian" and "historical" with the wider scope of the root term: "History itself
                  retains its whole range, and still, in different hands, <em>teaches</em> or <em>shows</em> us most kinds of knowable past and almost every kind of imaginable future" (146–48).
                  One aim of this essay is to demonstrate that this sense of instruction and demonstration
                  is increasingly evident in Williams’s writing about Cobbett as he comes to wrestle
                  with problems of perception and voice across time, so as to bring a knowable past
                  to bear upon an uncertain but imaginable future. An astute and materially engaged
                  observer, an engaging communicator, and a forceful critic of economic dispossession
                  through the critical early phase of industrial capitalism, the figure of Cobbett as
                  fully developed in the Past Masters volume is also a profoundly important <em>historical</em> figure in Williams’s fullest sense, a guide to the past whose expectations about
                  a future that is now past can also shape our own future expectations and projections.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Given Cobbett’s presence in <em>Culture and Society</em> as part of a preliminary set of contrasts, it is not surprising that the discussion
                     there is schematic, unfolding through a sequence of extracts with minimal commentary.
                     In a retrospective introduction, Williams observes that the writers treated in <em>Culture and Society</em> had not "been seen as connected in this way" before, and in some sense the case for
                     Cobbett develops over the course of the book as he becomes a "touchstone," and his
                     perspective returns in discussions of Coleridge, Mill, Carlyle, Dickens, Disraeli,
                     Eliot, Morris, Lawrence, and Leavis (x, 105).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The term "touchstone" appears in a discussion of George Eliot, and for Cobbett with
                              respect to other writers mentioned here see Culture and Society 56, 58, 78, 96, 99,
                              150.</span></div>
                     </div> That said, the initial discussion does involve some strikingly dismissive observations,
                     notably that Cobbett "had nothing of Burke’s depth of mind" and that his "relative
                     indifference to ideas" meant that he was "often simply a Philistine" (12–13, 18).
                     While this was not revoked in Williams’s later work, the tone shifts considerably,
                     to the point where Simpson convincingly charges Williams with having "failed to hear
                     the uglier voices in Cobbett" (12)—the sensationalism, the personal invective, the
                     racism, the misogyny, the anti-Semitism.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This critique connects with Edward Said’s critique of Culture and Society for its
                              "failure to deal with the imperial experience at all" (65). Cornel West suggests that
                              while "Williams provides indispensable analytical tools and historical sensibilities
                              for reflections on empire, race, color, gender and sexual orientation, the relative
                              silences in his work on these issues bear the stamp of his own intellectual and existential
                              formation" (8).</span></div>
                     </div> In exploring Williams’s writing on Cobbett, it is worth acknowledging Simpson’s point
                     at the outset: there is a consistent filtering out of what W. D. Rubinstein has termed
                     "the dark side" of British radical populism (339). In <em>Culture and Society</em>, the sense of Cobbett as a writer impervious to ideas aligns what is valuable about
                     his prose with impression and feeling rather than thought, with a "sureness of instinct"
                     evident above all in his rural and agricultural writing. The perspective of the "countryman"
                     enabled a critical response to industrialization, as Cobbett witnessed the development
                     of a "new class system" that sharply divided laborer and landowner, rich and poor
                     (14). In revising earlier individualist conceptions of property through an insistence
                     that the working poor possessed a property in their labor, Cobbett extended property
                     rights to "a whole new class" (17) and provided a radically new framework for class
                     conflict and collective action that fundamentally disrupted the existing order.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Beyond these and other convictions that Williams tracks primarily through the <em>Political Register</em>, it is worth identifying two features of the treatment of Cobbett in <em>Culture and Society</em> that he develops more fully in his later work. First is a matter of historical method
                  that at this point runs primarily from present to past in the form of a potential
                  misrecognition that tests our retrospective assumptions: "The terms of Cobbett’s social
                  criticism so much resemble later and more organized critiques that it is easy to forget
                  the basis of experience from which he worked, and the values by which he judged" (14).
                  While a claim for the distinctiveness of Cobbett’s experience is clear enough, Williams
                  does not attempt to account for the remarkable resemblance to later social criticism,
                  nor does he say much about the value (or the limitations) of a relatively unformed
                  and disorganized early nineteenth-century perspective. Again, much rests here on assigning
                  Cobbett’s own critical responses to instinct and experience rather than intellect
                  or coherent analysis, and this indicates a second strand of <em>Culture and Society</em> that extends through Williams’s later writing, the tendency to value Cobbett’s instinct
                  and experience rather than his intellect. While Williams does insist that "the sureness
                  of instinct was no accident—it was rather, vital and impregnable, a genuine embodiment
                  of value," the contrast with Burke is in this respect clearly diminishing (13). Where
                  this gets mitigated is through a countervailing insistence that Burke’s value also
                  lies in feeling and experience. What we learn from the author of the <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> (1790), notably through his insistence on social complexity and historical community,
                  has less to do "with his position than his manner of thinking," a manner that Williams
                  suggests is not even "thinking" in the usual sense but rather "a special immediacy
                  of experience, which works itself out, in depth, to a particularly embodiment of ideas"
                  (<em>Culture and Society</em> 4–5). In this way the contrast between instinct and intellect softens, and Burke
                  meets Cobbett on the common ground of personal experience and expression: "Burke’s
                  writing is an articulated experience, and as such it has a validity which can survive
                  even the demolition of its general conclusions. . . . It is, finally, a personal experience
                  become landmark" (5).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>With Crabbe, Hardy, Lawrence, and Wordsworth, Cobbett is among the most frequently
                     cited writers in <em>The Country and the City</em>, and his role in the unfolding argument of the book is more fluid and less narrowly
                     defined than in <em>Culture and Society</em>. The value of Cobbett’s experience as a "countryman" and a farmer is amplified as
                     Williams infuses the book with the perspective of his own Welsh village upbringing.
                     While there are continuities of principle and method from <em>Culture and Society</em> to <em>The Country and the City</em>, it is clear that Williams’s thinking has shifted in ways that shape the treatment
                     of Cobbett. Among other things, what came between the two books were developments
                     in the British New Left, notably Williams’s role in the 1967 <em>May Day Manifesto</em>, which expressed disenchantment with the rightward movement of the British Labour
                     Party.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Williams and the May Day Manifesto, see Chun 86–87.</span></div>
                     </div> A line of argument that Williams developed in 
                     “The British Left,”
                      a 1965 <em>New Left Review</em> article reprinted in the volume <em>Resources of Hope</em> (1989), is particularly instructive. Here, an assessment of "the state of the Left
                     in Britain" begins with an assessment of the Labour Party. The integrity of the party
                     as "a mass party and a permanently potential government, based primarily on the most
                     organized sections of the working class," can help account for its strengths and weaknesses,
                     notably its limited effectiveness as an "instrument of socialist change." But Williams
                     insists on looking beyond the framework of a parliamentary party (as he did in the <em>May Day Manifesto</em>), and beyond the 1960s, to "the complicated intellectual and structural traditions
                     of other kinds of social criticism and opposition," in particular, "the origins of
                     the British working-class movement, in the years 1790–1835" (<em>Resources</em> 133). While he and E. P. Thompson disagreed within the <em>May Day Manifesto</em> on the role of the Labour Party in bringing about social change through parliamentary
                     politics, with Williams no longer expecting Labour to advance socialism (Chun 86),
                     in the 1965 <em>New Left Review</em> article on the British left Williams invokes in his own support of <em>The Making of the English Working Class</em>, which appeared just two years earlier and manifestly shapes the ensuing discussion.

                  <p>In the <em>New Left Review</em> article Williams proceeds to trace this resilience to union organization but also
                     to "certain pre-political values" (we might consider Cobbett’s instincts) and a "self-generating
                     tradition" that has found expression in "the moral critique of industrial capitalism,"
                     and that "has been paralleled throughout by a literary tradition of comparable importance"
                     (<em>Resources</em> 136). The figures in this tradition are familiar from <em>Culture and Society</em>, yet here Williams more fully asserts a distinctively working-class commitment to
                     the life of the imagination and human fulfillment despite the corrosive effects of
                     industrial capitalism. The alignment of "moral critique" with "literary tradition"
                     tells us much about how Williams worked to introduce Cobbett to the literary canon
                     and even, as we will see, to Romanticism’s visionary company. Cobbett’s profile rises
                     further as Williams looks past the Labour Party and past his own present crisis to
                     identify forces that have shaped radical social change. While he acknowledges the
                     contribution of religious nonconformity to working-class values, Williams turns to
                     literary tradition for an ethos that is more emancipatory and less restrictive than
                     puritan tradition: <span class="quote">‘There has been an important tradition of ideas and feelings which is not puritan,

                        no more puritan than the novels of Dickens. What is asserted in this tradition is
                        the claim to life, against the distortion of humanity by the priorities and disciplines

                        in its immediate forms, but in its insistence on satisfaction and excitement it is

                     meets "literary tradition." As a result, the author of <em>Rural Rides</em> (1830) takes on some of the visionary proportions that Romantic studies has typically
                     associated with Blake and Shelley, though at this point Williams still looks ahead—itself
                     a tribute to Cobbett, who becomes the sole forebear of a distinguished nineteenth-
                     and early twentieth-century tradition. Assessing this tradition, he writes: "Cobbett,
                     Dickens, Ruskin, Morris, Lawrence: all these in their lifetimes fought utilitarianism,
                     and all except Ruskin fought the kind of moral paternalism which was the other main
                     line of reform. What they claimed, positively, was man’s absolute priority as a creative
                     and independent being. From this creativity and independence came cooperation and
                     a good society" (<em>Resources</em> 137). To be sure, there may be a return by way of a more structural Williams to the
                     early sense of "instinct" in the claim that the "important tradition of ideas and
                     feelings which is not puritan" and which ran through literature and through "British
                     working-class life" was "pre-political." What does it mean to identify "values" (136)
                     or a "level" (137) as "pre-political," within an essay that involves a concerted and
                     intensively situated argument about political action and organization? And yet the
                     account here of a resilient and persistently anarchic working-class tradition, allowing
                     for its imprecision, does register the emergence in Williams’s work of a more positive
                     way of thinking about the relatively disorganized critique of capitalism associated
                     with Cobbett and others in the decades before a fully developed socialism. If the
                     early Williams challenged Cobbett’s reliance on instinct, the later Williams was challenged
                     by the insight Cobbett offered into a pre-socialist challenge to industrial capitalism
                     that was no more fully developed than the economic system it confronted.</p>

                  <p>This is reinforced in a <em>New Left Review</em> interview on <em>Culture and Society</em>, conducted in 1977 and published in the <em>Politics and Letters</em> collection, where Williams compares the English tradition surveyed in the book with
                     continental sociology and asserts that "the very rapid and brutal experience of industrialization"
                     in England triggered a particularly critical response, again in the years from 1790
                     through the 1830s. "The thinking about the process of industrial transformation that
                     was done in the period between Blake and Wordsworth and Southey and the young Carlyle,
                     although it is very early and confused, still seems to me absolutely crucial. Some
                     of the questions then asked, more persistently by Cobbett than by anyone else, about
                     the whole nature of the industrial project and the consequences for social relations,
                     still have to be answered today" (115).

                     from the past to the present that Williams continued to explore through his later
                     career. In a sense the imperfect formation of Cobbett’s social and economic critique
                     accounts for its compelling present relevance, as any radical movement must acknowledge
                     an imperfect understanding of the future it wants to shape.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In historicizing misapprehensions within the New Left, Williams finds himself looking
                  back with more respect to an earlier era of writers who were similarly coming to terms
                  with a crisis of uncertain outcome, in ways that belie the more assured critical and
                  historical perspective of <em>Culture and Society</em>. As evidence of the way history can challenge socialist theory, he observes that
                  "the characteristic rhetoric" of Marxism in the 1930s would have anticipated the failure
                  of capitalism and the triumph of Soviet productivity, whereas the postwar period instead
                  ushered in "the new kind of productive explosion that capitalism had in store." Unanticipated
                  historical experience motivates the sympathetic return to an early and essentially
                  presocialist struggle to contest industrial capitalism. Williams writes, "It was then
                  that the questions posed by Blake or Cobbett acquired their force for me" (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 115). The acutely disorienting postwar experience, and the attendant return for critical
                  understanding to an earlier era, frames the transition from <em>Culture and Society</em> to <em>The Country and the City</em>. Williams leaves no doubt that the questions posed by Romantic period writers, and
                  "more persistently by Cobbett than by anyone else," were at the front of his mind
                  in the early 1970s: "<em>The Country and the City</em> was written very much in response to them" (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 115). In this sense, the fragmented and unsystematic critique associated with an
                  early phase of industrialization becomes less a liability to be overcome through corrective
                  historical analysis than an opportunity for salutary self-recognition across two centuries
                  of profound social and economic change. No wonder then that Cobbett’s instinct, far
                  from being insufficiently thought through, becomes an imaginatively vital and anarchic
                  insistence on the whole range of individual and collective human experience.</p>

                     for my purposes the central contrast is between Cobbett and Austen (119). Following
                     on a historical treatment of enclosure and property rights, Williams develops the
                     chapter in terms of the response to historical change. With "the economic system of
                     landlord, tenant and labourer" now "in explicit and assertive control," rural communities
                     were forced to adapt in order to survive (107). What Simpson has termed Williams’s
                     "appetite for immediacy" is fully evident (22), as Cobbett appears in the familiar
                     guise of close observer and careful recorder—though now without Burke casting the
                     invidious shadow of intellectual deprivation, and with Austen and White as fellow
                     observers. The questioning presence of Cobbett in the <em>New Left Review</em> interview is also pertinent, as interrogation supplements observation and description:
                     "What Cobbett gives us is detailed social observation, from the point of view of the
                     condition of the majority of men. He combined Arthur Young’s attention to the detailed
                     practice of a working agriculture with a more persistent social questioning and observation"
                     (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 109).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Cobbett’s willingness to identify with the condition of the laborer offers a
                     fundamental shift in perspective, it is his capacity for observation—to have "looked
                     very carefully" (110) and registered a "visible disturbance" (111)—that occasions
                     Williams’s most developed account yet of the role of the rural rider in a <em>literary</em> tradition that typically involves imaginative writing. Where the eighteenth-century
                     poetry of Goldsmith and Crabbe provided moral caution of a kind that Williams explores
                     in previous chapters of <em>The Country and the City</em>, the more fully developed capitalism of the early nineteenth century demanded organized
                     action and resistance, of a kind that prior literary conventions could not provide.
                     Under these conditions, Cobbett becomes "the outrider" of "a new kind of country writing"
                     that sustains description and reflection while accounting for "action," in both its
                     own communicative effects and what it witnessed among the working poor. Cobbett "described
                     and campaigned", and in doing so set the terms for developments in prose fiction that
                     made social realism a prevailing form of the mid-nineteenth century novel (<em>Country</em> 112). The line of development from Goldsmith to Cobbett to Dickens can seem counterintuitive,
                     running as it does from country to city, and from poetry through nonfiction prose
                     to the novel, but Williams insists upon tracing this line in order to register in
                     literary history what he often noted in economic history: that capitalism transformed
                     the English countryside through the reorganization of agricultural production well
                     in advance of urban industrialization.

                     of meditation, and then transmit his own activist disposition ahead to a socially
                     committed fiction. It is through the paired treatment of Austen and Cobbett that we
                     can appreciate Williams’s own effort to think historically about class as he worked

                  more frequently noticed gestures: <span class="quote">‘It is a truth universally acknowledged, that Jane Austen chose to ignore the decisive
                     historical events of her time. Where, it is still asked, are the Napoleonic wars:
                     the real current of history? But history has many currents, and the social history
                     of the landed families, at that time in England, was among the most important. As
                     we sense its real processes, we find that they are quite central and structural in
                     Austen’s novels. (<em>Country</em> 113)’</span> Readers of Austen can be protective of their author, so it is not surprising that
                  the discussion in <em>The Country and the City</em> has raised objections and spirited critical response. Yet given that the whole point
                  of this passage is to show that Austen was in fact engaged in the "the real current
                  of history," once we acknowledge social as well as political and military history,
                  it is surprising that Williams has been taken to task here for "a classic statement
                  of the view that Jane Austen the novelist repudiates any serious concern with larger
                  social and political events" (Crary 145). Fortunately, Devoney Looser’s observation
                  that Williams is writing "facetiously" and that he goes on to argue "to the contrary"
                  is more characteristic of the way historicist critics have responded (216). And yet
                  the recognition that Williams considers Austen to be a historically engaged novelist
                  may miss a more subtle point about the argument of <em>The Country and the City</em>, one that gets obscured by the way the chapter vividly reopens, as it were, through
                  this allusion to the opening of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. For this is not the transition from Cobbett to Austen. That comes in the previous
                  paragraph, as part of a stark contrast between the perspective of the two writers
                  that follows directly from the argument about the author of the <em>Rural Rides</em> as an "outrider" for literary developments that are more fully realized in Victorian
                  fiction: <span class="quote">‘But this change in the novel did not happen in Cobbett’s time. Through his middle
                     years, while the social changes were happening, Jane Austen was writing from a very
                     different point of view, from inside the houses that Cobbett was passing on the road.
                     When he was writing about the disappearance of the small gentry he was riding through
                     Hampshire, not far from Chawton. It was also in Hampshire that he made his list of
                     the new owners of country-houses and estates, from nabobs to stock-jobbers. (<em>Country</em> 112)’</span> This claim about a difference in perspective despite a shared affinity for close
                  observation becomes a key strand in the ensuing discussion of Austen, even as the
                  movement forward and back again in time (a method that is characteristic, yet somehow
                  intensified when Williams writes about Cobbett) highlights the sense of "action" with
                  respect to a campaigning journalist who recognized and endorsed working-class organization
                  against capitalist transformations of the countryside. For Williams, Cobbett’s "newly
                  typical action" is another dimension of the contrast with Austen, and it is accentuated
                  by the preliminary glance ahead to "a new kind of novel, which was to become, from
                  the 1830s, the dominant literary form" (112). Put in Williams’s own terms, Cobbett
                  provides what the later Gaskell or Dickens cannot, a strand of literary history that
                  indicated how even Austen’s celebrated powers of observation would become residual.</p>
               <p>The sharp distinction that places the domestic novelist "on the other side of the
                  park wall" from the rural rider has also occasioned spirited response in Austen criticism
                  (113), particularly as it gets reworked towards the end of the chapter, where Williams
                  once again switches temporal registers, speculating that if Austen had ventured "outside
                  the park walls, into a very different social experience," her writing would have "become
                  not a moral but a social criticism" of the kind found later in George Eliot: <span class="quote">‘We must emphasize here again the importance of Cobbett. What he names, riding past
                     on the road, are classes. Jane Austen, from inside the houses, can never see that,
                     for all the intricacy of her social description. All her discrimination is, understandably,
                     internal and exclusive. She is concerned with the conduct of people who, in the complications
                     of improvement, are repeatedly trying to make themselves into a class. But where only
                     one class is seen, no classes are seen. (117)’</span> It is important to acknowledge that subsequent work on Austen, sensitive to gender,
                  commerce, domesticity, sociability, and public and private spheres, demonstrates that
                  the catalog of what Williams himself fails to see, on both sides of the park wall,
                  is as lengthy as it is troubling. A vivid case in point would be Adela Pinch’s wonderful
                  reading of the scene in <em>Emma</em> where the heroine breaks away from her friend Harriet’s distracted shopping to look
                  out the door of Ford’s shop, observing and envisioning a range of characters from
                  within and beyond the plot of the novel. Expecting perhaps the apothecary Mr. Perry,
                  the lawyer William Cox "letting himself in at the office door," and the carriage horses
                  of the newly genteel tradesman Mr. Cole, along with "a stray letter-boy on an obstinate
                  mule," she is not disappointed "when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray,
                  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling
                  over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker’s little bow­window
                  eyeing the gingerbread" (Austen 183). The liminal perspective, at the door of a shop
                  looking out over a village high street, is itself suggestive with respect to Williams’s
                  impermeable park wall, and so too is Pinch’s insistence that for all the "gritty everydayness"
                  (xxiv) of the scene there is evidence of an important shift in literary history: <span class="quote">‘Austen is doing something quite revolutionary in presenting to us a woman standing
                     in a shop door. It is hard for us to find this ordinary image revolutionary, but in
                     fact what is revolutionary is that a woman loitering in a shop door in England in
                     1815 seems ordinary. It is an image we cannot imagine finding in a novel before this
                     moment. Emma’s activity is new, and so is the kind of contemplation Austen represents
                     Emma as practicing. (xxiii)’</span> Pinch is alert to the role of commerce and "the consumption of fashionable goods"
                  in the novel, and to patterns of circulation between London and Highbury, and she
                  insists that "this scene must be seen in its entirety as a shopping scene." But she
                  also draws a comparison with Burney’s <em>Camilla</em> to refine our sense of what is at stake when Emma takes a moment to pause and reflect.
                  Highbury suddenly appears to be a "considerably less orderly" village, and we are
                  made aware that even a realistically rendered social world recedes beyond apprehension
                  and suggests "glimpses of the inexhaustibly unknown" (xxii–xxiv).</p>

                  <p>There is much about this close attention to a historically situated female experience—transpiring
                     outside the home, in a world of circulating goods and traveling persons—that belies
                     Williams’s narrow and reductive schema of outside and inside, of traveling on the
                     public road as against settlement behind the park wall. Williams acknowledges little
                     of what Austen and Pinch render so vividly, and his vision was no doubt restricted
                     by his interest in sharing Cobbett’s perspective and listening closely to Cobbett’s
                     voice. While Pinch does not reference <em>The Country and the City</em>, others have. Helena Kelly acknowledges in Williams a "necessary corrective to Jane’s
                     genteel comedy of manners," but reminds us that many "pivotal scenes in [her] novels
                     take place outdoors," and that even when indoors "we’re not invariably ‘inside the
                     houses.’ Sometimes we’re in inns, assembly buildings, hotels, cramped rented rooms"
                     (225–26). In bringing Austen and her characters out from behind the park wall and
                     onto the road, Kelly invokes another episode in <em>Emma</em>, where Harriet Smith walks out with a friend on "the Richmond road," an excursion
                     that is "apparently public enough for safety" but ends nevertheless in a terrified
                     encounter with "a party of gipsies" and rescue at the hands of Frank Churchill (Austen
                     261).

                     </div> The conventional device of male rescue only heightens the extent to which Austen knew
                     and rendered what Williams overlooks in his easy contrast between Cobbett "riding
                     past on the road" and Austen writing "from inside the houses": the male privilege
                     at work in the relative freedom from geographical restriction and threat of assault
                     enjoyed by Cobbett throughout the <em>Rural Rides</em>.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As a narrative of mistaking and then finding one’s social place, the Harriet Smith
                  subplot in <em>Emma</em> indicates the range of Austen’s social vision. A village boarding schoolgirl of uncertain
                  parentage, Harriet is raised to genteel company at Highbury by a misguided Emma and
                  eventually aspires to marry Mr. Knightly, only to return through the process by which
                  the novel disciplines the heroine’s imagination to a more suitable marriage with Knightley’s
                  tenant farmer, Mr. Martin, which terminates any special intimacy with Emma. The social
                  distinctions at issue here and throughout her fiction have led Austen scholars to
                  challenge Williams on the question of class. According to Roger Sales, "the wide social
                  distance between the aristocratic Mr. Yates and the lower-middle-class Price family"
                  in <em>Mansfield Park</em> undermines the "basic thesis that Austen only represents one class" (253n10). A consensus
                  about social range in recent Austen scholarship is suggested in Juliet McMaster’s
                  compelling chapter on 
                  “Class”
                  for <em>The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen</em>, which sets out from a proposition that "class difference was . . . a fact of life
                  for Austen, and an acute observation of the fine distinctions between one social level
                  and another was a necessary part of her business as a writer of realistic fiction"
                  (111). McMaster goes on to provide a complex and dynamic map of status in Austen’s
                  fiction, beginning with such titled characters as Lord Osborne (in the fragment 
                  “The Watsons”
                  ) and Lady Catherine de Bourgh, extending down through the landed gentry, gentlemen
                  with incomes, professional men, and those who make or made their money in trade (some
                  of whom acquire gentility), and closing with servants and brief glimpses of laboring
                  people and the poor.</p>
               <p>Yet before concluding that Williams has been effectively superseded, it is worth returning
                  to what he actually says about Austen in <em>The Country and the City</em>. Against the perception that Austen is primarily interested in individuals and their
                  "personal relationships," he insists that her preoccupation is with "social <em>conduct</em>: a testing and discovery of the standards which govern human behaviour in real situations."
                  And such situations are crucially dynamic and uncertain, a matter of "changing fortunes"
                  rather than any "settled ‘traditional’ world" (113). This leads directly to a recognition
                  of the social range and complexity that Austen scholars are inclined to invoke against
                  him, as Williams surveys a range of characters with respect to property, income, and
                  manners, including Sir Thomas Bertram, the Crawfords, Darcy, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Martin,
                  the Coles, and Catherine Moreland. Change and motion are again keynotes: "It must
                  be clear that it is no single, settled society, it is an active, complicated, sharply
                  speculative process. It is indeed that most difficult world to describe, in English
                  social history: an acquisitive, high bourgeois society at the point of its most evident
                  interlocking with an agrarian capitalism that is itself mediated by inherited titles
                  and the making of family names." Given the difficulty of even describing this world,
                  Williams marvels at Austen’s ability to maintain "a unity of tone, of a settled and
                  remarkably confident way of seeing and judging, in the chronicle of confusion and
                  change" (<em>Country</em> 115). The point is important, and gets at the complexity and indeed the <em>necessity</em> of irony as a way for Austen to write about class: if Emma misleads Harriet into
                  misunderstanding her own social status and destiny, their mutual confusion is in many
                  respects more interesting and revealing than the denouement that divides them and
                  returns them to their proper places. In this sense, Emma’s apparently misguided plotting
                  reveals what the resolution of the novel conceals.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet Williams returns, with a bracing consistency, to a sense of Austen’s limitations.
                     His assessment of her paradoxical achievement follows directly from the observation
                     that "she is more exact about income, which is disposable, than about acres, which
                     have to be worked" (<em>Country</em> 115), and involves an interlocking set of distinctions, familiar to readers of <em>Keywords</em>, within contemporary senses of the terms "improvement" and "cultivation" (<em>Keywords</em> 92–93, 160–61).

                              assertion that "money, especially money as spendable income, is the love-tipped arrow
                              aimed at the hearts of Jane Austen’s heroines and her readers" (128).</span></div>
                     </div> There was improvement in working agriculture, and improvement in parks and artificial

                     In both cases, the revenue from the first could be applied to the second. In writing
                     about "an active, complicated, sharply speculative process," Austen achieved her remarkable
                     consistency of tone in part by overlooking "working" improvement and cultivation while
                     seeing "social" improvement and cultivation "very clearly indeed" (<em>Country</em> 116).

                              resists change and is "regulatory" in "discriminating among improvements" (27–28).</span></div>
                     </div> For those troubled by the crudeness of the distinction between Cobbett "riding past
                     on the road" and Austen writing "from inside the houses," I would offer this more
                     subtle distinction as a redeeming corrective. To be sure, there are grounds for contesting
                     Williams’s assessment, notably in <em>Emma</em>, in the scene where Mr. Knightley meets his brother John at Highbury and speaks "as
                     a farmer," as the two men share an interest in plans around draining and fencing,
                     the removal of a tree, "and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring
                     corn" (Austen 81). And yet Williams’s larger point stands, and has been reinforced
                     in a recent chapter on agriculture in the volume <em>Jane Austen in Context</em>. Here Robert Clark and Gerry Dutton propose the striking absence "to the historian’s
                     eye" of farmers and farm workers in film and television versions of Austen, and then
                     trace that conspicuous absence to the fiction itself: "Only the relatively minor character
                     of Robert Martin in <em>Emma</em> [serves] to represent the most numerous social orders in a period when even the King
                     was affectionately known as ‘Farmer George’" (185).

                     with what he did <em>not</em> mean, and with another Austen scholar who has taken exception to <em>The Country and the City</em>. In the introduction to <em>Jane Austen and the Fiction of Her Time</em>, Mary Waldron promises to avoid the distorting effects of "a sort of historical criticism"
                     that threatens "to damage the coherence of a novel" by prioritizing "what we think
                     was important over the perceptions of the author working within the cultural parameters
                     of his/her time." Waldron associates Williams with this kind of historicism: <span class="quote">‘Cultural historians like Raymond Williams may be right in their terms to see Austen’s
                        fictional world as essentially class-based, but "class" in the Marxist sense that
                        they use did not exist in Austen’s lifetime; her society was only just emerging from
                        a semi-feudal situation. It is interesting to identify foreshadowings in the novels
                        of what were to become elements in the adversarial world of Marx—bourgeois versus
                        proletarian—but they tell us nothing about the world within which Austen’s characters
                        interact, the world which she and they assume. (11–12)

                     emerging from a semi-feudal situation" is to ignore the massive changes in agriculture,
                     commerce, industry, and empire that had shaped England for centuries, supplementing
                     and replacing "feudal" authority with a complex interlocking urban and rural and imperial
                     network of titled, landed, agricultural, commercial, professional, and political elites,
                     and leaving the common people with a complex array of potential relationships with
                     their superiors. It is difficult to say what an account of Austen as a novelist representing
                     a world "only just emerging from a semi-feudal situation" would look like, but it
                     would certainly be reductive and distorting. The claim about what Austen and her characters
                     "assume" reduces to a claim about what Austen herself assumes, and it is certainly
                     true that Williams does not want his readers to be confined to those assumptions and
                     to that world. But his approach is not to impose elements of his own world on the
                     past. Rather, he draws the contrast with Cobbett in part to show that others in the
                     period saw the world differently, and did so in part by attending with all of Austen’s
                     fine discrimination to other elements of the world. Far from telling "us nothing about
                     the world within which Austen’s characters interact," Cobbett’s perception of a world
                     antagonistically divided between rich and poor tells us something important about
                     the world of Jane Austen, whether or not it is visible in her novels. And far from
                     complacently affirming a Marxist vision of "bourgeois versus proletarian," the process
                     by which Cobbett became increasingly important to Williams was a consequence of his
                     recognition of the value of ways of thinking critically about economic and social
                     change in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that do not easily align
                     with later socialist terms.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To understand what Williams meant in asserting that Austen saw only one class, we
                     need to appreciate the importance of Cobbett’s emerging sense that interlocking economic,
                     political, and social systems were effectively creating two classes with antithetical
                     interests and experiences—rich and poor, consumers and producers, masters and slaves.
                     I have already mentioned Williams’s account of "the new class system" in <em>Culture and Society</em>, where he cites an April 1821 article in the <em>Political Register</em> that finds Cobbett accusing an opponent of wanting to reduce "the community to two
                     classes: <em>Masters</em> and <em>Slaves</em>" (15). Cobbett figures again in the <em>Keywords</em> entry on class, as Williams distinguishes a sense of class as "precise descriptive
                     grouping" from a newer usage in the early nineteenth century that involves "basic
                     relationship," and particularly "basic economic relationships (as between employers
                     and employed, propertied and propertyless)." Cobbett’s 1825 observation "that there
                     is one class of society united to oppose another" is cited for the latter, along with
                     an 1805 assertion by Charles Hall that, while there may be many different orders in
                     "a civilized state," for the purposes of assessing well-being "they need only be divided
                     into two classes, viz. the rich and the poor." Williams suggests that the ambiguity
                     of the term has led to "persistent but confused arguments between those who, using <span style="font-weight:bold">class</span> in the sense of basic relationship, propose two or three basic <span style="font-weight:bold">classes</span>, and those who, trying to use it for descriptive groupings, find they have to break
                     these divisions down into smaller and smaller categories" (<em>Keywords</em> 66–67).

                     </div> Some of this ambiguity and confusion seems to be at work when Austen scholars object
                     to Williams’s claim that Austen failed to see classes because she saw only one class:
                     they are committed to the fine social and economic distinctions at work in her fiction.
                     Williams recognizes these, but wants to disclose through Cobbett an emerging sense
                     of essential economic division that she overlooked, working as she did overwhelmingly
                     on one side of the question—in Cobbett’s terms, on the side of the rich and the consumers
                     and the masters.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of course none of this indicates that Cobbett was correct about a world being reduced
                  to two classes with antithetical interests and experiences, any more than <em>Emma</em> demonstrates that differences between the likes of Emma and Mrs. Elton represent
                  a particularly significant moral or social divide in early nineteenth-century England.
                  And Williams certainly takes for granted that Cobbett witnessed the development of
                  class divisions that became increasingly important features of English society over
                  the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. But what Williams does show,
                  through Cobbett, is that we cannot simply say that Austen failed to represent class,
                  in the sense of basic economic relationship, because no one in the period had such
                  a perception. Waldron notwithstanding, Williams knew well that "bourgeois versus proletarian"
                  were not operative categories in Austen’s time, and he worked as hard as anyone to
                  think <em>historically</em> about class. In doing so, he showed that some of Austen’s contemporaries <em>were</em> coming to think about a society fundamentally divided between adversarial classes.
                  For all we may commend Austen’s extraordinary precision, her social range was meaningfully
                  limited. By drawing a line from Goldsmith and Crabbe through Cobbett to Dickens and
                  Eliot, Williams contends that by the early nineteenth century we have reached a point
                  in English social history where failing to represent ordinary working men and women
                  risks essential oversight.</p>
               <p>With this in mind, there is something haunting about the way Emma seems to approach
                  the shop door of Ford’s expecting that she will primarily see other characters named
                  in the novel (Mr. Perry, Mr. William Cox, Mr. Cole) only to then observe nameless
                  figures (a butcher, an old woman, a group of children) who have no part in the narrative,
                  and in that sense function as setting rather than agent. It is as if the novel fleetingly
                  defies its own expectations, as registered by the heroine. Emma is unperturbed—"she
                  had no reason to complain, and was amused enough" (Austen 183)—but the reader can
                  be forgiven for a sense of surprise at the abrupt appearance of the sort of nameless
                  common people not typically encountered in an Austen novel. And that surprise could
                  foster a recognition of the extent to which reading Jane Austen can be a matter of
                  internalizing her oversights as well as her insights.</p>

                  <p>By contrast with the account of Austen in <em>The Country and the City</em>, Williams’s Past Masters monograph on Cobbett has received scant notice, even in

                     </div> In some sense this is unsurprising, given that <em>Cobbett</em> was published in an Oxford University Press series associated with elementary introductions
                     to a life and works. And yet the book is interpretively ambitious and original. Certainly
                     if Williams had produced a study with similar claims about Blake or Wordsworth, there
                     would be wider notice in Romantic studies. My aim here will not be to offer a comprehensive
                     reading of the volume, but instead pick up on a key strand of my discussion so far:
                     how in writing about Cobbett as a key figure in the early response to industrial capitalism
                     Williams developed particular ways of thinking historically about the literature of
                     the past with respect to the present. The challenge is something Williams confronted
                     as early as 1969, in an introduction to the second volume of <em>The Pelican Book of English Prose</em> that was revised and reprinted in <em>Writing in Society</em> as 
                     “Notes on English Prose, 1780–1950.”
                      The first phase of the literary chronology presents particular challenges of familiarity
                     and distance that entail the whole intervening history of social and economic modernity: <span class="quote">‘We shall see, on closer examination, how much has changed in English prose, but the
                        stress on continuity is worth making at the beginning. The two centuries since 1780
                        are the making of modern Britain. But the connections and the gaps between some of
                        the early and some of the later stages are significant. There are moments when we
                        know Coleridge or Cobbett or Paine or Jane Austen as ancestors: as connected with
                        us in a land and through a language, but across an evident gap of historical time.
                        There are also moments when in a thing seen, a thing said, a thing written in a particular
                        way, we feel not distance but closeness: a man or a woman; a writer; a known experience
                        or idea; a known country. (<em>Writing in Society</em> 67)

                     the Romantic period, that Williams explored this problem of distance and familiarity,
                     of reading across a historical "gap" that presented acute challenges of recognition
                     and understanding. In this sense Cobbett was for Williams the most compelling writer
                     of the Romantic period.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The book opens inauspiciously, with a requisite biographical chapter that recalls
                  <em>Culture and Society</em> in the way it reduces to excerpts and condensed commentary, here, under the heading
                  of years or ranges of years in Cobbett’s life. Williams does introduce "a problem
                  of perspective" that returns throughout, as when he remarks that some of the best-known
                  publications (<em>A Year’s Residence in the United States of America</em>, <em>A Grammar of the English Language</em>) were from a period of exile, 1817 through 1819, when Cobbett returned to America
                  to evade prosecution at home. In their "vigorous plain style" and their sense of an
                  "irrepressible personality," these texts engage modern readers, yet they are written
                  at a distance from the political crisis that shaped Cobbett even as it was shaped
                  by his prose. "Cobbett wrote the books," Williams observes, "but also these years
                  of exposure and practice wrote Cobbett" (19). In the second part of the volume, "Themes,"
                  the challenges of moving back and forth in time become increasingly evident. Cobbett’s
                  claims about property in labor and the right of combination were "cast in conventional
                  terms" and yet pressed to "subversive" conclusions, so as to produce "shock (certainly
                  then; and in some places still)" (32–33). His commitment to a reform of parliament
                  and the poor laws was consistent with "the radicalism of the period," though it found
                  Cobbett "at the edge of his thinking, moving beyond these kinds of change," notably
                  in "his practical affiliation to the great majority of working and poor people" for
                  whom these reforms would eventually prove inadequate (34). In practice Cobbett "was
                  prefiguring the later movement" in working-class activism but he "did not in fact
                  reach its characteristic shaping ideas," notably in his failure to engage "the new
                  kinds of co-operative and collective social provision" that were evident in the work
                  of Paine and Owen (34–35). His "hatred of the great proprietors and manufacturers"
                  fostered his sympathy for emerging labor organization, yet he still adhered to "an
                  old and idealized social model" that had "a limited understanding of the new forces
                  and relations of industrial production" (37). The Cobbett of Past Masters can be as
                  socially and historically blinkered as the Austen of <em>The Country and the City</em>, and this last insight about his animosities and sympathies yields the paradoxical
                  assertion that what limited Cobbett in his own time somehow releases him in our own:
                  "This is one of several instances where Cobbett’s older kind of radicalism . . . is
                  at once limited and partial in his own day yet, in broader terms, still relevant and
                  even prophetic" (37).</p>
               <p>Where the intermediate 
                  “Themes”
                  portion of the volume offers brief topical surveys of Cobbett’s writing on economics,
                  politics, and education, the third and final part, 
                  “Issues,”
                  is more interpretively and analytically comprehensive, bringing together matters that
                  Williams himself returned to throughout his career: "the rural economy in its relation
                  both to a developing industrialism and to the capitalist system and the state" (28).
                  An opening paragraph recasts the problem of historical method as a matter of style
                  and voice: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">One sense of history requires that we see Cobbett in his time: "in his period." We
                     then study his campaigns in relation to the immediate conditions and events that provoked
                     them. We study his ideas within the thinking and prejudices of his day. We applaud
                     and apologise within his time-bound perspective.</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">One sense of writing requires that we see Cobbett both in his time and in ours. His
                     use of language belongs to his time: the condition of English in the early nineteenth
                     century; the social relations within which he developed particular uses—those distinctive
                     combinations of formality and colloquial polemic . . . It is in the grafting of colloquial
                     phrases and oral emphases on to the still formal strengths of the consciously public
                     address of his period that his most distinctive practice can be recognized and defined.
                     Pointing forward, this combination is still extraordinarily readable. Much of his
                     writing still directly engages us: never irrespective of his time but not bound by
                     it either. There are different preferences: for the rural rider; for the democratic
                     pamphleteer; for the practical countryman. Yet all these as a writer: the writing
                     outlasting its occasions. (54–55)</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Again and again in the final phase of the volume, Cobbett is released from the early
                  nineteenth century, even as Williams the cultural critic is released, with kaleidoscopic
                  effect, from writing about the early nineteenth century. Some of this has to do with
                  what the critic regards as valuable about his author. The voice, to be sure, and the
                  way his ideas "jump at us from his pages" so that "we can hear him speaking them,
                  in his usual plain and simple and decided way" (44). Yet if this betrays something
                  uncritical about Williams, what Simpson terms his "appetite for immediacy," much of
                  what is best about the analysis of Cobbett from the opening pages of the volume undermines
                  simple presence through an exploration of bewildering historical contradiction and
                  inconsistency.</p>
               <p>Thus Williams expresses a preference not for Cobbett the farmer and landholder at
                  Botley, but rather for the work of the 1820s, after the loss of the Botley farm and
                  the writer’s establishment of a more "commercial base" at Kensington. Here he set
                  about promulgating subsistence in <em>Cottage Economy</em>, even as he undid such tenets in own commercial practice as a seed farmer and purveyor
                  of nursery trees, and in his authorial practice as a publisher of books mediating
                  any return to the land. As Williams writes of the volume, "It is at once a consciously
                  examined renewal of the elements of a subsistence economy, and yet in the practice
                  and in the writing an enterprise beyond subsistence" (24). Williams foregrounds these
                  contradictions and embraces a similar paradox about the <em>Rural Rides</em>, which record Cobbett "riding out on business, whether in politics or in one of his
                  commercial enterprises" even as he sought "to look, and listen" in ways that evince
                  "the whole man, with whole interests" (<em>Cobbett</em> 24–25). In Blakean fashion, this "whole man" under early capitalism is a riven and
                  contradictory figure, his radical agrarian principles extending out through metropolitan
                  commercial and communicative circuits. The opening of the third and final part of
                  the volume finds Williams acknowledging "different preferences" among different readers
                  of Cobbett, while insisting that the man cannot simply be read "in his period" since
                  "the writing outlasts it occasions."</p>

                        separating his time and ours. Not then this period and that, but a common country,
                        in an actual succession, inheritance, of lives. And not then writing as style: the
                        critical or textual study; but writing as a practice, within this country and inheritance:
                        the giving and taking of energy, in this durable form, to attempt or actually to make
                        new kinds of relationship. William Cobbett as contributing, in this continuing life.
                        (<em>Cobbett</em> 55)’</span> To be sure, the sense of "a common country" and "an actual succession" may give pause,
                     in its geographical restriction, and this early twenty-first century American reader
                     wonders whether Williams’s point may be exclusionary. At the same time, the very inclusion
                     of Cobbett in a Past Masters series that favors the world historical figure, running
                     as it does from Homer, Confucius, Plato, and Jesus through Mohammed, Shakespeare,
                     Marx, and Tolstoy, indicates something provocative about the claim for the local and
                     the immediate.

                  <p>It is worth closing with a consideration of the meaning, in terms of Williams’s own
                     critical and interpretive practice, of a "sense of history" that would understand
                     Cobbett "in his time and in ours," and would connect rather than separate the times
                     in a shared succession and inheritance. There are some extraordinary claims in a section
                     on 
                     “Cobbett and the New England”
                      that follows directly on 
                     “Cobbett and the Old England.”
                      The rural rider experienced "a transforming history" that we tend to package and label
                     as "‘Modern England’; ‘Industrial England’; ‘Industrial-Capitalist England’; ‘Imperial
                     England’" (<em>Cobbett</em> 57). These are some of the terms that counterhistoricist advocates of aesthetic integrity
                     charge Williams with injecting into the era of Cobbett and Austen. But he disavows
                     them here, aligning all such labeling with a subsequent sense "of an achieved state,"
                     which can only regard Cobbett as a "good old chap" who was for all his virtues "not
                     on our road" (57). Rather than fixing Cobbett historically, Williams proposes that
                     we share with him an ongoing experience of a crisis extending from his time to our
                     own: <span class="quote">‘So there can be no indulgent trailing after Cobbett’s ghost; no lifting of his bones.
                        What we can actually learn from him is different, and less flattering: what it is
                        like to be living through a time when an old social order is visibly breaking up but
                        when we do not have the advantage of hindsight to show us the new social order that
                        is succeeding it. This uncertain and restless condition is very characteristic of
                        the most concerned and most passionate men of Cobbett’s own day. It is marked, paradoxically,
                        by intense radical convictions: of the evils of the time, of the depths of its disturbances;
                        of the new thing that must happen, the new life that is coming through. In Cobbett
                        and Blake, in Shelley and Carlyle, for all their individual differences, there is
                        this characteristic intensity and denunciation of what is happening in their world,
                        and also this characteristic confidence that these evils cannot last, that something
                        radically new must come. Yet what came as new, whatever else may be said of it, was
                        not within their line of vision at all; indeed was in many of its elements only an
                        intensification of what they had denounced. (58)

                                 of Tom Paine, which Williams discusses earlier in the book (20–21).</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> For literary readers, the company of Blake, Shelley, and Carlyle seems to raise Cobbett’s
                     stature, so it is worth insisting again that Williams proceeds from quite different
                     assumptions. Cobbett was in fact the leading figure among a group of Romantic-period
                     visionaries who contested without fully comprehending the early impact of industrial
                     capitalism.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Williams’s recognition, towards the end of his life, that his own understanding of
                  the situation in the 1980s looking ahead might be no better than Cobbett’s in the
                  1820s is as poignant as it is bracing. And yet that is not his final point. Rather,
                  he stresses shared historical experience and expectation across the centuries: <span class="quote">‘But if we have any sense of history we cannot . . . forget the picture we have been
                     given: of those earlier people who were struggling, bravely enough, with forces they
                     did not understand. We may suppose we can exempt ourselves from this likely deficiency.
                     Indeed that vanity is often the condition of hope. But what we can not reasonably
                     do is miss the community of situation: an old order breaking up; uncertainty and restlessness,
                     but in these men radical convictions, that certain new things must happen. (59)’</span> The later pages of the <em>Cobbett</em> volume are remarkable for the way they draw on this acknowledgment in order to freely
                  read, analyze, and engage "in his time and in ours," through a series of searching
                  critical explorations that escape period restriction, with William Cobbett everywhere
                  in evidence as a challenging yet affirming presence. Thus an account of the amplification
                  of "the organizing and organized labour movement" in the later nineteenth century
                  leads into a consideration of the uneven development of socialism, and of the "complacency"
                  with which new movements often regard an earlier history, confident that social and
                  economic relations are about to be improved and harmonized, somehow transforming the
                  "Great Britain Ltd" of the twentieth century into "Great Britain, the Modern and Caring
                  Society." Instead, persistent crisis yields a current situation where cynical voices
                  "speak of the forced ‘de-industrialisation’ of Britain." Meanwhile disruptive economic
                  change continues unabated and "Great Britain in either of its versions exports capital
                  and imports weapons of mass destruction, while settling to an apparently unending
                  period of widespread unemployment and redundancy" (71). The insistence, which becomes
                  a kind of refrain, that it "cannot be Cobbett who shows us any way out of this deep
                  failure" is less a critique of his limitations than a bleak reflection on our own.
                  To my mind, the third part of <em>Cobbett</em> is as compelling as anything in Williams’s later prose. And the problem in overlooking
                  Williams’s writing on Cobbett is less what we fail to learn about Cobbett than what
                  we miss about Raymond Williams.</p>

               that while "Williams provides indispensable analytical tools and historical sensibilities
               for reflections on empire, race, color, gender and sexual orientation, the relative
               silences in his work on these issues bear the stamp of his own intellectual and existential

               their work in these years. He acknowledges that "if I had read <em>The Making of the English Working Class</em> when I was writing <em>Culture in Society</em>, it would have been a very different book," and specifically indicates a desire to
               have written about "the extraordinary transposition of varieties of radicalism that
               occurred between 1790 and 1840—which I never mentioned in the book" (108). Given Cobbett’s
               prominent role in <em>Making</em>, the "very different book" Williams posits would likely have involved a very different

               to "<em>imaginative writing</em>" (185–86). His own work is what he identifies as a challenge to the narrowing sense
               of literature "by concepts of <em>writing</em> and <em>communication</em> which seek to recover the most active and general senses which the extreme specialization
               had seemed to include" (<em>Keywords</em> 187). At the same time, his practice retained "literature" and the "literary" in
               broad senses, and in the <em>Politics and Letters</em> interview on <em>The Country and the City</em>, the interviewer identifies a range of conceptions of literature, from a "record
               of human experience" and "a response" to "a dramatization of values" (303).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Although Austen scholars and "literary" readers tend to object to the <em>distinction</em> Williams makes when he places the two writers on opposite sides of a park wall, there
               is reason to suspect that the offense may lie instead in a contaminating lack of distinction,
               and in the leveling audacity that would discuss Austen and Cobbett in the same breath
               and reach this conclusion: "Cobbett and Jane Austen mark two ways of seeing, contrasted
               viewpoints, within the same county" (<em>Country</em> 118). See, for example, Jonathan Bate’s discussion of Austen (with Hardy) in the
               opening chapter of <em>Song of the Earth</em>, which comes, by way of Williams, to the geographical proximity of Austen and Cobbett,
               but immediately works to distinguish the two on the grounds of the bluntness and aggressiveness
               of Cobbett’s distinction between "a resident <em>native</em> gentry" and those who profit from the soil at a distance: <span class="quote">‘Jane Austen explores exactly the same distinction between good stewardship and absenteeism,
                  though by example and not by polemic. And she is more discriminating in her judgements:
                  where Cobbett flails indiscriminately at all the representatives of new money—financial
                  speculators, nabobs and negro-drivers, generals and admirals—Austen is more doubtful
                  about some (Sir Thomas Bertram, the bad father who has bought Mansfield Park on the
                  proceeds of his sugar plantations in Antigua) but robustly defensive of others (admiral
                  Croft, the good husband who in <em>Persuasion</em> rents Kellynch Hall on the proceeds of his successes during the Napoleonic Wars).
                  Knightley is her prime example of the "resident <em>native</em> gentry, attached to the soil." (Bate 7–8)’</span>Leaving aside all that may be problematic about "the proceeds of . . . successes during
               the Napoleonic Wars," it is possible to share Bates’s concerns about the extremes
               of Cobbett’s invective, and allow a romance reader’s affection for the likes of Knightley
               and Mr. Darcy, while still appreciating Williams’s insistence that we consider the
               perspective and condition of ordinary English laborers and in doing so recognize the
               dispossession, condescension, and dehumanization that is embedded in the very idea
               of a virtuous "resident <em>native</em> gentry," regardless of whether it is politely or crudely conceived.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
