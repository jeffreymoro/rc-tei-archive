                <p rend="noCount">This volume considers the place of Romantic works and the Romantic 
                    period itself in the work of one of the most important twentieth-century theorists 
                    of culture, Raymond Williams. Few works have generated as much critical thinking about 
                    Romantic writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as <title level="m">Culture and 
                        Society: 1780–1950</title> (1958), <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961), 
                    or <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), but, as these essays 
                    suggest, many of Williams’s other works have a more oblique yet equally powerful 
                    relationship to Romanticism’s moment.  After an introduction that pays particular 
                    attention to central concepts passed down from Williams like "structure of feeling" 
                    and "cultural formation," these essays revisit Williams over thirty years after his 
                    death to reconsider his bearing on particular Romantic authors or broader 
                    sociohistorical processes in order to ask how his work helps us ask questions 
                    about the contemporary university and the place of the humanities within it.</p>

            <p>Why read Raymond Williams now? This is certainly not the first time this question has
                been asked. Shortly after Williams’s sudden death in 1988, Simon During wondered
                whether that event marked "the end of an era" or "the sign of a beginning set in
                motion by the program, the shifts of emphasis, he urged" (681). Ultimately, we might
                now say that his death was both an end and a beginning. Cultural Studies, whose
                contours, possibilities, and limitations were so much a part of the early debate
                that followed Williams’s death, has now become an established, if not dominant,
                component of literary studies. The wide range of its approaches has meant that
                Williams’s assumptions about culture have pollinated various forms of analysis
                rooted in understandings of culture’s centrality to nation, empire, ecosystem, and
                to identities formed around race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, and
                disability. Most of these approaches, except for class, were met with relative
                silence in his own corpus. But literary and cultural work today remains indebted to
                the quality Williams attributed to Brecht and which applies to his own work as well:
                an unparalleled capacity for "the ‘complex seeing’ of a multivalent and both dynamic
                and uncertain social process" (<title level="m">Politics of Modernism</title> 91).</p>
            <p>This collection addresses Williams’s long and complex relationship to Romantic works
                and to the Romantic period itself. Few works have generated as much critical
                thinking about Romantic writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as
                <title level="m">Culture and Society: 1780–1950</title> (1958),
                <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961), or <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title> (1973), but many of Williams’s other
                works have spoken to Romanticism’s moment in different keys that our essays explore
                as well. Such reflection comes at a time today when Williams’s methods and legacy
                have come under new critical pressure. From one angle, critics like Joseph North
                have used Williams to stand for the domination over "criticism" by the
                "historical-contextualist" method he is credited (or blamed) for building. From a
                different angle, Williams’s legacy is now said to belong to the party of "critique"
                whose dark materialism appears to negate literature’s pleasures and other affects of
                many kinds.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph North’s lengthy attack in
                    <title level="m">Literary Criticism</title> indicts
                            Williams’s fostering of historical-social "scholarship" against the mode
                            of literary "criticism" that North seeks to revive from I. A. Richards
                            (62–68). Rita Felski and others have argued a roughly analogous
                            opposition between new modes of textual reading or literary affect and
                            historical-political interpretation, as in her <title level="m">Limits
                                of Critique</title>.</note>These new vectors of disciplinary
                debate, reasserting divides between the personal and historical, the critical and
                scholarly, are tacitly but unmistakably at issue in the perspectives on Williams’s
                work we present here.</p>
            <p>The work of Raymond Williams has by no means become dated by, or limited to, the
                moments of its emergence in the 1950s and 60s. In recent years a range of scholars
                have been moving the legacy of Williams in new directions, some surprising or
                unforeseen. Lauren Berlant, for one, uses Williams’s concept of "structure of
                feeling" to construct her materialist version of affect theory, tracking what she
                calls "the becoming historical of the affective event and the improvisation of genre
                amid pervasive uncertainty" (6). Within this process, "affective responses" come "to
                exemplify shared <emph>historical</emph> time" (Berlant 15). Lisa 
                Lowe also uses Williams’s structure of feeling and his related
                framing of dominant, residual, and emergent forms of culture to produce a
                materialist understanding of intimacy, one that pluralizes intimacy to produce what
                she calls a "political economy" of intimacies (Lowe 18). But affect theory is not
                the only way that Williams continues to inflect contemporary work. At the opposite
                end of the spectrum, we might also read his sociology of culture as shaping the
                ambitions of approaches like "cultural analytics" and other computational models
                that aim to show how new digital techniques like network analysis can expand the
                scale and scope of the way we study cultural forms (Dunst).</p>
            <p>By almost universal agreement, Williams’s writings represent an argument for the
                centrality of "culture" in literary, social, and political analysis, and it is
                around the turn of the nineteenth century, as his accounts repeatedly insist, that
                the Enlightenment idea of culture thickens, as it were, and through variations and
                complications begins to build into itself the contradictions of its development. We
                see this argument emerge initially in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                (1958) and develop through <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961) and
                beyond as Williams distinguishes between two interrelated ideas of culture: first,
                as the development of an achieved social order akin to civilization as presented in
                eighteenth-century universal histories and later challenged by Rousseau and Marx,
                among others; and second, a related but distinct concept of culture found in the
                common rituals of everyday life and what Williams repeatedly calls "a whole way of
                life."</p>

            <p>Several of our essays assert, while others imply, an important shift in Williams’s
                career between earlier work like <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, where
                he is grappling with the English moral and formalist criticism in which he had been
                trained, and a later stage typified by works like
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977), where he
                brings to fruition the new theory and methods of cultural materialism. In our
                lead-off essay, "Williams and the Romantic Turn," James Chandler argues that
                Williams’s engagement with Romanticism as a category belongs more clearly to the
                first phase of his career than the second, as both <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> query and challenge
                the Romantic figure of the creative poet galvanizing "imagination" to distance us
                from everyday life, promising access to a "superior reality" instead (<title 
                    level="m">Long Revolution</title> 32). Chandler turns his argument on a rich,
                surprising reading one of Williams’s least-cited books,
                <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1966), where the
                dialectical movement of categories like Romanticism, liberalism, and drama form an
                unexpectedly decisive turning point for Romanticism’s place in modern cultural
                history. In what Chandler calls the sociological turn in Williams’ thinking after
                1966, the moment of 1800 would remain an important pivot in the cultural history of
                modernity, but it was now understood as caught up in many movements and modes of
                writing beyond the traditional Romantic canon itself. What should be done, this
                volume asks in turn, with Williams’s several legacies?</p>
            <p>The essays collected here respond to this challenge in a variety of ways, though all
                reflect on how we should read Romanticism in light of Williams’s early and late
                work. Some, like those of Kevin Gilmartin, Mary Favret, and Brian McGrath, seek to
                open up a reconsideration of Williams through attention to his particular treatment
                of Romantic authors like Jane Austen, William Cobbett, and William Wordsworth.
                Others, like those by Thora Brylowe and Paul Keen, use Williams’s legacy to take
                stock of current conversations on the situation of university study and the place of
                the humanities within it. Meanwhile, Jon Mee’s essay puts into question Williams’s
                way of counterposing "culture" to "industrialism" as a basis for thinking in broader
                terms about the meanings and inflections of materialism, both in its historical
                manifestation in Romantic era intellectual life and in critical methods arising from
                Williams’s work. Some essays make renewed use of Williams’s best-known work, like
                <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> or <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title>, while others turn fresh and vigorous attention to his less
                cited contributions, such as <title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title>, <title level="m">Television</title>, or Williams’s
                slim Past Masters volume, <title level="m">Cobbett</title>. Literary questions—of
                narrative, grammar, style, medium, form—claim central attention in these essays.
                What unites them too is an awareness of the complexity and vitality of Williams’s
                approach to culture and an admiration for his sustained attempts to develop a method
                for studying culture appropriate to its capacity for mobility and change. Building
                from this work, our introduction provides a context for the essays to follow while
                also offering an argument of its own by raising further questions on the
                methodological side of Williams’s <emph>oeuvre</emph>.</p>
            <p>Williams argued for a concept of "structure of feeling" as early as his 1954
                <title level="m">Preface to Film</title> (cowritten with Michael
                Orrom), and the term appears casually in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                before being developed more seriously as a concept from <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title> onward. The inflections and implications of the term changed
                over time, but Williams consistently used it to capture the dynamic between the
                personal and the historical, the means by which a complex set of relationships
                reveal unexpected correspondences and discontinuities, thus precipitating, as it
                were, distinct elements of contact out of the history "in solution" of a complex
                    whole.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an early extended account of
                        the "structure of feeling" see <title level="m">Long Revolution</title>
                        (67–70), but the phrase originated, as Chandler points out in his essay, in
                        Williams and Orrem’s 1954 <title level="m">Preface 
                            to Film</title>.</note> He argued that it is in the arts of a 
                period that these elements are grasped most
                distinctively. As David Simpson put it in a 1995 essay, "Williams seems to want to
                offer art and literature as the most complex barometer of movement at the
                ideological level, and to propose the structure of feeling as a kind of
                super-sensitive indicator of such movement" (17). Within Romantic studies, the work
                of Kevis Goodman and Mary Favret has done as much as anyone’s to read this
                barometer. They use it to locate, as Goodman puts it in her book on the georgic,
                "that immanent, collective perception of any moment as a seething mix of unsettled
                elements," while reminding us that by "feeling" Williams meant especially the
                "unpleasurable sensations of ‘disturbance, blockage, tension’" (Goodman 3, 70).
                Their work and that of others show that culture and the historical present is always
                on the move, part of a process that must necessarily be grasped historically, though
                it is also pervasive below the threshold of articulation.</p>
            <p>But there was also a complex evolution in the concept of "structure of feeling" over
                the course of Williams’s career. From its earliest formulations in the 1950s and
                early 60s, Williams found the structure of feeling visible in texts, "at the edge of
                semantic availability" in drama, films, or novels. Whether it was Chekhov’s
                particular structure of feeling in
                <title level="m">Drama from Ibsen to Brecht</title> or Elizabeth
                Gaskell’s version in the industrial novels Williams studied in <title level="m">The
                    Long Revolution</title>, he located a structure of feeling in the works of
                individual writers and the literary conventions they either changed or introduced.
                Meanwhile the social sources of this feeling were inchoate, arising out of what he
                called "deep community," "the culture of a period," or, in his widest formulation,
                the "living result of all the elements in the [social] organization"
                (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title>64–65). What was not
                specified was how exactly the minute particulars of a structure of feeling were
                connecting to the widest social realm.</p>
            <p>Those ways of thinking about the structure of feeling were significantly altered when
                Williams’s work took a more explicitly sociological turn with <title 
                    level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977) or in his last completed 
                work, <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title> (1981). <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title> devoted several intensive pages to the structure of feeling,
                and here for the first time the idea is pluralized as "<title level="m">structures</title> 
                of feeling" (128–35, our emphasis). The plural changes the
                meaning and scope of the concept in several key directions. There is a telling shift
                from single writers to groups of writers or cultural producers—to what Williams
                began calling in another chapter "cultural formations" (138). While there is the
                same emphasis on "social experiences in solution," the terms of analysis are now far
                more precise. There is a new concreteness to specifying such structures in history
                beyond the individual writer or text, as Williams now speaks of "the complex
                relation of differentiated structures of feeling to differentiated classes" and
                other senses in which structures of feeling gain their affective force from highly
                particularized historical encounters
                (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 134).</p>
            <p>Williams’s characteristic and unparalleled ability to thicken
                the historical experience of his subjects comes through clearly in Kevin Gilmartin’s
                essay, <title level="a">‘In His Time and in Ours’: Reading Cobbett (and Jane Austen) with Raymond
                Williams.</title> For Gilmartin, Williams offers a properly literary reading of Cobbett’s
                work, one attuned to Cobbett’s style in a manner that shows how historical method
                itself can be understood as a matter of style. More particularly, Cobbett allows
                Williams to reflect on historical process and "unanticipated historical experience."
                Such contingency then becomes, through Williams’s comparison of Cobbett with Jane
                Austen in the <title level="a">Three around Farnham</title> chapter of <title level="m">The Country and
                    the City</title>, an encouragement to think historically about class. In
                Gilmartin’s account, we can see Williams’s earlier emphasis on shared historical
                experience transform into a more sophisticated understanding of the particularities
                of class, the institutional structures of culture, and the historical contingencies
                that make the relationship between class and culture so particular and complex.</p>
             <p>Mary Favret’s essay, <title level="a">Raymond Williams on Jane Austen, Again,</title>
                 also takes up Williams’s account of Austen from the <title level="a">Three 
                     around Farnham</title> chapter in an effort to grasp the motion and 
                 movement of historical experience. She suggests
                that Williams repeatedly presents Austen as a "static" writer, a subject whose
                contours can be taken as a given, but that the fixity of Williams’s account of
                Austen then sets his analysis of Cobbett and others into motion. Making her case at
                the level of the word, the sentence, the paragraph, and attending even to the look
                of the page in Williams’s published work, Favret registers the acute peculiarities
                of closeness and distance, of scale generally, through her toggling between the
                semantic units of Williams’s writing, especially as they bear on qualities of vision
                and seeing. For Favret, even the page itself in Williams’s work functions as an
                image that needs to be navigated and mapped by the eye. This visual emphasis sets up
                a pivot in Favret’s essay from Williams’s literary analysis in <title level="m">The
                    Country and the City</title> to his theorization of media in works like 
                 <title level="m">Television: Technology and Cultural Form</title>. What happens to
                Austen, Favret asks, when we look at her work through the terms Williams develops
                for new media and focus on motion, temporality, and tempo rather than the visual and
                spatial terms that Williams uses to "fix" Austen in behind her wall? Favret’s
                reading of Austen’s adaptation for screen stands also as a salutary reminder of how
                reading Williams, even against the grain, can produce new perspectives on seemingly
                familiar Romantic texts.</p>

            <p>In its subtle shifts of meaning as Williams develops the idea of a "structure of
                feeling" across his earlier work to his subsequent reflection on the term’s
                usefulness in the
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> interviews of 1979, we
                can see how the expression evolved from understanding culture as something rooted in
                "experience" to a conception of culture as produced by "practices." "It took me a
                long time," he told his
                <title level="m">New Left Review</title> interviewers, "to find
                the key move to the notion of cultural production as itself material"
                (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 139). First
                fleshed out in his essay <title level="a">Base and Superstructure in 
                    Marxist Cultural Theory</title> (1973), the concept of cultural 
                production permitted an enormous range of materials
                to enter the purview of cultural analysis, from writing to visual and electronic
                media, offering a more theoretical basis for what cultural studies, then still a
                British set of critical practices, was already doing on the ground. Though this
                notion sometimes obscured the place of economic determinations in classical Marxist
                terms, Williams defended "cultural production" as a concept that did not make
                production less important than culture, but more important and pervasive than the
                base/superstructure model could ever allow (<title level="m">Politics and
                    Letters</title> 145). And what he had earlier sometimes attributed to a
                preanalytical category of naïve experience was now to be found in what he called
                "the common character of the respective processes of production" (139).</p>
             <p>As Brian McGrath notes in his essay, <title level="a">Determination in the Passive 
                 Voice (Wordsworth and Williams),</title> the chapter <title 
                     level="a">Determination</title> comes just after the <title level="a">Base
                         and Superstructure</title> chapter in <title level="m">Marxism and 
                             Literature</title> and before Williams’s creative 
                 rethinking of "Productive Forces." McGrath turns from these texts to tarry with 
                 Williams’s <title level="m">Keywords</title> (1976) as his point of
                departure for teasing out the meanings of <emph>determine</emph> in
                Romantic poetry and Marxism alike, putting equal pressure on Romanticism’s
                freedom-seeking lyrical "I" and Marx’s senses of determination by wider forces.
                Citing Williams’s provocative phrase "I am determined not to be determined," McGrath
                follows the paradox into Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Prelude</title> and tracks the
                grammatical pattern the Romantic poet shared with Williams himself, a strategic
                recourse to the passive voice. Here, we might say, the structure of feeling is
                "determined" insofar as it is simultaneously shaping and being shaped, with the
                inflection of both activity and passivity that McGrath draws out in Wordsworth and
                Williams.</p>
             <p>Many of the implications of "cultural production" are not fleshed out in <title 
                 level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, a work of theory, but rather in his
                 counterpart manual on methods in <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title>,
                where Williams asks more pointed questions about the material "means of cultural
                production" and about who produces culture and how. One salient idea impressed on
                him by Lucien Goldmann’s work was that cultural production takes place most
                importantly not at the level of individual writer and his relation to some "abstract
                group," as in mainstream sociology, but rather between "individuals in real and
                collective social relations" (<title level="a">Literature and 
                    Sociology</title> 23). For Williams this came
                to mean thinking about production as carried out by highly particularized groups.
                His expression for these groups—"cultural formations"—has hardly ever been cited in
                this specific sense, in part because each term has so many wider uses that the
                phrase does not indicate how specific and useful it actually is. Such formations
                were not unknown to earlier kinds of literary history: they include "conscious
                movements and tendencies (literary, artistic, philosophical or scientific) which can
                usually be readily discerned after their formative productions" (<title 
                    level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 119). But the new conception pushes Williams
                further away from grand synthetic categories like "Romanticism" and closer to
                particular clusters whose members combined shared aesthetic and social aims. He
                gestures briefly in <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title> to a Godwin
                circle in the 1790s, a later Shelley formation, the pre-Raphaelites, and the
                Bloomsbury group of the 1920s, but the idea clearly has a far wider potential range
                than these familiar kinds of circles or coteries.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Recent work on coteries, circles, and related groups in the 
                    Romantic age has not generally made use of Williams’s framing of "cultural 
                    formations." A cogent exception is Jeffrey Cox, <title level="m">Poetry and
                                Politics in the Cockney School</title> (60–64).</note> Williams’s 
                 theoretically elaborated reworking of
                such groupings under the heading of "cultural formation" both investigates the
                internal complexities of such groups and maps them onto wider social dynamics.</p>
             <p>A reconceived idea of such cultural formations appears in Jon Mee’s 
                 essay, <title level="a">Raymond Williams, Industrialism, and Romanticism, 
                     1780–1850.</title> Arguing that Williams’s idea
                of industrialization remained abstract and unexamined, Mee shows how his later
                methods of cultural materialism can be used to locate a far greater complexity in
                the relations between literary production and industrialism. Rather than a
                centralized group working in cities like London, Mee studies the northern English
                writers who formed durable networks through the new literary and philosophical
                societies from Newcastle and York to Manchester and Liverpool, forging what Mee
                calls the "transpennine enlightenment" that led from the Rational Dissenters of the
                1780s to Elizabeth Gaskell and Robert Owen in the 1840s. The methodological gambit
                of his essay is to link Williams’s materialist methods of immanent critique to
                Latour’s tools of network analysis, following the "pattern of recurring links" that
                such writers forged in a particular structure of feeling underlying this English
                "culture of improvement." Beyond urban circles, Mee’s revisionary transpennine
                cultural formation reveals new dimensions possible to follow from Williams’s own
                conception.</p>
            <p>Locating and studying such cultural formations became Williams’s method for
                confronting what his late work called the "central problem" of literary and cultural
                analysis—how to understand "the specific relationships through which works are made
                and move" ("Uses" 28). In the 1986 essay <title level="a">The Uses of 
                    Cultural Theory,</title> he located theoretical ancestry for posing this 
                question in the "sociological poetics" of Medvedev, Bakhtin, and others 
                who challenged the Russian Formalists in the 1920s.
                Against notions of an abstract intertextuality, Williams cites what he took to be a
                crucial passage from Medvedev: "Works can only enter into real contact as
                inseparable elements of social intercourse . . . It is not works that come into
                contact, but people, who, however, come into contact through the medium of works"
                (qtd. in <title level="a">Uses</title> 29).</p>
            <p>This relation of works and actors was for Williams the matrix of the cultural
                formation. In these later writings, the terms <emph>collaborative</emph>
                and <emph>collaboration</emph> received increasingly strong emphasis as he
                also pushed harder against the figures of Romantic author, the solitary cultural
                producer, and the enthronement of the modern critic. Impressed at how cogently
                Goldmann’s work was encouraging him to think about cultural production as "an active
                and collaborative critical process," he recalled that his most critically embattled
                book, <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, had been written with "a crucial
                absence of collaboration" (<title level="a">Literature and Sociology</title> 24).</p>
            <p>Our final two essays draw on Williams’s later work to reflect on collaborative
                processes as they bear on the state of the contemporary academy. For Paul Keen in
                <title level="a">New Maps: Raymond Williams’s Radical Humanism,</title> Williams’s 
                method maps culture in part by consistently resisting the allure of theoretical 
                abstraction in its revision of Marxist theory as Williams emphasizes the 
                concreteness and sense of complexity needed to grasp the contradictory 
                character of Romantic era writing. Keen stresses some of the difficulties in 
                coming to grips with Williams’s skeptical way of "unlearning" past versions of 
                formalism or Marxism, as for instance the extensive previous reading in theory 
                required to grasp the interlaced arguments in <title level="m">Marxism and 
                    Literature</title>. Keen assesses the pertinence of
                relevant work by Edward Said, Timothy Brennan, and Georg Lukacs for thinking about
                Williams’s characteristic way of configuring cultural critique. Granted these
                challenges in reading Williams now, Keen also stresses the value of the
                "unflinchingly dialectical nature of Williams’s work" for the public role of the
                humanities today and the critical tools needed for confronting the digital
                revolution, the crisis of the humanities, and related forms of contemporary
                complexity.</p>
             <p>In her chapter, <title level="a">Book History and the 
                 Politics of Work and World,</title> Thora Brylowe too
                hopes to show the relevance of Williams for newer methodologies and questions.
                Emphasizing the central concept of labor for making sense of literature itself and
                the academic contexts in which it is studied, Brylowe underscores how Williams can
                help us to elicit the political urgency in newer methodologies like her preferred
                concept of "media ecology." Her essay stresses the collaborative, labor-based
                processes responsible for producing books and other artifacts of culture, the "hands
                and minds who never wrote a word," to demonstrate how abstractions like literature
                are produced in bookstores, libraries, papermills, coal mines, and (today) server
                farms. Brylowe, in other words, uses Williams to ask about the particular people who
                make the media through which words and works are transmitted, as well as to show the
                specific material processes that produce and circulate artifacts that contain
                information, imaginative content, and/or ideas.</p>
            <p>Cultural formations entailed rich and thoughtful modes of collaboration, but
                Williams’s idea of how their cooperative work clarified the problem of structures of
                feeling remained a work in progress by the time of his death. We want to conclude by
                citing a telling passage from the last chapters of <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title>:
            <quote>Something new happens in the very process of conscious co-operation. . . . But it is
                from just this realization that the second and more difficult sense of a collective
                subject is developed. This goes beyond conscious co-operation—collaboration—to
                effective social relations in which, even while individual projects are being
                pursued, what is being drawn on is trans-individual, not only in the sense of shared
                (initial) forms and experiences, but in the specifically creative sense of new
                responses and formation. This is obviously more difficult to find evidence for, but
                the practical question is whether the alternative hypothesis of categorically
                separate or isolated authors is compatible with the quite evident creation, in
                particular places and at particular times, of specific new forms and structures of
                feeling. (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 195)</quote>
               Passages like this, along with his later work in <title level="m">The Politics of
                    Modernism</title>, show Williams still experimenting with new ways to think through
                the connections between feeling, perception, and social being, and how they might be
                located between cultural producers at work on shared projects and a wider, emergent
                social awareness that is still unformed. It is worth recalling, of course, that his
                idea of cooperation was informed by a long socialist tradition of regarding
                cooperation in the labor process as vital to any creative overcoming of exploited
                labor, a meaning sometimes lost in more facile thinking about collaborative work
                today. We might also take Williams’ term "trans-individual" in another sense not
                available to Williams in his time, since the word evokes a notion of interpersonal
                networks in ways that earlier terms like collective consciousness may not. All these
                questions arise in Williams’s work at a time when Romantic-period scholars are
                searching for conceptions of cooperative authorship, constructive social networks,
                and other forms and interconnective means of producing cultural projects, whether
                literary ones at the turn of the nineteenth century, or scholarly ones in the early
                twenty-first. The essays in this collection speak with imagination and power as well
                as with different minds about such matters; we think they will be immensely
                suggestive about ways to think with the work of Raymond Williams once again now.</p>
