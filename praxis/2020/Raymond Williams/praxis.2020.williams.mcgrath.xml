            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">The problem of determination takes particular shape during the nineteenth
                    century, as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept of
                    determination from Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the ways
                    preexisting conditions fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as 
                    <emph>determined</emph> comes also to mean "unwavering" or "persistent").
                    In this essay I track these two competing definitions of <emph>determined</emph> through 
                    the writing of Raymond Williams and William Wordsworth.
                    As critical concepts open to caricature, Romanticism and Marxism are sometimes
                    placed in tension: where Romanticism prioritizes the power of the individual will,
                    Marxism prioritizes the external forces that condition it. But the texts we choose
                    to read closely often challenge the characterizations we bring to bear on them.
                    Williams, for instance, struggles against Marxism’s focus on economic determinism
                    and Wordsworth concludes Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—a poem that
                    celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the importance of
                    "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In this way, both
                    writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses of
                    "determination" in their work. In placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests
                    turn grammatical, for Williams and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice
                    in their writing about determination. If both writers share an interest in
                    determination and its various and competing connotations, what can we learn about
                    the concept from attending to the grammatical, even stylistic, choices writers make
                    when writing about determination?</p>

            <div type="section">
            <p>A few years ago the institution that employs me put together an advertising campaign
                that I enjoy imagining as Hegel-inspired. For purposes of attracting donations and
                student applications, the campaign’s featured slogan, "Determined Spirit," describes
                a shared, tenacious drive. And indeed, Clemson students often win awards for what
                gets called "school spirit." But given the various and sometimes competing senses of
                "determined," the slogan also introduces the possibility that "spirit" at Clemson is
                expected, even compulsory. A determined spirit, in other words, is also a
                predetermined spirit, a spirit determined in advance.</p>
            <p>In his <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Raymond Williams explores the complex range
                of definitions associated with the word <emph>determine</emph> as he
                focuses on the distinction between determination and determinism, where the word 
                <emph>determination</emph> refers to an unwavering individual will and the
                word <emph>determinism</emph> refers to the opposite, a will caught up in
                general processes beyond its control. Williams writes that even the most insistent
                and pseudoauthoritative application of one fixed sense of the word <emph>determined</emph> 
                cannot avoid the other line of meaning. He illustrates the potential difficulty 
                <emph>determine</emph> introduces with the sentence, "I am determined not
                to be determined," where the two meanings of determine vie for control (<title 
                    level="m">Keywords</title> 102). On the one hand, the "I" of the sentence is
                resolved to remain free from determination, free from all constraints, bounds, and
                definitions. In this way the "I" pursues a model sovereignty. On the other hand, the
                sentence also suggests that this pursuit of a model sovereignty is already and from
                the start determined, a sign of the subject’s unfreedom; there may be nothing less
                free than the subject’s supposedly free pursuit of freedom. And even these two broad
                interpretations of Williams’s sentence do not exhaust the interpretive
                possibilities, which is one of the reasons he offers it. One might still stress how
                the sentence produces an "I" that is resolved to be unresolved, an "I" that would
                prefer not to act and will say "no" to making any and all future decisions: "I am
                determined not to have to determine anything (myself)." Or perhaps this "I" has been
                determined this way, an "I" destined for indetermination: as if Williams had in mind
                Melville’s Bartleby or were commenting on the Supreme Court under Chief Justice
                Roberts. Needless to say, the sentence is not easy to translate, though as an
                experiment I did type the sentence into Google Translate and received this sentence
                in German, "Ich bin entschlossen, nicht bestimmt zu sein," which takes care of some
                of the difficulty <emph>determined</emph> introduces into English by
                translating one use of <emph>determined</emph> as <foreign 
                    xml:lang="de">entschlossen</foreign> and the other as <foreign 
                        xml:lang="de">bestimmt</foreign>. If one
                feeds this German translation back into Google Translate one receives in return: "I
                am determined not to be specific." Not uninteresting, but not quite the same.</p>
            <p>For Williams, the problem of determination takes particular shape during the
                nineteenth century, as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept
                of determination from Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the
                ways preexisting conditions fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as
                    <emph>determined</emph> comes also to mean "unwavering" or
                "persistent," and as the idea of the sovereign individual, the lyric "I," takes
                shape). William Keach develops this line of thinking in <title level="m">Arbitrary
                    Power</title>, where he remarks on the importance of determination to the
                nineteenth century: "Whether as a question of the ‘general will’ of the polis or of
                the individual will of a political agent or writer, ‘determination’ structures
                nineteenth-century efforts to understand the constitution of society and culture"
                    (22).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On determination, historicism, and Romanticism, 
                        see also Chandler 36. On determination and aesthetic and medical discourse,

                        earlier draft of this essay.</note> My interests are in part historical. 
                With Williams’s attention in mind to the
                importance of determination as a concept during the nineteenth century and his
                attention to the ways its meaning shifts, I turn to Book I of William Wordsworth’s
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, which features the word <emph>determined</emph> 
                at several key moments. As Wordsworth begins his biographical
                poem, he wonders whether he was determined by some external force to be a poet and
                whether he is determined enough to become one. In this essay I track these two
                competing definitions of <emph>determined</emph> through the writing of
                Williams and Wordsworth, a Marxist cultural critic on the one hand and a Romantic
                poet on the other. As critical concepts open to caricature, Romanticism and Marxism
                are sometimes placed in tension: where Romanticism prioritizes the power of the
                individual will, Marxism prioritizes the external forces that condition it. But the
                texts we choose to read closely often challenge the characterizations we bring to
                bear on them. Williams, for instance, struggles against Marxism’s focus on economic
                determinism, and Wordsworth concludes Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—a
                poem that celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the
                importance of "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In
                this way, both writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses
                of "determination" in their work.</p>
            <p>But in placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests turn grammatical, for
                Williams and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice in their writing about
                determination. They also both frequently employ empty grammatical subjects when
                writing about determination, which has the effect of making the subject of a key
                sentence about determination itself difficult to determine. Some of the interpretive
                problems posed by Williams’s sentence ("I am determined not to be determined") might
                be described in grammatical terms: is the first-person pronoun the agent of the
                action (in which case the sentence is read as active voice) or is some other,
                unnamed subject the agent of the action (in which case the sentence is read as
                passive voice)? The difference emerges when one rewrites the sentence, for instance,
                as "I am determined (by my class) not to be determined." If both writers share an
                interest in determination and its various and competing connotations, what can we
                learn about the concept from attending to the grammatical, even stylistic, choices
                writers make when writing about determination?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
            <head>No Problem More Difficult</head>
             <p>In <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, Williams begins his chapter
                 <title level="a">Determination</title> by identifying the term’s importance to 
                 Marxism: "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is more difficult, 
                 than that of ‘determination’" (83). Williams attempts to rescue Marxism 
                 from too rigid an emphasis on determination
                without, however, giving up on the importance of the term to cultural theory in
                general. As he concludes the first paragraph: "A Marxism without some concept of
                determination is in effect worthless. A Marxism with many of the concepts of
                determination it now has is quite radically disabled"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 83). Today, given developments
                in disability studies, the subtle personification of Marxism as "radically disabled"
                is difficult to ignore and worth attending to. But Williams is attempting to
                navigate between, for him, two undesirable versions of Marxism, neither capable of
                developing an adequate cultural theory: one without any concept of determination and
                one with too rigid a concept of determination.</p>
            <p>Williams attempts to rescue Marx from Marxism, as he objects to the ways determinism
                became widely known, in Marxism, as "economism" (which Williams describes as
                "worthless" [<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86]). Certain
                versions of Marxism, and certain poor readers of Marx, totalize determinism as
                economism and mistakenly erase from Marx any idea of direct agency. Over the course
                of the nineteenth century, Williams laments, Marx gives way to Marxism: "With bitter
                irony, a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not only in practice but
                at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity and reification against
                which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to operate"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86). Williams argues against
                this abstract determinism, for the full concept of determination is crucial to save
                Marxism from such abstractions: "In practice determination is never only the setting
                of limits; it is also the exertion of pressures. As it happens this is also a sense
                of ‘determine’ in English: to determine or be determined to do something is an act
                of will and purpose" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 87). As in
                <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Williams in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> turns to the resources of language itself, here the resources of
                the English language in particular, for help unsettling various attempts to fix
                meaning and thereby produce pseudoauthoritative doctrine.</p>
            <p>To explore why "determination" is the most difficult problem in Marxist cultural
                theory, Williams turns to a well-known passage from the 1859 preface to <title 
                    level="m">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</title>, which
                features what Williams refers to as Marx’s "normal word" for determine, <foreign 
                    xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign>. "It is not the consciousness of men that
                determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines
                their consciousness," writes Marx in a paragraph that Williams quotes at length in
                <title level="a">Base and Superstructure,</title> the chapter that immediately precedes 
                the <title level="a">Determination</title> chapter (qtd. in <title 
                    level="m">Marxism</title> 75). As Williams notes when he returns to the preface 
                in the next chapter, <foreign xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign> appears four times 
                    in Marx’s original German but only three times in the English translation 
                    (the one Williams quotes). And one appearance of
                    <emph>determine</emph> in the English version actually translates a
                different German word, <foreign xml:lang="de">konstatieren</foreign>. Williams does 
                not blame the translator for this discrepancy. "The point here," writes Williams, 
                "is not so much the adequacy of the translation as the extraordinary linguistic 
                complexity of this group of words. This can best be illustrated by considering 
                the complexity of ‘determine’ in English" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 84).
                Attuned to the complexity of such groups of words, Williams reads almost as a poet
                committed to language really used—and, as suggested by his reading of the word 
                <emph>determine</emph>, language overused and worked over.</p>
            <p>Of the various Romantic writers and poets Williams draws on to advance arguments in
                his many books, Wordsworth is not always the most important. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
                plays a more vital role in the early chapters of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society 1780–1950</title> and in its sequel, <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>, for instance. And yet, Williams’s repeated turns to language
                echo Wordsworth’s famous interest in language "really used by men" (Wordsworth, 
                <title level="m">Selected</title> 281). As Williams writes in the introduction 
                to <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "I feel myself committed to the study of
                actual language: that is to say, to the words and sequences of words which
                particular men and women have used in trying to give meaning to their experience"
                (xix). While Williams translates Wordsworth’s adverb ("really") into an adjective
                ("actual"), he develops Wordsworth’s poetics as advanced in the preface to <title 
                    level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> into a detailed critical method. And
                Williams’s commitment to actual individual statements over what he calls "a system
                of significant abstractions" echoes Wordsworth’s distrust of personified
                abstractions of ideas (<title level="m">Culture</title> xix). At
                moments like these it can seem that Williams is a determined Wordsworthian.</p>

            <head>Of Determined Bounds</head>
            <p>If a poor reading of Marx absolutizes one sense of "determination," then a poor
                reading of Romanticism absolutizes the other (as if Romanticism named nothing other
                than the systematic assertion of the individual will). I turn now to Wordsworth and
                the opening book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, in which Wordsworth’s
                poet-speaker poses two related questions: Was I determined (by Nature) to be a poet;
                and Am I determined (enough) to <emph>become</emph> one? Wordsworth’s <title 
                    level="m">The Prelude</title>, in other words, is motivated by the question of
                determination, and the word <emph>determined</emph> appears in the text at
                two key moments in the first book, once near the beginning where he announces his
                longing for a "determined aim," and once near the end where he celebrates his having
                settled on a theme, one with "determined bounds" (<title level="m">Prelude</title> 34,
                64). Reading Wordsworth after Williams helps make legible the importance of
                determination to Wordsworth’s thinking about the self. </p>
             <p>Wordsworth opens <title level="m">The Prelude</title> by rewriting the conclusion to
                 Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>. In the closing lines of Milton’s
                poem, Adam and Eve wonder "where to choose / Their place of rest" after expulsion
                from Eden; and with "providence their guide," hand in hand they wander (618).
                Wordsworth replaces Milton’s guide, "providence," with a wandering cloud: "should
                the guide I chuse / Be nothing better than a wandering cloud / I cannot miss my way"
                (<title level="m">Prelude</title> 28).<note place="foot" resp="editors">1805, Book I, 
                    lines 17–19. Future citations of the poem will be to this edition and included 
                    parenthetically (book, line numbers).</note> In doing so, Wordsworth negates 
                 the possible tragedy of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>. Though Wordsworth 
                 does not know what guide to choose, there is no
                 tragedy in the choice, for, unlike in <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, there is
                no wrong choice: "Whither shall I turn, / By road or pathway, or through open field,
                / Or shall a twig or any floating thing / Upon the river point me out my course?"
                (I.29–32). Wordsworth records that after wondering for two days he arrived at his
                hermitage and he describes the love that greeted him. He is happy for a time.</p>
            <p>At this point, and after some rest, Wordsworth characterizes himself as determined,
                as interested in determining an aim for himself, though what Wordsworth actually
                writes is quite complicated: "But speedily," writes Wordsworth, "a longing in me
                rose / To brace myself to some determined aim" (I.123–24). Characteristically,
                Wordsworth introduces the importance of individual will via syntax that throws into
                question the active, individual will. A longing arises in him, he writes, as if the
                longing were to some degree or other independent of him, as if the longing were not
                entirely his own. Though grammatically the sentence is not in the passive voice, the
                subject of the sentence is this longing and not Wordsworth himself, not the first
                person, as Wordsworth positions himself as the object acted upon. Bracing himself
                for some determined aim, Wordsworth progresses through Book I worrying over various
                possible choices for poetic composition, as undisturbed delight gives way to concern
                over a selection process for a proper poetic theme. As Wordsworth wonders what he
                should write about to prove his worth as a poet, and as he chronicles the various
                topics for a great poem he entertains only to dismiss, from some British theme or
                old "Romantic tale by Milton left unsung" to "some philosophic song" (I.180, 230),
                Wordsworth famously wonders "Was it for this / That one, the fairest of all rivers,
                loved / To blend his murmurs with my nurse’s song" (I.271–72)? Wordsworth takes
                stock and determines that he does not lack a vital soul and is not "naked in
                external things, / Forms, images, nor numerous other aids" (I.165–66), and yet he
                still must ask: Was it for this? The poet’s self-consciousness results in a question
                about determination, about the poet’s determination: Was Wordsworth determined for
                this? And then, subsequently, and thinking of determined as meaning "persistent," is
                Wordsworth persistent enough to follow through on the promise? Wordsworth’s poem, in
                other words, shows his sensitivity to the complexity of <emph>determination</emph> 
                (as word and concept). And this sensitivity can seem to
                result in the repeated use of dummy pronouns, as the antecedent for "it" in "was it
                for this" is famously open and opaque.</p>
            <p>When Wordsworth concludes Book I, having found his theme at last, he returns to the
                opening lines of the poem and figures himself as doubly determined. And the word
                itself makes a potentially surprising second appearance. Wordsworth replaces the
                wide range of options introduced at the beginning of the poem—where he wonders
                whether to follow a road or a pathway, a cloud or a floating thing, and write a
                romantic tale or some philosophic song—with a single option: "The road lies plain
                before me. ’Tis a theme / Single and of determined bounds, and hence / I chuse it
                rather at this time than work / Of ampler or more varied argument" (I.668–71).
                Wordsworth has settled on his theme, "the story of [his] life," and this theme
                already has a revivifying force ("One end hereby at least hath been attained— / My
                mind hath been revived" [I.664–65]). Wordsworth chooses a road that lies plain
                before him, a road, in other words, somewhat well-travelled—even though one might
                expect him to follow a less pre<emph>determined</emph> path. Despite the
                many ways we associate Romantic texts with the rise of the self-determining
                individual, the poem carefully anticipates and complicates such a characterization.
                In choosing a road, Wordsworth’s way is determined; it is before him. And he
                foregrounds the question of determination explicitly by comparing his theme to a
                road in describing its "determined bounds." Because the theme has determined bounds,
                Wordsworth is determined to choose it. If the opening of Book I is a return to <title 
                    level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, so too is the end of Book I. But whereas Adam
                and Eve wander, Wordsworth hits the road. His direction, clearly marked, opens
                before him. Had Wordsworth followed a cloud or floating thing across an open field,
                his chosen path would have fit more comfortably within the usual stories one hears
                about Romanticism (as a celebration of nature, of the individual, of the individual
                imagination, etc.); but instead of wandering across an open field, Wordsworth
                chooses a road and, additionally, one that "lies plain before [him]."</p>
            <p>Near the beginning of Book I, Wordsworth wonders if he was determined by nature to
                produce <title level="m">The Prelude</title>; by the end of Book I, he has determined
                his theme, one with determined bounds, a theme that is not varied. In a sense the
                one meaning of determination (as fixed) combines with the other, as Wordsworth makes
                his choice and thereby asserts himself as active agent. He chooses (determines) a
                theme with determined bounds, and as a result Wordsworth—over the course of 
                Book I—draws together, like Williams later, the two meanings of
                    <emph>determination</emph>. To borrow Williams’s imagined sentence
                from <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Wordsworth is determined
                to be determined. If Raymond Williams hopes to complicate a version of Marxism too
                enamored of "determinism" by reintroducing the importance of individual will,
                Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title> complicates a too-simple version of
                Romanticism too enamored of "determination" <emph>as</emph> individual
                will, as he reintroduces the importance of determined (and determining) bounds at
                the close of Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>.</p>

            <head>Passive Voices</head>
            <p>I have been focusing on what we might call a lexical problem, but as I have already
                hinted in my opening paragraphs, I would like to turn as well to syntax and to some
                of the ways lexical and syntactical questions are intertwined in Wordsworth and
                Williams. The question of determination from Wordsworth to Williams turns on one’s
                ability to decide whether the subject acts (determines itself for itself) or is
                acted upon (is determined by something else). The grammatical, or more specifically
                the syntactical, corollary to the question of "determination" is something like
                voice, specifically the difference between active and passive voice, where passive
                constructions invert normal subject and object noun phrases. In the active voice,
                the subject of the sentence is also the agent of the action. In the passive voice,
                the object acted upon becomes the subject, and the agent of the action is introduced
                belatedly, often in a prepositional phrase. For instance, in the sentence
                "Wordsworth wrote <title level="m">The Prelude</title>," the subject of the sentence
                (Wordsworth) precedes and acts upon the object of the sentence (<title 
                    level="m">The Prelude</title>). But in "<title level="m">The Prelude</title> was written by
                Wordsworth," the object acted upon comes first. By inverting subject and object, the
                agent of the action becomes the object of the sentence. And the object acted upon
                (<title level="m">The Prelude</title>) becomes the grammatical subject of the
                sentence. For this reason, writing guides often advise against using passive voice.
                Famously, George Orwell strongly advises against the passive voice in <title 
                    level="a">The Politics of the English Language,</title> where he suggests 
                that one should "never use the passive
                where you can use the active" (119). Of more philosophical importance, especially
                for an essay that began with the difficult problem of determination, passive
                constructions show just how easily subjects and objects can be reversed, as the
                agent capable of acting becomes an object and the object acted upon becomes a
                subject. In other words, passive constructions show how difficult it can be to
                determine and stabilize the difference between subjects and objects (the agents who
                act and the things that are acted upon). Passive constructions also showcase how
                quickly the agent of the action can disappear from a sentence. In some passive
                constructions, that is, the agent is left, either accidentally or intentionally,
                undecidable (as in a sentence like "<title level="m">The Prelude</title> was
                written"). One famous and much cited example is "Mistakes were made," where the one
                who made the mistakes, the agent of the action, the rhetorical (if not grammatical)
                subject of the sentence, goes unnamed. As Orwell argues, such a construction allows
                those in power to stay in power by strategically disappearing. At moments like this
                one, the agent is determined not to be determined.</p>
            <p>In their related attempts to think the difficult problem of determination, both
                Wordsworth and Williams repeatedly use the passive voice, as their grammar and
                syntax raise questions about who or what acts and who or what is acted upon. In the
                writing of Wordsworth and Williams, it is often difficult to determine who is doing
                what to whom. For instance, early in the glad preamble to <title level="m">The
                    Prelude</title> and after Wordsworth asserts that he "cannot miss [his] way" for
                his joy is great, he uses a passive construction that leaves the precise cause of
                his happiness unknown:
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rendition="#indent4">It is shaken off,</l>

                </quote>
              At first it is unclear to a reader what the antecedent for "it" is, but after a line
                or two it becomes clear that Wordsworth describes the burden of his own unnatural
                self, a burden that is shaken off. Readers are then able to reread the sentence as
                "The burthen of my own unnatural self is shaken off." But even when one learns what
                has been shaken off, the passive construction leaves undisclosed the active agent
                (the rhetorical if not grammatical subject).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On 
                    similar impersonal constructions in Wordsworth, see François and Banfield, 
                    especially the fifth chapter, <title level="a">The Sentence Representing 
                        Non-reflective Consciousness and the Absence of the Narrator.</title></note> We 
                know who is all shook up, but who or what has performed the shaking? In this
                opening example, Wordsworth seems to use the passive voice to deepen the mystery of
                a miraculous gift. For poetic reasons, Wordsworth does not name, and so leaves
                undetermined, the agent of the action.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See 
                    also Johnson, who suggests that Wordsworth uses the passive voice when 
                    "the speaker is caught up in a mode of perception that takes him beyond his 
                    ordinary, active consciousness to a larger and more indefinite 
                    perspective" (5).</note></p>
            <p>Most relevant to my purposes, Wordsworth employs passive voice in the final verse
                paragraph of Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> as well, where the
                question of determination is thematized most explicitly. As Wordsworth draws the
                first book to a close, he acknowledges that despite continuing difficulties "One end
                hereby at least hath been attained— / My mind hath been revived" (I.664–65). Who or
                what has revived the mind? Is it Wordsworth or Nature? Or the act of writing about
                himself and Nature? The agent of the action is again left unclear, and the effect is
                particularly Wordsworthian. Wordsworth turns to the passive voice at key moments
                like these because he does not wish to determine absolutely agents of action. To
                determine Nature as the active agent makes Wordsworth a passive object. He will have
                been determined absolutely by an external force. Conversely, to determine Wordsworth
                himself as the active agent makes Nature a passive object. Wordsworth’s
                philosophical questions about the relation between poet and Nature lead him
                inexorably toward the passive voice. Because it is difficult to determine one’s
                determination, Wordsworth is determined to use the passive voice.</p>
            <p>Williams’s own efforts to think determination similarly result in a high degree of
                indetermination: determination, for Williams, is always "an active and conscious as
                well as, by default, a passive and objectified historical experience"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 88). He is interested in
                determination because it can be difficult to determine adequately when historical
                experience results from one’s determination (one’s active persistence) and when it
                results from one’s determination (one’s objectified historical experience). Williams
                can sound a bit like Wordsworth from <title level="a">Tintern Abbey</title> here: as 
                if historical experience were half-perceived and half-created. Wordsworth hopes neither to
                prioritize poet over Nature nor Nature over poet; and Williams, likewise, hopes to
                keep both meanings of determination in play. As a result, both repeatedly write in
                the passive voice.</p>
            <p>In a key sentence in which Williams objects to some of the ways Marxism (against
                Marx, argues Williams) privileges one sense of determination over another to develop
                a theory of "economism," Williams uses the passive voice conspicuously: "With bitter
                irony," writes Williams, "a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not
                only in practice but at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity
                and reification against which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to
                operate" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86). Williams laments
                the degree to which Marxism’s focus on passive reification precludes attention to
                determination as active and conscious. But Williams chooses the passive voice in
                order to formulate his lament. Marx’s critical and revolutionary doctrine was
                changed, but changed by whom? Here and elsewhere in his writing, Williams turns to
                the passive voice as he attempts to rescue "determination" from a determinism that
                changes active agents into passive objects of cultural and economic forces. Faced
                with the indeterminate nature of <emph>determine</emph> in English, and in
                an effort to draw it out, Williams intensifies a syntactical tic.</p>
            <p>For a second example, we can return to another passage I have already quoted. In the
                paragraph discussed above, in which Williams examines a translation of Marx’s
                preface to <title level="m">A Contribution to the Critique of Political
                    Economy</title> and points to the linguistic complexity of <emph>determine</emph> 
                in English, the word translators often use to render Marx’s <foreign 
                    xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign> into English, Williams writes: "The point here is
                not so much the adequacy of the translation as the extraordinary linguistic
                complexity of this group of words. This can best be illustrated by considering the
                complexity of ‘determine’ in English"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 84). In the second sentence
                quoted, Williams leaves blank the rhetorical subject of his sentence, the agent of
                the action, as the "I" capable of illustrating and considering complexity is left
                out. And this sentence is illustrative of Williams’s style more generally, for
                Williams not only leaves out the agent of the action but also the object acted upon:
                to what does "this" refer to, this "this" that can best be illustrated? An inelegant
                version of Williams’s sentence might read: "I will illustrate this complexity by
                considering the complexity of ‘determine’ in English." Williams removes the agent
                that will perform the action and also leaves "this" to stand alone. Once again,
                Williams’s syntax raises questions about determination, as Williams leaves much
                undetermined. He can sound quite Wordsworthian. But just as the point for Williams
                is not the adequacy of translation, the point for me is not the adequacy of
                Williams’s style. What interests me most is how often in his writing about
                determination Williams uses the passive voice. A cursory glance at the
                "Determination" chapter of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> will show
                how often Williams repeatedly uses the passive voice and begins sentences with
                expletives or dummy pronouns (sentences that begin with an empty grammatical subject
                like the "it" of "it is raining"), a construction that often follows from the
                passive voice. To quote from sentences early in the chapter that introduce some
                complexity, especially if one wishes to linger over Williams’ syntax:
            <quote>According to its opponents, Marxism is a necessarily reductive and determinist kind
                of theory: no cultural activity is allowed to be real and significant in itself, but
                is always reduced to a direct or indirect expression of some preceding and
                controlling economic content. . . . In the perspective of mid-twentieth century
                developments of Marxism, this description can be seen as a caricature. Certainly it
                is often asserted with a confidence as solid as it is out of date. Yet it can hardly
                be denied that it came . . . from a common form of Marxism.
                (<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Marxism </hi>83) </quote>
               Williams presents a caricature of Marxism as determinism that he then acknowledges
                cannot be denied. He will go on to argue for a less deterministic Marxism. But in
                the concluding sentences of the above quotation, Williams’s prose features a series
                of "it" pronouns. The "it" of "certainly it is often asserted" refers to the
                caricature, though who is asserting it is left open. The "it" of "yet it can hardly
                be denied" is an expletive, an empty pronoun that serves a grammatical function but
                has no real antecedent. For Williams, the problem of determination is not
                independent from certain grammatical and syntactical arrangements, arrangements that
                make "it," for instance, difficult to determine.</p>
            <p>Wordsworth and Williams share not only an interest in the complexity of 
                <emph>determination</emph> in English, as word and concept, but also an
                interest in the passive voice and in uses of language that showcase with a certain
                lightness of touch the ways objects can become subjects and the ways subjects can
                drop from view, especially in sentences that leave undisclosed and indeterminate the
                agent of the action.</p>

            <p>It can be hard to tell whether passive constructions determine Wordsworth’s and
                Williams’s abstract philosophical speculation or whether abstract philosophical
                speculation determines passive constructions. In general, one might be satisfied
                with an either/or. But when it comes to <emph>determination</emph> itself,
                determining how much determination (as a philosophical question, say) is determined
                (by grammar, say) can get complicated quickly. How can we know anything 
                about <emph>determination</emph> if we cannot determine how much our discussion
                of determination is itself already determined?</p>
            <p>When readers bring Marxist cultural criticism and Romanticism into contact, one
                often senses a need to choose between them. Either Romanticism is little more than
                an ideology that denies the importance of external economic forces, or it is a
                vibrant celebration of human potential. In focusing on some of the ways Wordsworth
                and Williams think determination with and through the passive voice, I have tried
                for new points of contact. If we take seriously the ways Wordsworth and Williams
                both foreground passive voice in their writing about determination, we discover
                stylistic similarities in discourses often perceived to be antithetical, especially
                when Williams stands in for Marxist cultural materialism and Wordsworth for Romantic
                idealism. We know that Williams was dissatisfied with certain versions of Marxism
                and Wordsworth with certain versions of idealism. Both found in "determination"
                strategies for resisting the pull of familiar isms and both used the passive voice
                to make a little more restless our attempts to characterize historical experience as
                either active or passive.</p>
            <p>Theory in recent decades has become increasingly proficient at marshalling
                increasingly complicated philosophical and scientific concepts (let’s call them
                tropes) in the service of urgent speculation. But some of the most pressing social
                issues today also hold a grammatical edge, as those urging adoption of
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">l’écriture inclusive</foreign> in France know
                well. (In French, an adjective that refers jointly to masculine and feminine nouns
                agrees only with the masculine one, thus perpetuating [argue protesters] French
                linguistic patriarchy.) I sometimes worry that theory left grammar behind too
                quickly as theory courses proliferated in university curricula, even though we
                always knew (and still know) that there is no style of thought without a grammar.
                But what if, in place of "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is more difficult,
                than that of ‘determination,’" Williams had written "No problem in Marxist cultural
                theory is more difficult than that of passive voice"? What sort of theory would have
                emerged? For decades, Romanticism has played a key role in the development of theory
                (or Theory, or theories). I cannot determine whether Wordsworth led me to Williams
                or Williams led me to Wordsworth, just as I cannot tell whether interest in the
                question of determination leads to passive voice or if interest in the passive voice
                leads to questions about determination. It may be impossible to tell. To encounter
                the impossibility of telling, though, may be one of the only ways to open a new
                question.</p>
