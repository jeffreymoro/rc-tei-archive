            <p class="noCount">This volume considers the place of Romantic works and the Romantic period itself in
               the work of one of the most important twentieth-century theorists of culture, Raymond
               Williams. Few works have generated as much critical thinking about Romantic writing’s
               literary purposes and social meanings as <em>Culture and Society: 1780–1950</em> (1958), <em>The Long Revolution</em> (1961), or <em>The Country and the City</em> (1973), but, as these essays suggest, many of Williams’s other works have a more
               oblique yet equally powerful relationship to Romanticism’s moment. After an introduction
               that pays particular attention to central concepts passed down from Williams like
               "structure of feeling" and "cultural formation," these essays revisit Williams over
               thirty years after his death to reconsider his bearing on particular Romantic authors
               or broader sociohistorical processes in order to ask how his work helps us ask questions
               about the contemporary university and the place of the humanities within it.</p>

               <p>Why read Raymond Williams now? This is certainly not the first time this question
                  has been asked. Shortly after Williams’s sudden death in 1988, Simon During wondered
                  whether that event marked "the end of an era" or "the sign of a beginning set in motion
                  by the program, the shifts of emphasis, he urged" (681). Ultimately, we might now
                  say that his death was both an end and a beginning. Cultural Studies, whose contours,
                  possibilities, and limitations were so much a part of the early debate that followed
                  Williams’s death, has now become an established, if not dominant, component of literary
                  studies. The wide range of its approaches has meant that Williams’s assumptions about
                  culture have pollinated various forms of analysis rooted in understandings of culture’s
                  centrality to nation, empire, ecosystem, and to identities formed around race, class,
                  ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, and disability. Most of these approaches, except
                  for class, were met with relative silence in his own corpus. But literary and cultural
                  work today remains indebted to the quality Williams attributed to Brecht and which
                  applies to his own work as well: an unparalleled capacity for "the ‘complex seeing’
                  of a multivalent and both dynamic and uncertain social process" (<em>Politics of Modernism</em> 91).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This collection addresses Williams’s long and complex relationship to Romantic works
                     and to the Romantic period itself. Few works have generated as much critical thinking
                     about Romantic writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as <em>Culture and Society: 1780–1950</em> (1958), <em>The Long Revolution</em> (1961), or <em>The Country and the City</em> (1973), but many of Williams’s other works have spoken to Romanticism’s moment in
                     different keys that our essays explore as well. Such reflection comes at a time today
                     when Williams’s methods and legacy have come under new critical pressure. From one
                     angle, critics like Joseph North have used Williams to stand for the domination over
                     "criticism" by the "historical-contextualist" method he is credited (or blamed) for
                     building. From a different angle, Williams’s legacy is now said to belong to the party
                     of "critique" whose dark materialism appears to negate literature’s pleasures and
                     other affects of many kinds.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Joseph North’s lengthy attack in Literary Criticism indicts Williams’s fostering of
                              historical-social "scholarship" against the mode of literary "criticism" that North
                              seeks to revive from I. A. Richards (62–68). Rita Felski and others have argued a
                              roughly analogous opposition between new modes of textual reading or literary affect
                              and historical-political interpretation, as in her Limits of Critique.</span></div>
                     </div>These new vectors of disciplinary debate, reasserting divides between the personal
                     and historical, the critical and scholarly, are tacitly but unmistakably at issue
                     in the perspectives on Williams’s work we present here.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The work of Raymond Williams has by no means become dated by, or limited to, the moments
                  of its emergence in the 1950s and 60s. In recent years a range of scholars have been
                  moving the legacy of Williams in new directions, some surprising or unforeseen. Lauren
                  Berlant, for one, uses Williams’s concept of "structure of feeling" to construct her
                  materialist version of affect theory, tracking what she calls "the becoming historical
                  of the affective event and the improvisation of genre amid pervasive uncertainty"
                  (6). Within this process, "affective responses" come "to exemplify shared <em>historical</em> time" (Berlant 15). Lisa Lowe also uses Williams’s structure of feeling and his related
                  framing of dominant, residual, and emergent forms of culture to produce a materialist
                  understanding of intimacy, one that pluralizes intimacy to produce what she calls
                  a "political economy" of intimacies (Lowe 18). But affect theory is not the only way
                  that Williams continues to inflect contemporary work. At the opposite end of the spectrum,
                  we might also read his sociology of culture as shaping the ambitions of approaches
                  like "cultural analytics" and other computational models that aim to show how new
                  digital techniques like network analysis can expand the scale and scope of the way
                  we study cultural forms (Dunst).</p>
               <p>By almost universal agreement, Williams’s writings represent an argument for the centrality
                  of "culture" in literary, social, and political analysis, and it is around the turn
                  of the nineteenth century, as his accounts repeatedly insist, that the Enlightenment
                  idea of culture thickens, as it were, and through variations and complications begins
                  to build into itself the contradictions of its development. We see this argument emerge
                  initially in <em>Culture and Society</em> (1958) and develop through <em>The Long Revolution</em> (1961) and beyond as Williams distinguishes between two interrelated ideas of culture:
                  first, as the development of an achieved social order akin to civilization as presented
                  in eighteenth-century universal histories and later challenged by Rousseau and Marx,
                  among others; and second, a related but distinct concept of culture found in the common
                  rituals of everyday life and what Williams repeatedly calls "a whole way of life."</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I</span></h2>
               <p>Several of our essays assert, while others imply, an important shift in Williams’s
                  career between earlier work like <em>Culture and Society</em>, where he is grappling with the English moral and formalist criticism in which he
                  had been trained, and a later stage typified by works like <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977), where he brings to fruition the new theory and methods of cultural materialism.
                  In our lead-off essay, "Williams and the Romantic Turn," James Chandler argues that
                  Williams’s engagement with Romanticism as a category belongs more clearly to the first
                  phase of his career than the second, as both <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em> query and challenge the Romantic figure of the creative poet galvanizing "imagination"
                  to distance us from everyday life, promising access to a "superior reality" instead
                  (<em>Long Revolution</em> 32). Chandler turns his argument on a rich, surprising reading one of Williams’s
                  least-cited books, <em>Modern Tragedy</em> (1966), where the dialectical movement of categories like Romanticism, liberalism,
                  and drama form an unexpectedly decisive turning point for Romanticism’s place in modern
                  cultural history. In what Chandler calls the sociological turn in Williams’ thinking
                  after 1966, the moment of 1800 would remain an important pivot in the cultural history
                  of modernity, but it was now understood as caught up in many movements and modes of
                  writing beyond the traditional Romantic canon itself. What should be done, this volume
                  asks in turn, with Williams’s several legacies?</p>
               <p>The essays collected here respond to this challenge in a variety of ways, though all
                  reflect on how we should read Romanticism in light of Williams’s early and late work.
                  Some, like those of Kevin Gilmartin, Mary Favret, and Brian McGrath, seek to open
                  up a reconsideration of Williams through attention to his particular treatment of
                  Romantic authors like Jane Austen, William Cobbett, and William Wordsworth. Others,
                  like those by Thora Brylowe and Paul Keen, use Williams’s legacy to take stock of
                  current conversations on the situation of university study and the place of the humanities
                  within it. Meanwhile, Jon Mee’s essay puts into question Williams’s way of counterposing
                  "culture" to "industrialism" as a basis for thinking in broader terms about the meanings
                  and inflections of materialism, both in its historical manifestation in Romantic era
                  intellectual life and in critical methods arising from Williams’s work. Some essays
                  make renewed use of Williams’s best-known work, like <em>The Country and the City</em> or <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, while others turn fresh and vigorous attention to his less cited contributions,
                  such as <em>Modern Tragedy</em>, <em>Television</em>, or Williams’s slim Past Masters volume, <em>Cobbett</em>. Literary questions—of narrative, grammar, style, medium, form—claim central attention
                  in these essays. What unites them too is an awareness of the complexity and vitality
                  of Williams’s approach to culture and an admiration for his sustained attempts to
                  develop a method for studying culture appropriate to its capacity for mobility and
                  change. Building from this work, our introduction provides a context for the essays
                  to follow while also offering an argument of its own by raising further questions
                  on the methodological side of Williams’s <em>oeuvre</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Williams argued for a concept of "structure of feeling" as early as his 1954 <em>Preface to Film</em> (cowritten with Michael Orrom), and the term appears casually in <em>Culture and Society</em> before being developed more seriously as a concept from <em>The Long Revolution</em> onward. The inflections and implications of the term changed over time, but Williams
                     consistently used it to capture the dynamic between the personal and the historical,
                     the means by which a complex set of relationships reveal unexpected correspondences
                     and discontinuities, thus precipitating, as it were, distinct elements of contact
                     out of the history "in solution" of a complex whole.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For an early extended account of the "structure of feeling" see Long Revolution (67–70),
                              but the phrase originated, as Chandler points out in his essay, in Williams and Orrem’s
                              1954 Preface to Film.</span></div>
                     </div> He argued that it is in the arts of a period that these elements are grasped most
                     distinctively. As David Simpson put it in a 1995 essay, "Williams seems to want to
                     offer art and literature as the most complex barometer of movement at the ideological
                     level, and to propose the structure of feeling as a kind of super-sensitive indicator
                     of such movement" (17). Within Romantic studies, the work of Kevis Goodman and Mary
                     Favret has done as much as anyone’s to read this barometer. They use it to locate,
                     as Goodman puts it in her book on the georgic, "that immanent, collective perception
                     of any moment as a seething mix of unsettled elements," while reminding us that by
                     "feeling" Williams meant especially the "unpleasurable sensations of ‘disturbance,
                     blockage, tension’" (Goodman 3, 70). Their work and that of others show that culture
                     and the historical present is always on the move, part of a process that must necessarily
                     be grasped historically, though it is also pervasive below the threshold of articulation.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But there was also a complex evolution in the concept of "structure of feeling" over
                  the course of Williams’s career. From its earliest formulations in the 1950s and early
                  60s, Williams found the structure of feeling visible in texts, "at the edge of semantic
                  availability" in drama, films, or novels. Whether it was Chekhov’s particular structure
                  of feeling in <em>Drama from Ibsen to Brecht</em> or Elizabeth Gaskell’s version in the industrial novels Williams studied in <em>The Long Revolution</em>, he located a structure of feeling in the works of individual writers and the literary
                  conventions they either changed or introduced. Meanwhile the social sources of this
                  feeling were inchoate, arising out of what he called "deep community," "the culture
                  of a period," or, in his widest formulation, the "living result of all the elements
                  in the [social] organization" (<em>Long Revolution</em>64–65). What was not specified was how exactly the minute particulars of a structure
                  of feeling were connecting to the widest social realm.</p>
               <p>Those ways of thinking about the structure of feeling were significantly altered when
                  Williams’s work took a more explicitly sociological turn with <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977) or in his last completed work, <em>The Sociology of Culture</em> (1981). <em>Marxism and Literature</em> devoted several intensive pages to the structure of feeling, and here for the first
                  time the idea is pluralized as "<em>structures</em> of feeling" (128–35, our emphasis). The plural changes the meaning and scope of the
                  concept in several key directions. There is a telling shift from single writers to
                  groups of writers or cultural producers—to what Williams began calling in another
                  chapter "cultural formations" (138). While there is the same emphasis on "social experiences
                  in solution," the terms of analysis are now far more precise. There is a new concreteness
                  to specifying such structures in history beyond the individual writer or text, as
                  Williams now speaks of "the complex relation of differentiated structures of feeling
                  to differentiated classes" and other senses in which structures of feeling gain their
                  affective force from highly particularized historical encounters (<em>Marxism and Literature</em> 134).</p>
               <p>Williams’s characteristic and unparalleled ability to thicken the historical experience
                  of his subjects comes through clearly in Kevin Gilmartin’s essay, 
                  “‘In His Time and in Ours’: Reading Cobbett (and Jane Austen) with Raymond Williams.”
                  For Gilmartin, Williams offers a properly literary reading of Cobbett’s work, one
                  attuned to Cobbett’s style in a manner that shows how historical method itself can
                  be understood as a matter of style. More particularly, Cobbett allows Williams to
                  reflect on historical process and "unanticipated historical experience." Such contingency
                  then becomes, through Williams’s comparison of Cobbett with Jane Austen in the 
                  “Three around Farnham”
                  chapter of <em>The Country and the City</em>, an encouragement to think historically about class. In Gilmartin’s account, we can
                  see Williams’s earlier emphasis on shared historical experience transform into a more
                  sophisticated understanding of the particularities of class, the institutional structures
                  of culture, and the historical contingencies that make the relationship between class
                  and culture so particular and complex.</p>
               <p>Mary Favret’s essay, 
                  “Raymond Williams on Jane Austen, Again,”
                  also takes up Williams’s account of Austen from the 
                  “Three around Farnham”
                  chapter in an effort to grasp the motion and movement of historical experience. She
                  suggests that Williams repeatedly presents Austen as a "static" writer, a subject
                  whose contours can be taken as a given, but that the fixity of Williams’s account
                  of Austen then sets his analysis of Cobbett and others into motion. Making her case
                  at the level of the word, the sentence, the paragraph, and attending even to the look
                  of the page in Williams’s published work, Favret registers the acute peculiarities
                  of closeness and distance, of scale generally, through her toggling between the semantic
                  units of Williams’s writing, especially as they bear on qualities of vision and seeing.
                  For Favret, even the page itself in Williams’s work functions as an image that needs
                  to be navigated and mapped by the eye. This visual emphasis sets up a pivot in Favret’s
                  essay from Williams’s literary analysis in <em>The Country and the City</em> to his theorization of media in works like <em>Television: Technology and Cultural Form</em>. What happens to Austen, Favret asks, when we look at her work through the terms
                  Williams develops for new media and focus on motion, temporality, and tempo rather
                  than the visual and spatial terms that Williams uses to "fix" Austen in behind her
                  wall? Favret’s reading of Austen’s adaptation for screen stands also as a salutary
                  reminder of how reading Williams, even against the grain, can produce new perspectives
                  on seemingly familiar Romantic texts.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II</span></h2>
               <p>In its subtle shifts of meaning as Williams develops the idea of a "structure of feeling"
                  across his earlier work to his subsequent reflection on the term’s usefulness in the
                  <em>New Left Review</em> interviews of 1979, we can see how the expression evolved from understanding culture
                  as something rooted in "experience" to a conception of culture as produced by "practices."
                  "It took me a long time," he told his <em>New Left Review</em> interviewers, "to find the key move to the notion of cultural production as itself
                  material" (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 139). First fleshed out in his essay 
                  “Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory”
                  (1973), the concept of cultural production permitted an enormous range of materials
                  to enter the purview of cultural analysis, from writing to visual and electronic media,
                  offering a more theoretical basis for what cultural studies, then still a British
                  set of critical practices, was already doing on the ground. Though this notion sometimes
                  obscured the place of economic determinations in classical Marxist terms, Williams
                  defended "cultural production" as a concept that did not make production less important
                  than culture, but more important and pervasive than the base/superstructure model
                  could ever allow (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 145). And what he had earlier sometimes attributed to a preanalytical category of
                  naïve experience was now to be found in what he called "the common character of the
                  respective processes of production" (139).</p>
               <p>As Brian McGrath notes in his essay, 
                  “Determination in the Passive Voice (Wordsworth and Williams),”
                  the chapter 
                  “Determination”
                  comes just after the 
                  “Base and Superstructure”
                  chapter in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> and before Williams’s creative rethinking of "Productive Forces." McGrath turns from
                  these texts to tarry with Williams’s <em>Keywords</em> (1976) as his point of departure for teasing out the meanings of <em>determine</em> in Romantic poetry and Marxism alike, putting equal pressure on Romanticism’s freedom-seeking
                  lyrical "I" and Marx’s senses of determination by wider forces. Citing Williams’s
                  provocative phrase "I am determined not to be determined," McGrath follows the paradox
                  into Wordsworth’s <em>Prelude</em> and tracks the grammatical pattern the Romantic poet shared with Williams himself,
                  a strategic recourse to the passive voice. Here, we might say, the structure of feeling
                  is "determined" insofar as it is simultaneously shaping and being shaped, with the
                  inflection of both activity and passivity that McGrath draws out in Wordsworth and
                  Williams.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Many of the implications of "cultural production" are not fleshed out in <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, a work of theory, but rather in his counterpart manual on methods in <em>The Sociology of Culture</em>, where Williams asks more pointed questions about the material "means of cultural
                     production" and about who produces culture and how. One salient idea impressed on
                     him by Lucien Goldmann’s work was that cultural production takes place most importantly
                     not at the level of individual writer and his relation to some "abstract group," as
                     in mainstream sociology, but rather between "individuals in real and collective social
                     relations" (
                     “Literature and Sociology”
                      23). For Williams this came to mean thinking about production as carried out by highly
                     particularized groups. His expression for these groups—"cultural formations"—has hardly
                     ever been cited in this specific sense, in part because each term has so many wider
                     uses that the phrase does not indicate how specific and useful it actually is. Such
                     formations were not unknown to earlier kinds of literary history: they include "conscious
                     movements and tendencies (literary, artistic, philosophical or scientific) which can
                     usually be readily discerned after their formative productions" (<em>Marxism and Literature</em> 119). But the new conception pushes Williams further away from grand synthetic categories
                     like "Romanticism" and closer to particular clusters whose members combined shared
                     aesthetic and social aims. He gestures briefly in <em>The Sociology of Culture</em> to a Godwin circle in the 1790s, a later Shelley formation, the pre-Raphaelites, and
                     the Bloomsbury group of the 1920s, but the idea clearly has a far wider potential
                     range than these familiar kinds of circles or coteries.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Recent work on coteries, circles, and related groups in the Romantic age has not generally
                              made use of Williams’s framing of "cultural formations." A cogent exception is Jeffrey
                              Cox, Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School (60–64).</span></div>
                     </div> Williams’s theoretically elaborated reworking of such groupings under the heading
                     of "cultural formation" both investigates the internal complexities of such groups
                     and maps them onto wider social dynamics.</p>
               </div>
               <p>A reconceived idea of such cultural formations appears in Jon Mee’s essay, 
                  “Raymond Williams, Industrialism, and Romanticism, 1780–1850.”
                  Arguing that Williams’s idea of industrialization remained abstract and unexamined,
                  Mee shows how his later methods of cultural materialism can be used to locate a far
                  greater complexity in the relations between literary production and industrialism.
                  Rather than a centralized group working in cities like London, Mee studies the northern
                  English writers who formed durable networks through the new literary and philosophical
                  societies from Newcastle and York to Manchester and Liverpool, forging what Mee calls
                  the "transpennine enlightenment" that led from the Rational Dissenters of the 1780s
                  to Elizabeth Gaskell and Robert Owen in the 1840s. The methodological gambit of his
                  essay is to link Williams’s materialist methods of immanent critique to Latour’s tools
                  of network analysis, following the "pattern of recurring links" that such writers
                  forged in a particular structure of feeling underlying this English "culture of improvement."
                  Beyond urban circles, Mee’s revisionary transpennine cultural formation reveals new
                  dimensions possible to follow from Williams’s own conception.</p>
               <p>Locating and studying such cultural formations became Williams’s method for confronting
                  what his late work called the "central problem" of literary and cultural analysis—how
                  to understand "the specific relationships through which works are made and move" ("Uses"
                  28). In the 1986 essay 
                  “The Uses of Cultural Theory,”
                  he located theoretical ancestry for posing this question in the "sociological poetics"
                  of Medvedev, Bakhtin, and others who challenged the Russian Formalists in the 1920s.
                  Against notions of an abstract intertextuality, Williams cites what he took to be
                  a crucial passage from Medvedev: "Works can only enter into real contact as inseparable
                  elements of social intercourse . . . It is not works that come into contact, but people,
                  who, however, come into contact through the medium of works" (qtd. in 
                  “Uses”
                  29).</p>
               <p>This relation of works and actors was for Williams the matrix of the cultural formation.
                  In these later writings, the terms <em>collaborative</em> and <em>collaboration</em> received increasingly strong emphasis as he also pushed harder against the figures
                  of Romantic author, the solitary cultural producer, and the enthronement of the modern
                  critic. Impressed at how cogently Goldmann’s work was encouraging him to think about
                  cultural production as "an active and collaborative critical process," he recalled
                  that his most critically embattled book, <em>The Long Revolution</em>, had been written with "a crucial absence of collaboration" (
                  “Literature and Sociology”
                  24).</p>
               <p>Our final two essays draw on Williams’s later work to reflect on collaborative processes
                  as they bear on the state of the contemporary academy. For Paul Keen in 
                  “New Maps: Raymond Williams’s Radical Humanism,”
                  Williams’s method maps culture in part by consistently resisting the allure of theoretical
                  abstraction in its revision of Marxist theory as Williams emphasizes the concreteness
                  and sense of complexity needed to grasp the contradictory character of Romantic era
                  writing. Keen stresses some of the difficulties in coming to grips with Williams’s
                  skeptical way of "unlearning" past versions of formalism or Marxism, as for instance
                  the extensive previous reading in theory required to grasp the interlaced arguments
                  in <em>Marxism and Literature</em>. Keen assesses the pertinence of relevant work by Edward Said, Timothy Brennan, and
                  Georg Lukacs for thinking about Williams’s characteristic way of configuring cultural
                  critique. Granted these challenges in reading Williams now, Keen also stresses the
                  value of the "unflinchingly dialectical nature of Williams’s work" for the public
                  role of the humanities today and the critical tools needed for confronting the digital
                  revolution, the crisis of the humanities, and related forms of contemporary complexity.</p>
               <p>In her chapter, 
                  “Book History and the Politics of Work and World,”
                  Thora Brylowe too hopes to show the relevance of Williams for newer methodologies
                  and questions. Emphasizing the central concept of labor for making sense of literature
                  itself and the academic contexts in which it is studied, Brylowe underscores how Williams
                  can help us to elicit the political urgency in newer methodologies like her preferred
                  concept of "media ecology." Her essay stresses the collaborative, labor-based processes
                  responsible for producing books and other artifacts of culture, the "hands and minds
                  who never wrote a word," to demonstrate how abstractions like literature are produced
                  in bookstores, libraries, papermills, coal mines, and (today) server farms. Brylowe,
                  in other words, uses Williams to ask about the particular people who make the media
                  through which words and works are transmitted, as well as to show the specific material
                  processes that produce and circulate artifacts that contain information, imaginative
                  content, and/or ideas.</p>
               <p>Cultural formations entailed rich and thoughtful modes of collaboration, but Williams’s
                  idea of how their cooperative work clarified the problem of structures of feeling
                  remained a work in progress by the time of his death. We want to conclude by citing
                  a telling passage from the last chapters of <em>Marxism and Literature</em>: <span class="quote">‘Something new happens in the very process of conscious co-operation. . . . But it
                     is from just this realization that the second and more difficult sense of a collective
                     subject is developed. This goes beyond conscious co-operation—collaboration—to effective
                     social relations in which, even while individual projects are being pursued, what
                     is being drawn on is trans-individual, not only in the sense of shared (initial) forms
                     and experiences, but in the specifically creative sense of new responses and formation.
                     This is obviously more difficult to find evidence for, but the practical question
                     is whether the alternative hypothesis of categorically separate or isolated authors
                     is compatible with the quite evident creation, in particular places and at particular
                     times, of specific new forms and structures of feeling. (<em>Marxism and Literature</em> 195)’</span> Passages like this, along with his later work in <em>The Politics of Modernism</em>, show Williams still experimenting with new ways to think through the connections
                  between feeling, perception, and social being, and how they might be located between
                  cultural producers at work on shared projects and a wider, emergent social awareness
                  that is still unformed. It is worth recalling, of course, that his idea of cooperation
                  was informed by a long socialist tradition of regarding cooperation in the labor process
                  as vital to any creative overcoming of exploited labor, a meaning sometimes lost in
                  more facile thinking about collaborative work today. We might also take Williams’
                  term "trans-individual" in another sense not available to Williams in his time, since
                  the word evokes a notion of interpersonal networks in ways that earlier terms like
                  collective consciousness may not. All these questions arise in Williams’s work at
                  a time when Romantic-period scholars are searching for conceptions of cooperative
                  authorship, constructive social networks, and other forms and interconnective means
                  of producing cultural projects, whether literary ones at the turn of the nineteenth
                  century, or scholarly ones in the early twenty-first. The essays in this collection
                  speak with imagination and power as well as with different minds about such matters;
                  we think they will be immensely suggestive about ways to think with the work of Raymond
                  Williams once again now.</p>
