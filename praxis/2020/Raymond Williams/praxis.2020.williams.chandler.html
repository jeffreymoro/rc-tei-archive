            <p class="noCount">This essay begins by considering the place of the Romantic period in Williams’s various
               accounts of pivotal historical moments. It goes on, however, to address two interrelated
               questions about Williams’s changing relation to the category of Romanticism, from
               his account of the "Romantic Artist" and the "Creative Imagination" around 1960 through
               his more systematic work on the sociology of literature in the 1970s and after. One
               question is about how the Romantic period matters to the history of genres that Williams,
               as a critic who worked across genres, came to elaborate in some detail. He came to
               believe that the period was important for any account of genres, but not, like other
               critics, for its prioritization of lyric poetry. The second question is about Williams’s
               relation to the enterprise of practical criticism at Cambridge, especially his challenge
               to the project of I. A. Richards, which was of course determined in large part by
               its focus on reading the lyric. Williams challenged Richards with an emphasis on drama,
               out of which he developed his notion of the "structure of feeling." And it was in
               his somewhat underappreciated book of 1965, <em>Modern Tragedy</em>, that a kind of turning point is reached in Williams’s thinking about Romanticism,
               which recedes markedly in the later work.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I</span></h2>
               <p>Raymond Williams was, in most of his writings, a narrative thinker. Examples of this
                  tendency can be found all across his extensive oeuvre. One can see it in the very
                  titles of two books, respectively, about drama and fiction: <em>Drama: From Ibsen to Eliot</em> (1952) (later revised as <em>Drama from Ibsen to Brecht</em>) and <em>The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</em> (1970). One can see it as well in the organization of two of the big books he published
                  around 1960: <em>Culture and Society</em> (1958) and <em>The Long Revolution</em> (1961). The individual chapters in both books may be essayistic in form, but they
                  are also in both cases ordered in such a way as to trace a certain arc over time.
                  Williams closes his introduction to <em>The Long Revolution</em> by noting that it completes a body of work that includes not only <em>Culture and Society</em>—for which it is clearly a companion volume—but also his first novel, <em>Border Country</em> (1960), which was published in the year between them. That a work of fiction could
                  be placed in such close relationship with two critical books seems to reinforce a
                  certain sense of narrative overlap among them.</p>
               <p>The tendency to rely on narrative as a default mode continues to show up in Williams’s
                  important works of the 1970s, though here narrative is complimented by something like
                  a stratigraphic tendency, as mapped in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1974), with its much-cited schema of residual, dominant, and emergent cultural formations.
                  <em>Marxism and Literature</em> itself, though presented as a work of theory, unfolds as its own kind of conceptual
                  narrative, with problems and solutions in the history of Marxist literary analysis
                  succeeding each other in linked intellectual episodes. The overall organization of
                  <em>Keywords</em>, by contrast, is not narrative but explicitly and emphatically alphabetical. Nonetheless,
                  in a kind of inversion of the pattern of <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>, the individual entries in <em>Keywords</em> are themselves narratively structured, each telling the history of a particular semantic
                  transformation. <em>The Country and the City</em>, with its announced emphasis on location over narrative, space over time, is a partial
                  exception to this overall tendency, one to which I recur more than once in what follows.</p>
               <p>It will be clear from these scattered examples that Williams is willing to start and
                  stop his literary and cultural narratives at many different historical junctures and,
                  more importantly for my purposes here, able to find pivotal moments in many times
                  and places. Ibsen’s great plays of the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s certainly represent
                  one kind of pivotal moment for Williams, but so does the year 1848, on which he focuses
                  in <em>The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</em>. In <em>Modern Tragedy</em> (1966), Williams declares that "since 1917, we have been living in a world of successful
                  social revolutions" and that this particular date is "probably decisive in all our
                  thinking," certainly in all our thinking about revolution and tragedy, his twin themes
                  in that book (73). Taken as a whole, these narratives have so many pivot points, one
                  might say, that the very idea of a pivot seems to lose its force and purchase.</p>
               <p>This last point is not lost on Williams himself. Early on in <em>The Country and the City</em>, Williams waxes uncharacteristically playful in a little game about how to date the
                  disappearance of "organic community," the supplanting of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gemeinschaft</span> by <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gesellschaft</span>. Beginning close to home with <em>Culture and Environment</em> (1932), a book coauthored by his teacher at Cambridge F. R. Leavis, Williams notes
                  that for Leavis "the change is very recent indeed" (<em>Country</em> 9). Yet this view, he goes on, was based on the books by one George Sturt, which
                  were published between 1907 and 1923. And then, as Williams puts it, "what seemed
                  like an escalator began to move," for Sturt located this break as early as the enclosures
                  of 1861 (<em>Country</em> 9). Thomas Hardy’s novels pushed things back to the 1830s. And Richard Jefferies,
                  writing in the 1870s, spoke of the decisive change as having occurred in the last
                  half century. But then, with William Cobbett, John Clare, George Crabbe, and Oliver
                  Goldsmith, Williams is soon pointing to a still earlier break in the mid-eighteenth
                  century. Before long, he feels bound to reach all the way back to the pastoral nostalgia
                  of, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter alia</span>, Thomas More’s <em>Utopia</em> and William Langland’s <em>Piers Plowman</em>. It can, Williams shows, be a tricky business to pin down such pivotal moments in
                  social and cultural narratives, especially when "literature" is the medium of evidence.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II</span></h2>
               <p>It is a commonplace that historians of all kinds, including literary historians, tend
                  to think of the period they study as decisive for change over time. And students of
                  the Romantic period tend, among all specialists, to make particularly bold claims
                  for the age on which they focus. Evidence for these claims is not so hard to find
                  or to marshal, and this evidence was not unknown to the writers of that moment. Powerful
                  "causes unknown to former times," wrote Wordsworth in the Preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, were radically altering culture and society, literature and taste, at the turn of
                  the nineteenth century (Wordsworth 128). In addition to the major political revolutions
                  in America and France, we must number among these causes the beginning of England’s
                  Industrial Revolution—with its "accumulation of men in cities" and new forms of monotonous
                  work (Wordsworth 128)—which Williams’s himself conveniently dates to roughly the life
                  of William Blake (1757–1827). These are familiar facts and no one knows them better
                  than Williams himself. No surprise then that, in several of his books at least, the
                  decisive historical moment seems to fall around the turn of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>This happens, for example, in both of the important early books with which I began:
                  <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>. Both books establish their points of departure in late eighteenth-century Britain.
                  Both also devote early framing chapters to discussion of matters that most scholars
                  of Romanticism have regarded as central to their understanding of that subject: "The
                  Romantic Artist" in the case of <em>Culture and Society</em> and "The Creative Mind" in the case of <em>The Long Revolution</em>. When he focuses on such topics in this way, Williams shows himself capable of making
                  claims about the decisive importance of the Romantic moment in literary and cultural
                  history that would satisfy the field pride of the most aggressive Romanticists now
                  working. Elsewhere, however, he is less inclined to do so. For example, in his survey
                  of the social origins of British writers over several centuries of literary history,
                  divided into 50-year segments, no particular pivot point is indicated with either
                  of the Romantic generations (<em>Long Revolution</em>). It is not always clear when Romanticism matters for him and when it does not.</p>
               <p>In what follows, then, I wish to address a couple of basic questions. What are the
                  narrative contexts that lead Williams to cast the Romantic period in a decisive historical
                  role? And, in a critical project that evolved as much as Williams’s did over time,
                  is it possible to mark some changes in the way Williams accounts for the Romantic
                  era and its movements? To put this second question another way, which involves an
                  implicit narrative of my own, what happens to Romanticism as Williams’s frame of reference
                  shifts from "culture and society" to "Marxism and literature"?</p>
               <p>In retrospect, Williams’s early chapters on Romanticism in both <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em> depict the Romantic poets and their social-political circumstances in ways that we
                  have perhaps come to take for granted but that were anything but commonplace in Romantic
                  studies six decades ago. Prominent American work on the Romantic poets in the 1950s
                  included Earl Wasserman’s close reading of Keats in <em>The Finer Tone</em> (1953) and Robert Langbaum’s study of the Romantic origins of the dramatic monologue
                  in <em>The Poetry of Experience</em> (1957), both of which appeared before <em>Culture and Society</em>. David Ferry’s elegant appreciation of Wordsworth’s major lyrics in <em>The Limits of Mortality</em> (1959) and Harold Bloom’s Buberian interpretation of Shelley in <em>Shelley’s Mythmaking</em> (1959) appeared the year after Williams’s book. In England an exemplary work from
                  this period is John Jones’s "history of Wordsworth’s imagination" in <em>The Egotistical Sublime</em> (1954). At Cambridge, Williams’s colleague Frank Kermode published <em>Romantic Image</em> (1957), which anticipates <em>Culture and Society</em> in that it offers a century-and-a-half narrative history that begins with the figure
                  of "the artist in isolation," but this is about as far as the resemblance goes, for
                  Kermode gives very little account of what the artist might be isolated from or against
                  (1). When history is invoked in work of the postwar period of Romantic criticism,
                  as it is in such major books as Walter Jackson Bate’s <em>From Classic to Romantic</em> (1946), Northrop Frye’s <em>Fearful Symmetry</em> (1947), or M. H. Abrams’s <em>The Mirror and the Lamp</em> (1953), it tends to be in the mode of the history of ideas (as in Frye’s invocation
                  of Locke), or the history of aesthetics (as in Bate’s book), or both (as in Abrams’s).</p>
               <p>It already matters to Williams’s handling of Romanticism in <em>Culture and Society</em> that "The Romantic Artist" is actually the <em>second</em> chapter in the book (30). Williams begins with the pairing of two actively political
                  figures—Burke and Cobbett—best known for their writings on society more broadly. When
                  Williams turns to the poets in his second chapter, his first move is to stress that
                  "the poets from Blake and Wordsworth to Shelley and Keats" were among the generations
                  of poets most "deeply interested and . . . involved in study and criticism of the
                  society of their day" (<em>Culture and Society</em> 30). This observation leads him to puzzle over the "popular and general conception"
                  of these same poets as "indifferent to the crude worldliness and materialism of politics
                  and social affairs" (<em>Culture and Society</em> 30). For Williams in this book, the figure of the "Romantic Artist" is something
                  to be seriously queried, if not quite ultimately debunked.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Williams was by no means the first commentator to emphasize the relationship of these
                     poets to such political events as the French Revolution. But no one had explored,
                     as he was to do in this book and its many sequels, their relation to the Industrial
                     Revolution. Moreover, he emphasized that the transformations it effected—though "slower,
                     wider, less observable" than those of the political revolution—were part of what he
                     could come to call the lived experience of the time: <span class="quote">‘The changes that we receive as record were experienced, in these years, on the senses:
                        hunger, suffering, conflict, dislocation; hope, energy, vision, dedication. The pattern
                        of change was not background, as we may now be inclined to study it; it was, rather,
                        the mould in which general experience was cast. (<em>Culture and Society</em> 31)’</span> If one didn’t know the case to be otherwise, one could almost imagine that the cultural
                     moment of the early Industrial Revolution and its manifestations in the work of the
                     Romantic poets constituted the inaugural context for Williams’s signature notion of
                     a "structure of feeling."

                              down references and preparing this essay for publication. The concept of structures
                              of feeling was first developed by Williams and Orrom in Preface to Film. For an extended
                              account of the development of the concept throughout Williams’s oeuvre, see Chandler,
                              
                              “I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams”
                              (344–52).</span></div>
                     </div> He would go on in this chapter to apply that notion to some of the various challenges
                     to convention that writers made in this period: "changes in convention only occur
                     when there are radical changes in the general structure of feeling" (<em>Culture and Society</em> 39). Out of such "first apprehensions of the essential significance of the Industrial
                     Revolution," Williams’s argues, grew the roots of "the idea of culture" itself: accompanying
                     the political, economic, and social changes came "a radical change also in ideas of
                     art, of the artist, and of their place in society" (<em>Culture and Society</em> 31–32). The figure of the "Romantic Artist" was one encapsulation of these altered
                     ideas.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Returning to some of these questions in <em>The Long Revolution</em>, Williams produces a proto-<em>Keywords</em> sort of history of the word "creative" in its various forms, which he says "carries
                     a . . . consistently positive reference," more so than any other word in English (3).
                     As we might expect, the pivotal moment for the history of this word comes in the Romantic
                     period. And Williams lays out the history of the relationship between ordinary and
                     artistic "seeing" in the following schema:

Against
                     Bate’s position, Williams argues that Classic and Romantic critical orientations are
                     not so much opposed to each other as they are aligned against a third aesthetic: naturalism.
                     Against Abrams’s position, Williams suggests that the relationship of imitation—the
                     mirror—to creativity is a vexed one. In <em>Culture and Society</em>, the argument goes like this: <span class="quote">‘The tendency of Romanticism is towards . . . a claim which all good classical theory
                        would have recognized: the claim that the artist’s business is to "read the open secret
                        of the universe" . . . In fact, the doctrines of "the genius" (the autonomous creative
                        artist) and of the "superior reality of art" (penetration to a sphere of universal
                        truth) were in Romantic thinking two sides of the same claim. (<em>Culture and Society</em> 39)

                        </div>’</span> In <em>The Long Revolution</em>, Williams wrote that "the long and often bitter dialogue between these contrasted
                     positions leads now, not to a taking of sides, but to a rejection of the premises
                     which both parties share"—that is, that the genius has powers to penetrate to a higher
                     reality (<em>Long Revolution</em> 19). What makes both corrections possible, even necessary, is Williams’s insistence
                     on seeing the posture of the Romantic Artist as deriving, on the part of the writers
                     who assumed it, from the felt realities of the Industrial Revolution. In this sense,
                     Romanticism comes to be understood as just one way of responding to the transformations
                     unfolding in the world’s first industrial nation in the decades straddling the turn
                     of the nineteenth century. And <em>that</em> recognition in turn enables us to begin to answer the first question I posed about
                     what sort of narrative might lead Williams to see Romanticism as a kind of pivot point.
                     The answer would seem to be something like a history of the poet’s role in society.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of course, both <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em> build accounts that run over a far longer period than the Romantic period, and, from
                  the start, both address many more developments than the rubric of "Romanticism" could
                  encompass. They also address a wide variety of genres beyond poetry: <em>Culture and Society</em>, for example, includes prose nonfiction, fiction, drama, and criticism among its
                  objects of study, beginning as it does with Burke and Cobbett and ending with Richards
                  and Leavis. As Williams’s thinking evolved beyond this pair of early books, indeed,
                  two interrelated issues already incipient in them began more and more to occupy his
                  attention. One is the broader question of genres, what he calls the "multiplicity
                  of writing," especially what happened to genre discrimination around the turn of the
                  nineteenth century, the historical starting point for <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>. The other is the question of his involvement in the project of practical criticism.
                  I will address each of these two questions in turn.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III</span></h2>
               <p>Late in his career, in <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, Williams revisited the Romantic period in a new key as part of his account of the
                  "complex process" in which, over many decades, a system of fairly settled classical
                  classification was subjected to a "bourgeois drawing and redrawing of all these lines"
                  (147). This remapping of the genres, he argued, took place in keeping with tendencies
                  to secularization, rationalization, and ultimately popularization, and the upshot
                  of this process was the (for Williams) problematic distinction between "literary"
                  and "non-literary" kinds of writing. He is careful to assert, however, that this distinction
                  developed by stages. First there was the formation of certain disciplinary practices
                  (in history, philosophy, and social and scientific description) in which "new kinds
                  of distinction about forms and method of writing were radically connected with new
                  kinds of distinction about intention." Thus in certain fields, older values such as
                  "elevation" or "dignity" gave way to new values such as practicality, effectiveness,
                  and accuracy (<em>Marxism</em> 147). For a time—and here Williams is probably thinking of, among others, the Scottish
                  school of rhetoric and belles lettres associated with Adam Smith and Hugh Blair—the
                  idea of "‘Literature’ as a body of ‘polite learning’" could still function to unite
                  these increasingly diverse intentions (<em>Marxism</em> 147). But then came the real crisis, which Williams dates to the Romantic period.</p>
               <p>"Under pressure," he writes, "especially in the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth
                  centuries, this broke down" (<em>Marxism</em> 147). It is at this moment in the account that Williams produces a new conceptualization,
                  now in the register of the sociology of literature, of the Romantic moment described
                  at the start of <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>: "‘Literature’ became either the conceded or the contemptuous alternative—the sphere
                  of imagination or fancy, or of emotional substance and effect—or, at the insistence
                  of its practitioners, the relatively removed but again ‘higher’ dimension—the creative
                  as distinguished from the rational or the practical" (<em>Marxism</em> 147). We can note that the figure of the lyric poet as "Romantic Artist" is not privileged
                  in this new formulation. On the contrary, when Williams goes on to spell out the implications
                  of this shift in the new framework of <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, other genres and forms are emphasized: <span class="quote">‘In this complex interaction it is of course significant that the separated literature
                     itself changed, in many of its immediate forms. In the "realist" novel, especially
                     in its distinction from "romance," in the new drama (socially extended, secular and
                     contemporary), and in the new special forms of biography and autobiography, many of
                     the same secular, rational, or popular impulses changed particular forms of writing
                     from the inside, or created new literary forms. (<em>Marxism</em> 147)’</span> From his late sociological perspective, we might say, Williams came to see that the
                  era we call Romantic not only separated "literature" in its subsequent sense from
                  other kinds of writing, but also developed further, fractal distinctions of the same
                  kind within that category, such as the distinction between "romance" and "realism."
                  To superimpose this new account of the turn of the nineteenth century on the account
                  given in <em>Culture and Society</em>, then, is to see the foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet-as-Artist less in portrait
                  scale, with a historical landscape visible in the background, and more on the scale
                  of a crowded historical painting populated with other moving and changing images.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The second issue that occupies Williams’s attention in the years beyond 1960, though
                     in truth it is an issue that is with him from the start, is how to grapple with the
                     legacy of Cambridge English (especially in the persons of I. A. Richards and F. R.
                     Leavis, who are paired in a late chapter of <em>Culture and Society</em>), which had been so formative on his early work and thought. This difficult struggle
                     with practical criticism also mattered to his relationship to Romanticism, especially
                     to the once-foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet. Toward the end of his career,
                     Williams provided some late reflections on the role of practical criticism in his
                     early work that illuminate the evolution of his thinking. Looking back from 1977,
                     when he cooperated in a book-length series of interviews for <em>New Left Review</em> about his long career, Williams was especially self-critical about his approach to
                     reading and interpretation in <em>Culture and Society</em>. In these interviews, he acknowledges that his approach to the writings he discusses
                     was too immersive, too much given to reproducing the views of the authors he discusses
                     and too little given to maintaining critical distance. He blamed this tendency on
                     a habit of reading he had acquired at Cambridge under the aegis of "practical criticism."
                     The fuller story of Williams’s long struggle with these two figures is too complicated
                     to rehearse here.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Chandler, 
                              “I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams.”

                     </div> But in brief one might sum it up in three steps, even if it was not quite so clear-cut
                     in the working out.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The first step is Williams’s determination that Leavis’s version of practical criticism
                  was not only a less estimable affair than Richards’s, but also that it indeed represented
                  an ideological capture of Richards’s project on two counts: where Richards’s practical
                  criticism was grounded in rigorous theory, Leavis insisted on practice as opposed
                  to theory, <em>and</em> Leavis debased the best elements of Richards’s program by substituting excerpts from
                  novels in place of integral poetic texts. The second step is that, seeing this much,
                  Williams was able to recognize the greatness of Richards’s reformation in criticism—especially
                  its debunking of Oxbridge class privilege in the encounter with literature—but also
                  to admit its damaging limitations. These limitations called for the third step: Williams
                  would have to build a major critical alternative to practical criticism, something
                  that he indeed labored at for years and that issued in his great books of the 1970s
                  and 1980s.</p>
               <p>But what does the question of practical criticism have to do with Romanticism? Not
                  the least of the problems in Richards’s influential program, as Williams came to see,
                  was precisely the focus on the integral lyric poem in its Romantic incarnation, which
                  entailed a certain kind of reading practice closely associated with Wordsworth, whose
                  experiments with sensibility of the 1790s closely anticipate those of Richards in
                  the 1920s (in ways not difficult to demonstrate). It would be an exaggeration to say
                  that Williams’s reading of the figure of the Romantic Artist (in <em>Culture and Society</em>) and the concomitant emergence of the "creative mind" (in <em>The Long Revolution</em>) was in either case an unequivocal endorsement. It is not an exaggeration, however,
                  to say that he came to see these readings as too invested in a Wordsworthian lyric
                  paradigm that mattered so much to Richards. The paradigm, for all its initial sense
                  of empowerment and liberation from class prejudice, involved a subtle kind of "servility"
                  to the formal technique of close reading the lyric poem, what Williams identified
                  as an "active-passivity" in Richards’s Wordsworthian recourse to reading poetry as
                  a remedy for cultural crisis.</p>
               <p>The corrective to this narrow focus on immersive reading of integral lyrics, as Williams
                  explained things in the late 1970s, was to shift the paradigmatic object of critical
                  focus from poetry to drama. This was a move readily available to Williams, since drama
                  was the field in which he started his academic work and to which he often returned
                  in his writings. His dissertation was on Ibsen, and his appointment at Cambridge was
                  actually as professor of drama. In addition to the books on drama that I have already
                  mentioned, there are the two short books of 1954, <em>Preface to Drama</em> and <em>Preface to Film</em> (the latter coauthored with Michael Orrom). Since film, in Williams’s handing, is
                  decidedly a particular species of dramatic presentation, both books are really about
                  drama. And it is in Williams’s contribution to the latter book that he lays out an
                  understanding of "drama-in-performance," which requires attention not just to the
                  literary text, à la Richards, but also to the historical conventions of theatrical
                  production. This focus in turn leads at this very early date to Williams’s first articulation
                  of the concept—"structures of feeling"—on which he would famously ground the evolving
                  critical edifice that should supplant that of Richards.</p>
               <p>That edifice would indeed be a long time in the building, but an interesting moment
                  in its construction comes with <em>Modern Tragedy</em> (1967), a book that Williams himself thought well of, though it has not enjoyed the
                  same warmth of reception as many of his other books. The book is divided between a
                  series of reflective essays in part one, "Tragic Ideas," and a series of critical
                  essays on modern tragic works in part two, almost all of them from the twentieth century.
                  It seeks overall to reframe the relationship between tragedy and politics, and it
                  does so first by critiquing what Williams calls "the ordinary twentieth-century idea"
                  of tragedy, or "the structure of tragedy in our own culture" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 62), and then by reading specific tragedies from the new perspective he opens up.
                  The ordinary twentieth-century idea of tragedy includes components that are meant
                  to be recognized as familiar: the separation of tragedy from accident, the focus on
                  the destruction of the hero, the principle of irreversible or "irreparable" action,
                  and the emphasis on absolute evil. One consequence of the hegemony of this ideology
                  of tragedy, for Williams, is the false dichotomy Williams precisely seeks to redress:
                  "Having separated earlier tragic systems from their actual societies, we can achieve
                  a similar separation in our own time, and can take it for granted that modern tragedy
                  can be discussed without reference to the deep social crisis, of war and revolution,
                  through which we have all been living" (<span style="font-style:italic">Modern Tragedy</span> 62).</p>
               <p><em>Modern Tragedy</em> offers an account of how this particular separation widened over time. And as with
                  some other narratives we have considered, the turn of the nineteenth century marks
                  a crucial turn in a larger story. Anticipating the account of the multiplicity of
                  writing in <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, the first essay in part two—
                  “From Hero to Victim: The Making of Liberal Tragedy, to Ibsen and Miller”
                  —goes back in time to consider a key transition (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 87). This is the transition from what Williams calls "bourgeois tragedy" in decline—driven
                  underground "by its own contradictions"—to the reemergence of its distinctive energy
                  in the form of Romantic tragedy (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 94). Williams is well aware that in making Romantic tragedy the focus of this particular
                  narrative, he is not playing to the strengths of the movement. Romantic drama, certainly
                  in Britain, is not on the whole a body of achievement to rival Romantic poetry. Yet
                  it plays its part in the longer history of tragedy: "What is quite evident, through
                  all the failures of Romantic drama, is a renewal and a renewed assertion of individual
                  energy" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 94). More to the point for Williams, this new energy follows a course that helps
                  to shape the (deeply problematic) modern idea of tragedy. Certain key themes of Romantic
                  tragedy—the "impossibility of finding a home in the world, the condemnation to a guilty
                  wandering, the dissolution of self and others in a desire that is beyond all relationships"—are
                  what Williams calls "an important source of nearly all modern tragedy," especially
                  (one might add) tragedy cast in an existentialist register as is the case for many
                  of the plays Williams selects in the mid-twentieth century (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 94–95).</p>
               <p>How does the renewal of energy in Romantic drama issue in such dark consequences?
                  Williams tells the story this way: <span class="quote">‘The desires of man are again intense and imperative; they reach out and test the
                     universe itself. Society is identified as convention, and convention as the enemy
                     of desire. The individual rebellion is humanist, at a conscious level. Prometheus
                     and Faust, characteristically, are its heroes. But the condition of desire, unconsciously,
                     is that it is always forbidden. What then happens is that the forms of desire become
                     devious and often perverse, and what looks like revolt is more properly a desperate
                     defiance of heaven and hell. There is a related preoccupation with remorse: deep,
                     pervasive, and beyond all its nominal causes. For in Romantic tragedy man is guilty
                     of the ultimate and nameless crime of being himself. (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 94)’</span> Williams’s scope of reference in this passage is broadly European. He notes elsewhere
                  that "Romanticism" in the sense that he uses it in this book is a European phenomenon,
                  and of course <em>Modern Tragedy</em> as a whole deals with a range of tragic production from the ancient Athenians to
                  Ionesco, Beckett, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams. For the decades straddling
                  the turn of the nineteenth century, the expanded scope takes us well beyond the canon
                  of Romanticism enumerated in <em>Culture and Society</em>—"from Blake and Wordsworth to Shelley and Keats"—to the European-identified Byron
                  and indeed to Schiller and Goethe. And the concentration on drama, with its concomitant
                  expansion of horizons, seems to shift focus importantly in Williams’s evolving understanding
                  of Romanticism as such.</p>
               <p>Indeed, <em>Modern Tragedy</em> has the advantage of being perhaps unique in Williams’s oeuvre for having a section
                  that bears the heading "Romanticism." This section appears in the culminating chapter
                  of part one, "Tragedy and Revolution," a conjunction of ideas, as he called them,
                  that involved him in years of study. Within that chapter, this section appears third
                  in a sequence that includes first "Liberalism" and then "Naturalism." The sequence
                  merits some attention for the question of how Romanticism comes to be understood by
                  Williams as an aspect of a larger set of pivotal and dialectically related ideological
                  developments in that historical moment. It is the moment in which, in the wake of
                  the French Revolution, "the idea of tragedy can be seen as in different ways a response
                  to a culture in conscious change and movement" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 62). The French Revolution itself, on Williams’s account, had marked the moment when
                  the medieval idea of rebellion was refashioned into the modern idea of revolution.
                  This modern idea of revolution, he explains, had its origins in liberalism, which,
                  over time, "eroded the conceptions of a permanent human nature and of a static social
                  order with connections to a divine order" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 68). Out of liberalism’s "alternative conception of the possibility of human and
                  social transformation," however, comes not only the new notion of revolution, but
                  also an identification of the most important human values "not with the received order
                  but with development, progress and change" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 68). For Williams, then, liberalism had the effect of putting the idea of revolution
                  and the idea of tragedy at odds: "Revolution asserted the possibility of man altering
                  his condition; tragedy showed its impossibility. . . . On that opposition, we are
                  still trying to rest" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 68).</p>
               <p>Liberalism, so understood by Williams, spawned two tragic modes that offer stark choices
                  which are "essentially a matter of attitudes towards revolution" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 68). The first discussed is what he calls <em>Naturalism</em>, which <em>seems</em> a "true child of the liberal enlightenment, in which the traditional ideas of fate,
                  an absolute order, a design beyond human powers, were replaced by a confidence in
                  reason and in the possibility of a continually expanding capacity for explanation
                  and control" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 69). But this child of enlightenment, declares Williams, "finally, is a bastard":
                  <span class="quote">‘What became naturalism, and what distinguished it from the more important movement
                     of realism, was a mechanical description of men as the creatures of their environment,
                     which literature recorded as if man and thing were of the same nature. The tragedy
                     of naturalism is the tragedy of passive suffering, and the suffering is passive because
                     man can only endure and never really change his world. . . . This naturalism . . .
                     began in liberalism but ends, ironically, as a grotesque version of the system originally
                     challenged by liberalism . . . (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 69)’</span> Naturalism and its debased form of tragedy are ultimately associated with the rapidly
                  developing theories of political economy and "the theory of administered reform,"
                  society in this view amounting to nothing more than "an impersonal process, a machine
                  with certain built-in properties" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 70). The naturalist response to liberalism gives us the "mystification" of what Williams
                  calls "mechanical materialism" and more specifically "utilitarianism" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 71).</p>
               <p>Romanticism is the name that Williams gives to the <em>second</em> of the two movements that "sought to express the values of liberalism" (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 71). If utilitarianism, "the most common English form of mechanical materialism,
                  had sought liberal values in the reform of civil society," Romanticism took a seemingly
                  opposite tack, seeking "values in the development of the individual," though this
                  led to a similarly ironic impasse. <span class="quote">‘In its early stages, Romanticism was profoundly liberating, but, partly because of
                     the inadequacy of any corresponding social theory, and partly because of the consequent
                     decline from individualism and subjectivism, it ended by denying its own deepest impulses,
                     and even reversing them. Almost all our revolutionary language in fact comes from
                     the Romantics, and this has been a real hindrance as well as an incidental embarrassment.
                     Romanticism is the most important expression in modern literature of the first impulse
                     of revolution: a new and absolute image of man. Characteristically, it relates this
                     transcendence to an ideal world and an ideal human society; it is in Romantic literature
                     that man is first seen as making himself. (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 71)’</span> How, exactly, does the promise of Romanticism go so wrong as to deny, even to reverse,
                  its own deepest impulses? As Williams says, it has partly to do with the inadequacy
                  of any existing social theory in that moment. Liberal political economy certainly
                  would not do. Marx famously wrote than human beings make their own history but not
                  under conditions of their own choosing. Likewise, when the Romantic project of man
                  making himself is "particularised, to social criticism and construction, it encounters
                  fundamental obstacles." The turn is to utopia: <span class="quote">‘It is easier to visualise the ideal in an exotic or fabled community (or an historical
                     community transformed by those elements). The existing social world is seen as so
                     hostile to what is most deeply human that even what begins as social criticism tends
                     to pass into nihilism. (<em>Modern Tragedy</em> 71)’</span> Thus, in the space of a page in <em>Modern Tragedy</em>, does the promise of the so-called Romantic movement, now understood in its relation
                  to revolution and tragedy, pass from everything to nothing.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">V</span></h2>
               <p>What distinguishes Williams’s treatment of Romanticism in <em>Modern Tragedy</em>, then, is his aggressive formulation of its tendencies within the systematic unfolding
                  of a dialectical account in which liberalism opposes the feudal order, clearing the
                  way for the modern idea of revolution, but then finds its contradictions played out
                  in two apparently rival modes of representation that are actually mutually complementary.
                  The dialectical contradictions within each of these modes is in turn examined so that
                  each turns against its own most promising drives and aspirations. Over the course
                  of <em>Modern Tragedy</em>, Williams ultimately works out, first in theory and then in applied critical practice,
                  how an enriched understanding of the relationship between tragedy and revolution can
                  point a way forward. In the end, the paradoxical optimism of this book about tragedy
                  is perhaps best understood in relation to its distinctive moment in the mid-1960s,
                  a time when Williams was active in movements that provide a flash of hope that, for
                  a time, brightened Britain’s social and political prospects.</p>
               <p>The point I wish to emphasize here is that Williams represents Romanticism in his
                  study of the history of a dramatic form in a way that feels far less immersive than
                  the accounts offered only a few years earlier in <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>. All three books work in an essayistic mode, but there is a systematicity to the
                  unfolding arguments of <em>Modern Tragedy</em> that is far more pronounced than anything in those earlier books. <em>Modern Tragedy</em> indeed anticipates the marked systematicity of <em>Marxism and Literature</em> about a decade later. Yet as I have noted, the systematic language in that late book
                  is mainly aimed at constructing the critical edifice with which Williams sought to
                  supplant the powerful program of Richards. It offers an account of British culture
                  and society only incidentally, along the way, with next to nothing about "Romanticism"
                  as such. It is thus telling that, in the comments we considered earlier about what
                  happens to the "multiplicity of literature" in the "late-eighteenth and early nineteenth
                  centuries," Romanticism never quite gets to hear the sound of its own name—though
                  "romance" as a sub-genre does, along with references to the creative imagination and
                  other Romantic topics. Likewise, when Williams turned back to English literary history
                  and criticism in <em>The Country and the City</em>, Romanticism as such plays very little role, a point that gains added force when
                  one considers how many pages are devoted, say, to Wordsworth. A quick search of <em>The Country and the City</em> will show that "romantic" is nearly always used there in its lowercase form, an everyday
                  descriptor rather than a term associated with a particular literary and intellectual
                  movement around the turn of the nineteenth century: "romantic love," "romantic compliment,"
                  "romantic lovers," "romantic wastes," "romantic strain," "romantic attachment," "romantic
                  atmosphere," "romantic destiny" (to name just a few) (<em>Country</em> 23, 25, 63, 69, 71, 203, 227, 251).</p>
               <p>It would be wrong to conclude that Williams somehow came to forget about the "Romantic
                  movement" in his late work. He even refers to it once in passing, when, in making
                  a point about eighteenth-century enclosures, he explains that it "connects with that
                  structure of feeling which was beginning to form, from Goldsmith to the poets of the
                  Romantic movement, and which is particularly visible in Clare: the loss of the ‘old
                  country’" (<em>Country</em> 137). Yet this way of gesturing casually to the shared cultural figures and formations
                  of the two generations of poets "from Blake and Wordsworth to Shelley and Keats,"
                  as he identifies them in <em>Culture and Society</em>, already marks quite a change, if only because names are named only for the period-bracketing
                  figures of Goldsmith and Clare.</p>
               <p>Nor should we conclude that the decades around the turn of the nineteenth century
                  in Britain ceased to be pivotal for Williams: when he traces the history of the most
                  important terms in <em>Keywords</em>, many of the transformations he calls decisive (a favorite word of his own) tend
                  to occur in the passage from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The point is
                  rather that the figures and topoi of Romanticism as such, once the starting point
                  in <em>Culture and Society</em> and <em>The Long Revolution</em>, and indeed the guidelines for Richards’s immersive practical criticism embraced
                  by Williams in his early years, had become systematized as far as they could be in
                  the dialectics of <em>Modern Tragedy</em>. After that, Romanticism as such held diminished interest for his late work on literature,
                  media, and society.</p>
