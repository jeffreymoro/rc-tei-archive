            <p class="noCount">In <em>The Country and the City</em> (1973), Raymond Williams launched an investigation into the historical character
               of Jane Austen’s fiction which has profoundly influenced our understanding of the
               novelist’s work and the period in which she wrote. This essay first examines Williams’s
               curiously static representation of Austen, offered by a critic otherwise attuned to
               a literary and social history conceived as unsettled and agitated. The limitations
               of his approach reflect both gender bias and a bias toward realism, especially evident
               in Williams’s reliance on the figure of perspective. To loosen understanding of the
               history in Austen, this essay proposes a turn to Williams’s later reflections on media,
               notably <em>Television: Technology and Cultural Form</em> (1974), where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries of visual perspective.
               Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams depicts it and to move
               Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons and other media.</p>

                  <p>Jane Austen is a favorite touchstone in Raymond Williams’s discussions of both the
                     novel and the development of British culture more broadly. She inaugurates his account
                     of <em>The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</em> (1970) and then, in <em>The Country and the City</em> (1973), marks the historical shift to “an acquisitive high bourgeois society at the
                     point of its most evident interlocking with an agrarian capitalism . . . [a]n openly
                     acquisitive society, which is concerned with the transmission of wealth, [and] trying
                     to judge itself by an inherited code and the morality of improvement” (Williams, <em>English Novel</em> 21). Austen helps Williams describe a “most difficult world to describe”: “active,
                     complicated, and sharply speculative” (Williams, <em>Country</em> 115). In <em>Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</em> (1976), the novelist is tagged to terms Williams activated in <em>The Country and the City</em> specifically to track the rise of increasingly abstract forms of value: culture and
                     improvement (<em>Keywords</em> 88, 162).

                              Jane Austen and the Improvement of the Estate, also published in 1970, provides a
                              finer-grained account of Austen’s approach to “improvement” than Williams allows himself.
                              Williams appears not to have read Duckworth before publishing The Country and the
                              City.</span></div>

               <p>In <em>Culture and Society</em>, <em>The Long Revolution</em>, and even <em>The Politics of Modernism</em>, where she plays only bit parts, Austen nonetheless serves as a known quantity, a
                  handy point of reference for the historical and social analyses Williams will roll
                  out. As the editors of the <em>New Left Review</em> note in their interviews with Williams, even though he does not give Austen a chapter
                  to herself, she nonetheless “figures as <em>the starting point</em> of a tradition” (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 224; emphasis added). “Remarkably confident,” “quite extraordinarily composed,” Austen’s
                  work injects stability and familiarity into Williams’s revisionary analysis (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 230).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It was revisionary in the 1970s to treat Austen as “a highly historical writer,” to
                     quote the words of Williams’s interviewers (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 256).

                     </div> Williams’s treatment refutes what he calls a truth universally acknowledged (he does
                     not employ quotation marks because he owns the phrase in common with his readers):
                     the truth, that is, that Austen “chose to ignore the decisive political events of
                     her time,” war and revolution (<em>English Novel</em> 18; <em>Country</em> 113). Williams does not claim that the novelist did address such events; rather, he
                     uses Austen’s example to argue powerfully that history and politics belong less to
                     events than to “the whole social experience” (<em>Country</em> 136). In the 1979 interview that became <em>Politics and Letters</em>, Williams goes so far as to align Austen with his view of the canonical Romantic
                     poets (a radical move for any critic at the time). “The Romantic attempts to grasp
                     the momentous social changes of their time, which were eventually to determine all
                     politics,” Williams finds, “were of far greater significance” than their stance on,
                     say, political revolution. <span class="quote">‘Just as—to take a comparable example—it was really much more important that Jane Austen
                        depicted a vast complex transition in the world of English landowning and landholding
                        than that she did not write about the Napoleonic Wars. It is the same kind of judgment.
                        It is not a general dismissal of politics. (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 81–82)’</span> Williams’s understanding of the history in Austen’s fiction—a history of vast social,
                     economic, and cultural transition—has been supremely influential, coloring scholarly
                     works as diverse as Marilyn Butler’s <em>Jane Austen and the War of Ideas</em> (1988), Clifford Siskin’s <em>The Work of Writing: Literature and Social Change 1700–1830</em> (1999), and Edward Said’s <em>Culture and Imperialism</em> (1993).

                              in her study. Siskin cites his debt to Williams frequently. Said’s reading of Mansfield
                              Park was originally published in Raymond Williams: Critical Perspectives (1989).</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>This understanding builds, however, upon a curiously static representation of Austen,
                  offered by a critic otherwise attuned to a literary and social history conceived as
                  unsettled and agitated. As he elaborates in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977), Williams typically directs his critical attention to “structures of feeling”
                  where historical experience hovers “in solution,” not yet “precipitated” into “the
                  fixed and explicit—the known relationships, institutions, formations, positions” (133–34;
                  128). Williams comes to this formulation, though, after his major work on Austen.
                  If structures of feeling hold loosely “all that is present and moving, all that escapes
                  or seems to escape from the fixed and the explicit and the known,” they seem absent
                  from Austen’s world (<em>Marxism</em> 128). In <em>The Country and the City</em> especially Williams precipitates the world of her novels into something fixed, explicit
                  and known—the anchor of an otherwise mobile “whole social experience” (136). His treatment
                  of Austen tends furthermore to homogenize her fiction (so that any one work stands
                  in for all) and to leave her work unread. By unread I mean to say that in making Austen
                  a touchstone, Williams leaves the novels untouched, and because taken as so familiar,
                  hardly seen.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Williams’s powerful presentation of Austen in history in fact depends less upon structures
                     of feeling than a specific logic of vision and space. Most notably in <em>The Country and the City</em>, Williams focuses attention on “a problem of perspective,” the title of the book’s
                     second chapter. For him the term designates a historiographical problem, but Williams’s
                     “problem of perspective” also works rhetorically to situate the work of reading into
                     a telling and restrictive geometry. The best critique of the rigidity of “perspective”
                     is Williams’s own shift in subsequent work to discerning “history in solution.”

                     </div> His invocation of the “problem of perspective” in these earlier works, by contrast,
                     is especially inadequate to the stillness, quirks, and <em>vertiges</em> that sometimes characterize the way history moves in Austen’s work.

                              oeuvre chafes against the emergent demands of narrative realism; D. A. Miller’s Jane
                              Austen, or the Secret of Style reads the smooth and settled surface of Austen’s style
                              as the index of possibilities foreclosed by her social and historical position. In
                              reimagining the familiar “settlements” of Austen’s fiction, both critics find “within
                              a dimension of relatively fixed forms . . . an unease, a stress, a displacement, a

               <p>To loosen understanding of the history in Austen, then, I propose a turn to Williams’s
                  later reflections on media, where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries
                  of vision and space. Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams
                  depicts it and to move Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons
                  and other media. If works like <em>The Country and the City</em> rely on Austen’s fiction to establish a fixed and familiar horizon, Williams’s writings
                  on “the concept of flow” in new media unmoor that horizon—and our expectations. On
                  the one hand, film and television recognize and capitalize on something less certain
                  or settled emerging especially in the novelist’s later fiction: “qualifications, reservations,
                  indications . . . still sounding elsewhere” (to borrow the language of <em>Marxism and Literature</em>). These features have the potential, as Williams explains elsewhere, to disturb what
                  consensus—critical, historical, or formal—has otherwise “seemed to settle” (<em>Marxism</em> 130). On the other hand, though, Williams’s reflections reveal how new media work
                  to smooth the flux of history into programmatic <em>flow</em>—motion without variation or disturbance. Williams suggests that <em>flow</em> may be a new form of fixity, and that suggestion in turn opens new questions about
                  Williams’s treatment of reading (in the medium of print), his commitment to metaphors
                  of liquidity (“in solution”), and his valuation of motion <em>per se</em>. We might learn more about Austen as a “highly historical writer” by recognizing
                  the limits of Williams’s treatment of the novelist and adopting instead his insights
                  about new media.</p>

               <p>In quoting from Williams’s most influential work on Austen, I give page numbers from
                  both <em>The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</em> and <em>The Country and the City</em> because the analysis of Austen’s novels in the latter repeats wholesale (then extends)
                  that of the former. What interests me is not the obvious change in norms of academic
                  publishing but rather this conflation: that when Williams considers Austen, his approach
                  to a history of the novel and his approach to the social history of these signal English
                  spaces—country and city—so fully overlap. It’s almost as if his rendering of Austen
                  in <em>The English Novel</em> motivates the larger project of <em>The Country and the City</em>—that is, how “land” is “seen”: if Austen “sees land in a way that she does not see
                  ‘other sources’ of income,” he will cultivate other ways of seeing, attuned to “other
                  sources,” especially labor (<em>English Novel</em> 21; <em>Country</em> 115).</p>
               <p>The repetition in his analyses works in part because the figure of perspective—styled
                  also as “ways of seeing”—governs both projects. The movement of the eye implicit in
                  perspective cannot for Williams be dissociated from the mode of reading proposed in
                  these works. In the second chapter of <em>The Country and the City</em>, 
                  “The Problem of Perspective,”
                  he explains that “the witnesses [i.e., authors and their texts] we have summoned raise
                  questions of historical fact and perspective, but they raise questions, also, of literary
                  fact and perspective” (12). For Williams <em>perspective</em> provides a provisional sort of mechanism for testing the assumptions of the present
                  against those of prior moments; more significantly, it helps to coordinate individual
                  experience with a given social structure. In this early effort, such coordination
                  operates almost geometrically in the (socially and dialectically) constructed spaces
                  denominated as country and city. In fact, recalling the function that it plays in
                  painting, we recognize—as Williams must have—that perspective figures the construction
                  of those spaces. In his argument, the figure of perspective helps to <em>externalize</em>, to diagram or map individual experience onto the perceived world through lines of
                  sight (see figure 1).</p>

                  <p>Additionally, the second chapter’s famous image of an “escalator” moving through time
                     as if through space (“back we would go again, over the next hill, to the 1750s”) implies
                     that solving the “problem of perspective” requires movement (10).

                     criticism promotes movement, training the eye to travel between detail and distance,
                     near and far, particular and general, along multiple sightlines. In escalator fashion, <em>The Country and the City</em> organizes the reader’s movement past many stopping points (the “direct experience”
                     of individual witnesses), a movement which then allows the reader to step back and
                     recognize “the regularity of [the] patterns” that make up “real history” (<em>Country</em> 10).

                  <p>In these early works, the history available via <em>perspective</em> is mirrored by Williams’s mode of reading. As Jean-Jacques Lecercle and others point
                     out, it was Williams, contesting the tradition laid down by F. R. Leavis, who prioritized
                     literature for the New Left as it undertook its investigations of British culture,
                     an emphasis that continues to motivate literary critics.

                              change provides a mediation between the general determination of the superstructure
                              by the base and the social experience, which, being lived and felt, will percolate
                              down to the individual” (Lecercle 41). Lecercle puts stress on the literary per se;
                              I want to stress the practice of reading that literature. See also Baskin, 
                              “Romanticism, Culture, Collaboration.”

                     </div> Framed by Williams’s view out his Cambridgeshire window, <em>The Country and the City</em> works to concretize the ways in which <em>reading</em> offers a kind of <em>perspective</em>, binding the lived and felt experience of individuals to the general forms of culture
                     (e.g. literature, tradition). Reading can perform work similar to that of perspective:
                     the reader’s eye travels over the flat page on its way to building a three-dimensional
                     reality, a social totality defined by a horizon of “real history” beyond the page.

You can leaf
                     through the book and discover simply through the formatting a certain reading practice:
                     inset lines of verse stud and long block quotes knock and bump the way we follow the
                     page. The method does not differ from earlier works of literary criticism: like his
                     own teachers, Williams trains our eyes to read differently, more closely, these passages
                     of quoted text. Yet because <em>The Country and the City</em> consistently aligns reading with the landscape out the window (“back we . . . go again,
                     over the next hill, . . .”), the reader is encouraged to treat the printed page as
                     topography, block quotes standing as landmarks or outcroppings in the continually
                     morphing landscape of British city and country. Analytic focus moves from close to
                     distant and back, the muscles of our inner eye as well as our reading eye exercised
                     to toggle between small detail (of text) and large prospect (of social history). What
                     matters most is precisely that ongoing, alternating, comparative movement, the constantly
                     adjusting perspective: the work of the eye models the work of the mind.</p>

                  <p>The treatment of texts mimics Williams’s manner of visualizing the landscape of his

                     takes in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> when she visits “the principal wonders of the country” around Derbyshire, including
                     Pemberley (Austen 157).

                     to “you” most notably, and from then to now, but also from general series (“the next
                     and the next example”), to pointed items (“the stones and the furniture”; “those fields,
                     those streams”), then back out to the large prospect (“look at the land . . . and
                     see the long and systematic . . . exploitation”), only to swing back to reassess detail
                     (“great iron gates,” “guardian lodges”) before discovering finally beyond those details
                     an abstract truth: “you now see” the fact of “social disproportion.” Reading the page
                     teaches you to look at the landscape differently; looking at the landscape (“look
                     at the land”) teaches you to read anew: each is a lens correcting the other. And both

               <p>Williams constructs for his reader a mobile perspective that he associates with many
                  of his selected writers; but for him, Austen’s perspective does not budge. Just a
                  few pages after this tour of the manor houses, Williams stages another lesson in vision
                  and space in “Three around Farnham.” “In this period of change,” the chapter begins,
                  “it mattered very much where you were looking from,” and Jane Austen is only ever
                  looking from within (108). As Williams maps the “perspectives” of three writers at
                  work in the Hampshire countryside circa 1800, Austen provides the pivot: she appears
                  after William Cobbett, the rabble-rousing outsider, has been shown riding his horse
                  around the neighborhood and before the Reverend Gilbert White strolls through the
                  gardens and woods of Selborne. In a world of flux she remains still: working within
                  “no single, settled society,” she nevertheless exhibits a “settled and remarkably
                  confident way of seeing” (113–14). Essentially enclosed, Williams’s Austen is also
                  strangely abstracted—the vanishing point in his picture of Farnham. Williams concretely
                  visualizes Cobbett: “a boy of fourteen, Cobbett ran away from his father’s small farm
                  at Farnham. Cobbett was to ride back through these villages many times” (108, 117).
                  And he lets White’s journal provide vivid details of lived experience as the naturalist
                  dissects a butcher-bird, notes the ripening of berries, and attends to the horrific
                  effects of the 1783 eruption of the Laki volcano (118-19). By contrast, the figure
                  of Austen remains hardly seen behind those impenetrable walls: “not far away, in another
                  parsonage, Jane Austen was beginning to write. . . . in Chawton . . . inside the houses
                  Cobbett was passing on the road. . . . from the other side of the park wall. . . .
                  from inside the houses” (108, 112, 113, 117). No rooms divide this interior world,
                  no upstairs or downstairs, no delineation of domestic routine: “walls” and “houses”
                  are as concrete as it gets. Even as she tracks the “facts of general change and a
                  certain mobility” affecting the families of the landed classes, the novelist herself
                  remains <span class="foreign" id="fr">immeuble</span> (113).</p>

               <p>Like the novelist, Austen’s fiction remains both already known (settled, composed)
                  yet hardly seen. In both these early works Williams barely quotes from the novels:
                  two sets of fewer than three lines from <em>Persuasion</em>, followed by a series of small scraps, not even sentences, and those only in order
                  “to abstract this social history” which motivates him (115) (figure 4). He does not
                  have to submit these bits for close analysis any more than he has to put quotation
                  marks around a truth universally acknowledged (113). Compared to the large blocks
                  of <em>Tom Jones</em> or <em>larissa</em>, of Eliot’s fiction and Hardy’s, mention of Austen’s novels blends into the page,
                  barely registering topographically because they are already part of, fully within,
                  the known landscape. The techniques Austen develops “would only have to be <em>taken outside the park walls</em>” by later novelists to gain the requisite distance to become a properly “social criticism”
                  worthy of more sustained attention, of that recommended mobile focalizing, close and
                  distant, by the reader (<em>English Novel</em> 23; <em>Country</em> 117; emphasis added).</p>

                     sees is “understandably internal and exclusive” without benefit of larger movement
                     or distance (117).

                     his analysis of Austen, <em>outstanding</em> features are absorbed, folded into the <em>understood</em>. At the same time, her “settled and remarkably confident way of seeing” masks a stunted
                     way of seeing: a “foreshortening” of perspective, a “blurring of [the] forces” at
                     work on the larger social prospect (120, 166). Cobbett, perpetually riding by on his
                     horse, can read “class” written on the countryside; Austen, perpetually “inside the

                     Edward Said quotes these lines in <em>Culture and Imperialism</em> (84), Susan Fraiman calls him—and Williams—out for clinging to “the myth of feminine
                     myopia”: <span class="quote">‘While Said wants to go beyond Williams’s class analysis, his Austen, too, is tied

                        on a Eurocentric formulation of the category “home.” Positioned at the beginning of
                        his genealogy and at the heart of his argument, Austen’s fiction works, at least in
                        part, to characterize as domestic and to sex as feminine the larger body of European
                        culture. (Fraiman 819)’</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note14" id="Note14_return"><sup class="super">

                     modern—and masculinized—ethic of mobility.</p>

                  <p>“Ethic of mobility” is a term borrowed from Elizabeth Deeds Ermarth’s foundational
                     study of realist fiction, <em>Realism and Consensus in the English Novel: Time, Space and Narrative</em> (1983). The term implies that Austen’s status for Williams is not just a function
                     of gender; it may also be a question of genre. Ermarth explains how pictorial perspective
                     finds its narrative counterpart in literary realism and how this shared logic of perspective
                     demands from both an “ethic of mobility” (Ermarth 55–58). I cannot do justice here
                     to Ermarth’s meticulous work, but the link she forges between perspective and realism
                     reminds us that Williams approaches the English novel as a realist project. More significantly,
                     her insights suggest that <em>The Country and the City</em>, with its investment in perspective, adopts the techniques of realist fiction—and
                     nowhere more overtly than in 
                     “Three around Farnham.”
                      That chapter asks the reader to track and compare three specific cases, unified in
                     time and space, in order to arrive at an abstract idea of what Williams calls “real
                     history.” In perspectival drawings, Ermarth explains, “the actual form of something
                     [its identity] emerges from a series of vantage points” or “appearances”; realist
                     narrative similarly depends upon a reader sorting and comparing multiple appearances
                     (e.g., Cobbett, Austen, White) in order to compose a social whole. <span class="quote">‘[The] invariant identity of anything cannot be identified at once, but only eventually,
                        through a series where similitudes and recurrent elements can be distinguished among

                        as discreet cases, now come to be understood as partial expressions of hidden wholes;
                        wholes, or identities, which are independent of any particular form of visual apprehension,
                        or, as in the novel, of apprehension by any single individual, in a single moment.
                        (Ermarth 16)’</span> What Ermath designates as “series,” Williams dubs “pattern” or “general movement”
                     made visible by the moving escalator—and the ongoing motions of reading; the “hidden
                     whole” is the social totality or “real history.” For Ermarth, an ethic of mobility
                     both supports and follows from the work perspective performs in painting and narrative
                     realism; it applies as well to the work perspective performs in Williams’s mode of
                     critical reading.

                              it is a matter of time and consciousness” (64). Williams seems to collapse this distinction,

                  <p>Ermarth derives the term “ethic of mobility” in contrast to the “ethic of stillness”
                     which Leo Bersani uses to characterize Austen’s <em>Mansfield Park</em>. Stillness makes that novel a limit case, whose “social universe is inimical to the
                     values of realism” and whose “social hierarchy . . . depends upon maintaining position”
                     (Ermarth 55). Or, as Bersani puts it, <em>Mansfield Park</em> is a novel where a “tremblingly still Fanny Price” registers “a sense of the dangers”—and <em>demands</em>, we might add, thinking of the way Fanny is swapped between homes—“of movement” (Bersami
                     75). Bersani and Ermarth together suggest that Austen’s fiction may not always fit
                     the logic of perspective governing realism; it may not always move in the ways narrative
                     realism would come to demand. Indeed, recent critical work by Anne-Lise François (on <em>Mansfield Park</em>), Sonia Hofkosh (on <em>Northanger Abbey</em>), and Williams Galperin (on all the novels) have given us ways of reading Austen
                     against the currents of realism, and within a capacious understanding of romance.
                     We might simply recall the fragile bubble of romance in <em>Persuasion</em>, where the lovers step away from vision, sightlines and chronological time: they
                     “slowly pace,” “heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians,
                     bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, . . . and of
                     yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end” (240–41).

                     this: her fiction cannot be seen fully within the framework of the realist novel;

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>When Williams does envision a concrete image of Austen the novelist—“behind these
                     [looks, etc.], all the time . . . watching, observing, <em>physically</em> recording and reflecting”—the image startles: not just because its apparently 3D depiction
                     of Austen relies on a hard-to-locate “behind” (is she behind the faces? behind the
                     words we read?); and not just because “<em>physically</em> recording and reflecting” raises further questions about the materiality of the scene
                     (does <em>physically</em> recording describe an act of eye, hand, or ear? Does <em>physically</em> also modify reflecting?) (<em>Country</em> 166). The language startles because the watcher-recorder surfaces only to vanish again.
                     Just watch: “Her eye for a house, for timber, for the details of improvement,” Williams
                     notes, “is quick, accurate, monetary” (115). We see a quick eye, her eye. Then: <span class="quote">‘Yet money or other kinds, from the trading houses, from the colonial plantations,
                        has no visual equivalent; it <em>has to be converted</em> into these signs of order <em>to be recognised</em> at all. This way of seeing is especially representative. <em>The land is seen</em> primarily as an index of revenue and position; its visible order and control are a
                        valued product, while the process of working <em>it is hardly seen</em> at all. (<em>English Novel</em> 22; <em>Country</em> 115; emphasis added)’</span> What happens to her eye, to her, in “this way of seeing”? Elsewhere in this collection
                     of essays, Brian McGrath diagnoses this recurrent feature of Williams’s prose, the
                     recourse to the passive voice. Used sometimes ironically, the passive voice can demonstrate,
                     McGrath writes, “how difficult it can be to determine and stabilize the difference
                     between subjects and objects (the agents who act and the things that are acted upon)”
                     (McGrath). Like perspective, then, the passive voice operates as another mechanism
                     for holding together the individual instance with the larger social whole. In Williams’s
                     writing about Austen, though, its use matches a pervasive disappearing of this woman
                     and her novels. Some unstated generality or abstracting force (“the land is seen,”
                     “the process . . . is hardly seen”) absorbs the novelist, leaving “no visual equivalent”
                     of her “process of working” (the irony hits hard) (<em>Country</em> 115). The abstracting happens again when Williams decrees, “Where only one class is
                     seen, no classes are seen” (117). And again, when “through the holes of this tightly-drawn
                     mesh most actual people are not to be seen,” the mesh-maker in turn drops from view,
                     written over by abstraction and stark impersonality (call it the park wall) (118).
                     D. A. Miller will later twist the characterization, attributing to the novelist this
                     refusal of embodied personhood, as if it were a mode of protection, effacing <em>perforce</em> her “peculiar” social status as spinster-woman-author, before “disappearing” into
                     a flawless style (Miller 8–9).

                     who have disappeared. . . . [it] is also most of the country, which becomes real [in
                     these novels] only as it relates to the houses which are the real nodes; for the rest

                     or a place for a walk”—is nearly Austenian. It signals, if not contempt, then at least
                     Williams’s alienation from this specific “knowable community” and its mode of seeing.
                     But Williams overlooks Austen’s own ironies, and overlooks too her own manner of alienation
                     from the network of manor houses (and her sometimes forced movement among them), all
                     of which might position her differently on the landscape, with a less stable angle
                     of vision. Both <em>The English Novel</em> and <em>The City and the Country</em> ignore the slippages and fissures of Austen’s irony, emphasizing instead the “achievement
                     of a unity of tone,” “her remarkable unity of tone,” “a unity of language in all its
                     main uses,” “a remarkable unity of tone” and what the editors of <em>Politics and Letters</em> echo in citing her “extraordinary unity of tone” (<em>Country</em> 115, 116, 169; <em>Politics and Letters</em> 228). With George Eilot, Williams can hear fracture and inconsistency, a “break in
                     the texture” and coherent “idiom” inherited from Austen. Such dissonance gives evidence
                     of the “acute difficulty” Eliot takes on when trying to comprehend a broader social
                     world than her predecessor (<em>Country</em> 168–69).

                     Impervious unity of tone provides the aural equivalent of her “remarkably settled
                     and confident way of seeing,” elsewhere concretized in the impregnable walls that
                     fix and delimit Jane Austen. All three—enclosing walls, settled way of seeing, unified
                     tone—betoken the exclusive <em>status</em> (quite literal) of Austen’s social world. Features of the landscape as much as features
                     of style, they function as objective correlatives of the otherwise “unseen formula”
                     or rigid “grammar” of Austen’s writing, where “improvement is or ought to be improvement”
                     (<em>Country</em> 116). As William Galperin points out in <em>Historical Austen</em>, Williams’s approach “assumes that Austen’s representational technique could only
                     work in one register and to a single purpose” (Galperin 2). One might add: and from
                     one fixed location and in one tone.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The urge to position Austen in terms of something settled, composed, and unified aligns
                  with Williams’s need for a “point of origin” or, more precisely, a point of departure
                  for critique (“to be <em>taken outside the park walls</em>”). The effort to keep Austen a settled matter nonetheless produces its own strain
                  and discomposure in Williams’s writing, which characteristically gravitates toward
                  a mobile and shifting perspective (the escalator), or toward friction, and unsettledness.
                  I have remarked on the awkward picture of the novelist “behind . . . <em>physically</em> recording”; there is also the “is <em>or ought to be</em>” which snags the neat formula of Austen’s settled view of improvement. Additionally
                  there are repeated (apologetic?) notes of exceptionalism (“outstanding,” “remarkable,”
                  “extraordinary”) that jar an account that otherwise assimilates Austen’s work into
                  a representative, hegemonic, and uniform way of seeing.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The effort to maintain Austen as a fixed entity—the requisite vanishing point—does
                     begin to wobble later, in <em>Politics and Letters</em>. There Williams suggests that Austen’s achieved unity was hardly achieved: “In my
                     view Jane Austen makes a very <em>strenuous</em> attempt to unify what was not unifiable” (228; emphasis added). Or achieved only through
                     magic: he calls up a favorite image of the novelist accomplishing the “reconciliation
                     of property and value like a supernatural lawyer.” The supernatural lawyer appears
                     in both <em>The English Novel</em> and <em>The Country and the City</em>: this third time it feels almost insistent (<em>English Novel</em> 23; <em>Country</em> 116; <em>Politics and Letters</em> 228). Williams’s simile introduces a note of historical impossibility, of fantasy
                     operating in a world he otherwise subjects fully to the protocols of realism. In claiming
                     that her “settlements are an artificial solution” that will provide the “basis for
                     critique” in the work of subsequent novelists, Williams seems not quite to recognize
                     that the manifest artificiality, extraordinariness, and, for lack of a better word, <em>romance</em> of these settlements already form a kind of critique (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 228).

                     and literature <em>per se</em>, Williams turns an unforeseen corner. What had been assumed “understandably” in <em>The Country and the City</em> now needs to be investigated: “In Austen’s case, I would now say that two special
                     conditions of her ideological stance were decisive: She was doubly marginalized in
                     relation to her class, as a dependent within it, and as a woman” (<em>Politics and Letters</em> 230). The ground shifts, sending Austen to a more precarious position on the margins
                     of the propertied class. To which Williams’s interlocutors respond, “Turning to Dickens . . .”

                     </div> It seems plausible, indeed faithful to Williams’s insights, to engage Austen anew
                     through the more mobile, multistranded and contentious mode that Williams developed
                     for his histories of film and television, media forms which have amply welcomed Jane
                     Austen—her fiction and her fictionalized life. Features that had hardened into familiarity,
                     the park walls drawn around that “subject,” are set in motion when television, film,
                     and a range of digital media testify that the “areas of common life” denominated by
                     “Jane Austen” extend now—and have in fact extended for a century—well beyond an English
                     countryside, and indeed beyond an English or even literary tradition, and well beyond
                     the enclosure of a unified style.

                              of various “Jane Austens” travelling since the mid-1800s throughout Anglo-American
                              popular culture and well into subcultures.</span></div>
                     </div> Two concerns emerge with this change of approach. First, the terms Williams develops
                     to speak of new media—television especially—help us perceive how deeply Austen’s fiction
                     is informed and vexed by questions of motion, temporality, and tempo (rather than
                     the questions of vision and space raised by Williams’s earlier work). Of course motion
                     has a place in all Austen’s fiction (think only of Catherine Morland’s carriage ride
                     with John Thorpe, or Elizabeth Bennett’s muddy walk); but motion (along with stasis)
                     is subject to severe scrutiny in her later work: <em>Emma</em>, <em>Mansfield Park</em>, <em>Persuasion</em>, and <em>Sanditon</em>. Second, Williams’s analysis also suggests that in grasping this aspect of Austen’s
                     work, new media risk exploiting and sanitizing it, smoothing its vexations into harmonious
                     and continual “flow.” In short, Williams’s writing on media reveals the limitations
                     of both his early work on Austen’s novels and the later adaptation of those novels
                     by new media. If Austen led him to translate reading to a mode of seeing, new media
                     lead him to worry about reading converted to a mode of watching.</p>
               </div>
               <p>With the move to the study of media comes a heightened attention in Williams’s method
                  to multiple lines of development (no single tradition or <em>telos</em>) as well as a reconsideration of the appeal of mobility. He finds for instance that
                  <em>independent of narrative content</em>, the medium of film provides “experiences of mobility, dislocation and alienation,
                  but also intense curiosity <em>about</em> movement and newly possible dynamic forms” (142; emphasis added). The emphasis extends
                  to his reflections on television, which offers not just a curiosity about mobility
                  but—and again, independent of specific content—a newly mobile way of viewing: the
                  “primary processes of the technology [of television],” he explains, promote a new
                  “kind of attention,” “an experience of visual mobility, of contrast of angle, of variation
                  of focus, which is often very beautiful” (<em>Television</em> 74–75). In both film and television the movement associated with the technology and
                  an individual’s experience of that movement form part of a “whole social experience . . .
                  of greater physical and social mobility” (87–88). Television makes Williams’s figure
                  of the escalator (strained to begin with) unusable: motion expands almost infinitely
                  even as it becomes more recursive and constraining. Wary of the greater mobility of
                  new media, Williams’s analyses discard the spatialized, perspectival vision that informs
                  <em>The Country and the City</em>, working instead with temporal markers of rhythm and tempo, as well as sonic qualities
                  of dissonance and silence.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>What preoccupies Williams about television especially (and his “television” powerfully
                     anticipates subsequent new media) is the “concept of flow,” a reformulation of sequence
                     and interval without interruption, where rhythmic and seemingly “natural breaks” foster
                     “the impulse to go on watching”—not unlike, perhaps, the experience of reading serialized
                     novels in print. Yet “watching” directs itself at no particular content, but simply
                     an undifferentiated, horizonless, and ever-streaming “television,” quite distinct
                     from the topographical model of seeing/reading promoted in <em>The Country and the City</em>.

                              McGuigan quotes the prescient last lines of the book: ‘Over a wide range from general

                     the “concept of flow” rearranges human experience. Perspective dissolves in the experience
                     of the screen and visual activity finds itself subordinate to a certain tempo and
                     movement captured by the liquid “flow” of ceaseless programming. Williams searches
                     for both revolutionary and counterrevolutionary impulses in the phenomenon, but <em>Television</em> ends on this dystopian note: <span class="quote">‘Under cover of talk about choice and competition, a few para-national corporations,
                        with their attendant states and agencies, could further reach into our lives, at every
                        level from news to psycho-drama, until individual and collective response to many
                        different kinds of experience and problem became almost limited to choice between
                        their programmed possibilities. (151)’</span> In contrast to older and, as Williams sees it, more “static” notions of programming
                     (in conventional modes of entertainment and education), “the flow [of new media] is
                     always accessible, in many simultaneous and alternative sequences, at the flick of
                     a switch”—or, we might now say, at the touch of a button or utterance of a command.
                     “Both internally, in its immediate organization, and as a generally available experience,”
                     “flow” indicates a mobile, primarily <em>temporal</em> mode of experience, inflected but not broken or divided by individual activity (95).
                     As one scholar put it, Williams finds in the “flow” of television the theater of capitalism—and
                     an apt image for capitalism’s principle of utter fungibility and exchangeability.

                     what might Austen know of flow? A concept of flow might be one way of reconsidering
                     the recursive everydayness of a novel like <em>Emma</em> and its investigation of how choice—even for the privileged heroine—resides only in
                     “programmed possibilities.” More specifically, such an approach would suggest how
                     and to what extent <em>Emma</em>’s creation of a fictional everyday—praised by Walter Scott for its seamless fusion
                     with the reader’s “own social habits” such that “the youthful wanderer may return
                     from his promenade to the ordinary business of life, without any chance of having
                     his head turned by the recollection of the scene through which he has been wandering”—might
                     coincide with the ordinary business and ongoing flow of new media (68). (In addition
                     to several film versions, “Clueless” [1995] adapted from <em>Emma</em> and translated to Beverly Hills, spawned a TV series,

                      all of which are continuously flowing through online media services. “Stream Anytime,”
                     Amazon advises.) In the space that remains, though, I follow “flow” and the attendant
                     qualities of tempo and silence in another direction, using the case of Austen’s last
                     novel, <em>Persuasion</em>, and its televised 1996 remediation directed by Roger Michell (later turned into
                     a film, also available for streaming).

                     by the televised version and, as Williams guides us to see, channeled via transnational

                     least stabilized by the economies of the park wall and the landed gentry. <em>Persuasion</em> is Austen’s most aqueous book, set in motion by the return of naval officers. Sir
                     Walter Elliott must move to leased housing in Bath and rent his family estate; his
                     renter is Admiral Croft, flush with prize money and newly returned from the Navy in
                     1814, the year of the so-called false peace (in this novel Austen <em>does</em> work carefully to bring together the upending events of the Napoleonic Wars with the
                     unsettling social reality of the home front). Social instability is newly, baldly
                     evident in <em>Persuasion</em> in the figures of the scheming widow Mrs. Clay, the gossiping invalid Mrs. Smith,
                     and the wounded officer, Captain Harville (the mobility of the latter two seriously,
                     physically impeded). A disturbing sense of flux lurks in unelaborated memories of
                     the sailors’ years at sea and in the visit the protagonists make to Lyme Regis, where
                     they walk upsetting promenades at the water’s edge. A pervasive unease makes itself
                     heard, moreover, in the unprecedented bitterness of the narrator’s ironies and “lapses”
                     of tone: a report, for instance, on “the large, fat sighings” of a mother recalling
                     the death of her son, “whom alive nobody had cared for” (68).

               <p> Whatever loss the lines might register is pacified by repetition (the flowing sequence
                  of exchangeable similes, the feminine rhyme, the easy concord of the reciters) as
                  well as the excerptability of the lines, their ready portability from one story to
                  another and another. More formally, the TV series opens and closes with scenes shot
                  on water. An extraordinary underwater shot, all blue flow—beautiful in the way Williams
                  identifies the contentless visual mobility of television—is the first thing to appear
                  on screen, the camera then surfacing to the steady, diagetic pulse of oars (with extradiegetic
                  harpsichord) as rowers ferry Admiral Croft to his ship. The abstraction of the initial
                  image and the cadence of the oars together defuse any turbulence an underwater view
                  might portend to the men of the Royal Navy. The film ends, again at sea, with another
                  wordless scene Austen did not imagine: now married to Captain Wentworth, Anne Elliott
                  stands with him on the deck of a ship he commands as sailors go about their daily
                  chores (swabbing the deck, etc.). The camera pulls back to display the man-of-war
                  floating serenely westward, then silhouetted against a glorious sunset. Like the first
                  underwater shot, the final image surrenders depth to undulation across a two-dimensional
                  surface. A swelling orchestral arrangement gives way to the piano, which closes the
                  film in simple descending chords. The two final shots of the film, the naval vessel
                  moving west and then poised on the horizon, were taken from footage of the film <em>The Bounty</em>, a 1984 remake of <em>The Mutiny on the Bounty</em> and the latest of five film versions (Parrill 156). A ready portability from one
                  story to another and another.</p>
               <p>From one image of the British Navy, a mutiny in the South Pacific in 1789, to this
                  peaceably unmappable picture of married contentment (perhaps post-Waterloo: the novel
                  and miniseries are pointedly set in 1814, but we have no idea when Wentworth is sent
                  back to sea with Anne nor if, as in 1815, Britain is again at war), the movement of
                  this footage from film to television is itself made possible by flow—in this case,
                  the flow of capital funding for <em>Persuasion</em>. What began as a BBC project became a global enterprise via partnership with station
                  WGBH in Boston, sponsored in turn by the Mobile Oil Corporation, backer of WGBH’s
                  popular Masterpiece Theater program, and joined ultimately with Millésime Productions,
                  a French company. (The TV miniseries–turned–feature film was distributed by Sony Classics
                  beginning in 1997). With this boost of funding, the project moved from a chamber piece
                  set primarily indoors to a much more ambitious historical romance, with the ability
                  to film outdoors on location (in Bath and Lyme) and to purchase footage from the American-British-New
                  Zealand product <em>The Bounty</em> (starring the Australian Mel Gibson and Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins). Expanding what
                  might be considered the world of the novel, taking it well beyond the park walls,
                  the scenes at sea also participate materially and thematically in the concept of flow
                  as Williams defines it.</p>
               <p>Such transnational enterprises have marked Austen’s entry into film and television
                  for decades, and effectively made of Jane Austen a brand that circulates the globe.
                  This is not news. But the concept of flow and its soothing rhythms, which so thoroughly
                  inhabit the 1995 television adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em>, set in relief the less steady motions, the discordant tempos of the novel. If, in
                  closing, we return to the novel not looking at its topography, nor pacified by memory
                  of the flowing films, but with an ear for its own distinctive tempos, we can hear
                  its enduring, unsettled dissonances more sharply.</p>
               <p>On the largest scale we might point to the difference between Anne’s domesticating
                  rhythms and those of the military enterprise that employs Wentworth and his fellow
                  sailors. But such differences can be registered on smaller scales as well. The bouts
                  of dizziness, for instance, that punctuate <em>Persuasion</em>—like the several falls, evidence of unsteady and erratic movement as well as historical
                  instability—are mostly filtered through a free indirect discourse tied to Anne. Her
                  consciousness is “bombarded,” as A. Walton Litz puts it, leaving her to endure private,
                  interior waves of turbulence (228). That internal rhythm is juxtaposed to an exterior
                  tempo embodied by Wentworth. As John Wilshire has remarked, Captain Wentworth serves
                  as an agent of speed and suddenness: he is described often in motion, moving “in an
                  instant” with a “quicker step,” often threatening Anne’s equilibrium (Wiltshire 171).
                  The two rhythms, of inner turbulence and outer impetuousness, are so starkly opposed
                  that they seem impossible to harmonize—until they do, magically, when Anne and Wentworth
                  finally manage to be alone together. But the deep discord of those competing rhythms
                  rumbles in the last lines of the novel, where the narrator relays that <span class="quote">‘[h]is profession was all that could ever make her friends wish [Anne’s] tenderness
                     less; the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine. She gloried in being
                     a sailor’s wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession
                     which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national
                     importance. (<em>Persuasion</em> 252)’</span> It’s a foreboding resolution, to say the least, the repeated “all” of the opening
                  sentence hardly sounding settled or promising stability. And who thinks “if possible”:
                  Anne? The narrator? Social consensus? There is no firm ground; point of view—that
                  is, <em>perspective</em>—feels impossible to secure. Reading instead for tempo (“all that could make . . .
                  all that could dim”), what strikes me now is the odd phrase, “must pay the tax of
                  quick alarm.” The phrasing is rhythmic and precise, a small shadow neatly tucked under
                  the sunny smile of “she gloried.” In contrast to the preceding sentences, its monosyllables
                  offer something simple, matter-of-fact, and almost proverbial. Yet “quick alarm” worries
                  in part because of its seeming redundancy: the novel has been full of quick alarms,
                  but this phrase raises the possibility of slow alarms we have not registered.</p>
               <p>In these irreconcilable tempos, the novel here and elsewhere works with and against
                  the concept of flow. “Paying the tax of quick alarm” yokes Anne’s emotional state
                  to the coffers of the state, which had routinely, and more aggressively in the decades
                  since Napoleon’s rise, proliferated modes of taxation so as to fund the wars with
                  France (William Pitt introduced, among other funding schemes, the first individual
                  income tax) (Brewer 110–11). But it is not clear what relation between our heroine’s
                  emotional life and the state economy is suggested by the phrase. Had the author of
                  <em>Keywords</em> included “tax” in his vocabulary of society and culture, he would have noted the
                  slow turn away from the etymological link between “tax” and an obligatory “task” or
                  job, and toward its current association with money exacted by government authorities.
                  He might have noted as well the way taxes can coordinate individual activity (e.g.,
                  labor) with the demands of a larger sociopolitical entity through the medium of money.
                  Austen’s language insists on tax as payment. But in what sense must Anne <em>pay</em> taxes? And is paying the tax a consequence of her “profession,” understood less as
                  work (task) than as a mode of being (<em>glorying</em> and exhibiting “domestic virtues”)? Or is paying tax a <em>duty</em> (another word for tax) evenly distributed across the populace? I wonder whether the
                  tax she must pay is a one-time offering or part of a general pattern, a periodic or
                  indeed continuous demand. “Tax” hints that some species of slow alarm subtends the
                  quick alarms so crisply forecast.</p>
               <p>In any case, the notion of payment proposes to regulate feeling: paying a tax helps
                  to pace Anne’s undifferentiated dread into smaller installments of quick alarm. Paying
                  the tax furthermore recycles alarm—quietly, with no need for Anne to say a word—into
                  the hands of the state, where it can flow out to support future military endeavors.
                  All that could make, all that could dim, all channeled into paying the tax. And yet
                  the resolution proposed here for coordinating Anne’s interior state with the workings
                  of a militarized state can hardly be read as smoothly reassuring. Rather, it exposes
                  and questions the mechanisms by which such resolutions are engineered.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Written by the sister of naval officers, <em>Persuasion</em> understands paying attention as paying a tax, funneling one’s private, emotional turbulence
                     into the ongoing operations of the British Navy and the empire it will maintain. In <em>Persuasion</em>, a militarized state anticipates the “para-national corporations, with their attendant
                     states and agencies,” that “could further reach into our lives, at every level from
                     news to psycho-drama” (Williams, <em>Television</em> 151). When Williams meditates on “the concept of flow,” and studies how new media
                     like television ask us simply and continually “to watch,” he is updating a Romantic
                     phenomenon that Lily Gurton-Wachter, in her <em>Watchwords</em>, has illuminated so well—and that Austen fully grasps.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note28" id="Note28_return"><sup class="super">
                              (28)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This paragraph owes a debt to Gurton-Wachter’s important analysis of the culture of
                              alarm and attentiveness in Romantic-era Britain.</span></div>
                     </div> The friction she generates in <em>Persuasion</em> offers proleptic resistance to that flow Williams locates in the theater of capitalism.
                     Watching, she might say, can be taxing.</p>
               </div>
               <p>It should not surprise us that television cannot admit such taxation. The 1995 television
                  adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em> eliminates the dread, the tax, and the quick alarm. It does not wrestle to coordinate
                  Anne’s domesticating rhythms with those of the man of war; she enters his world fully
                  and wordlessly. The two stand together on the deck of a battleship, smile at each
                  other, and look out placidly, watching, watching the empty ocean. A ship floats in
                  silhouette on the flowing water. Everything is externalized, and everyone at sea.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Austen also appears in the discussion of “Sensibility” (<em>Keywords</em> 285). Alistair Duckworth’s <em>Jane Austen and the Improvement of the Estate</em>, also published in 1970, provides a finer-grained account of Austen’s approach to
               “improvement” than Williams allows himself. Williams appears not to have read Duckworth

               of narrative realism; D. A. Miller’s <em>Jane Austen, or the Secret of Style</em> reads the smooth and settled surface of Austen’s style as the index of possibilities
               foreclosed by her social and historical position. In reimagining the familiar “settlements”
               of Austen’s fiction, both critics find “within a dimension of relatively fixed forms . . .
               an unease, a stress, a displacement, a latency,” to invoke Williams’s own language
               (<em>Marxism and Literature</em> 130). On the <em>vertiges</em> of <em>Persuasion</em>, see Pinch (156–63) and Favret (163–71).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">A distinctly twentieth-century engine of mobility, the escalator concretizes Williams’s
               notion of “historical perspective” (<em>Country</em> 9–12). The reader rides the escalator from one historical example to another, thus
               gaining a view of the “general pattern” of an idea. Yet “what seems like a single
               escalator, a perpetual recession into history,” Williams adds, “turns out to be a
               more complicated movement. . . . [A]t different times . . . quite different values
               are being brought to question. We shall need precise analysis of each kind of retrospect,
               as it comes [into view]” (<em>Country</em> 12). The reader’s (or critic’s) job is to organize those various “retrospects” into
               a unified field: “real history.” As we will see below, the process Williams describes
               here mimics closely the functioning of perspective developed in renaissance painting
               and later in realist fiction.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

                  poems of different kinds. We can only analyze these important structures of feeling
                  if we make from the beginning, these critical discriminations [between kinds].

               Baskin uses Williams’s work to put to one side debates about surface and depth reading.
               He highlights a phenomenological element in Williams’s writing that understands depth
               as the condition of—and therefore inextricable from—surface (and vice versa). An understanding
               of perspective also makes this point. In the passage quoted here and elsewhere in

               in its treatment of Sir Thomas Bertram. Most crucially, he ignores the ways gender

               she creates the tradition we see leading down to her (4–5). Despite her centrality

               Galperin’s study, and warrants his revision of what it means for Austen to be “historical.”
               In 
               “The Illusionist: <em>Northanger Abbey</em> and Austen’s Uses of Enchantment,”
               Sonia Hofkosh similarly renovates a strain of criticism that pulls Austen’s fiction
               away from conventional realism. Williams does indicate that if he had begun his history
               of the English novel in the 1790s, “I think this would have yielded a different perspective
               on Jane Austen” (225). His comments suggest that the fiction of the 1790s (e.g., Godwin’s)
               had to be suppressed after the turn of the century and did not resurface until the
               1830s. Presumably Austen would for Williams mark suppression or reaction, not continuation
               of earlier Gothic and romance impulses.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

                  information and data-processing systems, the technology that is now or is becoming

                  We could have inexpensive, locally based yet internationally extended television systems,
                  making possible communication and information-sharing on a scale that not long ago
