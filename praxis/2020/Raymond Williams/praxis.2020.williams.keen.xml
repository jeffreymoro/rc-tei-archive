            <p>I want to use this paper to explore what has always been a
                    central paradox for me about Raymond Williams’s work, and to consider how
                    knowing more about the sources and implications of the historical tensions at
                    the heart of this paradox can help to illuminate the intersection between our
                    work as Romantic critics and broader debates about the humanities today. On the
                    one hand, Williams’s writing has been one of the most fundamental influences on
                    my own interest in the changing cultural landscape of the Romantic period, and
                    particularly, in the highly mediated and politically charged struggles over the
                    definition of literature that shaped this period in such memorable and
                    influential ways. On the other hand, I have never found his analyses of
                    particular Romantic authors helpful in ways that resonated with my work despite
                    these larger theoretical convergences. I can think of several reasons for this.
                    Williams’s often-noted preference for fiction and drama directed his attention
                    more to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (the worlds of Dickens and
                    Hardy, Ibsen and Brecht), and his inclination to formalist approaches diminished
                    his interest in writing about the intersections between debates about literature
                    and the nitty-gritty world of political struggles that writers such as E. P.
                    Thompson focused on. It may also have had a lot to do with generational
                    differences, though ironically, this is primarily because so much of Williams’s
                    pioneering work has passed into mainstream thought as today’s received wisdom.
                    His analyses, which were usually limited to a few of the canonical poets (mainly
                    Wordsworth and Blake), are often rooted in largely unqualified references to a
                    "Romantic" mindset with the attendant set of implicit assumptions that so much
                    of the best work of the past few decades has been pushing back against. It isn’t
                    that these sorts of analyses are wrong, but as Williams had himself repeatedly
                    argued about the dangers of abstractions generally, they are reductive in ways
                    that distort the historical complexities of the era.</p>
            <p>So how to square these two sides of Williams’s work? Ironically, Williams’s own evolving 
                understanding of the legacy of the cultural dynamics of this period may provide the best 
                answer. As he argued most explicitly in later works such as <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, the Romantic period’s greatest impact may be the
                    enduring influence of the shift towards an ideology of the aesthetic marked by a
                    "false attachment" to literature and art as an autonomous realm, with the
                    related set of assumptions about genius, the imagination, and creativity, that
                    supported this new way of thinking about aesthetic value (43). The impact of
                    this paradigm shift as a form of "abstraction" that alienated literature and art
                    from the stubborn complexities of lived experience (as controversial as his
                    insistence on that phrase has been) would mark his own thinking in fundamental
                    ways, but as he famously pointed out, this period also witnessed the emergence
                    that broader realm hailed as "culture" whose intellectual possibilities would
                    ultimately reinforce his self-reflexive commitment to charting the history of
                    these dynamics (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 47).</p>
            <p>Williams’s awareness of both the theoretical limitations
                    and the political cost of aesthetic forms of abstraction (as well as his
                    sympathetic understanding of the historical pressures that produced them) <emph>and</emph> 
                of the enabling critical potential of modern ideas of culture as a realm of theoretical 
                engagement helps to explain the paradox that I noted at the outset: in many ways, 
                Williams’s work was driven by his awareness of the vital importance of <emph>unlearning</emph> 
                the inherited assumptions that had helped to shape his own canonical understanding of 
                literary history. It was, as he put it in the extensive interviews published as <title 
                    level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, "a clearing operation" aimed at jettisoning 
                inherited but indefensible assumptions in the hope that "once the ground has been 
                cleared of the received idea of literature, it will be possible to find certain new 
                concepts that would allow for special emphases" (335, 325). Both of these impulses (the 
                commitment to unlearning outmoded assumptions and the need to do so) can, as his own work 
                has demonstrated, be traced back to these contrapuntal developments which emerged in the 
                late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>
            <p>The impact of this intervention was reinforced by the unflinchingly dialectical nature of 
                Williams’s work: it was animated by his abiding interest in knowing more about how these 
                historical dynamics could help him to respond to the political and cultural pressures of 
                his own day, and just as valuably, how a more clearly self-reflexive awareness of his own 
                critical position had shaped his understanding of this history in the first place. If, 
                as he insisted in the conclusion to <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "the 
                history of the idea of culture is a record of our
                    reactions, in thought and feeling, to the changed conditions of our modern
                    life," it was equally true that "these, in turn, are only understood within the
                    context of our actions" (295).</p>
            <p>This process of unlearning or "clearing" was at the heart of the genealogical impulse 
                that defined early projects such as <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>, which foregrounded a history of thinking about the phenomenon of 
                culture that had long remained virtually invisible precisely because it <emph>was</emph> 
                so fundamental, but it also reflects the evolution of his approach as he moved from what 
                Williams himself described as the "first-stage radicalism" of his earlier work towards 
                the more rigorously skeptical perspective that would define his interest in the idea of 
                literature as an historically arbitrary category in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 110). The blind 
                spots that are clearest in the uncritically canonical spirit of Williams’s response to 
                Romantic literature (as feminist critics have long pointed out, one would never guess 
                that there were any women writers in the period, apart from Jane Austen) are themselves 
                the best evidence of the extraordinary importance of this endeavor to come to terms with 
                the shaping influence of the long history of these disciplinary formations and the 
                aesthetic values that supported them.</p>
            <p>The real value of understanding these developments in Williams’s work—both the deformations 
                that his work was aimed at "clearing" and the traces of his inscription within these 
                influences—may be the ways that they can in turn help us to think about the challenges 
                that we face in our own struggle to articulate the public value of the humanities today 
                and, like Williams, to bring this public role to bear on the broader political struggles 
                of our day. Williams’s 1984 <title level="j">London Review of Books</title> essay on 
                Georg Lukacs, published just four years before his death, was on one level an eloquent 
                if implicit reflection on many of these aspects of Williams’s own career. Having praised 
                Lukacs as "one of the more interesting and tolerable Marxist critics of literature," 
                Williams attributed his relative obscurity amongst British readers to three principal 
                causes: "the breadth of his learning and his relative freedom from dogmatism"; his 
                alignment with "an old and fruitless kind of Marxism" that was reminiscent of Marxist 
                theory’s "Stalinist phase"; and perhaps worst of all, his alignment with "the ‘humanist 
                fallacy’ in Western Marxism, in his reliance on notions of ‘man as subject’ and more 
                directly in his kind of socialism, which is more properly a ‘romantic anti-capitalism’" 
                (<title level="a">A Man</title> 14). As a leading proponent of the New Left, Williams was 
                never in much danger of being branded a Stalinist, but arguably, the other two factors 
                might well help to explain Williams’s own shifting stature within theoretical debates. 
                During the heyday of the theory wars when the most damning charge in graduate school was 
                to be guilty of residual humanism, exposed as being still in thrall to all of those 
                ideological forces that one <emph>thought</emph> one was resisting but apparently was not, 
                Williams’s cultural materialism was overshadowed by the theoretical interventions of 
                French poststructuralists whose work offered an uncompromising critique of humanist 
                thought.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Terry Eagleton’s strident and often strangely 
                    personal critique of his former teacher in <title level="m">Criticism and 
                        Ideology</title>, which zeroed in on what Eagleton rejected
                                as Williams’s gradualist approach, may have been the most prominent
                                of critical arguments that Williams’s work had failed to absorb the
                                important lessons of Marxists such as Louis Althusser, whose work
                                owed its prominence to its deft mixture of Lancanian insight about a
                                radically decentered subjectivity and its scientific claims for
                                Marxism.</note></p>
            <p>Arguably, this may have had as much to do with image as content. Being Welsh lacked 
                the allure of <emph>avant-garde</emph> radicalism at a time when being Parisian was an 
                unspoken but crucial ingredient in the cultural capital that was a major part of the 
                attractions of theory on many North American campuses. Being the son of a railway worker 
                from a village called Pandy, a few miles from the market town of Abergavenny, was no 
                match for the <emph>frisson</emph> of Left Bank intellectualism. But as literary critics 
                have become increasingly wary of what Rita Felski has called "the hermeneutics of 
                suspicion" and dubious of the political upside of the zero-sum version of power 
                implicit in Louis Althusser’s and Michel Foucault’s arguments, which seemed to have 
                thrown any possibility of agency out with the humanist bathwater, Williams’s work 
                has garnered renewed interest.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrase recurs 
                    throughout Rita Felski’s <title level="m">The Limits of Critique</title>. It has 
                    gained momentum more broadly in recent years as a shorthand for concerns about the 
                    excessively accusatory tone of many critics who, as Felski argues, often exempt 
                    themselves from the suspicions of any possibility of agency that ground their 
                    analyses.</note></p>

                    Williams offers a crucial underacknowledged voice within theoretical debates.
                    Like Williams’s own discussion of Lukacs, Brennan suggests that this may be
                    partly because the extraordinary breadth of Williams’s intellectual scope makes
                    a proper level of engagement with his work especially challenging. As Brennan
                    argues, the "deceptively straightforward" style of Williams’s writing "at the
                    level of the sentence" is belied by the unique level of the challenges posed,
                    both by "the volumes of prior reading required to appreciate his range of
                    reference," and perhaps even more dauntingly, by the "<emph>symphonic</emph>"
                    nature of Williams’s work, which channels various currents of thought into a
                    particular argument in ways that make it "extraordinarily difficult to analyze
                    the intricate architecture of its individual components" (<title

                            Brennan’s discussion of the impact of Williams’s <title level="m">The 
                                Country and the City</title>, a study whose particular
                                approach exemplifies this "symphonic" style: "His work proliferates,
                                spiraling outwards, spun out at a level of complexity, and delivered
                                in a relaxed and knowing comprehensiveness, over the wide ambit of
                                associations, imageries, feelings, attitudes and cultural tics,
                                until one comes to see the unresolved and constantly morphing
                                conflict between country and city as the primary contradiction of
                                all social life" (<title level="a">On the Image,</title> 38–39).</note> As 
                Brennan points out, precisely because of this paradoxical blend of insights and challenges, 
                the influence of Williams’s work is most often felt in indirect or derivative forms. In 
                the opening page of <title level="m">Wars of Position</title>, Brennan excoriates 
                an academic (whom he politely leaves
                    unnamed) who, having been asked about her use of the phrase "structures of
                    feeling," explained that she got it from a book on Hollywood cinema without any
                    apparent recognition of the fact that it had been introduced and popularized by
                    Williams (1). For Brennan, this personal oversight matters because "higher
                    stakes" are involved than a simple failure of attribution (1).</p>
            <p>The nature of these "higher stakes" becomes clearer in
                    Brennan’s discussion of Edward Said’s larger attack on the "abdication of
                    responsibility" that characterized poststructuralist theoretical debates (<title 
                        level="m">Wars</title> 99). Said’s brand of discourse analysis in <title 
                            level="m">Orientalism</title> has often invited assumptions about his debt 
                to Foucault, but as Brennan points out, Said’s sustained critique of the appeal of 
                Foucault’s "flawed attitude to power," which "captivated not only Foucault himself but 
                many of his readers" as a way of "justify[ing] political quietism with sophisticated 
                intellectualism," stands out especially strongly when set against "the excitement Said 
                has" when he discusses Williams’s work (qtd. in Brennan, <title level="m">Wars</title> 
                112, 111). This double sense of intellectual debt (theoretical and political) converged 
                in Said’s own call to "reconsider, reexamine, and reformulate the relevance of humanism" 
                as "a useable praxis for intellectuals and academics who want to know what they are 
                doing, what they are committed to as scholars, and who want also to connect these 
                principles to the world in which they live as citizens," particularly in a "turbulent 
                world . . . brimming over with belligerency, actual wars, and all kinds of 
                terrorism" (Said 6, 2).</p>
            <p>Said’s increasingly explicit call for a renewed form of
                    radical humanism underscores the larger importance of Williams’s earlier
                    commitment to mapping out a history of the idea of culture as it emerged "in the
                    last decades of the eighteenth century, and in the first half of the nineteenth
                    century" as part of a broader shift in the meaning of a constellation of words
                    such as "<emph>industry</emph>, <emph>democracy</emph>, <emph>class</emph>, 
                and <emph>art</emph>" that was driven by more fundamental changes "in our 
                characteristic ways of thinking about our common life: about our social, political 
                and economic institutions; about the purposes which these institutions are designed 
                to embody; and about the relations to these institutions and purposes of our 
                activities in learning, education, and the arts" (Williams, <title 
                    level="m">Culture</title> xiii). Williams felt compelled to chart the impact of
                    these earlier shifts in large part because of the parallels he saw between the
                    struggles of early nineteenth-century thinkers for whom the idea of culture
                    offered a powerful basis for resistance and "the post-1945 crisis of belief and
                    affiliation" that Williams himself was confronted by as <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> was taking shape. Understanding the challenges inherent in this 
                earlier epoch that we now think of as the Romantic period was, for Williams, an 
                important "way of finding a position from which I could hope to understand and act 
                in contemporary society, necessarily through its history, which had delivered this 
                strange, unsettling, and exciting, world to us" (<title 
                    level="m">Culture</title> xii).</p>
             <p>Returning to this work decades later as he prepared a new introduction to <title 
                 level="m">Culture and Society</title> for the Morningside edition in 1982, that 
                 sense of a "now major crisis" had only intensified in the face of Thatcherite 
                 conservatism (ix). The need for developing a "detailed and complex thinking about 
                 culture which has been active and vibrant at every stage" had lost none of its 
                 urgency, in large part because the historical turn in <title level="m">Culture and 
                     Society</title> anticipated the double imperative inherent in Said’s call
                    for a form of radical humanism as a basis for political engagement that was at
                    the same time driven by self-critique about the limitations of the tradition out
                    of which it emerged (viii). As Williams’s work demonstrated, the modern idea of
                    culture that had developed in the Romantic period was similarly ambivalent: it
                    provided thinkers with an intellectual basis for resisting the contradictions of
                    industrial capitalism, but because it had also tended to be deployed as a
                    bulwark against the perceived excesses of modernity generally (including its
                    more progressive aspects such as democracy and the rise of a mass public
                    culture), its radical potential was, more often than not, compromised by an
                    underlying conservatism. Shining a historical light on both sides of these early
                    debates about the modern idea of culture enabled Williams to demonstrate more
                    clearly how aligning one’s work with this intellectual tradition might provide a
                    "way of finding a position from which [one] could hope to understand and act in
                    contemporary society" even as it foregrounded the need to clarify the historical
                    limitations of these inherited ideas.</p>
            <p>Fortified by what Williams has described as "the key move"
                    in the evolution of his own thinking "to the notion of cultural production as
                    itself material" (an insight that reinforced his challenge to reductive accounts
                    of the notorious Marxist distinction between base and superstructure), his work
                    increasingly foregrounded the underlying classificatory assumptions that
                    structured the literary field as a primary focus of analysis in themselves
                    (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 139). What may be most valuable about Williams’s
                    historicism, though, is the strikingly empathetic nature of his ability to blend
                    critique with a sense of affirmation. Rather than simply debunking these earlier
                    mystifications of literature and art as acts of theoretical bad faith,
                    Williams’s "clearing operation" remained animated by his sense of both the
                    extraordinary efforts of earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures of their
                    own day, and even more importantly, of the extent to which these mystifications,
                    once exposed as "false attachment[s]," could nonetheless also be seen in terms
                    of the positive cultural work they also enabled (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 
                43). The equation of literature with "creative writing" may have been inherently reductive, 
                but as he also pointed out, critical awareness of the "actively ideological" nature of 
                the "powerful and often forbidding" impact of these ideas needed to be balanced against 
                an appreciation of both the deeply "affirmative" spirit of their origin as a strategy 
                for resisting "the socially repressive and intellectually mechanical forms of a new 
                social order: that of capitalism and especially industrial capitalism," and more broadly, 
                their capacity to manifest themselves in more beneficial ways: "What was laid down as a 
                defensive reaction became in the course of the century a most important positive 
                principle, which in its full implications was deeply and genuinely humane" (<title 
                    level="m">Marxism</title> 43, 50; <title level="m">Culture</title> 40). The fact 
                that this new aesthetic ideology would itself often be embraced in "socially 
                repressive" and "intellectually mechanical ways" on behalf of the dominant social 
                order did not negate the legacy of these more positive dimensions. The real challenge 
                was to develop ways of engaging with "the very complicated pressures and limits which, 
                in their weakest forms, these [emerging] definitions falsely stabilized, yet which, in 
                their strongest forms, they sought to emphasize as new cultural practice" (<title 
                    level="m">Marxism</title> 145).</p>
            <p>For Williams, "the human commitments of these earlier
                    writers came through, in a majority of cases, as the voices of fellow strugglers
                    rather than of historically dated or periodised thinkers," an archeology of
                    resistance, however imperfect, whose larger effect was to offer an important
                    "sense that such a tradition existed" (<title level="m">Culture</title>, xi, x). As
                    Williams’s language, with its emphasis on a sense of continuity with the "human
                    commitments" of these "fellow strugglers" in their "thinking about our common
                    life" suggests, his work remained unapologetically rooted within precisely the
                    sort of humanist impulse that he cites as a reason for Lukacs’s undeserved
                    neglect: it was a "way of finding a position from which" we in turn can "hope to
                    understand and act in contemporary society" in terms that reinscribed a faith in
                    the possibility of agency even as it rejected any naïve assumptions about the
                    potential of this position (<title level="m">Culture</title> xii). However strongly 
                Williams’s work may have gravitated towards a sense of the need to critique the 
                influence of the ideas about the aesthetic that emerged in the Romantic period, this 
                critical spirit was always balanced against his recognition of the efforts of these 
                earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures of their day, even where the legacy of
                    their ideas remained the focus of his own critical efforts.</p>
            <p>Where New Historicist critics often read the theories of
                    the aesthetic that emerged in this period as a flight from the pressures of
                    history, Williams tended to approach the efforts of these authors as the work of
                    "fellow strugglers" engaged in flawed but still valuable efforts to wrestle with
                    the idea of culture, not as a means of evasion or as a formal and
                    all-encompassing ideological system but as a basis for confronting "the lived
                    dominance and subordination of particular classes" in specific historical
                    contexts (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 110). Williams was definitely not 
                uncritical of Romantic theories of the aesthetic. He warned that the tendency to "isolate 
                art, to specialize the imaginative faculty to . . . one kind of activity" amounted to a
                    "false attachment" to art as an autonomous realm that was little more than "a
                    saving clause in a bad treaty" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 43, 67). This 
                elevation of art into "a symbolic abstraction for a whole range of human experience" may 
                have been a "valuable abstraction" in many ways because of the transformative power 
                that it attributed to art in the face of dehumanizing pressures, but it was "an abstraction
                    nonetheless, because a general social activity was forced into the status of a
                    department or province, and actual works of art were in part converted into a
                    self-pleading ideology" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 47). This process amounted 
                to a "defensive reaction" that legitimated "the separation of poets from other men, and 
                their classification into an idealized general person, ‘Poet’ or ‘Artist,’ which was to be 
                so widely and damagingly received" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 48). But having 
                emphasized the cost of this impulse towards abstraction, Williams refused to allow 
                readers to forget the "deeply and genuinely humane" source of this shift: "What was 
                important at this time was the stress given to a mode of human experience and activity 
                which the progress of society seemed increasingly to deny" (<title 
                    level="m">Culture</title> 40, 39). Approached in a spirit of historical complexity,
                    this Romantic-era impulse towards abstraction must be understood, not by
                    imposing further layers of abstraction by imposing our own inadequately
                    historicized interpretations on it but by recognizing it as a flawed but
                    understandable "social activity" in its own right in the face of larger hostile
                    pressures.</p>
            <p>As the renewed critical attention that it has received in recent years suggests, Williams’s 
                work has itself become a crucial part of the history of cultural analysis that his own work 
                charts, an exemplary moment in a tradition of resistance that both focused and intensified 
                the efforts of these earlier "fellow strugglers." In this as in so many other instances, 
                humanism (in both its radical and more conventional forms) remains deeply palimpsestic: a 
                way of responding to the pressures of our own day by understanding more clearly the legacy 
                of the efforts of previous thinkers to wrestle with similar challenges in their earlier 
                forms. If, as Williams suggested, Robert Southey’s invocation of the ghost of Thomas More 
                in <title level="m">Colloquies</title> "indicates a conscious continuity with the first phase of
                    the humanist challenge" that emerged during the Renaissance
                    (<title level="m">Culture</title> 24), Williams’s own engagement with Southey and his
                    contemporaries suggests a similarly "conscious continuity" with this subsequent
                    early nineteenth-century phase in this "humanist challenge." This, for Williams,
                    is why the emergence of our modern idea of culture in the Romantic period was so
                    vital. It offered (in the historical interventions charted by Williams and in
                    his own work) a "special kind of map by means of which the nature of the
                    changes" "in our social, economic and political life" can be charted (<title 
                        level="m">Culture</title> xvii). But crucially for Williams, if culture provides a
                    unique way of mapping these changes, the very nature of this map itself was
                    changing in fundamental ways. Its initial function as "a separate body of moral
                    and intellectual activities" and as "a court of human appeal" had extended to a
                    far broader and more fundamental understanding of culture as "a whole way of
                    life, not only as a scale of integrity, but as a mode of interpreting all our
                    common experience, and, in this new interpretation, changing it" (<title 
                        level="m">Culture</title> xviii). This understanding of culture has, like Harry
                    Potter’s Marauder’s Map, become both mobile and self-reflexive: a critical
                    disposition focused on charting dynamics rather than fixed topographies and
                    highlighting our own position within them: "Each [literary] convention must be
                    assessed by what it is rooted in and what it does: an assessment that is related
                    to a much more general historical judgment that is also an affiliation—not
                    history as all that has happened, but as where oneself is in it" (<title 
                        level="m">Politics</title> 307).</p>
            <p>However necessary it may be to delineate the theoretical
                    differences between the different stages of Williams’s career, particularly as
                    his work became more overtly engaged with current Marxist debates, on the one
                    hand, and more energized by both his involvement in the radical political
                    struggles associated with the May Day Manifesto and by his theoretical
                    insistence on the materiality of culture, on the other, it remains equally
                    important to emphasize the continuities implicit in Williams’s efforts to chart
                    the relations between different forms of cultural production and broader social
                    and political relations.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Williams’s role in

                    his hang-ups and become a real person"—Williams countered that this sense of a
                    change in his thinking missed the far more fundamental continuities across the
                    whole of his work, in all of which he had been "arguing with what I take to be
                    official English culture," even if he had "done that in different ways in
                    different phases" (<title level="m">Politics and
                    Letters</title> 317, 316). The common thread running through these
                    different phases had been Williams’s interest, not just in mapping out the
                    broader relations that exposed the limitations of this "official" version of
                    culture, but perhaps more importantly, highlighting a history of earlier
                    writers’ similar efforts.</p>
            <p>This cartographic impulse to map out the connections that
                    define an increasingly complex understanding of our "whole way of life" has
                    become important in new but familiar ways in the face of the complexities that
                    confront us in the opening decades of the twenty-first century. In <title 
                        level="m">Age of Discovery</title>, Ian
                    Goldin and Chris Kutarna argue in a similar spirit that like earlier eras, our
                    age is a precarious but exciting transitional moment faced with enormous
                    possibilities and hazards. Faced with spiralling levels of complexity on
                    multiple fronts, Goldin and Kutarna echo Williams’s fundamental lesson about the
                    challenge this implies: "Every day in which we do not actively map out new
                    connections, we become more lost in their complexity" (255). The key to managing
                    these changes, they argue, is that we emulate earlier thinkers (in their case,
                    the "learned people in the Renaissance" rather than the Romantic period) who,
                    faced with similar pressures and opportunities, "completely changed their mental
                    map of the world to suit the challenges they faced" (251). Williams’s
                    intervention, which was grounded in his study of early nineteenth-century
                    thinkers’ efforts to change their own "mental map of the world," has lost none
                    of its urgency or relevance.</p>
            <p>For those of us who work in the humanities, these
                    challenges have been felt in especially immediate ways. In her landmark 2010
                    book, <title level="m"> Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</title>, 
                Martha Nussbaum warned that "we are in the midst of a
                    crisis of massive proportions and grave global significance": not "the global
                    economic crisis that began in 2008" whose ultimate outcome may well be the rise
                    of alt-right populist extremism one decade later, but the widespread erosion of
                    support for the humanities both within and outside of universities (1). The
                    urgency of the topic has generated an avalanche of books, studies, and articles
                    in a range of venues, from academic journals to leading magazines and
                    newspapers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance, Rens Bod, <title

                    debates—<ref target="https://mk0humanitiesinfbx7p.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Mapping-the-Future-of-the-Humanities.pdf">
                        The Teaching of the Arts and Humanities at Harvard College: Mapping the 
                        Future</ref> (2013)—suggests, the cartographic impulse embraced by Williams 
                and echoed by Goldin and Kutarna remains central to these responses. As humanist 
                thinkers have always recognized, this task of mapping the future begins with a 
                clearer understanding of the historical force of the cultural formations whose 
                stubbornly prescriptive influence did so much to define the disciplines within which 
                we study them.</p>
            <p>Stefan Collini’s argument that we need "to start from
                    further away in order to revitalize ways of understanding the nature and
                    importance of universities that are in danger of being lost sight of in the
                    present" underscores the continuing importance of Williams’s historical turn to
                    the project of developing an archeology of ideas forged by earlier thinkers in
                    the face of similar pressures as a basis for responding to current issues (19).
                    Williams’s genealogical work on culture never explicitly engaged with the
                    emergence of modern institutional forms of the humanities in these same decades,
                    however closely intertwined these histories may have been, but as his analyses
                    make clear, the work of these earlier writers amounted to exemplary instances of
                    the humanities in action: critical reflections on the nature and role of culture
                    as a transformative domain within a modern industrial society. If talk of
                    "crisis of the humanities" has declined over the past few years, this may be in
                    part because there are bigger crises to worry about. The issue seems less and
                    less to be what society can do for the humanities, than what the humanities can
                    do for a society in the face of a rising spirit of authoritarianism. But the
                    key, as Williams argued in the face of very different pressures, begins with
                    resisting the lure of reifying supposedly autonomous sites of resistance,
                    whether that be "culture" or its institutional cousin, "the humanities."</p>
            <p>The implications of Williams’s particular form of radical humanism become clearest 
                in his discussion of hegemony in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, 
                where, aligning his approach with Gramsci, Williams
                    explicitly distinguishes the idea of hegemony as "a lived system of meanings and
                    values" that is fundamentally shaped by "relations of domination and
                    subordination" without ever being reduced to them—"a whole body of practices and
                    expectations, over the whole of living: our senses and assignments of energy,
                    our shaping perceptions of ourselves and our world"—from the more abstracted and
                    endlessly "generalized system" that theorists such as Althusser described as
                    "ideology" (109–10). Where the idea of ideology developed by Althusser implied a
                    "relatively formal and articulated system of meanings, values, and beliefs, of a
                    kind that can be abstracted as a ‘world-view’ or ‘class outlook’" and then
                    mapped onto cultural analyses of "works of art" as "fully articulate and
                    systematic expressions of this ideology," the concept of hegemony favored by
                    Williams suggested a work-in-progress: a sense of contingency rooted in people’s
                    actual struggles to engage with the pressures of their day: "the relatively
                    mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate consciousness of actual men [and
                    women] in that period" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 109). This shift 
                (from ideology as wall-to-wall
                    consciousness to hegemony as a site of struggle) is crucial because it
                    transforms culture, and therefore, the study of it, from a mere "superstructure"
                    reflecting "a formed social and economic structure" to a vital set of activities
                    that actively help to shape people’s historical moment (<title 
                        level="m">Marxism</title> 111). In this sense, the idea of "a lived hegemony" is
                    never, "except analytically, a system or a structure. It is a realized complex
                    of experiences, relationships, and activities, with specific and changing
                    pressures and limits" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 112).</p>
            <p>This recourse to a rhetoric of the lived experiences of "actual men" was reinforced by 
                the autobiographical dimension of his work, especially in <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title>, which was peppered with passages such as his comment that 
                "I know these feelings at once, from my own experience. The only landscape I ever 
                see, in dreams, is the Black Mountain village in which I was born. When I go back 
                to that country, I feel a recovery of a particular kind of life, which appears, as 
                an inescapable identity, a more positive connection than I have known elsewhere" 
                (84). There is, according to the almost Wordsworthian logic of these sorts of 
                invocations, a kind of personal and unmediated "truth" here that can be extrapolated 
                into a broader social truth in opposition to the distortions of power. It was no 
                accident that <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> opens with what, for many critics, was a surprisingly sympathetic 
                discussion of Edmund Burke, the great champion of the importance of feelings to any 
                sustainable vision of common life. Returning to this idea three years later in <title 
                    level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, Williams would provide a name for this 
                theoretical focus: "structure[s] of feeling," a term that would become a hallmark of 
                his work and which was intended to convey a phenomenon that was, paradoxically, both 
                "firm and definite," grounded in particular forms of social organization, and 
                evanescent, operating "in the most delicate and least tangible parts of our 
                activities" (64).</p>
            <p>Williams’s stress on the importance of this fleeting world
                    of deeply felt but sometimes only half-recognized emotional life has rendered
                    his work vulnerable to the criticism that, despite his insistence to the
                    contrary, it presumes the availability of some preideological realm of
                    unmediated self-presence. But as Williams has always argued, this recourse to
                    lived experience was primarily a strategy for resisting the dangers of
                    abstraction (whether it is in the name of poetry or art or culture or the
                    humanities) without denying the unique value of the forms of knowledge and
                    potential for political engagement that these phenomena also afford. This
                    position may have been grounded in an overly confident appeal to the authentic
                    experience of actual men and women, but this interpretive fallacy does not
                    negate the importance of Williams’s related effort to ground the possibility of
                    political resistance in a cultural vision that recognized the transformative
                    promise of affect as a domain that could never be fully recontained within
                    dominant systems of power in terms that reflect Gramsci’s vision of hegemony as
                    process: "the relatively mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate
                    consciousness of actual men [and women] in that period" (<title 
                        level="m">Marxism</title> 109). If Williams’s work, both in its limitations and the
                    critical scrutiny that he brought to bear on the historical sources of these
                    limitations, offered a compelling counterpoint to the strengths and the problems
                    inherent in Romantic authors’ own efforts to advance a similar recognition of
                    the primacy of lived experience in face of the hostile pressures of their day,
                    his understanding of these authors as both a pioneering force in the development
                    of new ideas about the role of culture and as cautionary examples of the
                    dangerous tug of abstraction may well be more material than ever.</p>
