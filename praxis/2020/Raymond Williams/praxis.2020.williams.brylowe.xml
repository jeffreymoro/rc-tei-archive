                    usefulness in thinking both about our profession and our relationship to other kinds

            <p>This essay is a work of gratitude, as I think it is safe to say that reading Raymond
                Williams’s <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> changed my life. I spent
                most of my 20s as contingent academic labor. When I had finally had enough, I left
                my role as family caretaker to pursue a PhD in Literary and Cultural Studies in
                Pittsburgh, a city built on coal and hot metal. I was painfully aware of my
                shortcomings: I had an undergraduate degree from a small public college. I had a
                terminal MA that I’d earned one course at a time. I was
                older than anyone in my cohort, having spent much of my early adulthood motherless
                and caring for my grandparent and siblings. I was pregnant with my second child. My
                working-class spouse opted to stay home with our children rather than devote a full
                salary to childcare. More than once I wondered what I was doing back in school: I
                felt guilt over the life I had left and alienation from the one I was heading
                toward. In my darkest moments, I felt I was a tool of the Ideological State
                Apparatus, a low middle manager of cultural capital. Before I left home for a PhD, I
                had been cobbling together a health-insuranceless living, trying to make ends meet
                by teaching four or five composition classes per semester, at times teaching at a
                for-profit business school and at others working in a writing center. Now I was on
                the knowledge-production side of things. How could I reconcile this past and future?</p>
             <p>In this essay, I explain how <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> inflected
                my understanding of the work we do in general and my own work at the intersection of
                Romanticism and book history in particular. One goal of this essay is to show those
                readers coming to <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> for the first time
                what its stakes were in its time and how it might be applied now, both as a way to
                think about the Romantic period—which encompasses the emergence of political
                economy—and as a way to consider our own situation, in and beyond the institutions
                of higher learning that employ us. Hands and minds who never wrote a word are as
                essential to the production and reception of literature as all our writers and
                critics, and those people deserve a space in our theoretical consideration of
                literary works and their reception. By considering literature from this wider
                angle—by taking academic research, teaching, bookstores, libraries, papermills,
                coltan mines, and server farms into account as institutions and infrastructures
                without which we could not have (or study) literature—I want to show how a "media
                ecology" that necessarily includes the work of backs and hands long dead as well as
                those now living is commensurate with Williams’s thinking. I begin by explaining the
                stakes of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> on its own terms and then
                move into its usefulness beyond literature <emph>per se</emph>, into the
                constellation of interests we once called "book history" and now call variously
                "print culture studies," "old media studies," "media ecology," and a raft of other
                terms that indicate an interest in the material processes that make and circulate
                artifacts that contain information, imaginative content, and/or ideas.</p>
            <p>In the 1990s, book history was emerging in English departments as a discrete field of
                study. It was both topic and technique, which in turn drew on an array of
                interdisciplinary methods and histories. Its canon included bibliographers, both old
                and new; students read Fredson Bowers beside D. F. Mackenzie. It also included works
                from the <title level="m">Annales</title> school, works of historicist literary
                criticism, structuralist linguistics, and media theory. Once I explain how
                Williams’s thinking is at the center of my own book-historical research and teaching
                praxis, I briefly consider the emergence of adjunctification in higher education, a
                condition of labor that underwrites budgetary shortcomings in many institutions. The
                essay ends with some reflections on the current state of the field and, perhaps
                predictably, an encouraging word to those who might consider teaching <title 
                    level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. Ultimately, I want to urge solidarity
                between workers alive and dead in the interest of decolonizing our classrooms and
                scholarship and acknowledging that media ecology and the ecology of the planet we
                inhabit are deeply entangled. Knowledge production often <emph>feels</emph>
                solitary. But my work on the history of particular English books could not be done
                were it not for the work of ragpickers and assembly workers, leather tanners and
                adjunct professors. Williams does not go this far. But in reading <title 
                    level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> today, given the urgencies of climate 
                change and the slow violence enacted on workers across the Global South, I think it 
                is a text worth revisiting with an expanded understanding of the media ecology of 
                literature (Nixon).</p>
             <p>Many new readers find <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> difficult going.
                Williams is writing against a dominant form of Marxism that has aligned itself with
                structuralist thinking, but since he does not name names or explicitly say that his
                targets are both the New Criticism and especially structuralism (which he considers
                its legacy) the stakes can be difficult for an uninitiated reader to understand (<title 
                    level="m">Interviews</title> 335). Williams would later describe his main
                target as "the eruption of a mode of idealist literary study claiming the authority
                of Marxism and the prestige of association with powerful intellectual movements in
                many other fields" (<title level="m">Interviews</title> 340). Even this explanation is
                slippery, but it refers to descriptions of base and superstructure, taken up by
                Louis Althusser and others, as the factors determining social relations. Earlier in
                his writings, Williams had cast doubt on the very language of determination, which
                he argued "is of great linguistic and real complexity. The language of determination
                and even more of determinism was inherited from idealist and especially theological
                accounts of the world and man" ("Base and Superstructure"). In <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, he targets the reduction of what he understands to
                be complex <emph>processes</emph> to objectified <emph>structures</emph>. This way 
                 of thinking helps us understand culture in analog to
                our environment. Just as water (or PCB) cycles through earth and air, so too do the
                materials that carry ideas move across material forms and institutions. Of interest
                to Williams is the <emph>labor</emph> that moves literature and culture
                across time and distance—and crucially, he argues that the <emph>idea
                    itself</emph> is material.</p>
             <p>Initiated readers will know that Williams grounds his objection to structure 
                 in <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>, written by Marx and Engels in
                 1846, in which they take up the division of mental from physical labor. The real 
                 object of criticism, though, is a particular brand of 20th-century Marxist criticism 
                 he dismisses as "a mode of idealist literary study." The relevant
                passage is as follows:
            <quote>From the start the "spirit" is afflicted with the curse of being "burdened" with
                matter, which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air,
                sounds, in short, of language. Language is as old as consciousness, language 
                <emph>is</emph> practical consciousness that exists also for other men,
                and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well; language, like
                consciousness, only arises from need, the necessity, of intercourse with other
                men. . . . Consciousness is therefore a social product. (Marx 158)</quote>
                Having established that consciousness is a social product and therefore of the
                material realm, Marx and Engels argue that divisions of labor stem from the
                misguided division of mental from physical labor, after which<quote>
                consciousness can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness
                of existing practice, that it really represents something without representing
                something real; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from
                the world and to proceed to the foundation of "pure" theory. (159)</quote>
                The perceived split between the ideal and the material, Marx and Engels argue, is at
                the root of German ideology—but for them, "Life is not determined by consciousness,
                but consciousness is determined by life" (155). As Brian McGrath’s contribution to
                this volume shows, English translation poses more problems than German when it comes
                to the language of determinism, and Williams is acutely aware of problems both with
                the double meaning of "determined" (as in "I am determined not to be determined")
                and of the difficulty in getting determinism right.<note place="foot"

            <p>For Williams, to split social relations into base and superstructure is to repeat the
                misguided reasoning refuted in <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>. Williams,
                in thinking about his profession, explains that in separating civilization from
                culture, structuralist Marxism had relegated both language <emph>and</emph> 
                literature to a superstructure that merely "reflects" a base of "real"
                or "true" social relations (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 19). In an earlier essay,
                Williams writes that the definition of "base"
            <quote>has narrowed remarkably, and in a cultural context very damagingly, from [Marx’s]
                more central notion of <emph>productive forces</emph>, in which, to give
                just brief reminders, the most important thing a worker ever produces is himself,
                himself in the fact of that kind of labour, or the broader historical emphasis of
                men producing themselves, themselves and their history. Now when we talk of the
                base, and of primary productive forces, it matters very much whether we are
                referring . . . to primary production within the terms of capitalist economic
                relationships, or to the primary production of society itself, and of men
                themselves, material production and reproduction of real life. If we have the broad
                sense of productive forces, we look at the whole question of the base differently,
                and we are then less tempted to dismiss as superstructural, and in that sense as
                merely secondary, certain vital productive social forces, which are in the broad
                sense, from the beginning, basic. (<title level="a">Base and 
                    Superstructure</title>)</quote>
               Taken with McGrath’s discussion of determinism, this passage makes clear the stakes
                of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. If the base determines social
                relations, it necessarily includes cultural production, for "language is practical
                consciousness." Language, of course, includes literature.</p>
             <p>While <title level="m">The German Ideology</title> does not use the words "base" or
                 "superstructure," the introduction to the much later <title level="m">A
                    Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</title> (1857) does. Williams
                shows that Marx seems to contradict himself in his use of the term "superstructure,"
                suggesting it is a <emph>concept</emph> in the introduction but describing
                it as a <emph>process</emph> elsewhere (<title level="m">Marxism </title>19). 
                 Nonetheless, structuralist Marxism took up the base-and-superstructure 
                 model in order to look at the capitalist system synchronically—that is to say, 
                 to look at it <emph>as a structure</emph>. In this model, while the base (or means 
                 of production) ultimately plays a determining role, it is controlled by a ruling 
                 ideology. The "superstructure," then, consists of the state (which has the power to 
                 oppress through repressive violence) and a collection of institutions that function as what
                Althusser calls the "Ideological State Apparatus." Unlike the "Repressive State
                Apparatus," which consists of the ruling political regime, the ISA is considerably
                varied and consists of schools, churches, families, sports, media outlets, trade
                unions, and so on. In creating this distinction, Althusser is able to argue,
                following <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>, that "ideology has no
                history." I will return to ideology and history, but before I do, I want to point
                out that the ethical stakes here for Williams—and for us—are high. Thinking of
                ourselves as the long arm of the ISA could only mean that we are complicit in
                capitalist repression. But are we by virtue of the institutions that employ us
                instruments of their ideology? Is an adjunct making $3,000 per course with no hope
                of health insurance complicit in repression?</p>
             <p>Perhaps yes, although the 2019 story in <title level="j">The Atlantic</title> about the
                death of Thea Hunter, an African American adjunct, should make us wonder (Harris).
                Economic and social circumstances are different for all of us, and I am certainly
                complicit inasmuch as I am on the tenure track now—but even so, blaming ourselves
                for reinscribing the ideology of capitalism, I have learned, is not a very
                productive way to think. I am sure I was not the first graduate student to be
                crushed by the dissonant awareness of my role as a force of the superstructure on
                the one hand and that a faculty dinner cost over half my monthly wages on the other.
                 <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, however, steers its readers away
                from an analysis of structure and toward one of <emph>process</emph>—in
                other words, away from the synchronic and toward the diachronic, away from ideology
                and toward history. Its recuperative move, to return to <title level="m">The German
                    Ideology</title>, lies in the assertion that "language is practical consciousness."
                In the chapter titled <title level="a">Language,</title> <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title> elaborates a theory of language as <emph>activity</emph>. 
                The sign is not a fixed object, and language is not to be read synchronically. To fix 
                the sign either in its form or content is "a radical denial of active practical
                consciousness" (39). Williams argues that despite certain surface affinities between
                Marxism and Saussurian linguistics, which "repeats an important and often general
                pattern within Marxism itself, over a range from comparative analysis and
                classification of stages of a society, through the discovery of certain fundamental
                laws of change within these systematic stages, to the assertion of a controlling
                social system which is a priori inaccessible to ‘individual’ acts of will and
                intelligence," the analogy does not hold. He shows Marxism and structuralist
                linguistics to be opposed on the grounds that structuralism reifies history into "an
                ‘always given’ language system" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 28, 37). Williams 
                prefers to see language as inseparable from the social, as "living evidence of a 
                continual social process, into which individuals are born and within which they 
                are shaped, but to which they then actively contribute, in a continuing process"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 37). Unlike Althusser’s
                last-instance determinism, then, Williams’s analysis of language-as-process
                reconciles language (as practical consciousness) to thought and thought to history
                and to work. This is the book’s most important contribution to literary studies. It
                means that language, constitutive to humans across time and context, unites us in
                our labors. As a worker and as a researcher in English literature, this assertion of
                unification and solidarity with other kinds of workers has helped me find my
                way.</p>
            <p>Writers, tenure-track professors, and graduate students, <emph>as well

                we are all part of the process of cultural production. Williams’s overlapping
                definitions of "labor," "work," and "job" in his 1976 <title level="m">Keywords</title> 
                illuminate his understanding of language and moreover help to
                show how the historical period that encompasses Romanticism is implicated in the
                shifts in social relations that necessitate Marxist criticism in the first place.<note 
                    place="foot" resp="editors">In this section, I am summarizing from <title

                    334–37, in <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and
                                Society</title>.</note> Labor, like culture, has linguistic
                roots planted deeply in a field. "To labor" meant "to plough or plant," and a
                laborer was one who lived by his hands. Labor as a noun meant to work, but also "to
                suffer," as one struggling under a burden might do. Williams explains that except
                for the labors of childbirth, the term underwent a transition in the eighteenth
                century such that by the time Adam Smith was writing <title level="m">The Wealth of
                    Nations</title> (1776) it was an abstract term in the language of political
                economy. At the same time, the term "work" underwent a shift from its original
                definition to one that particularly emphasizes paid employment. As labor was
                abstracted from suffering bodies in order for it to be bought and sold, so work
                became the activity associated with that abstracted form of toil. Finally, in the
                context of capitalist social relations, the word "job" described not the temporary
                and finite tasks associated with "jobbing" but the position we occupy as paid
                laborers in our work. The Romantic period, then, marks our identification with other
                paid workers who have a job whereby they sell their labor.</p>
            <p>Not only is a transition in social relations marked by these terms, but, crucially,
                Williams’s description of that transition shows how <emph>language
                    itself</emph> is a product of historical and social <emph>process</emph>. These 
                words (like language more broadly) are both a distinct social
                product and are part of the process by which history is produced. Linguistic signs
                cannot be separated from the history they create or the history they carry. The
                implicit criticism of structuralist linguistics, which describes language as an
                arbitrary and <emph>a priori</emph> system accessed by individual
                speakers, is clear. Williams writes of the <title level="m">Keywords</title> project
                that "language is a continuous social production in its most dynamic sense. In other
                words, not in the sense which is compatible with structuralism—that a central body
                of meaning is created and propagated, but in the sense that like any other social
                production it is the arena of all sorts of shifts and interests and relations of
                dominance" (<title level="m">Interviews</title> 176). These keywords both mark and
                make historical contradictions and conflict. It just so happens that a shift in the
                meaning of work happened in the Romantic period—a period when British cultural
                practices were being professionalized into actual jobs that people 
                worked.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Jon Klancher’s

            <p>To be sure, Williams was not thinking of media ecology in the way that I propose is
                so urgently needed. His threefold critique of Marxist cultural theory, structuralist
                linguistics, and literary theory does not address the nonintellectual labor involved
                in producing material media. Moreover, he did not invent the critique. In 1977, when
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> was published, the "communication
                circuit" had already migrated from structuralist linguistics to cultural studies.
                Saussure had visualized communication as a pair of line-drawn heads, labeled A and
                B, exchanging messages via mouths, ears, and brains (Figure 1).

                </figure>In 1973, Stuart Hall, whose model of Encoding/Decoding
                demonstrated that media, discourse, and social practice produce and constitute each
                other through a "passage of forms," replaced Saussure’s heads with "structures of
                meaning" without which discourse could not work.

                </figure>More important for the development of media ecology was Robert
                Darnton’s 1982 revision of the communications circuit in his essay <title level="a">What is the
                History of Books.</title>
                <figure>

                </figure>Instead of the <emph>concepts</emph> of
                "infrastructure" and "relations of production" that Hall had offered, Darnton’s
                circuit included people and things: booksellers, pirates, pressmen, trees, and
                sheep. I argue that imposing Williams’s reading of Marx onto Darnton’s circuit, via
                Hall, makes the communication circuit diagram into a diagram about work: about their
                work and ours, about Jane Austen’s work and the pressman’s work, about the lowest
                paid papermill laborer, the enslaved cotton gin operator, the tree feller—without
                whom our profession, with its own oversimplified circuit of author/text/reader,
                would be unsustainable. Put another way, <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> holds together the "book-historical" and literary past, the
                ongoing ideology of our profession, and the corporatized present of our labor
                market. The book that saved me from the dark suspicion that I was becoming part of
                the ISA did so because it offers a path to a theory that binds us through language:
                engravers and printers—and professors and university
                administrators—are <emph>joined by our labors</emph>
                in the work of cultural production. We are all, to use Williams’s term, "basic."</p>
            <p>For many of us, research and knowledge production constitute at least part of our
                paid work. Certainly time in the archive is both mental and physical work. Working
                on big books, I quickly learned, means hefting them on and off library carts,
                standing to turn pages, see pictures, or take photos, and sitting to read, type, and
                take notes. Reading small typeface in low light means eye strain; sitting and
                writing for hours cripples our backs and wrists. For some, research means entering
                unairconditioned government buildings, sometimes under unsafe conditions, looking at
                papers that are crumbling to pulp or dust. For some, it means "reading" a landscape
                rife with the remnants of war and colonial violence.<note place="foot"

                traveling, reading, and
                assembling arguments—these things are also part of my paid job. Dwindling research
                money means a trip to the archive is not to be wasted: many of us sit from open to
                close, peering into foam-cradled codices or through transparent plastic at
                centuries-old ink. The reading room requires the stamina of a scrivener. And like
                illuminating manuscripts or setting type or binding codices, it also requires
                professional training unavailable to the average reader. It seems reasonable to
                think that a print history that is attentive to the labor of making books, paper,
                and ink might also be attentive to the work of reading and preserving them. A
                politics of the archive should include the makers (however willing or unwilling),
                the encoders and the decoders alike. These makers of media may not have "worked" a
                "job," but they certainly <emph>labored</emph>—like we all do—with hands
                and minds and backs.</p>
            <p>In the field of literature, we have our own version of Saussure’s
                communication-circuit heads. In the classroom, I draw stick figures to demonstrate
                the poststructuralist idea that authorship isn’t any more real than any other shared
                belief. In my chalkboard cartoon, it’s 2020, and I am reading <title 
                    level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>. I am riveted as Catherine Moreland discovers a secreted
                laundry list. On the other end of the chalkboard, it’s 1799 and Jane Austen is
                writing. Between us, in an idea bubble, is the scene from the novel. In the most
                basic model of the literary communication circuit, we share the experience of events
                unfolding in text, a text an author wrote some time in the past and a reader now
                reads. In the cartoon (and in the ideology we live by) we share Catherine’s world
                    <emph>as text</emph>, no matter which physical iteration we hold in
                our hands, read with our eyes or fingers, or hear with our ears. The physical thing
                is merely a conduit—or a window for Roland Barthes—that allows us access to that
                shared, nonphysical thing that is the text.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">See, for example, Barthes, <title level="m">S/Z</title>, and
                            Richard Lanham, pp. 4–18.</note> But this shared belief
                requires us to agree to ignore the labor that brought us the thing we hold, often a
                Penguin Classics or a Norton Critical or a Broadview edition—or nowadays as often as
                not a laptop screen with the free version on Google books, a Kindle, or even a
                phone. And it’s not just the editors or the publishers we ignore in this
                author-text-reader formula. Or even the manufacturers who made the paper and printed
                the book. Modern editions are edited and laid out on a computer. What about the
                workers who made that computer or designed the software? If we read on a tablet, the
                ideology of authorship allows us to think past the labor of the factory workers who
                built the device, for pitiful wages, often at terrible physical and mental cost. As
                Romanticists we are conditioned to think of the contingencies of <title 
                    level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>'s vexed publication history. As a book historian, I also
                think about the arms and backs that pressed early editions, and the makers of the
                paper it was printed on, the mixers of ink. The ideology represented in my stick
                figures—the ideology of authorship that my profession is founded on—obfuscates this
                labor in favor of a model of <emph>textual</emph> transmission, where <title 
                    level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> travels from mind to mind to mind without
                regard for how it got in there.</p>
            <p>In this volume, Mary Favret reads Williams reading Austen. In her reckoning, Austen
                is for Williams a stable entity against which to produce and describe social change.
                In revealing this important blind spot in Williams’s writing, Favret helps me to
                articulate other shortcomings, including the valorization of a canon we might like
                to see modified, or even abandoned. In proposing we read <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title> now, I do not mean to say that Williams has everything
                right. As John Guillory points out, Williams is suspicious of the very process he
                addresses in the <title level="a">From Reflection to Mediation</title> chapter 
                of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. For Williams, 
                <emph>mediation</emph> is always in danger of collapsing into reified 
                <emph>media</emph>. In <title level="a">Genesis of the Media Concept,</title> 
                Guillory usefully distinguishes between the "media concept" (itself
                a product of contradiction) and the genesis of the "concept of mediation, which
                names a process rather than an object" (342). As Guillory explains it, 
                <emph>media</emph>, a material form, is historically rooted in a
                seventeenth-century philosophical contradiction, which is borne out philologically:
                material <emph>words</emph> are a medium for immaterial thought in one
                formulation; in the other, technological media are a medium for speech (358). 
                <title level="m">Mediation</title>, however, has a different and altogether more
                recent genesis. The process we call mediation, Guillory argues, was initially
                connected to communication theory by Charles Sanders Peirce, whose semiotic theory
                provided a "new framework . . . which encloses all forms of media" under the rubric
                of communication—or, in an even more ideologically charged formulation, the rubric
                of <emph>information</emph> (347). Over the next century, social and
                cultural relations of all kinds were subsumed under a new totalizing regime. At the
                same time, "mediation," now freighted with semiotics-as-information on the one hand
                and increasing "media saturation" on the other, came only to mean "the process of
                transferring information."<note place="foot" resp="editors">I briefly summarize here 
                    what Guillory carefully lays out on pp. 348–53. The term "media saturation" is 
                    defined in the introduction to the Multigraph Collective’s <title

                            entrenched over time.</note></p>
             <p>Williams, of course, was not a book historian, so his concerns in <title 
                 level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> have more to do with the work of writing 
                 than the work of making the constituent materials of textual transmission.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">Williams does at times address media. Notably, the institutions of 
                     printing are crucial to his analysis in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>
                            (1961).</note> Its third chapter defines literature. Against
                formalist definitions of literature that reduce literature to ideology, Williams
                offers us history. He shows how literature’s definition shifted from one that
                emphasized general print literacy to, in the eighteenth century, a canon of
                imaginative works that a discerning judge could recognize. As such, this emergent
                form of literature <emph>required</emph> a critical apparatus capable of
                declaring its value. Criticism filled this need. In the last section of the book,
                devoted to literary criticism, Williams writes against the cordoning off of specific
                "aesthetic" forms of writing, and he joins its reception with its making, both of
                which "are connecting material processes within a social system of the use and
                transformation of material (including language) by material means"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 152). While the move is to
                level literature, the author nonetheless occupies the privileged position.</p>
            <p>Unlike Williams, I feel more optimistic regarding the potential that might be enacted
                in the concept of mediation. Rather than worry about the dangers of vulgar
                reflection theory on the one hand or technological determinism on the other, I think
                in wedding media theory to our new attention to ecological processes, media ecology
                could level literary studies further, and in the process to decenter the author,
                itself an invention solidified in Romantic period, by "Romantic" poets.<note place="foot"

                                Self-Canonization, and the Business of Poetry</title>.</note> In 
                using Williams to reconcile the labor of writing and the materiality of language
                to the work of <emph>making media itself</emph>—that is, the production of
                paper, ink, printed materials, bindings, and so on—we allow ourselves the
                opportunity to study a new canon of cultural makers, including enslaved Africans,
                workhouse children, indigenous growers, and others whose labor has been sold into
                the making of media. Returning to Darnton, it is important to note that the workers
                in a circuit that mediates thought into books may be joined in their labors, but
                they are hardly made equal by this joining. Our highly specialized and
                professionalized work looks nothing like labors of the men and women who assemble
                our computers. Rather than a circuit, Darnton’s diagram could be replaced with a
                web—or an enmeshed, messy conglomeration of constantly changing relationships that
                is and has been, since before the eighteenth century, subject to the ebbs and flows
                of global capital. While it doesn’t make for neat diagramming, it does help us feel
                the community of which we are part.</p>
            <p>Williams constantly replaces static structures with the dynamic complexity and
                multiplicity of actions and relationships. He is, however, a product of a particular
                history. In bringing <emph>our</emph> histories to his writings, <emph>we</emph> can 
                build an inclusive media ecology. The sheer
                perniciousness of the ideology of authorship makes efforts at both expansion of the
                circuitry and efforts at decolonization equally difficult. On the one hand,
                declaring the author dead these days is an ironic gesture, a way of gesturing toward
                the absurdity of the ivory tower, a way of saying students of literature and
                critical theory are out of touch with everyone else’s reality. On the other, we
                suffer from a dearth of "authorized voices" issuing from people of color in the
                Romantic period, as Rebecca Schneider has shown. Of course the author is alive and
                well; an astonishing collection of new-to-the-canon authors populate our course
                offerings and anthologies, and without a doubt their writings enrich our
                understanding of the complexity and diversity—and the sufferings—of history. We all
                write and publish, furthermore, and thus we ourselves are authors, even if we write
                about collectors or librarians or publishers or pressmen or ragpickers or
                plantations or suicide nets, all of which had a place in making words from a pen in
                1799 readable on a screen in 2019.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I refer to the

                recent efforts by the Bigger Six Collective and the new
                Race and Empire Caucus at NASSR speak to the urgency of decolonizing efforts.
                Despite declarations that cultural studies or working-class studies are finished,
                done in by the wave of identitarian recovery projects that came along with
                postmodern fragmentation, I want to suggest that in looking past the author into a
                wider media ecology that is both based in and moves beyond Williams’s cultural
                theory, we might find alternate routes to decolonizing literature.</p>
            <p>In the past, efforts at extirpating the author have come from above. In the
                poststructuralist moment, French theory tried to kill the author. The Romantic
                period offers another example of its attempted murder. Writings by our colleagues on
                British bibliomaniacs like Thomas Frognall Dibdin suggest that in our period,
                against Wordsworth’s assertion regarding the professional poet with all his
                specialized capacities, another path was possible. If the bibliomaniacs had had
                their way, perhaps our literature classes would be organized around collectors and
                collections rather than authors. Romantic-era bibliomaniacs were perverse, as Deidre
                Lynch argues, precisely because their habits ran counter to the sensibilities of a
                national reading culture; they could and did wield aristocratic power and wealth
                over the defenseless library in way that charmed even as it repulsed. But the
                formation of authorship in the eighteenth century—a powerful cultural construction
                built from raw materials like celebrity culture, editorial intervention, legal
                changes in copyright, and stabilizing print conventions—was able to resist the
                deadly charms of these hypermasculine collectors. It doesn’t seem to be going
                anywhere anytime soon. Authorship is like Mark Twain that way. Rumors of its death
                were greatly exaggerated.</p>
            <p>Rather to declare the author dead, then, we might resurrect the other workers who
                make figures like Jane Austen <emph>and</emph> Raymond Williams possible.
                As important as it is to recover and circulate the writings of people marginalized
                by history, Williams’s focus on mediation and labor also allows us to think past the
                author "function" to its <emph>making</emph>, which is the explicit <emph>job</emph> 
                of editors, compositors, printers, and so on. Darnton’s
                circuit proves that from the outset, book history valued the artisanal labor of men
                in printshops, papermills, and binderies. Studies of book history and print culture
                nearly always privilege artisanal or professionalized labor over the unskilled
                workers whose efforts are every bit as important to the final material products we
                read and examine. Instead of looking at the singular and exceptional author, or the
                professionalized (mostly) white men who set type or operated printing presses, I
                propose we acknowledge the unskilled labor just as necessary to the literature we
                read—the work of little boys and girls in Manchester, unpaid "apprentices" whose
                hands worked machines that made the cotton cloth that eventually became rags in the
                papermill; the enslaved fieldhands whose liberty and labor were stolen to pick the
                same cotton; the women sorting and cutting soiled rags. Williams acknowledges that
                the language of labor and work shift during the Romantic period. Perhaps it is time
                for another change that acknowledges a shift away from the long Romanticism that has
                ushered in climate crisis.</p>
             <p>In the chapter <title level="a">From Medium to Social Practice</title>, Williams 
                again objects to the term "medium" as it has been applied to language. 
                The objectification of language into a
                series of things we access and arrange can lead, Williams argues, to a different
                kind of hard determinism. Base and superstructure, McLuhan’s sense that the medium
                    <emph>is</emph> the message—that medium determines what is within the
                possible for communication—is also objectionable because it gives our human agency
                over to a system or thing. As I’ve written elsewhere, I credit the Multigraph
                Collective with helping me to think about the constituent materials of print culture
                and for teaching me to use the term "media ecology" as a frame to consider medium
                and material as interactive and dynamic constituents of print culture. Add to this
                Williams’s theory of language and cultural production and an expanded version of
                Darnton’s communications circuit that includes an accretion of unrecognized
                agricultural and unskilled urban labor. In this context, media ecology frees media
                from reification, encouraging us to think about its circulation and interactivity
                rather than its thingness. Like Williams, we must see media (with all the
                fundamental contradictions Guillory shows us it contains) and mediation through
                material processes inseparable from history and use. Media ecology invites us to
                acknowledge the backs as well as the minds that make our work possible. It helps to
                focus on the arrows and processes in Darnton’s diagram, on the currents that make
                the circuit jump.</p>
            <p>In all of this, I am not the hard humanist that Williams was, and my own theoretical
                goal is to work from an ecological theory that acknowledges that objects and animals
                and other unconscious or nonlinguistic beings shape human social relations. The
                expanded definition of "medium" I propose might look something like Williams’s
                definition of "culture." In his exploration of medium in <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title>, Williams does not mention the red gel onto which cells are
                smeared in order to develop a "culture." These cultures cannot survive without the
                medium that sustains them. While the sciences and humanities live far apart in our
                institutions, I don’t think the idea that culture cannot exist without media is
                unimaginably far from what Williams thought. So rather than read Romanticism as an
                event in the history of mediation, as Siskin and Warner might, I think our challenge
                is to produce a fuller account of Romantic media ecology as a dynamic system of use
                and reuse, something close to what Tim Ingold has termed an "ecology of materials,"
                but one that holds what Williams insists upon as the "cultural practice" of making
                and remaking—not the thing itself and not the reified event—in constant focus.</p>
            <p>The institutions where most of this theorizing has taken place have their own complex
                and problematic histories. I began this essay by recounting my own alienated
                position in graduate school. <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> offered a
                way to understand myself in solidarity with workers doing kinds of labor with which
                I was more familiar. We all know, however, that we do not have to look to theory to
                find evidence of labor exploitation in our workplaces. English departments have a
                dubious history of shunting off "service" courses as piecework to low-paid,
                untenured—and in many cases, untenurable—instructors (Bousquet). In the United
                States, doctoral students are paid around $15,000 per year (AAUP 28). The average
                lecturer salary is $56,712 (AAUP 1). Salaries for those of us in the humanities
                often fall below that average. Between 1975 and 2013, contingent, part-time teaching
                jobs grew by 300% (AAUP 28). According to a recent survey by TIAA, adjuncts continue
                to make around $3,000 per course, but they are older and more content to stay in
                their positions than in the past (Yakoboski 8). Given that TIAA’s sample was only
                502 individuals when adjuncts make up over half the ranks of teaching faculty, we
                have grounds to question their findings. In September of 2013, Mary Vojtke, an
                adjunct at Duquesne University for 25 years, died in penury after she had been
                dismissed because, at 83, she was "no longer an effective instructor" (Kovalik). I
                know from my own experience that universities don’t like to offer adjuncts more than
                two classes per semester, because three classes makes the worker full time and
                therefore the institution is required to offer health and retirement benefits.
                Vojtke, who suffered from cancer, was teaching only one class per semester when she
                was dismissed (Kovalik). Her story sparked a nationwide discussion about unethical
                contingent labor practices in institutions of higher education. Dr. Thea K. Hunter,
                adjunct and historian of transatlantic law in our period, nevertheless died without
                health insurance of complications from asthma in December of 2018.</p>
            <p>Thinking with Williams and with Marx, those of us who are on the tenure track should
                feel solidarity with these workers, who join us in the practices of cultural
                production. But what of our university administrators? Are they not the bosses,
                complicit with the corporatized institution that values little past its own prestige
                and the salaries that come with it? Naturally an ecology that binds us to the labors
                of the writers of our software and the millers of our paper must also bind us to the
                labors of the administration of our cultural institutions, however corporate they
                may be? The answer is yes. Williams addresses this problem through discussions of
                "intention," which he considers the determining factor of social action 
                (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>). In <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, the discussion
                of hegemony in the chapter by that name begins to address this problem. While
                culture may be a whole way of living, a complex and intertwined structure
                irreducible to base and superstructure, the imposition of dominant structures and
                practices should be understood through modes of "incorporation." In an earlier essay
                he writes:
            <quote>We can only understand an effective and dominant culture if we understand the real
                social process on which it depends: I mean the process of incorporation. The modes
                of incorporation are of great social significance, and incidentally in our kind of
                society have considerable economic significance. The educational institutions are
                usually the main agencies of the transmission of an effective dominant culture, and
                this is now a major economic as well as cultural activity; indeed it is both in the
                same moment. Moreover, at a philosophical level, at the true level of theory and at
                the level of the history of various practices, there is a process which I call
                the selective tradition: that which, within the terms of an effective dominant
                culture, is always passed off as "the tradition," "the significant past." 
                (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>)</quote>
               Cultural work, then, the replication of "the" tradition, is certainly labor,
                performed by workers who maintain the university’s ties to society as a whole.
                Williams argues in the same passage:
            <quote>Even more crucially, some of these meanings and practices are reinterpreted, diluted,
                or put into forms which support or at least do not contradict other elements within
                the effective dominant culture. The processes of education; the processes of a much
                wider social training within institutions like the family; the practical definitions
                and organisation of work; the selective tradition at an intellectual and theoretical
                level: all these forces are involved in a continual making and remaking of an
                effective dominant culture, and on them, as experienced, as built into our living,
                its reality depends. If what we learn there were merely an imposed ideology, or if
                it were only the isolable meanings and practices of the ruling class, or of a
                section of the ruling class, which gets imposed on others, occupying merely the top
                of our minds, it would be—and one would be glad—a very much easier thing to
                overthrow. (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>)</quote>
              This passage, though long, very much helps us to see how Williams understands the
              stakes of the "Hegemony" chapter in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>.
                Hegemony is "our lived systems of meanings of values": <emph>we</emph> are
                the instruments of the selective tradition, as is Williams himself, so long as we
                continue to construct and support a canon based on authors (110).
                <emph>Our</emph> administrators ensure the agencies
                of the institution continue apace, with all its ongoing struggles between varying
                political factions. The communication circuit we insist on propagating in the name
                of tradition means that the author is always the sovereign god of a textual world we
                can only interpret.</p>
            <p>Intersectional book history, as Emily Friedman has named it, is a sin against the
                author, but it is certainly not a sin against the word.<note place="foot"

                shows us a path whereby the two can be separated.
                If language is practical consciousness, we are joined in our labors—and in our
                work—to everyone who makes our words visible across time and distance. For a long
                time, the work making words into text has been a global enterprise. For anyone
                considering teaching <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, I urge you to
                help your students think through the importance of this work of resistance in its
                moment and in our own. My teachers seemed to grasp this instinctively, but I
                required selected readings from Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser to understand the
                importance of Williams’s claims.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am grateful to 
                    Marian Aguiar, who wrote the syllabus and assigned the readings that helped me 
                    contextualize <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>.</note> While
                cultural studies <emph>per se</emph> may feel passé, decolonization and
                considerations regarding climate change are felt not only by ourselves and our
                students, but by our administrators, who are finally recognizing that a lack of
                diversity in enrollments is as much a detriment to their cultural capital as climate
                change is to their economic capital.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As evidence, 
                    see how universities use the <title level="j">US News and World Report</title> 
                    Diversity Index.</note> I recognize that Williams—or Marx for that matter—is
                not the answer to all of our problems. But for me, Williams presented a way forward,
                and for that I am grateful.</p>
