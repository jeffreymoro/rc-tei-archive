               <head>About this Volume</head>
               <p rend="noCount">This volume considers the place of Romantic works and the Romantic period itself in
                the work of one of the most important twentieth-century theorists of culture,
                Raymond Williams. Few works have generated as much critical thinking about Romantic
                writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society: 1780–1950</title> (1958), <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title> (1961), or <title level="m">The Country
                    and the City</title> (1973), but, as these essays suggest, many of Williams’s other
                works have a more oblique yet equally powerful relationship to Romanticism’s
                moment. After an introduction that pays particular attention to central concepts
                passed down from Williams like "structure of feeling" and "cultural
                formation," these essays revisit Williams over thirty years after his death to
                reconsider his bearing on particular Romantic authors or broader sociohistorical
                processes in order to ask how his work helps us ask questions about the contemporary
                university and the place of the humanities within it.</p>

               <head>About the Design and Markup</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> This volume was designed and encoded at the University of
                    Colorado, Boulder by Site Manager T. J. McLemore and Technical Editor Dave
                    Rettenmaier at <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial
                    transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further
                    TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text in
                    archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and
                    Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided
                    by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to
                    convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

               <head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is
                    devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
                    investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of
                    Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated
                    domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual
                    terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period
                    and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a
                    vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of
                    today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain
                    with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
                    scholarship.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This volume considers the place of Romantic works and the Romantic 
                    period itself in the work of one of the most important twentieth-century theorists 
                    of culture, Raymond Williams. Few works have generated as much critical thinking about 
                    Romantic writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as <title level="m">Culture and 
                        Society: 1780–1950</title> (1958), <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961), 
                    or <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), but, as these essays 
                    suggest, many of Williams’s other works have a more oblique yet equally powerful 
                    relationship to Romanticism’s moment.  After an introduction that pays particular 
                    attention to central concepts passed down from Williams like "structure of feeling" 
                    and "cultural formation," these essays revisit Williams over thirty years after his 
                    death to reconsider his bearing on particular Romantic authors or broader 
                    sociohistorical processes in order to ask how his work helps us ask questions 
                    about the contemporary university and the place of the humanities within it.</p>

                  <p>Why read Raymond Williams now? This is certainly not the first time this question has
                been asked. Shortly after Williams’s sudden death in 1988, Simon During wondered
                whether that event marked "the end of an era" or "the sign of a beginning set in
                motion by the program, the shifts of emphasis, he urged" (681). Ultimately, we might
                now say that his death was both an end and a beginning. Cultural Studies, whose
                contours, possibilities, and limitations were so much a part of the early debate
                that followed Williams’s death, has now become an established, if not dominant,
                component of literary studies. The wide range of its approaches has meant that
                Williams’s assumptions about culture have pollinated various forms of analysis
                rooted in understandings of culture’s centrality to nation, empire, ecosystem, and
                to identities formed around race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, and
                disability. Most of these approaches, except for class, were met with relative
                silence in his own corpus. But literary and cultural work today remains indebted to
                the quality Williams attributed to Brecht and which applies to his own work as well:
                an unparalleled capacity for "the ‘complex seeing’ of a multivalent and both dynamic
                and uncertain social process" (<title level="m">Politics of Modernism</title> 91).</p>
                  <p>This collection addresses Williams’s long and complex relationship to Romantic works
                and to the Romantic period itself. Few works have generated as much critical
                thinking about Romantic writing’s literary purposes and social meanings as
                <title level="m">Culture and Society: 1780–1950</title> (1958),
                <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961), or <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title> (1973), but many of Williams’s other
                works have spoken to Romanticism’s moment in different keys that our essays explore
                as well. Such reflection comes at a time today when Williams’s methods and legacy
                have come under new critical pressure. From one angle, critics like Joseph North
                have used Williams to stand for the domination over "criticism" by the
                "historical-contextualist" method he is credited (or blamed) for building. From a
                different angle, Williams’s legacy is now said to belong to the party of "critique"
                whose dark materialism appears to negate literature’s pleasures and other affects of
                many kinds.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph North’s lengthy attack in

                            Williams’s fostering of historical-social "scholarship" against the mode
                            of literary "criticism" that North seeks to revive from I. A. Richards
                            (62–68). Rita Felski and others have argued a roughly analogous
                            opposition between new modes of textual reading or literary affect and
                            historical-political interpretation, as in her <title level="m">Limits
                                of Critique</title>.</note>These new vectors of disciplinary
                debate, reasserting divides between the personal and historical, the critical and
                scholarly, are tacitly but unmistakably at issue in the perspectives on Williams’s
                work we present here.</p>
                  <p>The work of Raymond Williams has by no means become dated by, or limited to, the
                moments of its emergence in the 1950s and 60s. In recent years a range of scholars
                have been moving the legacy of Williams in new directions, some surprising or
                unforeseen. Lauren Berlant, for one, uses Williams’s concept of "structure of
                feeling" to construct her materialist version of affect theory, tracking what she
                calls "the becoming historical of the affective event and the improvisation of genre
                amid pervasive uncertainty" (6). Within this process, "affective responses" come "to
                exemplify shared <emph>historical</emph> time" (Berlant 15). Lisa 
                Lowe also uses Williams’s structure of feeling and his related
                framing of dominant, residual, and emergent forms of culture to produce a
                materialist understanding of intimacy, one that pluralizes intimacy to produce what
                she calls a "political economy" of intimacies (Lowe 18). But affect theory is not
                the only way that Williams continues to inflect contemporary work. At the opposite
                end of the spectrum, we might also read his sociology of culture as shaping the
                ambitions of approaches like "cultural analytics" and other computational models
                that aim to show how new digital techniques like network analysis can expand the
                scale and scope of the way we study cultural forms (Dunst).</p>
                  <p>By almost universal agreement, Williams’s writings represent an argument for the
                centrality of "culture" in literary, social, and political analysis, and it is
                around the turn of the nineteenth century, as his accounts repeatedly insist, that
                the Enlightenment idea of culture thickens, as it were, and through variations and
                complications begins to build into itself the contradictions of its development. We
                see this argument emerge initially in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                (1958) and develop through <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961) and
                beyond as Williams distinguishes between two interrelated ideas of culture: first,
                as the development of an achieved social order akin to civilization as presented in
                eighteenth-century universal histories and later challenged by Rousseau and Marx,
                among others; and second, a related but distinct concept of culture found in the
                common rituals of everyday life and what Williams repeatedly calls "a whole way of
                life."</p>

                  <head>I</head>
                  <p>Several of our essays assert, while others imply, an important shift in Williams’s
                career between earlier work like <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, where
                he is grappling with the English moral and formalist criticism in which he had been
                trained, and a later stage typified by works like
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977), where he
                brings to fruition the new theory and methods of cultural materialism. In our
                lead-off essay, "Williams and the Romantic Turn," James Chandler argues that
                Williams’s engagement with Romanticism as a category belongs more clearly to the
                first phase of his career than the second, as both <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> query and challenge
                the Romantic figure of the creative poet galvanizing "imagination" to distance us
                from everyday life, promising access to a "superior reality" instead (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title> 32). Chandler turns his argument on a rich,
                surprising reading one of Williams’s least-cited books,
                <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1966), where the
                dialectical movement of categories like Romanticism, liberalism, and drama form an
                unexpectedly decisive turning point for Romanticism’s place in modern cultural
                history. In what Chandler calls the sociological turn in Williams’ thinking after
                1966, the moment of 1800 would remain an important pivot in the cultural history of
                modernity, but it was now understood as caught up in many movements and modes of
                writing beyond the traditional Romantic canon itself. What should be done, this
                volume asks in turn, with Williams’s several legacies?</p>
                  <p>The essays collected here respond to this challenge in a variety of ways, though all
                reflect on how we should read Romanticism in light of Williams’s early and late
                work. Some, like those of Kevin Gilmartin, Mary Favret, and Brian McGrath, seek to
                open up a reconsideration of Williams through attention to his particular treatment
                of Romantic authors like Jane Austen, William Cobbett, and William Wordsworth.
                Others, like those by Thora Brylowe and Paul Keen, use Williams’s legacy to take
                stock of current conversations on the situation of university study and the place of
                the humanities within it. Meanwhile, Jon Mee’s essay puts into question Williams’s
                way of counterposing "culture" to "industrialism" as a basis for thinking in broader
                terms about the meanings and inflections of materialism, both in its historical
                manifestation in Romantic era intellectual life and in critical methods arising from
                Williams’s work. Some essays make renewed use of Williams’s best-known work, like
                <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> or <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title>, while others turn fresh and vigorous attention to his less
                cited contributions, such as <title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title>, <title level="m">Television</title>, or Williams’s
                slim Past Masters volume, <title level="m">Cobbett</title>. Literary questions—of
                narrative, grammar, style, medium, form—claim central attention in these essays.
                What unites them too is an awareness of the complexity and vitality of Williams’s
                approach to culture and an admiration for his sustained attempts to develop a method
                for studying culture appropriate to its capacity for mobility and change. Building
                from this work, our introduction provides a context for the essays to follow while
                also offering an argument of its own by raising further questions on the
                methodological side of Williams’s <emph>oeuvre</emph>.</p>
                  <p>Williams argued for a concept of "structure of feeling" as early as his 1954
                <title level="m">Preface to Film</title> (cowritten with Michael
                Orrom), and the term appears casually in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                before being developed more seriously as a concept from <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title> onward. The inflections and implications of the term changed
                over time, but Williams consistently used it to capture the dynamic between the
                personal and the historical, the means by which a complex set of relationships
                reveal unexpected correspondences and discontinuities, thus precipitating, as it
                were, distinct elements of contact out of the history "in solution" of a complex
                    whole.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an early extended account of
                        the "structure of feeling" see <title level="m">Long Revolution</title>
                        (67–70), but the phrase originated, as Chandler points out in his essay, in
                        Williams and Orrem’s 1954 <title level="m">Preface 
                            to Film</title>.</note> He argued that it is in the arts of a 
                period that these elements are grasped most
                distinctively. As David Simpson put it in a 1995 essay, "Williams seems to want to
                offer art and literature as the most complex barometer of movement at the
                ideological level, and to propose the structure of feeling as a kind of
                super-sensitive indicator of such movement" (17). Within Romantic studies, the work
                of Kevis Goodman and Mary Favret has done as much as anyone’s to read this
                barometer. They use it to locate, as Goodman puts it in her book on the georgic,
                "that immanent, collective perception of any moment as a seething mix of unsettled
                elements," while reminding us that by "feeling" Williams meant especially the
                "unpleasurable sensations of ‘disturbance, blockage, tension’" (Goodman 3, 70).
                Their work and that of others show that culture and the historical present is always
                on the move, part of a process that must necessarily be grasped historically, though
                it is also pervasive below the threshold of articulation.</p>
                  <p>But there was also a complex evolution in the concept of "structure of feeling" over
                the course of Williams’s career. From its earliest formulations in the 1950s and
                early 60s, Williams found the structure of feeling visible in texts, "at the edge of
                semantic availability" in drama, films, or novels. Whether it was Chekhov’s
                particular structure of feeling in
                <title level="m">Drama from Ibsen to Brecht</title> or Elizabeth
                Gaskell’s version in the industrial novels Williams studied in <title level="m">The
                    Long Revolution</title>, he located a structure of feeling in the works of
                individual writers and the literary conventions they either changed or introduced.
                Meanwhile the social sources of this feeling were inchoate, arising out of what he
                called "deep community," "the culture of a period," or, in his widest formulation,
                the "living result of all the elements in the [social] organization"
                (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title>64–65). What was not
                specified was how exactly the minute particulars of a structure of feeling were
                connecting to the widest social realm.</p>
                  <p>Those ways of thinking about the structure of feeling were significantly altered when
                Williams’s work took a more explicitly sociological turn with <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977) or in his last completed 
                work, <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title> (1981). <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title> devoted several intensive pages to the structure of feeling,
                and here for the first time the idea is pluralized as "<title level="m">structures</title> 
                of feeling" (128–35, our emphasis). The plural changes the
                meaning and scope of the concept in several key directions. There is a telling shift
                from single writers to groups of writers or cultural producers—to what Williams
                began calling in another chapter "cultural formations" (138). While there is the
                same emphasis on "social experiences in solution," the terms of analysis are now far
                more precise. There is a new concreteness to specifying such structures in history
                beyond the individual writer or text, as Williams now speaks of "the complex
                relation of differentiated structures of feeling to differentiated classes" and
                other senses in which structures of feeling gain their affective force from highly
                particularized historical encounters
                (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 134).</p>
                  <p>Williams’s characteristic and unparalleled ability to thicken
                the historical experience of his subjects comes through clearly in Kevin Gilmartin’s
                essay, <title level="a">‘In His Time and in Ours’: Reading Cobbett (and Jane Austen) with Raymond
                Williams.</title> For Gilmartin, Williams offers a properly literary reading of Cobbett’s
                work, one attuned to Cobbett’s style in a manner that shows how historical method
                itself can be understood as a matter of style. More particularly, Cobbett allows
                Williams to reflect on historical process and "unanticipated historical experience."
                Such contingency then becomes, through Williams’s comparison of Cobbett with Jane
                Austen in the <title level="a">Three around Farnham</title> chapter of <title level="m">The Country and
                    the City</title>, an encouragement to think historically about class. In
                Gilmartin’s account, we can see Williams’s earlier emphasis on shared historical
                experience transform into a more sophisticated understanding of the particularities
                of class, the institutional structures of culture, and the historical contingencies
                that make the relationship between class and culture so particular and complex.</p>
                  <p>Mary Favret’s essay, <title level="a">Raymond Williams on Jane Austen, Again,</title>
                 also takes up Williams’s account of Austen from the <title level="a">Three 
                     around Farnham</title> chapter in an effort to grasp the motion and 
                 movement of historical experience. She suggests
                that Williams repeatedly presents Austen as a "static" writer, a subject whose
                contours can be taken as a given, but that the fixity of Williams’s account of
                Austen then sets his analysis of Cobbett and others into motion. Making her case at
                the level of the word, the sentence, the paragraph, and attending even to the look
                of the page in Williams’s published work, Favret registers the acute peculiarities
                of closeness and distance, of scale generally, through her toggling between the
                semantic units of Williams’s writing, especially as they bear on qualities of vision
                and seeing. For Favret, even the page itself in Williams’s work functions as an
                image that needs to be navigated and mapped by the eye. This visual emphasis sets up
                a pivot in Favret’s essay from Williams’s literary analysis in <title level="m">The
                    Country and the City</title> to his theorization of media in works like 
                 <title level="m">Television: Technology and Cultural Form</title>. What happens to
                Austen, Favret asks, when we look at her work through the terms Williams develops
                for new media and focus on motion, temporality, and tempo rather than the visual and
                spatial terms that Williams uses to "fix" Austen in behind her wall? Favret’s
                reading of Austen’s adaptation for screen stands also as a salutary reminder of how
                reading Williams, even against the grain, can produce new perspectives on seemingly
                familiar Romantic texts.</p>

                  <p>In its subtle shifts of meaning as Williams develops the idea of a "structure of
                feeling" across his earlier work to his subsequent reflection on the term’s
                usefulness in the
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> interviews of 1979, we
                can see how the expression evolved from understanding culture as something rooted in
                "experience" to a conception of culture as produced by "practices." "It took me a
                long time," he told his
                <title level="m">New Left Review</title> interviewers, "to find
                the key move to the notion of cultural production as itself material"
                (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 139). First
                fleshed out in his essay <title level="a">Base and Superstructure in 
                    Marxist Cultural Theory</title> (1973), the concept of cultural 
                production permitted an enormous range of materials
                to enter the purview of cultural analysis, from writing to visual and electronic
                media, offering a more theoretical basis for what cultural studies, then still a
                British set of critical practices, was already doing on the ground. Though this
                notion sometimes obscured the place of economic determinations in classical Marxist
                terms, Williams defended "cultural production" as a concept that did not make
                production less important than culture, but more important and pervasive than the
                base/superstructure model could ever allow (<title level="m">Politics and
                    Letters</title> 145). And what he had earlier sometimes attributed to a
                preanalytical category of naïve experience was now to be found in what he called
                "the common character of the respective processes of production" (139).</p>
                  <p>As Brian McGrath notes in his essay, <title level="a">Determination in the Passive 
                 Voice (Wordsworth and Williams),</title> the chapter <title level="a">Determination</title> comes just after the <title level="a">Base
                         and Superstructure</title> chapter in <title level="m">Marxism and 
                             Literature</title> and before Williams’s creative 
                 rethinking of "Productive Forces." McGrath turns from these texts to tarry with 
                 Williams’s <title level="m">Keywords</title> (1976) as his point of
                departure for teasing out the meanings of <emph>determine</emph> in
                Romantic poetry and Marxism alike, putting equal pressure on Romanticism’s
                freedom-seeking lyrical "I" and Marx’s senses of determination by wider forces.
                Citing Williams’s provocative phrase "I am determined not to be determined," McGrath
                follows the paradox into Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Prelude</title> and tracks the
                grammatical pattern the Romantic poet shared with Williams himself, a strategic
                recourse to the passive voice. Here, we might say, the structure of feeling is
                "determined" insofar as it is simultaneously shaping and being shaped, with the
                inflection of both activity and passivity that McGrath draws out in Wordsworth and
                Williams.</p>
                  <p>Many of the implications of "cultural production" are not fleshed out in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, a work of theory, but rather in his
                 counterpart manual on methods in <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title>,
                where Williams asks more pointed questions about the material "means of cultural
                production" and about who produces culture and how. One salient idea impressed on
                him by Lucien Goldmann’s work was that cultural production takes place most
                importantly not at the level of individual writer and his relation to some "abstract
                group," as in mainstream sociology, but rather between "individuals in real and
                collective social relations" (<title level="a">Literature and 
                    Sociology</title> 23). For Williams this came
                to mean thinking about production as carried out by highly particularized groups.
                His expression for these groups—"cultural formations"—has hardly ever been cited in
                this specific sense, in part because each term has so many wider uses that the
                phrase does not indicate how specific and useful it actually is. Such formations
                were not unknown to earlier kinds of literary history: they include "conscious
                movements and tendencies (literary, artistic, philosophical or scientific) which can
                usually be readily discerned after their formative productions" (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 119). But the new conception pushes Williams
                further away from grand synthetic categories like "Romanticism" and closer to
                particular clusters whose members combined shared aesthetic and social aims. He
                gestures briefly in <title level="m">The Sociology of Culture</title> to a Godwin
                circle in the 1790s, a later Shelley formation, the pre-Raphaelites, and the
                Bloomsbury group of the 1920s, but the idea clearly has a far wider potential range
                than these familiar kinds of circles or coteries.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Recent work on coteries, circles, and related groups in the 
                    Romantic age has not generally made use of Williams’s framing of "cultural 
                    formations." A cogent exception is Jeffrey Cox, <title level="m">Poetry and
                                Politics in the Cockney School</title> (60–64).</note> Williams’s 
                 theoretically elaborated reworking of
                such groupings under the heading of "cultural formation" both investigates the
                internal complexities of such groups and maps them onto wider social dynamics.</p>
                  <p>A reconceived idea of such cultural formations appears in Jon Mee’s 
                 essay, <title level="a">Raymond Williams, Industrialism, and Romanticism, 
                     1780–1850.</title> Arguing that Williams’s idea
                of industrialization remained abstract and unexamined, Mee shows how his later
                methods of cultural materialism can be used to locate a far greater complexity in
                the relations between literary production and industrialism. Rather than a
                centralized group working in cities like London, Mee studies the northern English
                writers who formed durable networks through the new literary and philosophical
                societies from Newcastle and York to Manchester and Liverpool, forging what Mee
                calls the "transpennine enlightenment" that led from the Rational Dissenters of the
                1780s to Elizabeth Gaskell and Robert Owen in the 1840s. The methodological gambit
                of his essay is to link Williams’s materialist methods of immanent critique to
                Latour’s tools of network analysis, following the "pattern of recurring links" that
                such writers forged in a particular structure of feeling underlying this English
                "culture of improvement." Beyond urban circles, Mee’s revisionary transpennine
                cultural formation reveals new dimensions possible to follow from Williams’s own
                conception.</p>
                  <p>Locating and studying such cultural formations became Williams’s method for
                confronting what his late work called the "central problem" of literary and cultural
                analysis—how to understand "the specific relationships through which works are made
                and move" ("Uses" 28). In the 1986 essay <title level="a">The Uses of 
                    Cultural Theory,</title> he located theoretical ancestry for posing this 
                question in the "sociological poetics" of Medvedev, Bakhtin, and others 
                who challenged the Russian Formalists in the 1920s.
                Against notions of an abstract intertextuality, Williams cites what he took to be a
                crucial passage from Medvedev: "Works can only enter into real contact as
                inseparable elements of social intercourse . . . It is not works that come into
                contact, but people, who, however, come into contact through the medium of works"
                (qtd. in <title level="a">Uses</title> 29).</p>
                  <p>This relation of works and actors was for Williams the matrix of the cultural
                formation. In these later writings, the terms <emph>collaborative</emph>
                and <emph>collaboration</emph> received increasingly strong emphasis as he
                also pushed harder against the figures of Romantic author, the solitary cultural
                producer, and the enthronement of the modern critic. Impressed at how cogently
                Goldmann’s work was encouraging him to think about cultural production as "an active
                and collaborative critical process," he recalled that his most critically embattled
                book, <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, had been written with "a crucial
                absence of collaboration" (<title level="a">Literature and Sociology</title> 24).</p>
                  <p>Our final two essays draw on Williams’s later work to reflect on collaborative
                processes as they bear on the state of the contemporary academy. For Paul Keen in
                <title level="a">New Maps: Raymond Williams’s Radical Humanism,</title> Williams’s 
                method maps culture in part by consistently resisting the allure of theoretical 
                abstraction in its revision of Marxist theory as Williams emphasizes the 
                concreteness and sense of complexity needed to grasp the contradictory 
                character of Romantic era writing. Keen stresses some of the difficulties in 
                coming to grips with Williams’s skeptical way of "unlearning" past versions of 
                formalism or Marxism, as for instance the extensive previous reading in theory 
                required to grasp the interlaced arguments in <title level="m">Marxism and 
                    Literature</title>. Keen assesses the pertinence of
                relevant work by Edward Said, Timothy Brennan, and Georg Lukacs for thinking about
                Williams’s characteristic way of configuring cultural critique. Granted these
                challenges in reading Williams now, Keen also stresses the value of the
                "unflinchingly dialectical nature of Williams’s work" for the public role of the
                humanities today and the critical tools needed for confronting the digital
                revolution, the crisis of the humanities, and related forms of contemporary
                complexity.</p>
                  <p>In her chapter, <title level="a">Book History and the 
                 Politics of Work and World,</title> Thora Brylowe too
                hopes to show the relevance of Williams for newer methodologies and questions.
                Emphasizing the central concept of labor for making sense of literature itself and
                the academic contexts in which it is studied, Brylowe underscores how Williams can
                help us to elicit the political urgency in newer methodologies like her preferred
                concept of "media ecology." Her essay stresses the collaborative, labor-based
                processes responsible for producing books and other artifacts of culture, the "hands
                and minds who never wrote a word," to demonstrate how abstractions like literature
                are produced in bookstores, libraries, papermills, coal mines, and (today) server
                farms. Brylowe, in other words, uses Williams to ask about the particular people who
                make the media through which words and works are transmitted, as well as to show the
                specific material processes that produce and circulate artifacts that contain
                information, imaginative content, and/or ideas.</p>
                  <p>Cultural formations entailed rich and thoughtful modes of collaboration, but
                Williams’s idea of how their cooperative work clarified the problem of structures of
                feeling remained a work in progress by the time of his death. We want to conclude by
                citing a telling passage from the last chapters of <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title>:
            <quote>Something new happens in the very process of conscious co-operation. . . . But it is
                from just this realization that the second and more difficult sense of a collective
                subject is developed. This goes beyond conscious co-operation—collaboration—to
                effective social relations in which, even while individual projects are being
                pursued, what is being drawn on is trans-individual, not only in the sense of shared
                (initial) forms and experiences, but in the specifically creative sense of new
                responses and formation. This is obviously more difficult to find evidence for, but
                the practical question is whether the alternative hypothesis of categorically
                separate or isolated authors is compatible with the quite evident creation, in
                particular places and at particular times, of specific new forms and structures of
                feeling. (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 195)</quote>
               Passages like this, along with his later work in <title level="m">The Politics of
                    Modernism</title>, show Williams still experimenting with new ways to think through
                the connections between feeling, perception, and social being, and how they might be
                located between cultural producers at work on shared projects and a wider, emergent
                social awareness that is still unformed. It is worth recalling, of course, that his
                idea of cooperation was informed by a long socialist tradition of regarding
                cooperation in the labor process as vital to any creative overcoming of exploited
                labor, a meaning sometimes lost in more facile thinking about collaborative work
                today. We might also take Williams’ term "trans-individual" in another sense not
                available to Williams in his time, since the word evokes a notion of interpersonal
                networks in ways that earlier terms like collective consciousness may not. All these
                questions arise in Williams’s work at a time when Romantic-period scholars are
                searching for conceptions of cooperative authorship, constructive social networks,
                and other forms and interconnective means of producing cultural projects, whether
                literary ones at the turn of the nineteenth century, or scholarly ones in the early
                twenty-first. The essays in this collection speak with imagination and power as well
                as with different minds about such matters; we think they will be immensely
                suggestive about ways to think with the work of Raymond Williams once again now.</p>

                  <p>This essay is a work of gratitude, as I think it is safe to say that reading Raymond
                Williams’s <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> changed my life. I spent
                most of my 20s as contingent academic labor. When I had finally had enough, I left
                my role as family caretaker to pursue a PhD in Literary and Cultural Studies in
                Pittsburgh, a city built on coal and hot metal. I was painfully aware of my
                shortcomings: I had an undergraduate degree from a small public college. I had a
                terminal MA that I’d earned one course at a time. I was
                older than anyone in my cohort, having spent much of my early adulthood motherless
                and caring for my grandparent and siblings. I was pregnant with my second child. My
                working-class spouse opted to stay home with our children rather than devote a full
                salary to childcare. More than once I wondered what I was doing back in school: I
                felt guilt over the life I had left and alienation from the one I was heading
                toward. In my darkest moments, I felt I was a tool of the Ideological State
                Apparatus, a low middle manager of cultural capital. Before I left home for a PhD, I
                had been cobbling together a health-insuranceless living, trying to make ends meet
                by teaching four or five composition classes per semester, at times teaching at a
                for-profit business school and at others working in a writing center. Now I was on
                the knowledge-production side of things. How could I reconcile this past and future?</p>
                  <p>In this essay, I explain how <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> inflected
                my understanding of the work we do in general and my own work at the intersection of
                Romanticism and book history in particular. One goal of this essay is to show those
                readers coming to <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> for the first time
                what its stakes were in its time and how it might be applied now, both as a way to
                think about the Romantic period—which encompasses the emergence of political
                economy—and as a way to consider our own situation, in and beyond the institutions
                of higher learning that employ us. Hands and minds who never wrote a word are as
                essential to the production and reception of literature as all our writers and
                critics, and those people deserve a space in our theoretical consideration of
                literary works and their reception. By considering literature from this wider
                angle—by taking academic research, teaching, bookstores, libraries, papermills,
                coltan mines, and server farms into account as institutions and infrastructures
                without which we could not have (or study) literature—I want to show how a "media
                ecology" that necessarily includes the work of backs and hands long dead as well as
                those now living is commensurate with Williams’s thinking. I begin by explaining the
                stakes of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> on its own terms and then
                move into its usefulness beyond literature <emph>per se</emph>, into the
                constellation of interests we once called "book history" and now call variously
                "print culture studies," "old media studies," "media ecology," and a raft of other
                terms that indicate an interest in the material processes that make and circulate
                artifacts that contain information, imaginative content, and/or ideas.</p>
                  <p>In the 1990s, book history was emerging in English departments as a discrete field of
                study. It was both topic and technique, which in turn drew on an array of
                interdisciplinary methods and histories. Its canon included bibliographers, both old
                and new; students read Fredson Bowers beside D. F. Mackenzie. It also included works
                from the <title level="m">Annales</title> school, works of historicist literary
                criticism, structuralist linguistics, and media theory. Once I explain how
                Williams’s thinking is at the center of my own book-historical research and teaching
                praxis, I briefly consider the emergence of adjunctification in higher education, a
                condition of labor that underwrites budgetary shortcomings in many institutions. The
                essay ends with some reflections on the current state of the field and, perhaps
                predictably, an encouraging word to those who might consider teaching <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. Ultimately, I want to urge solidarity
                between workers alive and dead in the interest of decolonizing our classrooms and
                scholarship and acknowledging that media ecology and the ecology of the planet we
                inhabit are deeply entangled. Knowledge production often <emph>feels</emph>
                solitary. But my work on the history of particular English books could not be done
                were it not for the work of ragpickers and assembly workers, leather tanners and
                adjunct professors. Williams does not go this far. But in reading <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> today, given the urgencies of climate 
                change and the slow violence enacted on workers across the Global South, I think it 
                is a text worth revisiting with an expanded understanding of the media ecology of 
                literature (Nixon).</p>
                  <p>Many new readers find <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> difficult going.
                Williams is writing against a dominant form of Marxism that has aligned itself with
                structuralist thinking, but since he does not name names or explicitly say that his
                targets are both the New Criticism and especially structuralism (which he considers
                its legacy) the stakes can be difficult for an uninitiated reader to understand (<title level="m">Interviews</title> 335). Williams would later describe his main
                target as "the eruption of a mode of idealist literary study claiming the authority
                of Marxism and the prestige of association with powerful intellectual movements in
                many other fields" (<title level="m">Interviews</title> 340). Even this explanation is
                slippery, but it refers to descriptions of base and superstructure, taken up by
                Louis Althusser and others, as the factors determining social relations. Earlier in
                his writings, Williams had cast doubt on the very language of determination, which
                he argued "is of great linguistic and real complexity. The language of determination
                and even more of determinism was inherited from idealist and especially theological
                accounts of the world and man" ("Base and Superstructure"). In <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, he targets the reduction of what he understands to
                be complex <emph>processes</emph> to objectified <emph>structures</emph>. This way 
                 of thinking helps us understand culture in analog to
                our environment. Just as water (or PCB) cycles through earth and air, so too do the
                materials that carry ideas move across material forms and institutions. Of interest
                to Williams is the <emph>labor</emph> that moves literature and culture
                across time and distance—and crucially, he argues that the <emph>idea
                    itself</emph> is material.</p>
                  <p>Initiated readers will know that Williams grounds his objection to structure 
                 in <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>, written by Marx and Engels in
                 1846, in which they take up the division of mental from physical labor. The real 
                 object of criticism, though, is a particular brand of 20th-century Marxist criticism 
                 he dismisses as "a mode of idealist literary study." The relevant
                passage is as follows:
            <quote>From the start the "spirit" is afflicted with the curse of being "burdened" with
                matter, which here makes its appearance in the form of agitated layers of air,
                sounds, in short, of language. Language is as old as consciousness, language 
                <emph>is</emph> practical consciousness that exists also for other men,
                and for that reason alone it really exists for me personally as well; language, like
                consciousness, only arises from need, the necessity, of intercourse with other
                men. . . . Consciousness is therefore a social product. (Marx 158)</quote>
                Having established that consciousness is a social product and therefore of the
                material realm, Marx and Engels argue that divisions of labor stem from the
                misguided division of mental from physical labor, after which<quote>
                consciousness can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness
                of existing practice, that it really represents something without representing
                something real; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from
                the world and to proceed to the foundation of "pure" theory. (159)</quote>
                The perceived split between the ideal and the material, Marx and Engels argue, is at
                the root of German ideology—but for them, "Life is not determined by consciousness,
                but consciousness is determined by life" (155). As Brian McGrath’s contribution to
                this volume shows, English translation poses more problems than German when it comes
                to the language of determinism, and Williams is acutely aware of problems both with
                the double meaning of "determined" (as in "I am determined not to be determined")
                and of the difficulty in getting determinism right.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Brian McGrath’s essay <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.mcgrath.html">

                  </p>
                  <p>For Williams, to split social relations into base and superstructure is to repeat the
                misguided reasoning refuted in <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>. Williams,
                in thinking about his profession, explains that in separating civilization from
                culture, structuralist Marxism had relegated both language <emph>and</emph> 
                literature to a superstructure that merely "reflects" a base of "real"
                or "true" social relations (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 19). In an earlier essay,
                Williams writes that the definition of "base"
            <quote>has narrowed remarkably, and in a cultural context very damagingly, from [Marx’s]
                more central notion of <emph>productive forces</emph>, in which, to give
                just brief reminders, the most important thing a worker ever produces is himself,
                himself in the fact of that kind of labour, or the broader historical emphasis of
                men producing themselves, themselves and their history. Now when we talk of the
                base, and of primary productive forces, it matters very much whether we are
                referring . . . to primary production within the terms of capitalist economic
                relationships, or to the primary production of society itself, and of men
                themselves, material production and reproduction of real life. If we have the broad
                sense of productive forces, we look at the whole question of the base differently,
                and we are then less tempted to dismiss as superstructural, and in that sense as
                merely secondary, certain vital productive social forces, which are in the broad
                sense, from the beginning, basic. (<title level="a">Base and 
                    Superstructure</title>)</quote>
               Taken with McGrath’s discussion of determinism, this passage makes clear the stakes
                of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. If the base determines social
                relations, it necessarily includes cultural production, for "language is practical
                consciousness." Language, of course, includes literature.</p>
                  <p>While <title level="m">The German Ideology</title> does not use the words "base" or
                 "superstructure," the introduction to the much later <title level="m">A
                    Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</title> (1857) does. Williams
                shows that Marx seems to contradict himself in his use of the term "superstructure,"
                suggesting it is a <emph>concept</emph> in the introduction but describing
                it as a <emph>process</emph> elsewhere (<title level="m">Marxism </title>19). 
                 Nonetheless, structuralist Marxism took up the base-and-superstructure 
                 model in order to look at the capitalist system synchronically—that is to say, 
                 to look at it <emph>as a structure</emph>. In this model, while the base (or means 
                 of production) ultimately plays a determining role, it is controlled by a ruling 
                 ideology. The "superstructure," then, consists of the state (which has the power to 
                 oppress through repressive violence) and a collection of institutions that function as what
                Althusser calls the "Ideological State Apparatus." Unlike the "Repressive State
                Apparatus," which consists of the ruling political regime, the ISA is considerably
                varied and consists of schools, churches, families, sports, media outlets, trade
                unions, and so on. In creating this distinction, Althusser is able to argue,
                following <title level="m">The German Ideology</title>, that "ideology has no
                history." I will return to ideology and history, but before I do, I want to point
                out that the ethical stakes here for Williams—and for us—are high. Thinking of
                ourselves as the long arm of the ISA could only mean that we are complicit in
                capitalist repression. But are we by virtue of the institutions that employ us
                instruments of their ideology? Is an adjunct making $3,000 per course with no hope
                of health insurance complicit in repression?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps yes, although the 2019 story in <title level="j">The Atlantic</title> about the
                death of Thea Hunter, an African American adjunct, should make us wonder (Harris).
                Economic and social circumstances are different for all of us, and I am certainly
                complicit inasmuch as I am on the tenure track now—but even so, blaming ourselves
                for reinscribing the ideology of capitalism, I have learned, is not a very
                productive way to think. I am sure I was not the first graduate student to be
                crushed by the dissonant awareness of my role as a force of the superstructure on
                the one hand and that a faculty dinner cost over half my monthly wages on the other.
                 <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, however, steers its readers away
                from an analysis of structure and toward one of <emph>process</emph>—in
                other words, away from the synchronic and toward the diachronic, away from ideology
                and toward history. Its recuperative move, to return to <title level="m">The German
                    Ideology</title>, lies in the assertion that "language is practical consciousness."
                In the chapter titled <title level="a">Language,</title>
                     <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title> elaborates a theory of language as <emph>activity</emph>. 
                The sign is not a fixed object, and language is not to be read synchronically. To fix 
                the sign either in its form or content is "a radical denial of active practical
                consciousness" (39). Williams argues that despite certain surface affinities between
                Marxism and Saussurian linguistics, which "repeats an important and often general
                pattern within Marxism itself, over a range from comparative analysis and
                classification of stages of a society, through the discovery of certain fundamental
                laws of change within these systematic stages, to the assertion of a controlling
                social system which is a priori inaccessible to ‘individual’ acts of will and
                intelligence," the analogy does not hold. He shows Marxism and structuralist
                linguistics to be opposed on the grounds that structuralism reifies history into "an
                ‘always given’ language system" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 28, 37). Williams 
                prefers to see language as inseparable from the social, as "living evidence of a 
                continual social process, into which individuals are born and within which they 
                are shaped, but to which they then actively contribute, in a continuing process"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 37). Unlike Althusser’s
                last-instance determinism, then, Williams’s analysis of language-as-process
                reconciles language (as practical consciousness) to thought and thought to history
                and to work. This is the book’s most important contribution to literary studies. It
                means that language, constitutive to humans across time and context, unites us in
                our labors. As a worker and as a researcher in English literature, this assertion of
                unification and solidarity with other kinds of workers has helped me find my
                way.</p>

                    as</emph> the Foxconn employees who assemble our computers, are all workers, and
                we are all part of the process of cultural production. Williams’s overlapping
                definitions of "labor," "work," and "job" in his 1976 <title level="m">Keywords</title> 
                illuminate his understanding of language and moreover help to
                show how the historical period that encompasses Romanticism is implicated in the
                shifts in social relations that necessitate Marxist criticism in the first place.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In this section, I am summarizing from <title level="a">Labour,</title> pp. 176–79, and <title level="a">Work,</title> pp.
                    334–37, in <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and
                                Society</title>.</note> Labor, like culture, has linguistic
                roots planted deeply in a field. "To labor" meant "to plough or plant," and a
                laborer was one who lived by his hands. Labor as a noun meant to work, but also "to
                suffer," as one struggling under a burden might do. Williams explains that except
                for the labors of childbirth, the term underwent a transition in the eighteenth
                century such that by the time Adam Smith was writing <title level="m">The Wealth of
                    Nations</title> (1776) it was an abstract term in the language of political
                economy. At the same time, the term "work" underwent a shift from its original
                definition to one that particularly emphasizes paid employment. As labor was
                abstracted from suffering bodies in order for it to be bought and sold, so work
                became the activity associated with that abstracted form of toil. Finally, in the
                context of capitalist social relations, the word "job" described not the temporary
                and finite tasks associated with "jobbing" but the position we occupy as paid
                laborers in our work. The Romantic period, then, marks our identification with other
                paid workers who have a job whereby they sell their labor.</p>
                  <p>Not only is a transition in social relations marked by these terms, but, crucially,
                Williams’s description of that transition shows how <emph>language
                    itself</emph> is a product of historical and social <emph>process</emph>. These 
                words (like language more broadly) are both a distinct social
                product and are part of the process by which history is produced. Linguistic signs
                cannot be separated from the history they create or the history they carry. The
                implicit criticism of structuralist linguistics, which describes language as an
                arbitrary and <emph>a priori</emph> system accessed by individual
                speakers, is clear. Williams writes of the <title level="m">Keywords</title> project
                that "language is a continuous social production in its most dynamic sense. In other
                words, not in the sense which is compatible with structuralism—that a central body
                of meaning is created and propagated, but in the sense that like any other social
                production it is the arena of all sorts of shifts and interests and relations of
                dominance" (<title level="m">Interviews</title> 176). These keywords both mark and
                make historical contradictions and conflict. It just so happens that a shift in the
                meaning of work happened in the Romantic period—a period when British cultural
                practices were being professionalized into actual jobs that people 
                worked.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Jon Klancher’s

                  <p>To be sure, Williams was not thinking of media ecology in the way that I propose is
                so urgently needed. His threefold critique of Marxist cultural theory, structuralist
                linguistics, and literary theory does not address the nonintellectual labor involved
                in producing material media. Moreover, he did not invent the critique. In 1977, when
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> was published, the "communication
                circuit" had already migrated from structuralist linguistics to cultural studies.
                Saussure had visualized communication as a pair of line-drawn heads, labeled A and
                B, exchanging messages via mouths, ears, and brains (Figure 1).

                demonstrated that media, discourse, and social practice produce and constitute each
                other through a "passage of forms," replaced Saussure’s heads with "structures of
                meaning" without which discourse could not work.

                     </figure>More important for the development of media ecology was Robert

                     </figure>Instead of the <emph>concepts</emph> of
                "infrastructure" and "relations of production" that Hall had offered, Darnton’s
                circuit included people and things: booksellers, pirates, pressmen, trees, and
                sheep. I argue that imposing Williams’s reading of Marx onto Darnton’s circuit, via
                Hall, makes the communication circuit diagram into a diagram about work: about their
                work and ours, about Jane Austen’s work and the pressman’s work, about the lowest
                paid papermill laborer, the enslaved cotton gin operator, the tree feller—without
                whom our profession, with its own oversimplified circuit of author/text/reader,
                would be unsustainable. Put another way, <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> holds together the "book-historical" and literary past, the
                ongoing ideology of our profession, and the corporatized present of our labor
                market. The book that saved me from the dark suspicion that I was becoming part of
                the ISA did so because it offers a path to a theory that binds us through language:
                engravers and printers—and professors and university
                administrators—are <emph>joined by our labors</emph>
                in the work of cultural production. We are all, to use Williams’s term, "basic."</p>
                  <p>For many of us, research and knowledge production constitute at least part of our
                paid work. Certainly time in the archive is both mental and physical work. Working
                on big books, I quickly learned, means hefting them on and off library carts,
                standing to turn pages, see pictures, or take photos, and sitting to read, type, and
                take notes. Reading small typeface in low light means eye strain; sitting and
                writing for hours cripples our backs and wrists. For some, research means entering
                unairconditioned government buildings, sometimes under unsafe conditions, looking at
                papers that are crumbling to pulp or dust. For some, it means "reading" a landscape
                rife with the remnants of war and colonial violence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Shalini Puri’s work, most notably <title level="m">The Grenada Revolution in the Caribbean Present: Operation 
                        Urgent Memory</title>.</note> Getting credentials, negotiating our institutions, 
                traveling, reading, and
                assembling arguments—these things are also part of my paid job. Dwindling research
                money means a trip to the archive is not to be wasted: many of us sit from open to
                close, peering into foam-cradled codices or through transparent plastic at
                centuries-old ink. The reading room requires the stamina of a scrivener. And like
                illuminating manuscripts or setting type or binding codices, it also requires
                professional training unavailable to the average reader. It seems reasonable to
                think that a print history that is attentive to the labor of making books, paper,
                and ink might also be attentive to the work of reading and preserving them. A
                politics of the archive should include the makers (however willing or unwilling),
                the encoders and the decoders alike. These makers of media may not have "worked" a
                "job," but they certainly <emph>labored</emph>—like we all do—with hands
                and minds and backs.</p>
                  <p>In the field of literature, we have our own version of Saussure’s
                communication-circuit heads. In the classroom, I draw stick figures to demonstrate
                the poststructuralist idea that authorship isn’t any more real than any other shared
                belief. In my chalkboard cartoon, it’s 2020, and I am reading <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>. I am riveted as Catherine Moreland discovers a secreted
                laundry list. On the other end of the chalkboard, it’s 1799 and Jane Austen is
                writing. Between us, in an idea bubble, is the scene from the novel. In the most
                basic model of the literary communication circuit, we share the experience of events
                unfolding in text, a text an author wrote some time in the past and a reader now
                reads. In the cartoon (and in the ideology we live by) we share Catherine’s world
                    <emph>as text</emph>, no matter which physical iteration we hold in
                our hands, read with our eyes or fingers, or hear with our ears. The physical thing
                is merely a conduit—or a window for Roland Barthes—that allows us access to that
                shared, nonphysical thing that is the text.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, Barthes, <title level="m">S/Z</title>, and
                            Richard Lanham, pp. 4–18.</note> But this shared belief
                requires us to agree to ignore the labor that brought us the thing we hold, often a
                Penguin Classics or a Norton Critical or a Broadview edition—or nowadays as often as
                not a laptop screen with the free version on Google books, a Kindle, or even a
                phone. And it’s not just the editors or the publishers we ignore in this
                author-text-reader formula. Or even the manufacturers who made the paper and printed
                the book. Modern editions are edited and laid out on a computer. What about the
                workers who made that computer or designed the software? If we read on a tablet, the
                ideology of authorship allows us to think past the labor of the factory workers who
                built the device, for pitiful wages, often at terrible physical and mental cost. As
                Romanticists we are conditioned to think of the contingencies of <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>'s vexed publication history. As a book historian, I also
                think about the arms and backs that pressed early editions, and the makers of the
                paper it was printed on, the mixers of ink. The ideology represented in my stick
                figures—the ideology of authorship that my profession is founded on—obfuscates this
                labor in favor of a model of <emph>textual</emph> transmission, where <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> travels from mind to mind to mind without
                regard for how it got in there.</p>
                  <p>In this volume, Mary Favret reads Williams reading Austen. In her reckoning, Austen
                is for Williams a stable entity against which to produce and describe social change.
                In revealing this important blind spot in Williams’s writing, Favret helps me to
                articulate other shortcomings, including the valorization of a canon we might like
                to see modified, or even abandoned. In proposing we read <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title> now, I do not mean to say that Williams has everything
                right. As John Guillory points out, Williams is suspicious of the very process he
                addresses in the <title level="a">From Reflection to Mediation</title> chapter 
                of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>. For Williams, 
                <emph>mediation</emph> is always in danger of collapsing into reified 
                <emph>media</emph>. In <title level="a">Genesis of the Media Concept,</title> 
                Guillory usefully distinguishes between the "media concept" (itself
                a product of contradiction) and the genesis of the "concept of mediation, which
                names a process rather than an object" (342). As Guillory explains it, 
                <emph>media</emph>, a material form, is historically rooted in a
                seventeenth-century philosophical contradiction, which is borne out philologically:
                material <emph>words</emph> are a medium for immaterial thought in one
                formulation; in the other, technological media are a medium for speech (358). 
                <title level="m">Mediation</title>, however, has a different and altogether more
                recent genesis. The process we call mediation, Guillory argues, was initially
                connected to communication theory by Charles Sanders Peirce, whose semiotic theory
                provided a "new framework . . . which encloses all forms of media" under the rubric
                of communication—or, in an even more ideologically charged formulation, the rubric
                of <emph>information</emph> (347). Over the next century, social and
                cultural relations of all kinds were subsumed under a new totalizing regime. At the
                same time, "mediation," now freighted with semiotics-as-information on the one hand
                and increasing "media saturation" on the other, came only to mean "the process of
                transferring information."<note place="foot" resp="editors">I briefly summarize here 
                    what Guillory carefully lays out on pp. 348–53. The term "media saturation" is 
                    defined in the introduction to the Multigraph Collective’s <title level="m">Interacting with Print</title>.</note> Guillory explains
                Williams’s suspicion by demonstrating its relatedness to representation, which like
                "reflection" is subject to the very ideology critique <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> works to undo (Guillory 356, 356n58).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Note that Guillory draws our attention especially to p. 99 
                        of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, but he also quotes "Means of

                            in Material Culture</title>, which was published in 1982,
                            implying that Williams’s position on mediation may have become more
                            entrenched over time.</note>

                  <p>Williams, of course, was not a book historian, so his concerns in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> have more to do with the work of writing 
                 than the work of making the constituent materials of textual transmission.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Williams does at times address media. Notably, the institutions of 
                     printing are crucial to his analysis in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>
                            (1961).</note> Its third chapter defines literature. Against
                formalist definitions of literature that reduce literature to ideology, Williams
                offers us history. He shows how literature’s definition shifted from one that
                emphasized general print literacy to, in the eighteenth century, a canon of
                imaginative works that a discerning judge could recognize. As such, this emergent
                form of literature <emph>required</emph> a critical apparatus capable of
                declaring its value. Criticism filled this need. In the last section of the book,
                devoted to literary criticism, Williams writes against the cordoning off of specific
                "aesthetic" forms of writing, and he joins its reception with its making, both of
                which "are connecting material processes within a social system of the use and
                transformation of material (including language) by material means"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 152). While the move is to
                level literature, the author nonetheless occupies the privileged position.</p>
                  <p>Unlike Williams, I feel more optimistic regarding the potential that might be enacted
                in the concept of mediation. Rather than worry about the dangers of vulgar
                reflection theory on the one hand or technological determinism on the other, I think
                in wedding media theory to our new attention to ecological processes, media ecology
                could level literary studies further, and in the process to decenter the author,
                itself an invention solidified in Romantic period, by "Romantic" poets.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See especially Michael Gamer, <title level="m">Romanticism,
                                Self-Canonization, and the Business of Poetry</title>.</note> In 
                using Williams to reconcile the labor of writing and the materiality of language
                to the work of <emph>making media itself</emph>—that is, the production of
                paper, ink, printed materials, bindings, and so on—we allow ourselves the
                opportunity to study a new canon of cultural makers, including enslaved Africans,
                workhouse children, indigenous growers, and others whose labor has been sold into
                the making of media. Returning to Darnton, it is important to note that the workers
                in a circuit that mediates thought into books may be joined in their labors, but
                they are hardly made equal by this joining. Our highly specialized and
                professionalized work looks nothing like labors of the men and women who assemble
                our computers. Rather than a circuit, Darnton’s diagram could be replaced with a
                web—or an enmeshed, messy conglomeration of constantly changing relationships that
                is and has been, since before the eighteenth century, subject to the ebbs and flows
                of global capital. While it doesn’t make for neat diagramming, it does help us feel
                the community of which we are part.</p>
                  <p>Williams constantly replaces static structures with the dynamic complexity and
                multiplicity of actions and relationships. He is, however, a product of a particular
                history. In bringing <emph>our</emph> histories to his writings, <emph>we</emph> can 
                build an inclusive media ecology. The sheer
                perniciousness of the ideology of authorship makes efforts at both expansion of the
                circuitry and efforts at decolonization equally difficult. On the one hand,
                declaring the author dead these days is an ironic gesture, a way of gesturing toward
                the absurdity of the ivory tower, a way of saying students of literature and
                critical theory are out of touch with everyone else’s reality. On the other, we
                suffer from a dearth of "authorized voices" issuing from people of color in the
                Romantic period, as Rebecca Schneider has shown. Of course the author is alive and
                well; an astonishing collection of new-to-the-canon authors populate our course
                offerings and anthologies, and without a doubt their writings enrich our
                understanding of the complexity and diversity—and the sufferings—of history. We all
                write and publish, furthermore, and thus we ourselves are authors, even if we write
                about collectors or librarians or publishers or pressmen or ragpickers or
                plantations or suicide nets, all of which had a place in making words from a pen in
                1799 readable on a screen in 2019.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I refer to the 
                    Foxcon suicide scandal, which broke in 2010 but continues to crop up in the news.

                     </note> With or without the author, 
                recent efforts by the Bigger Six Collective and the new
                Race and Empire Caucus at NASSR speak to the urgency of decolonizing efforts.
                Despite declarations that cultural studies or working-class studies are finished,
                done in by the wave of identitarian recovery projects that came along with
                postmodern fragmentation, I want to suggest that in looking past the author into a
                wider media ecology that is both based in and moves beyond Williams’s cultural
                theory, we might find alternate routes to decolonizing literature.</p>
                  <p>In the past, efforts at extirpating the author have come from above. In the
                poststructuralist moment, French theory tried to kill the author. The Romantic
                period offers another example of its attempted murder. Writings by our colleagues on
                British bibliomaniacs like Thomas Frognall Dibdin suggest that in our period,
                against Wordsworth’s assertion regarding the professional poet with all his
                specialized capacities, another path was possible. If the bibliomaniacs had had
                their way, perhaps our literature classes would be organized around collectors and
                collections rather than authors. Romantic-era bibliomaniacs were perverse, as Deidre
                Lynch argues, precisely because their habits ran counter to the sensibilities of a
                national reading culture; they could and did wield aristocratic power and wealth
                over the defenseless library in way that charmed even as it repulsed. But the
                formation of authorship in the eighteenth century—a powerful cultural construction
                built from raw materials like celebrity culture, editorial intervention, legal
                changes in copyright, and stabilizing print conventions—was able to resist the
                deadly charms of these hypermasculine collectors. It doesn’t seem to be going
                anywhere anytime soon. Authorship is like Mark Twain that way. Rumors of its death
                were greatly exaggerated.</p>
                  <p>Rather to declare the author dead, then, we might resurrect the other workers who
                make figures like Jane Austen <emph>and</emph> Raymond Williams possible.
                As important as it is to recover and circulate the writings of people marginalized
                by history, Williams’s focus on mediation and labor also allows us to think past the
                author "function" to its <emph>making</emph>, which is the explicit <emph>job</emph> 
                of editors, compositors, printers, and so on. Darnton’s
                circuit proves that from the outset, book history valued the artisanal labor of men
                in printshops, papermills, and binderies. Studies of book history and print culture
                nearly always privilege artisanal or professionalized labor over the unskilled
                workers whose efforts are every bit as important to the final material products we
                read and examine. Instead of looking at the singular and exceptional author, or the
                professionalized (mostly) white men who set type or operated printing presses, I
                propose we acknowledge the unskilled labor just as necessary to the literature we
                read—the work of little boys and girls in Manchester, unpaid "apprentices" whose
                hands worked machines that made the cotton cloth that eventually became rags in the
                papermill; the enslaved fieldhands whose liberty and labor were stolen to pick the
                same cotton; the women sorting and cutting soiled rags. Williams acknowledges that
                the language of labor and work shift during the Romantic period. Perhaps it is time
                for another change that acknowledges a shift away from the long Romanticism that has
                ushered in climate crisis.</p>
                  <p>In the chapter <title level="a">From Medium to Social Practice</title>, Williams 
                again objects to the term "medium" as it has been applied to language. 
                The objectification of language into a
                series of things we access and arrange can lead, Williams argues, to a different
                kind of hard determinism. Base and superstructure, McLuhan’s sense that the medium
                    <emph>is</emph> the message—that medium determines what is within the
                possible for communication—is also objectionable because it gives our human agency
                over to a system or thing. As I’ve written elsewhere, I credit the Multigraph
                Collective with helping me to think about the constituent materials of print culture
                and for teaching me to use the term "media ecology" as a frame to consider medium
                and material as interactive and dynamic constituents of print culture. Add to this
                Williams’s theory of language and cultural production and an expanded version of
                Darnton’s communications circuit that includes an accretion of unrecognized
                agricultural and unskilled urban labor. In this context, media ecology frees media
                from reification, encouraging us to think about its circulation and interactivity
                rather than its thingness. Like Williams, we must see media (with all the
                fundamental contradictions Guillory shows us it contains) and mediation through
                material processes inseparable from history and use. Media ecology invites us to
                acknowledge the backs as well as the minds that make our work possible. It helps to
                focus on the arrows and processes in Darnton’s diagram, on the currents that make
                the circuit jump.</p>
                  <p>In all of this, I am not the hard humanist that Williams was, and my own theoretical
                goal is to work from an ecological theory that acknowledges that objects and animals
                and other unconscious or nonlinguistic beings shape human social relations. The
                expanded definition of "medium" I propose might look something like Williams’s
                definition of "culture." In his exploration of medium in <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title>, Williams does not mention the red gel onto which cells are
                smeared in order to develop a "culture." These cultures cannot survive without the
                medium that sustains them. While the sciences and humanities live far apart in our
                institutions, I don’t think the idea that culture cannot exist without media is
                unimaginably far from what Williams thought. So rather than read Romanticism as an
                event in the history of mediation, as Siskin and Warner might, I think our challenge
                is to produce a fuller account of Romantic media ecology as a dynamic system of use
                and reuse, something close to what Tim Ingold has termed an "ecology of materials,"
                but one that holds what Williams insists upon as the "cultural practice" of making
                and remaking—not the thing itself and not the reified event—in constant focus.</p>
                  <p>The institutions where most of this theorizing has taken place have their own complex
                and problematic histories. I began this essay by recounting my own alienated
                position in graduate school. <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> offered a
                way to understand myself in solidarity with workers doing kinds of labor with which
                I was more familiar. We all know, however, that we do not have to look to theory to
                find evidence of labor exploitation in our workplaces. English departments have a
                dubious history of shunting off "service" courses as piecework to low-paid,
                untenured—and in many cases, untenurable—instructors (Bousquet). In the United
                States, doctoral students are paid around $15,000 per year (AAUP 28). The average
                lecturer salary is $56,712 (AAUP 1). Salaries for those of us in the humanities
                often fall below that average. Between 1975 and 2013, contingent, part-time teaching
                jobs grew by 300% (AAUP 28). According to a recent survey by TIAA, adjuncts continue
                to make around $3,000 per course, but they are older and more content to stay in
                their positions than in the past (Yakoboski 8). Given that TIAA’s sample was only
                502 individuals when adjuncts make up over half the ranks of teaching faculty, we
                have grounds to question their findings. In September of 2013, Mary Vojtke, an
                adjunct at Duquesne University for 25 years, died in penury after she had been
                dismissed because, at 83, she was "no longer an effective instructor" (Kovalik). I
                know from my own experience that universities don’t like to offer adjuncts more than
                two classes per semester, because three classes makes the worker full time and
                therefore the institution is required to offer health and retirement benefits.
                Vojtke, who suffered from cancer, was teaching only one class per semester when she
                was dismissed (Kovalik). Her story sparked a nationwide discussion about unethical
                contingent labor practices in institutions of higher education. Dr. Thea K. Hunter,
                adjunct and historian of transatlantic law in our period, nevertheless died without
                health insurance of complications from asthma in December of 2018.</p>
                  <p>Thinking with Williams and with Marx, those of us who are on the tenure track should
                feel solidarity with these workers, who join us in the practices of cultural
                production. But what of our university administrators? Are they not the bosses,
                complicit with the corporatized institution that values little past its own prestige
                and the salaries that come with it? Naturally an ecology that binds us to the labors
                of the writers of our software and the millers of our paper must also bind us to the
                labors of the administration of our cultural institutions, however corporate they
                may be? The answer is yes. Williams addresses this problem through discussions of
                "intention," which he considers the determining factor of social action 
                (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>). In <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, the discussion
                of hegemony in the chapter by that name begins to address this problem. While
                culture may be a whole way of living, a complex and intertwined structure
                irreducible to base and superstructure, the imposition of dominant structures and
                practices should be understood through modes of "incorporation." In an earlier essay
                he writes:
            <quote>We can only understand an effective and dominant culture if we understand the real
                social process on which it depends: I mean the process of incorporation. The modes
                of incorporation are of great social significance, and incidentally in our kind of
                society have considerable economic significance. The educational institutions are
                usually the main agencies of the transmission of an effective dominant culture, and
                this is now a major economic as well as cultural activity; indeed it is both in the
                same moment. Moreover, at a philosophical level, at the true level of theory and at
                the level of the history of various practices, there is a process which I call
                the selective tradition: that which, within the terms of an effective dominant
                culture, is always passed off as "the tradition," "the significant past." 
                (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>)</quote>
               Cultural work, then, the replication of "the" tradition, is certainly labor,
                performed by workers who maintain the university’s ties to society as a whole.
                Williams argues in the same passage:
            <quote>Even more crucially, some of these meanings and practices are reinterpreted, diluted,
                or put into forms which support or at least do not contradict other elements within
                the effective dominant culture. The processes of education; the processes of a much
                wider social training within institutions like the family; the practical definitions
                and organisation of work; the selective tradition at an intellectual and theoretical
                level: all these forces are involved in a continual making and remaking of an
                effective dominant culture, and on them, as experienced, as built into our living,
                its reality depends. If what we learn there were merely an imposed ideology, or if
                it were only the isolable meanings and practices of the ruling class, or of a
                section of the ruling class, which gets imposed on others, occupying merely the top
                of our minds, it would be—and one would be glad—a very much easier thing to
                overthrow. (<title level="a">Base and Superstructure</title>)</quote>
              This passage, though long, very much helps us to see how Williams understands the
              stakes of the "Hegemony" chapter in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>.
                Hegemony is "our lived systems of meanings of values": <emph>we</emph> are
                the instruments of the selective tradition, as is Williams himself, so long as we
                continue to construct and support a canon based on authors (110).
                <emph>Our</emph> administrators ensure the agencies
                of the institution continue apace, with all its ongoing struggles between varying
                political factions. The communication circuit we insist on propagating in the name
                of tradition means that the author is always the sovereign god of a textual world we
                can only interpret.</p>
                  <p>Intersectional book history, as Emily Friedman has named it, is a sin against the
                author, but it is certainly not a sin against the word.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Freidman convened a panel at ASECS 2018 in Orlando, Florida,

                shows us a path whereby the two can be separated.
                If language is practical consciousness, we are joined in our labors—and in our
                work—to everyone who makes our words visible across time and distance. For a long
                time, the work making words into text has been a global enterprise. For anyone
                considering teaching <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, I urge you to
                help your students think through the importance of this work of resistance in its
                moment and in our own. My teachers seemed to grasp this instinctively, but I
                required selected readings from Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser to understand the
                importance of Williams’s claims.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I am grateful to

               <p rend="noCount">This essay begins by considering the place of the Romantic period in Williams’s
                    various accounts of pivotal historical moments. It goes on, however, to address two
                    interrelated questions about Williams’s changing relation to the category of
                    Romanticism, from his account of the "Romantic Artist" and the "Creative
                    Imagination" around 1960 through his more systematic work on the sociology of
                    literature in the 1970s and after. One question is about how the Romantic period
                    matters to the history of genres that Williams, as a critic who worked across
                    genres, came to elaborate in some detail. He came to believe that the period was
                    important for any account of genres, but not, like other critics, for its
                    prioritization of lyric poetry. The second question is about Williams’s relation to
                    the enterprise of practical criticism at Cambridge, especially his challenge to the
                    project of I. A. Richards, which was of course determined in large part by its focus
                    on reading the lyric. Williams challenged Richards with an emphasis on drama, out of
                    which he developed his notion of the "structure of feeling." And it was in his
                    somewhat underappreciated book of 1965, <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, that
                    a kind of turning point is reached in Williams’s thinking about Romanticism, which
                    recedes markedly in the later work.</p>

                  <p>Raymond Williams was, in most of his writings, a narrative thinker. Examples of this
                tendency can be found all across his extensive oeuvre. One can see it in the very
                titles of two books, respectively, about drama and fiction: <title level="m">Drama:
                    From Ibsen to Eliot</title> (1952) (later revised as <title level="m">Drama from
                        Ibsen to Brecht</title>) and <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to
                    Lawrence</title> (1970). One can see it as well in the organization of two of the
                big books he published around 1960: <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                (1958) and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961). The individual
                chapters in both books may be essayistic in form, but they are also in both cases
                ordered in such a way as to trace a certain arc over time. Williams closes his
                introduction to <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> by noting that it
                completes a body of work that includes not only <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>—for which it is clearly a companion volume—but also his first
                novel, <title level="m">Border Country</title> (1960), which was published in the year
                between them. That a work of fiction could be placed in such close relationship with
                two critical books seems to reinforce a certain sense of narrative overlap among
                them.</p>
                  <p>The tendency to rely on narrative as a default mode continues to show up in
                Williams’s important works of the 1970s, though here narrative is complimented by
                something like a stratigraphic tendency, as mapped in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> (1974), with its much-cited schema of residual, dominant, and
                emergent cultural formations. <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> itself,
                though presented as a work of theory, unfolds as its own kind of conceptual
                narrative, with problems and solutions in the history of Marxist literary analysis
                succeeding each other in linked intellectual episodes. The overall organization of
                <title level="m">Keywords</title>, by contrast, is not narrative but explicitly
                and emphatically alphabetical. Nonetheless, in a kind of inversion of the pattern of
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>, the individual entries in <title level="m">Keywords</title> are
                themselves narratively structured, each telling the history of a particular semantic
                transformation. <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, with its announced
                emphasis on location over narrative, space over time, is a partial exception to this
                overall tendency, one to which I recur more than once in what follows.</p>
                  <p>It will be clear from these scattered examples that Williams is willing to start and
                stop his literary and cultural narratives at many different historical junctures
                and, more importantly for my purposes here, able to find pivotal moments in many
                times and places. Ibsen’s great plays of the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s certainly
                represent one kind of pivotal moment for Williams, but so does the year 1848, on
                which he focuses in <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to
                    Lawrence</title>. In <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1966), Williams
                declares that "since 1917, we have been living in a world of successful social
                revolutions" and that this particular date is "probably decisive in all our
                thinking," certainly in all our thinking about revolution and tragedy, his twin
                themes in that book (73). Taken as a whole, these narratives have so many pivot
                points, one might say, that the very idea of a pivot seems to lose its force and
                purchase. </p>
                  <p>This last point is not lost on Williams himself. Early on in <title level="m">The
                    Country and the City</title>, Williams waxes uncharacteristically playful in a
                little game about how to date the disappearance of "organic community," the
                supplanting of <foreign xml:lang="de">Gemeinschaft</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="de">
                    Gesellschaft</foreign>. Beginning close to home with
                 <title level="m">Culture and Environment</title> (1932), a book
                coauthored by his teacher at Cambridge F. R. Leavis, Williams notes that for Leavis
                "the change is very recent indeed"
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 9). Yet this view, he goes on,
                was based on the books by one George Sturt, which were published between 1907 and
                1923. And then, as Williams puts it, "what seemed like an escalator began to move,"
                for Sturt located this break as early as the enclosures of 1861
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 9). Thomas Hardy’s novels
                pushed things back to the 1830s. And Richard Jefferies, writing in the 1870s, spoke
                of the decisive change as having occurred in the last half century. But then, with
                William Cobbett, John Clare, George Crabbe, and Oliver Goldsmith, Williams is soon
                pointing to a still earlier break in the mid-eighteenth century. Before long, he
                feels bound to reach all the way back to the pastoral nostalgia of, <foreign xml:lang="la">inter alia</foreign>, Thomas More’s <title level="m">Utopia</title> and
                 William Langland’s <title level="m">Piers Plowman</title>. It can, Williams shows, be
                a tricky business to pin down such pivotal moments in social and cultural
                narratives, especially when "literature" is the medium of evidence.</p>

                  <p>It is a commonplace that historians of all kinds, including literary historians, tend
                to think of the period they study as decisive for change over time. And students of
                the Romantic period tend, among all specialists, to make particularly bold claims
                for the age on which they focus. Evidence for these claims is not so hard to find or
                to marshal, and this evidence was not unknown to the writers of that moment.
                Powerful "causes unknown to former times," wrote Wordsworth in the Preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, were radically altering culture and society,
                literature and taste, at the turn of the nineteenth century (Wordsworth 128). In
                addition to the major political revolutions in America and France, we must number
                among these causes the beginning of England’s Industrial Revolution—with its
                "accumulation of men in cities" and new forms of monotonous work (Wordsworth
                128)—which Williams’s himself conveniently dates to roughly the life of William
                Blake (1757–1827). These are familiar facts and no one knows them better than
                Williams himself. No surprise then that, in several of his books at least, the
                decisive historical moment seems to fall around the turn of the nineteenth
                century.</p>
                  <p> This happens, for example, in both of the important early books with which I began:
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>. Both books establish their points of departure in late
                eighteenth-century Britain. Both also devote early framing chapters to discussion of
                matters that most scholars of Romanticism have regarded as central to their
                understanding of that subject: "The Romantic Artist" in the case of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and "The Creative Mind" in the case of
                <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. When he focuses on such topics in
                this way, Williams shows himself capable of making claims about the decisive
                importance of the Romantic moment in literary and cultural history that would
                satisfy the field pride of the most aggressive Romanticists now working. Elsewhere,
                however, he is less inclined to do so. For example, in his survey of the social
                origins of British writers over several centuries of literary history, divided into
                50-year segments, no particular pivot point is indicated with either of the Romantic
                generations (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title>). It is not always clear when
                Romanticism matters for him and when it does not.</p>
                  <p>In what follows, then, I wish to address a couple of basic questions. What are the
                narrative contexts that lead Williams to cast the Romantic period in a decisive
                historical role? And, in a critical project that evolved as much as Williams’s did
                over time, is it possible to mark some changes in the way Williams accounts for the
                Romantic era and its movements? To put this second question another way, which
                involves an implicit narrative of my own, what happens to Romanticism as Williams’s
                frame of reference shifts from "culture and society" to "Marxism and
                literature"?</p>
                  <p> In retrospect, Williams’s early chapters on Romanticism in both <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> depict
                the Romantic poets and their social-political circumstances in ways that we have
                perhaps come to take for granted but that were anything but commonplace in Romantic
                studies six decades ago. Prominent American work on the Romantic poets in the 1950s
                included Earl Wasserman’s close reading of Keats in <title level="m">The Finer
                    Tone</title> (1953) and Robert Langbaum’s study of the Romantic origins of the
                    dramatic monologue in <title level="m">The Poetry of Experience</title> (1957), both
                    of which appeared before <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. David Ferry’s
                    elegant appreciation of Wordsworth’s major lyrics in <title level="m">The Limits of
                    Mortality</title> (1959) and Harold Bloom’s Buberian interpretation of Shelley in
                    <title level="m">Shelley’s Mythmaking</title> (1959) appeared the
                year after Williams’s book. In England an exemplary work from this period is John
                Jones’s "history of Wordsworth’s imagination" in <title level="m">The Egotistical
                    Sublime</title> (1954). At Cambridge, Williams’s colleague Frank Kermode
                    published <title level="m">Romantic Image</title> (1957), which
                    anticipates <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> in that it offers a
                century-and-a-half narrative history that begins with the figure of "the artist in
                isolation," but this is about as far as the resemblance goes, for Kermode gives very
                little account of what the artist might be isolated from or against (1). When
                history is invoked in work of the postwar period of Romantic criticism, as it is in
                such major books as Walter Jackson Bate’s <title level="m">From Classic to
                    Romantic</title> (1946), Northrop Frye’s <title level="m">Fearful Symmetry</title>
                    (1947), or M. H. Abrams’s <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title> (1953), it
                tends to be in the mode of the history of ideas (as in Frye’s invocation of Locke),
                or the history of aesthetics (as in Bate’s book), or both (as in Abrams’s).</p>
                  <p>It already matters to Williams’s handling of Romanticism in <title level="m">Culture 
                 and Society</title> that "The Romantic Artist" is actually the <emph>second</emph> 
                 chapter in the book (30). Williams begins with the pairing of two 
                 actively political figures—Burke and Cobbett—best known for their
                writings on society more broadly. When Williams turns to the poets in his second
                chapter, his first move is to stress that "the poets from Blake and Wordsworth to
                Shelley and Keats" were among the generations of poets most "deeply interested 
                and . . . involved in study and criticism of the society of their day" (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 30). This observation leads him to puzzle 
                 over the "popular and general conception" of these same poets as "indifferent to the 
                 crude worldliness and materialism of politics and social affairs" (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 30). For Williams in this book, the figure 
                 of the "Romantic Artist" is something to be seriously queried, if not quite ultimately
                debunked.</p>
                  <p>Williams was by no means the first commentator to emphasize the relationship of these
                poets to such political events as the French Revolution. But no one had explored, as
                he was to do in this book and its many sequels, their relation to the Industrial
                Revolution. Moreover, he emphasized that the transformations it effected—though
                "slower, wider, less observable" than those of the political revolution—were part of
                what he could come to call the lived experience of the time:
            <quote>The changes that we receive as record were experienced, in these years, on the
                senses: hunger, suffering, conflict, dislocation; hope, energy, vision, dedication.
                The pattern of change was not background, as we may now be inclined to study it; it
                was, rather, the mould in which general experience was cast.
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 31)</quote>
               If one didn’t know the case to be otherwise, one could almost imagine that the
                cultural moment of the early Industrial Revolution and its manifestations in the
                work of the Romantic poets constituted the inaugural context for Williams’s
                signature notion of a "structure of feeling."<note place="foot" resp="editors">I would like to thank my research
                            assistant, Eric Powell, for his help in tracking down references and
                            preparing this essay for publication. The concept of structures of
                            feeling was first developed by Williams and Orrom in <title level="m">Preface to Film</title>. For an extended account of the 
                    development of the concept throughout Williams’s oeuvre, see Chandler, <title level="a">I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams</title> (344–52).</note> He 
                would go on in this chapter to apply that notion to some of the various challenges 
                to convention that writers made in this period: "changes in convention only occur when 
                there are radical changes in the general structure of feeling"
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 39). Out of such
                "first apprehensions of the essential significance of the Industrial Revolution,"
                Williams’s argues, grew the roots of "the idea of culture" itself: accompanying the
                political, economic, and social changes came "a radical change also in ideas of art,
                of the artist, and of their place in society"
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 31–32). The figure
                of the "Romantic Artist" was one encapsulation of these altered ideas.</p>
                  <p>Returning to some of these questions in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>,
                 Williams produces a proto-<title level="m">Keywords</title> sort of history of the
                word "creative" in its various forms, which he says "carries a . . . consistently
                positive reference," more so than any other word in English (3). As we might expect,
                the pivotal moment for the history of this word comes in the Romantic period. And
                Williams lays out the history of the relationship between ordinary and artistic
                "seeing" in the following schema:

                     </quote>
                Williams refers neither to Bate’s <title level="m">From Classic to Romantic</title> nor
                to Abrams’s <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title> in these two books, but
                his account has corrective implications for each. Against Bate’s position, Williams
                argues that Classic and Romantic critical orientations are not so much opposed to
                each other as they are aligned against a third aesthetic: naturalism. Against
                Abrams’s position, Williams suggests that the relationship of imitation—the
                mirror—to creativity is a vexed one. In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>,
                the argument goes like this:
            <quote>The tendency of Romanticism is towards . . . a claim which all good classical theory
                would have recognized: the claim that the artist’s business is to "read the open
                secret of the universe" . . . In fact, the doctrines of "the genius" (the autonomous
                creative artist) and of the "superior reality of art" (penetration to a sphere of
                universal truth) were in Romantic thinking two sides of the same claim.
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 39)<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also James Naremore’s invocation of Williams’s point 
                    in a parallel discussion of how imitative and expressionist styles of film 
                    acting likewise amount to two sides of the same coin (59–60).</note>
                     </quote>
               In <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, Williams wrote that "the long and
                often bitter dialogue between these contrasted positions leads now, not to a taking
                of sides, but to a rejection of the premises which both parties share"—that is, that
                the genius has powers to penetrate to a higher reality
                (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title> 19). What makes both
                corrections possible, even necessary, is Williams’s insistence on seeing the posture
                of the Romantic Artist as deriving, on the part of the writers who assumed it, from
                the felt realities of the Industrial Revolution. In this sense, Romanticism comes to
                be understood as just one way of responding to the transformations unfolding in the
                world’s first industrial nation in the decades straddling the turn of the nineteenth
                century. And <emph>that</emph> recognition in turn enables us to begin to
                answer the first question I posed about what sort of narrative might lead Williams
                to see Romanticism as a kind of pivot point. The answer would seem to be something
                like a history of the poet’s role in society.</p>
                  <p>Of course, both <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The
                    Long Revolution</title> build accounts that run over a far longer period than the
                Romantic period, and, from the start, both address many more developments than the
                rubric of "Romanticism" could encompass. They also address a wide variety of genres
                beyond poetry: <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, for example, includes
                prose nonfiction, fiction, drama, and criticism among its objects of study,
                beginning as it does with Burke and Cobbett and ending with Richards and Leavis. As
                Williams’s thinking evolved beyond this pair of early books, indeed, two
                interrelated issues already incipient in them began more and more to occupy his
                attention. One is the broader question of genres, what he calls the "multiplicity of
                writing," especially what happened to genre discrimination around the turn of the
                nineteenth century, the historical starting point for <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. The other is the
                question of his involvement in the project of practical criticism. I will address
                each of these two questions in turn.</p>

                  <head>III</head>
                  <p>Late in his career, in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, Williams
                revisited the Romantic period in a new key as part of his account of the "complex
                process" in which, over many decades, a system of fairly settled classical
                classification was subjected to a "bourgeois drawing and redrawing of all these
                lines" (147). This remapping of the genres, he argued, took place in keeping with
                tendencies to secularization, rationalization, and ultimately popularization, and
                the upshot of this process was the (for Williams) problematic distinction between
                "literary" and "non-literary" kinds of writing. He is careful to assert, however,
                that this distinction developed by stages. First there was the formation of certain
                disciplinary practices (in history, philosophy, and social and scientific
                description) in which "new kinds of distinction about forms and method of writing
                were radically connected with new kinds of distinction about intention." Thus in
                certain fields, older values such as "elevation" or "dignity" gave way to new values
                such as practicality, effectiveness, and accuracy
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). For a time—and here
                Williams is probably thinking of, among others, the Scottish school of rhetoric and
                belles lettres associated with Adam Smith and Hugh Blair—the idea of "‘Literature’
                as a body of ‘polite learning’" could still function to unite these increasingly
                diverse intentions (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). But
                then came the real crisis, which Williams dates to the Romantic period.</p>
                  <p>"Under pressure," he writes, "especially in the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth
                centuries, this broke down" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). It is at this moment in
                the account that Williams produces a new conceptualization, now in the register of
                the sociology of literature, of the Romantic moment described at the start of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>: "‘Literature’ became either the conceded or the contemptuous
                alternative—the sphere of imagination or fancy, or of emotional substance and
                effect—or, at the insistence of its practitioners, the relatively removed but again
                ‘higher’ dimension—the creative as distinguished from the rational or the practical"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). We can note that the
                figure of the lyric poet as "Romantic Artist" is not privileged in this new
                formulation. On the contrary, when Williams goes on to spell out the implications of
                this shift in the new framework of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>,
                other genres and forms are emphasized:
            <quote>In this complex interaction it is of course significant that the separated literature
                itself changed, in many of its immediate forms. In the "realist" novel, especially
                in its distinction from "romance," in the new drama (socially extended, secular and
                contemporary), and in the new special forms of biography and autobiography, many of
                the same secular, rational, or popular impulses changed particular forms of writing
                from the inside, or created new literary forms.
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147)</quote>
             From his late sociological perspective, we might say, Williams came to see that the
                era we call Romantic not only separated "literature" in its subsequent sense from
                other kinds of writing, but also developed further, fractal distinctions of the same
                kind within that category, such as the distinction between "romance" and "realism."
                To superimpose this new account of the turn of the nineteenth century on the account
                given in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, then, is to see the
                foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet-as-Artist less in portrait scale, with a
                historical landscape visible in the background, and more on the scale of a crowded
                historical painting populated with other moving and changing images.</p>

                  <p>The second issue that occupies Williams’s attention in the years beyond 1960, though
                in truth it is an issue that is with him from the start, is how to grapple with the
                legacy of Cambridge English (especially in the persons of I. A. Richards and F. R.
                Leavis, who are paired in a late chapter of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>), which had been so formative on his early work and thought. This
                difficult struggle with practical criticism also mattered to his relationship to
                Romanticism, especially to the once-foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet. Toward
                the end of his career, Williams provided some late reflections on the role of
                practical criticism in his early work that illuminate the evolution of his thinking.
                Looking back from 1977, when he cooperated in a book-length series of interviews for
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> about his long career, Williams was
                especially self-critical about his approach to reading and interpretation in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. In these interviews, he acknowledges
                that his approach to the writings he discusses was too immersive, too much given to
                reproducing the views of the authors he discusses and too little given to
                maintaining critical distance. He blamed this tendency on a habit of reading he had
                acquired at Cambridge under the aegis of "practical criticism." The fuller story of
                Williams’s long struggle with these two figures is too complicated to rehearse
                here.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Chandler, <title level="a">I. A. 
                    Richards and Raymond Williams.</title>
                     </note> But in
                brief one might sum it up in three steps, even if it was not quite so clear-cut in
                the working out.</p>
                  <p>The first step is Williams’s determination that Leavis’s version of practical
                criticism was not only a less estimable affair than Richards’s, but also that it
                indeed represented an ideological capture of Richards’s project on two counts: where
                Richards’s practical criticism was grounded in rigorous theory, Leavis insisted on
                practice as opposed to theory, <emph>and</emph> Leavis debased the best
                elements of Richards’s program by substituting excerpts from novels in place of
                integral poetic texts. The second step is that, seeing this much, Williams was able
                to recognize the greatness of Richards’s reformation in criticism—especially its
                debunking of Oxbridge class privilege in the encounter with literature—but also to
                admit its damaging limitations. These limitations called for the third step:
                Williams would have to build a major critical alternative to practical criticism,
                something that he indeed labored at for years and that issued in his great books of
                the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
                  <p>But what does the question of practical criticism have to do with Romanticism? Not
                the least of the problems in Richards’s influential program, as Williams came to
                see, was precisely the focus on the integral lyric poem in its Romantic incarnation,
                which entailed a certain kind of reading practice closely associated with
                Wordsworth, whose experiments with sensibility of the 1790s closely anticipate those
                of Richards in the 1920s (in ways not difficult to demonstrate). It would be an
                exaggeration to say that Williams’s reading of the figure of the Romantic Artist (in
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>) and the concomitant emergence of the
                "creative mind" (in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>) was in either case
                an unequivocal endorsement. It is not an exaggeration, however, to say that he came
                to see these readings as too invested in a Wordsworthian lyric paradigm that mattered
                so much to Richards. The paradigm, for all its initial sense of empowerment and
                liberation from class prejudice, involved a subtle kind of "servility" to the formal
                technique of close reading the lyric poem, what Williams identified as an
                "active-passivity" in Richards’s Wordsworthian recourse to reading poetry as a
                remedy for cultural crisis.</p>
                  <p> The corrective to this narrow focus on immersive reading of integral lyrics, as
                Williams explained things in the late 1970s, was to shift the paradigmatic object of
                critical focus from poetry to drama. This was a move readily available to Williams,
                since drama was the field in which he started his academic work and to which he
                often returned in his writings. His dissertation was on Ibsen, and his appointment
                at Cambridge was actually as professor of drama. In addition to the books on drama
                that I have already mentioned, there are the two short books of 1954, <title level="m">Preface to Drama</title> and <title level="m">Preface to Film</title> 
                (the latter coauthored with Michael Orrom). Since film, in Williams’s handing, is 
                decidedly a particular
                species of dramatic presentation, both books are really about drama. And it is in
                Williams’s contribution to the latter book that he lays out an understanding of
                "drama-in-performance," which requires attention not just to the literary text, à la
                Richards, but also to the historical conventions of theatrical production. This
                focus in turn leads at this very early date to Williams’s first articulation of the
                concept—"structures of feeling"—on which he would famously ground the evolving
                critical edifice that should supplant that of Richards.</p>
                  <p>That edifice would indeed be a long time in the building, but an interesting moment
                in its construction comes with <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1967), a book
                that Williams himself thought well of, though it has not enjoyed the same warmth of
                reception as many of his other books. The book is divided between a series of
                reflective essays in part one, "Tragic Ideas," and a series of critical essays on
                modern tragic works in part two, almost all of them from the twentieth century. It
                seeks overall to reframe the relationship between tragedy and politics, and it does
                so first by critiquing what Williams calls "the ordinary twentieth-century idea" of
                tragedy, or "the structure of tragedy in our own culture" (<title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title> 62), and then by reading specific tragedies from the new
                perspective he opens up. The ordinary twentieth-century idea of tragedy includes
                components that are meant to be recognized as familiar: the separation of tragedy
                from accident, the focus on the destruction of the hero, the principle of
                irreversible or "irreparable" action, and the emphasis on absolute evil. One
                consequence of the hegemony of this ideology of tragedy, for Williams, is the false
                dichotomy Williams precisely seeks to redress: "Having separated earlier tragic
                systems from their actual societies, we can achieve a similar separation in our own
                time, and can take it for granted that modern tragedy can be discussed without
                reference to the deep social crisis, of war and revolution, through which we have
                all been living" (<hi rend="italic">Modern Tragedy</hi> 62).</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> offers an account of how this particular
                separation widened over time. And as with some other narratives we have considered,
                the turn of the nineteenth century marks a crucial turn in a larger story.
                Anticipating the account of the multiplicity of writing in <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title>, the first essay in part two—<title level="a">From Hero 
                        to Victim: The Making of Liberal Tragedy, to Ibsen and Miller</title>—goes 
                 back in time to consider a key transition (<title level="m">Modern 
                     Tragedy</title> 87). This is the transition from what Williams calls "bourgeois 
                 tragedy" in decline—driven underground "by its own contradictions"—to the 
                 reemergence of its distinctive energy in the form of Romantic tragedy
                 (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94). Williams is well
                aware that in making Romantic tragedy the focus of this particular narrative, he is
                not playing to the strengths of the movement. Romantic drama, certainly in Britain,
                is not on the whole a body of achievement to rival Romantic poetry. Yet it plays its
                part in the longer history of tragedy: "What is quite evident, through all the
                failures of Romantic drama, is a renewal and a renewed assertion of individual
                energy" (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94). More to the
                point for Williams, this new energy follows a course that helps to shape the (deeply
                problematic) modern idea of tragedy. Certain key themes of Romantic tragedy—the
                "impossibility of finding a home in the world, the condemnation to a guilty
                wandering, the dissolution of self and others in a desire that is beyond all
                relationships"—are what Williams calls "an important source of nearly all modern
                tragedy," especially (one might add) tragedy cast in an existentialist register as
                is the case for many of the plays Williams selects in the mid-twentieth century
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94–95).</p>
                  <p>How does the renewal of energy in Romantic drama issue in such dark consequences?
                Williams tells the story this way:
            <quote>The desires of man are again intense and imperative; they reach out and test the
                universe itself. Society is identified as convention, and convention as the enemy of
                desire. The individual rebellion is humanist, at a conscious level. Prometheus and
                Faust, characteristically, are its heroes. But the condition of desire,
                unconsciously, is that it is always forbidden. What then happens is that the forms
                of desire become devious and often perverse, and what looks like revolt is more
                properly a desperate defiance of heaven and hell. There is a related preoccupation
                with remorse: deep, pervasive, and beyond all its nominal causes. For in Romantic
                tragedy man is guilty of the ultimate and nameless crime of being himself.
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94)</quote>
              Williams’s scope of reference in this passage is broadly European. He notes elsewhere
                that "Romanticism" in the sense that he uses it in this book is a European
                phenomenon, and of course <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> as a whole deals
                with a range of tragic production from the ancient Athenians to Ionesco, Beckett,
                Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams. For the decades straddling the turn of the
                nineteenth century, the expanded scope takes us well beyond the canon of Romanticism
                enumerated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>—"from Blake and Wordsworth
                to Shelley and Keats"—to the European-identified Byron and indeed to Schiller and
                Goethe. And the concentration on drama, with its concomitant expansion of horizons,
                seems to shift focus importantly in Williams’s evolving understanding of Romanticism
                as such.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> has the advantage of being perhaps
                unique in Williams’s oeuvre for having a section that bears the heading
                "Romanticism." This section appears in the culminating chapter of part one, "Tragedy
                and Revolution," a conjunction of ideas, as he called them, that involved him in
                years of study. Within that chapter, this section appears third in a sequence that
                includes first "Liberalism" and then "Naturalism." The sequence merits some
                attention for the question of how Romanticism comes to be understood by Williams as
                an aspect of a larger set of pivotal and dialectically related ideological
                developments in that historical moment. It is the moment in which, in the wake of
                the French Revolution, "the idea of tragedy can be seen as in different ways a
                response to a culture in conscious change and movement"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 62). The French
                Revolution itself, on Williams’s account, had marked the moment when the medieval
                idea of rebellion was refashioned into the modern idea of revolution. This modern
                idea of revolution, he explains, had its origins in liberalism, which, over time,
                "eroded the conceptions of a permanent human nature and of a static social order
                with connections to a divine order"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). Out of liberalism’s
                "alternative conception of the possibility of human and social transformation,"
                however, comes not only the new notion of revolution, but also an identification of
                the most important human values "not with the received order but with development,
                progress and change"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). For Williams, then,
                liberalism had the effect of putting the idea of revolution and the idea of tragedy
                at odds: "Revolution asserted the possibility of man altering his condition; tragedy
                showed its impossibility. . . . On that opposition, we are still trying to rest"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68).</p>
                  <p>Liberalism, so understood by Williams, spawned two tragic modes that offer stark
                choices which are "essentially a matter of attitudes towards revolution"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). The first discussed
                is what he calls <emph>Naturalism</emph>, which <emph>seems</emph> a "true 
                child of the liberal enlightenment, in which the traditional
                ideas of fate, an absolute order, a design beyond human powers, were replaced by a
                confidence in reason and in the possibility of a continually expanding capacity for
                explanation and control"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 69). But this child of
                enlightenment, declares Williams, "finally, is a bastard":
            <quote>What became naturalism, and what distinguished it from the more important movement of
                realism, was a mechanical description of men as the creatures of their environment,
                which literature recorded as if man and thing were of the same nature. The tragedy
                of naturalism is the tragedy of passive suffering, and the suffering is passive
                because man can only endure and never really change his world. . . . This naturalism
                . . . began in liberalism but ends, ironically, as a grotesque version of the system
                originally challenged by liberalism . . .
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 69)</quote>
               Naturalism and its debased form of tragedy are ultimately associated with the rapidly
                developing theories of political economy and "the theory of administered reform,"
                society in this view amounting to nothing more than "an impersonal process, a
                machine with certain built-in properties" (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>
                70). The naturalist response to liberalism gives us the "mystification" of what
                Williams calls "mechanical materialism" and more specifically "utilitarianism"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71).</p>
                  <p>Romanticism is the name that Williams gives to the <emph>second</emph> of
                the two movements that "sought to express the values of liberalism"
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71). If utilitarianism,
                "the most common English form of mechanical materialism, had sought liberal values
                in the reform of civil society," Romanticism took a seemingly opposite tack, seeking
                "values in the development of the individual," though this led to a similarly ironic
                impasse.
            <quote>In its early stages, Romanticism was profoundly liberating, but, partly because of
                the inadequacy of any corresponding social theory, and partly because of the
                consequent decline from individualism and subjectivism, it ended by denying its own
                deepest impulses, and even reversing them. Almost all our revolutionary language in
                fact comes from the Romantics, and this has been a real hindrance as well as an
                incidental embarrassment. Romanticism is the most important expression in modern
                literature of the first impulse of revolution: a new and absolute image of man.
                Characteristically, it relates this transcendence to an ideal world and an ideal
                human society; it is in Romantic literature that man is first seen as making
                himself. (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71)</quote>
              How, exactly, does the promise of Romanticism go so wrong as to deny, even to
                reverse, its own deepest impulses? As Williams says, it has partly to do with the
                inadequacy of any existing social theory in that moment. Liberal political economy
                certainly would not do. Marx famously wrote than human beings make their own history
                but not under conditions of their own choosing. Likewise, when the Romantic project
                of man making himself is "particularised, to social criticism and construction, it
                encounters fundamental obstacles." The turn is to utopia:
            <quote>It is easier to visualise the ideal in an exotic or fabled community (or an
                historical community transformed by those elements). The existing social world is
                seen as so hostile to what is most deeply human that even what begins as social
                criticism tends to pass into nihilism.

              Thus, in the space of a page in <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, does the
                promise of the so-called Romantic movement, now understood in its relation to
                revolution and tragedy, pass from everything to nothing.</p>

                  <p>What distinguishes Williams’s treatment of Romanticism in <title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title>, then, is his aggressive formulation of its tendencies within the
                systematic unfolding of a dialectical account in which liberalism opposes the feudal
                order, clearing the way for the modern idea of revolution, but then finds its
                contradictions played out in two apparently rival modes of representation that are
                actually mutually complementary. The dialectical contradictions within each of these
                modes is in turn examined so that each turns against its own most promising drives
                and aspirations. Over the course of <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, Williams
                ultimately works out, first in theory and then in applied critical practice, how an
                enriched understanding of the relationship between tragedy and revolution can point
                a way forward. In the end, the paradoxical optimism of this book about tragedy is
                perhaps best understood in relation to its distinctive moment in the mid-1960s, a time 
                when Williams was active in movements that provide a flash of hope that, for a time,
                brightened Britain’s social and political prospects.</p>
                  <p>The point I wish to emphasize here is that Williams represents Romanticism in his
                study of the history of a dramatic form in a way that feels far less immersive than
                the accounts offered only a few years earlier in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. All three books work in
                an essayistic mode, but there is a systematicity to the unfolding arguments of <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> that is far more pronounced than anything in
                those earlier books. <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> indeed anticipates the
                marked systematicity of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> about a decade
                later. Yet as I have noted, the systematic language in that late book is mainly
                aimed at constructing the critical edifice with which Williams sought to supplant
                the powerful program of Richards. It offers an account of British culture and
                society only incidentally, along the way, with next to nothing about "Romanticism"
                as such. It is thus telling that, in the comments we considered earlier about what
                happens to the "multiplicity of literature" in the "late-eighteenth and early
                nineteenth centuries," Romanticism never quite gets to hear the sound of its own
                name—though "romance" as a sub-genre does, along with references to the creative
                imagination and other Romantic topics. Likewise, when Williams turned back to
                English literary history and criticism in <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title>, Romanticism as such plays very little role, a point that gains added
                force when one considers how many pages are devoted, say, to Wordsworth. A quick
                search of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> will show that "romantic"
                is nearly always used there in its lowercase form, an everyday descriptor rather
                than a term associated with a particular literary and intellectual movement around
                the turn of the nineteenth century: "romantic love," "romantic compliment,"
                "romantic lovers," "romantic wastes," "romantic strain," "romantic attachment,"
                "romantic atmosphere," "romantic destiny" (to name just a few)
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 23, 25, 63, 69, 71, 203, 227, 251).</p>
                  <p>It would be wrong to conclude that Williams somehow came to forget about the
                "Romantic movement" in his late work. He even refers to it once in passing, when, in
                making a point about eighteenth-century enclosures, he explains that it "connects
                with that structure of feeling which was beginning to form, from Goldsmith to the
                poets of the Romantic movement, and which is particularly visible in Clare: the loss
                of the ‘old country’" (<title level="m">Country</title> 137). Yet
                this way of gesturing casually to the shared cultural figures and formations of the
                two generations of poets "from Blake and Wordsworth to Shelley and Keats," as he
                identifies them in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, already marks quite a
                change, if only because names are named only for the period-bracketing figures of
                Goldsmith and Clare.</p>
                  <p>Nor should we conclude that the decades around the turn of the nineteenth century in
                Britain ceased to be pivotal for Williams: when he traces the history of the most
                important terms in <title level="m">Keywords</title>, many of the transformations he
                calls decisive (a favorite word of his own) tend to occur in the passage from the
                eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The point is rather that the figures and topoi
                of Romanticism as such, once the starting point in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, and indeed the
                guidelines for Richards’s immersive practical criticism embraced by Williams in his
                early years, had become systematized as far as they could be in the dialectics of
                <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>. After that, Romanticism as such held
                diminished interest for his late work on literature, media, and society.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">In <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), Raymond Williams 
                    launched an investigation into the historical character of Jane Austen’s fiction which has 
                    profoundly influenced our understanding of the novelist’s work and the period in which she 
                    wrote. This essay first examines Williams’s curiously static representation of Austen, 
                    offered by a critic otherwise attuned to a literary and social history conceived as unsettled 
                    and agitated. The limitations of his approach reflect both gender bias and a bias toward 
                    realism, especially evident in Williams’s reliance on the figure of perspective. To loosen 
                    understanding of the history in Austen, this essay proposes a turn to Williams’s later 
                    reflections on media, notably <title level="m">Television: Technology and Cultural
                    Form</title> (1974), where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries of visual 
                    perspective. Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams depicts it and 
                    to move Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons and other media.</p>

                     <quote>After all, it is you yourself [Raymond Williams] who have shown that there are multiple 
                    social processes of a manifestly historical character in the work of Jane Austen, whose

                  <p>Jane Austen is a favorite touchstone in Raymond Williams’s discussions of both the novel 
                and the development of British culture more broadly. She inaugurates his account of
                <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</title> (1970) and then, 
                in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), marks the historical shift 
                to “an acquisitive high bourgeois society at the point of its most evident interlocking with an
                    agrarian capitalism . . . [a]n openly acquisitive society, which is concerned with the 
                    transmission of wealth, [and] trying to judge itself by an inherited code and the morality 
                    of improvement” (Williams, <title level="m">English Novel</title> 21). Austen helps Williams 
                describe a “most difficult world to describe”: “active, complicated, and sharply speculative” 
                (Williams, <title level="m">Country</title> 115). In <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of 
                    Culture and Society</title> (1976), the novelist is tagged to terms Williams activated in 
                <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> specifically to track the rise of increasingly abstract
                forms of value: culture and improvement (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 88, 162).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Austen also appears in the discussion of “Sensibility” (<title level="m">Keywords</title>
                    285). Alistair Duckworth’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the Improvement of the Estate</title>, 
                    also published in 1970, provides a finer-grained account of Austen’s approach to “improvement” 
                    than Williams allows himself. Williams appears not to have read Duckworth before publishing <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>.</note>

                  <p>In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, 
                    and even <title level="m">The Politics of Modernism</title>, where she plays only bit parts, 
                    Austen nonetheless serves as a known quantity, a handy point of reference for the historical and 
                    social analyses Williams will roll out. As the editors of the <title level="j">New Left
                    Review</title> note in their interviews with Williams, even though he does not give Austen a chapter 
                    to herself, she nonetheless “figures as <emph>the starting point</emph> of a tradition” (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 224; emphasis added). “Remarkably confident,” “quite 
                    extraordinarily composed,” Austen’s work injects stability and familiarity into Williams’s 
                    revisionary analysis (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 230).</p>
                  <p>It was revisionary in the 1970s to treat Austen as “a highly historical writer,” to quote the 
                words of Williams’s interviewers (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 256).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This point intersects with <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.gilmartin.html">Kevin Gilmartin’s essay 
                        in this collection</ref>.</note> Williams’s treatment refutes what he calls a truth 
                universally acknowledged (he does not employ quotation marks because he owns the phrase in 
                common with his readers): the truth, that is, that Austen “chose to ignore the decisive political 
                events of her time,” war and revolution (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 18; <title level="m">Country</title> 113). Williams does not claim that the novelist did
                    address such events; rather, he uses Austen’s example to argue powerfully that
                    history and politics belong less to events than to “the whole social experience”
                    (<title level="m">Country</title> 136). In the 1979 interview that became <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, Williams goes so far as to align Austen with 
                his view of the canonical Romantic poets (a radical move for any critic at the time).
                    “The Romantic attempts to grasp the momentous social changes of their time,
                    which were eventually to determine all politics,” Williams finds, “were of far
                    greater significance” than their stance on, say, political revolution.
            <quote>Just as—to take a comparable example—it was really much
                    more important that Jane Austen depicted a vast complex transition in the world
                    of English landowning and landholding than that she did not write about the
                    Napoleonic Wars. It is the same kind of judgment. It is not a general dismissal
                    of politics. (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 81–82)</quote>
               Williams’s understanding of the history in Austen’s fiction—a history of vast social, 
               economic, and cultural transition—has been supremely influential, coloring scholarly 
               works as diverse as Marilyn Butler’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the War of Ideas</title>
                (1988), Clifford Siskin’s <title level="m">The Work of Writing: Literature and Social
                    Change 1700–1830</title> (1999), and Edward Said’s <title level="m">Culture and 
                        Imperialism</title> (1993).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the preface to 
                            a later edition, Butler comments on her failure to credit Williams in her 
                    study. Siskin cites his debt to Williams frequently. Said’s reading of <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> was originally published in <title level="m">Raymond Williams: Critical Perspectives</title> (1989).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This understanding builds, however, upon a curiously static representation of Austen, 
                offered by a critic otherwise attuned to a literary and social history conceived as 
                unsettled and agitated. As he elaborates in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>
                (1977), Williams typically directs his critical attention
                    to “structures of feeling” where historical experience hovers “in solution,” not
                    yet “precipitated” into “the fixed and explicit—the known relationships,
                    institutions, formations, positions” (133–34; 128). Williams comes to this
                    formulation, though, after his major work on Austen. If structures of feeling
                    hold loosely “all that is present and moving, all that escapes or seems to
                    escape from the fixed and the explicit and the known,” they seem absent from
                    Austen’s world (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). In <title level="m">The 
                        Country and the City</title> especially Williams precipitates the world of 
                her novels into something fixed, explicit and known—the anchor of an otherwise mobile 
                “whole social experience” (136). His treatment of Austen tends furthermore to 
                homogenize her fiction (so that any one work stands in for all) and to leave her work 
                unread. By unread I mean to say that in making Austen a touchstone, Williams leaves 
                the novels untouched, and because taken as so familiar, hardly seen.</p>
                  <p>Williams’s powerful presentation of Austen in history in fact depends less upon 
                structures of feeling than a specific logic of vision and space. Most notably 
                in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, Williams focuses attention 
                on “a problem of perspective,” the title of the book’s second chapter. For him the term
                    designates a historiographical problem, but Williams’s “problem of perspective”
                    also works rhetorically to situate the work of reading into a telling and
                    restrictive geometry. The best critique of the rigidity of “perspective” is
                    Williams’s own shift in subsequent work to discerning “history in
                    solution.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Goodman’s analysis of “structures 
                        of feeling” in <title level="m">Georgic Modernity.</title>
                     </note> His 
                invocation of the “problem of perspective” in these earlier works, by contrast, is 
                especially inadequate to the stillness, quirks, and <emph>vertiges</emph> that 
                sometimes characterize the way history moves in Austen’s work.<note place="foot" resp="editors">William Galperin’s work in <title level="m">Historical Austen</title>
                            elaborates the ways in which Austen’s oeuvre chafes against the 
                            emergent demands of narrative realism; D. A. Miller’s <title level="m">Jane 
                                Austen, or the Secret of Style</title> reads the smooth and settled surface of
                                Austen’s style as the index of possibilities foreclosed by her
                                social and historical position. In reimagining the familiar
                                “settlements” of Austen’s fiction, both critics find “within a
                                dimension of relatively fixed forms . . . an unease, a stress, a
                                displacement, a latency,” to invoke Williams’s own language
                                (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 130). On the 
                    <emph>vertiges</emph> of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, see Pinch (156–63) 
                    and Favret (163–71).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To loosen understanding of the history in Austen, then, I propose a turn to Williams’s later 
                reflections on media, where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries of vision 
                and space. Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams depicts it and to move 
                Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons and other media. If works like <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> rely on Austen’s fiction  to establish a fixed and 
                familiar horizon, Williams’s writings on “the concept of flow” in new media unmoor that horizon—and 
                our expectations. On the one hand, film and television recognize and capitalize on something less 
                certain or settled emerging especially in the novelist’s later fiction: “qualifications, 
                reservations, indications . . . still sounding elsewhere” (to borrow the language of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>). These features have the potential, as Williams
                    explains elsewhere, to disturb what consensus—critical, historical, or
                    formal—has otherwise “seemed to settle” (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 130). On the other 
                hand, though, Williams’s reflections reveal how new media work to smooth the flux of history into 
                programmatic <emph>flow</emph>—motion without variation or disturbance. Williams suggests 
                that <emph>flow</emph> may be a new form of fixity, and that suggestion in turn opens new questions 
                about Williams’s treatment of reading (in the medium of print), his commitment to metaphors of 
                liquidity (“in solution”), and his valuation of motion <emph>per se</emph>. We might learn more 
                about Austen as a “highly historical writer” by recognizing the limits of Williams’s treatment of 
                the novelist and adopting instead his insights about new media.</p>

                  <p>In quoting from Williams’s most influential work on Austen, I give page numbers from both 
               <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</title> and <title level="m">The 
                   Country and the City</title> because the analysis of Austen’s novels in the latter 
               repeats wholesale (then extends) that of the former. What interests me is not the obvious 
               change in norms of academic publishing but rather this conflation: that when Williams considers 
               Austen, his approach to a history of the novel and his approach to the social history of these 
               signal English spaces—country and city—so fully overlap. It’s almost as if his rendering of 
               Austen in <title level="m">The English Novel</title> motivates the larger project of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>—that is, how “land” is “seen”: if Austen “sees 
               land in a way that she does not see ‘other sources’ of income,” he will cultivate other ways 
               of seeing, attuned to “other sources,” especially labor (<title level="m">English 
                   Novel</title> 21; <title level="m">Country</title> 115).</p>
                  <p>The repetition in his analyses works in part because the figure of perspective—styled also as 
                “ways of seeing”—governs both projects. The movement of the eye implicit in perspective cannot 
                for Williams be dissociated from the mode of reading proposed in these works. In the second 
                chapter of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, <title level="a">The Problem of 
                    Perspective,</title> he explains that “the witnesses [i.e., authors and their texts] we 
                have summoned raise questions of historical fact and perspective, but they raise questions, 
                also, of literary fact and perspective” (12). For Williams <emph>perspective</emph>
                provides a provisional sort of mechanism for testing the assumptions of the present against 
                those of prior moments; more significantly, it helps to coordinate individual experience with 
                a given social structure. In this early effort, such coordination operates almost geometrically 
                in the (socially and dialectically) constructed spaces denominated as country and city. In fact, 
                recalling the function that it plays in painting, we recognize—as Williams must have—that 
                perspective figures the construction of those spaces. In his argument, the figure of perspective 
                helps to <emph>externalize</emph>, to diagram or map individual experience onto the perceived 
                world through lines of sight (see figure 1).</p>

                  <p>Additionally, the second chapter’s famous image of an
                    “escalator” moving through time as if through space (“back we would go again,
                    over the next hill, to the 1750s”) implies that solving the “problem of
                    perspective” requires movement (10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">“The fact of what I have 
                        called the escalator may be an important clue to the real history, but only when we begin to 
                        see the regularity of its patterns” (<title level="m">Country</title> 10).</note> (Williams’s 
                escalator functions more like a mechanized walkway than a moving staircase—it seems to move laterally, 
                not necessarily ascending or descending). For Williams, proper criticism promotes movement, training the 
                eye to travel between detail and distance, near and far, particular and general, along multiple 
                sightlines. In escalator fashion, <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> organizes the reader’s 
                movement past many  stopping points (the “direct experience” of individual witnesses), a movement which 
                then allows the reader to step back and recognize “the regularity of [the] patterns” that make up “real 
                history” (<title level="m">Country</title> 10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">A distinctly 
                    twentieth-century engine of mobility, the escalator concretizes Williams’s notion of “historical 
                    perspective” (<title level="m">Country</title> 9–12). The reader rides the escalator from one historical 
                    example to another, thus gaining a view of the “general pattern” of an idea. Yet “what seems like a 
                    single escalator, a perpetual recession into history,” Williams adds, “turns out to be a more 
                    complicated movement. . . . [A]t different times . . . quite different values are being brought to 
                    question. We shall need precise analysis of each kind of retrospect, as it comes [into view]” (<title level="m">Country</title> 12). The reader’s (or critic’s) job is to organize those various 
                    “retrospects” into a unified field: “real history.” As we will see below, the process Williams describes 
                    here mimics closely the functioning of perspective developed in renaissance painting and later in 
                    realist fiction.</note> Placing history within the sightlines of perspective, though, reduces felt 
                experience to a single mode of perception, and a rationalized mode of perception at that (figure 2).

                   concept of “structures of feeling”:
                        <quote>The things they [the witnesses] are saying
                                are not all in the same mode. They range, as facts, from a speech in

                                note in a journal. When the facts are poems, they are also, perhaps

                   “Structures of feeling” here seem (tellingly) synonymous with “poems” or <emph>kinds</emph> of poems; 
                   they bear some quality distinct from “fact,” yet submit to a ready taxonomy.</note> But <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> follows the sharp angles of perspective.</p>
                  <p>In these early works, the history available via <emph>perspective</emph> is mirrored by Williams’s mode 
                of reading. As Jean-Jacques Lecercle and others point out, it was Williams, contesting the tradition 
                laid down by F. R. Leavis, who prioritized literature for the New Left as it undertook its 
                investigations of British culture, an emphasis that continues to motivate literary critics.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“To put it in a nutshell, [for Williams] the centrality of literature to cultural 
                    change provides a mediation between the general determination of the superstructure by the base and 
                    the social experience, which, being lived and felt, will percolate down to the individual” 
                    (Lecercle 41). Lecercle puts stress on the literary <emph>per se</emph>; I want to stress the practice 
                    of <emph>reading</emph> that literature. See also Baskin, <title level="a">Romanticism, Culture,

                     </note> Framed by Williams’s view out his Cambridgeshire window, <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> works to concretize the ways in which <emph>reading</emph>
                offers a kind of <emph>perspective</emph>, binding the lived and felt experience of individuals to the 
                general forms of culture (e.g. literature, tradition). Reading can perform work similar to that of 
                perspective: the reader’s eye travels over the flat page on its way to building a three-dimensional 
                reality, a social totality defined by a horizon of “real history” beyond the page.

              To this end, especially in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, acts of reading and acts of seeing 
                overlap and amplify each other. You can leaf through the book and discover simply through the formatting a certain 
                reading practice: inset lines of verse stud and long block quotes knock and bump the way we follow the page. The 
                method does not differ from earlier works of literary criticism: like his own teachers, Williams trains our eyes 
                to read differently, more closely, these passages of quoted text. Yet because <title level="m">The Country and the
                City</title> consistently aligns reading with the landscape out the window (“back we . . . go again, over the next 
                hill, . . .”), the reader is encouraged to treat the printed page as topography, block quotes standing as landmarks 
                or outcroppings in the continually morphing landscape of British city and country. Analytic focus moves from close 
                to distant and back, the muscles of our inner eye as well as our reading eye exercised to toggle between small 
                detail (of text) and large prospect (of social history). What matters most is precisely that ongoing, alternating, 
                comparative movement, the constantly adjusting perspective: the work of the eye models the work of the mind.</p>
                  <p>The treatment of texts mimics Williams’s manner of visualizing the landscape of his country. Here, for instance, 
                Williams recounts something like the tour Elizabeth Bennett takes in <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title> when she visits “the principal wonders of the country” around Derbyshire, including 
                Pemberley (Austen 157).<note place="foot" resp="editors">He is prompted by reading Matthew Arnold’s description

                     <quote>It is fashionable to admire these extraordinarily numerous houses: the extended manors, the neoclassical

                    these “great” houses do is to break the scale, by an act of will corresponding to their real and systematic

               Our focus adjusts and readjusts throughout this paragraph:
                    it moves from “People” to “you” most notably, and from then to now, but also
                    from general series (“the next and the next example”), to pointed items (“the
                    stones and the furniture”; “those fields, those streams”), then back out to the
                    large prospect (“look at the land . . . and see the long and systematic . . .
                    exploitation”), only to swing back to reassess detail (“great iron gates,”
                    “guardian lodges”) before discovering finally beyond those details an abstract
                    truth: “you now see” the fact of “social disproportion.” Reading the page
                    teaches you to look at the landscape differently; looking at the landscape
                    (“look at the land”) teaches you to read anew: each is a lens correcting the
                    other. And both depend on that restless movement. The method, worked through
                    form as through argument, is so fully visualized and spatialized that its
                    extension into studies of landscape painting seems inevitable, if not
                    mandatory.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I’m thinking in particular of John Barrell’s powerful <title level="m">The Dark Side of the Landscape</title>, a conscious heir to Williams’s work.</note> The

                of a three-dimensional kind of vision that can move between “the inside out” and “the outside looking in.” 
                The dynamic is considerably more freighted and unsettled than the one we tend to associate with a surface/depth 
                hermeneutic of reading: here the insides and outsides of the manor houses figure at the very least a cartography 
                of class. They gesture to Williams’s own troubled position within and without the academic establishment.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="a">‘Soft Eyes’</title> Baskin uses Williams’s work to put 
                    to one side debates about surface and depth reading. He highlights a phenomenological element in Williams’s 
                    writing that understands depth as the condition of—and therefore inextricable from—surface (and vice versa). 
                    An understanding of perspective also makes this point. In the passage quoted here and elsewhere in his 
                    criticism, Williams will accentuate the class markers of these perspectival positions.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Williams constructs for his reader a mobile perspective
                    that he associates with many of his selected writers; but for him, Austen’s
                    perspective does not budge. Just a few pages after this tour of the manor
                    houses, Williams stages another lesson in vision and space in “Three around
                    Farnham.” “In this period of change,” the chapter begins, “it mattered very much
                    where you were looking from,” and Jane Austen is only ever looking from within
                    (108). As Williams maps the “perspectives” of three writers at work in the
                    Hampshire countryside circa 1800, Austen provides the pivot: she appears after
                    William Cobbett, the rabble-rousing outsider, has been shown riding his horse
                    around the neighborhood and before the Reverend Gilbert White strolls through
                    the gardens and woods of Selborne. In a world of flux she remains still: working
                    within “no single, settled society,” she nevertheless exhibits a “settled and
                    remarkably confident way of seeing” (113–14). Essentially enclosed, Williams’s
                    Austen is also strangely abstracted—the vanishing point in his picture of
                    Farnham. Williams concretely visualizes Cobbett: “a boy of fourteen, Cobbett ran
                    away from his father’s small farm at Farnham. Cobbett was to ride back through
                    these villages many times” (108, 117). And he lets White’s journal provide vivid
                    details of lived experience as the naturalist dissects a butcher-bird, notes the
                    ripening of berries, and attends to the horrific effects of the 1783 eruption of
                    the Laki volcano (118-19). By contrast, the figure of Austen remains hardly seen
                    behind those impenetrable walls: “not far away, in another parsonage, Jane
                    Austen was beginning to write. . . . in Chawton . . . inside the houses Cobbett
                    was passing on the road. . . . from the other side of the park wall. . . . from
                    inside the houses” (108, 112, 113, 117). No rooms divide this interior world, no
                    upstairs or downstairs, no delineation of domestic routine: “walls” and “houses”
                    are as concrete as it gets. Even as she tracks the “facts of general change and
                    a certain mobility” affecting the families of the landed classes, the novelist
                    herself remains <foreign xml:id="fr">immeuble</foreign> (113).</p>

                  <p>Like the novelist, Austen’s fiction remains both already known (settled, composed) yet hardly 
                seen. In both these early works Williams barely quotes from the novels: two sets of fewer 
                than three lines from <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, followed by a series of small 
                scraps, not even sentences, and those only in order “to abstract this social history” which 
                motivates him (115) (figure 4). He does not have to submit these bits for close analysis any 
                more than he has to put quotation marks around a truth universally acknowledged (113). 
                Compared to the large blocks of <title level="m">Tom Jones</title> or <title level="m">larissa</title>, of Eliot’s fiction and Hardy’s, mention of Austen’s novels 
                blends into the page, barely registering topographically because they are already part of, 
                fully within, the known landscape. The techniques Austen develops “would only have to 
                be <emph>taken outside the park walls</emph>” by later novelists to gain the requisite 
                distance to become a properly “social criticism” worthy of more sustained attention, of 
                that recommended mobile focalizing, close and distant, by the reader (<title level="m">English
                    Novel</title> 23; <title level="m">Country</title> 117; emphasis added).</p>
                  <p>In <title level="a">Knowable Communities,</title> a later chapter of <title level="m">The 
                   Country and the City</title>, Williams insists upon the intimate, inside the walls, 
                   “face-to-face” scale of Austen’s world:
                   <quote>It is outstandingly face-to-face; its crises, physically and spiritually, are in 
                       just these terms: a look, a gesture, a stare, a confrontation; and behind these, all 
                       the time, the novelist is watching, observing, <emph>physically</emph> recording and 
                       reflecting. (166) </quote>
                     <emph>Outstandingly</emph> visual, the novelist (not unlike the critic) is gifted at seeing and 
                   recording <emph>how others see</emph>, yet little but seeing seems to be seen. As Williams
                    notes elsewhere, what Austen sees is “understandably internal and exclusive”
                    without benefit of larger movement or distance (117).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Williams does not mention any outdoor scenes in the novels: neither, 
                        for instance, the satire of the picturesque in Bath (<title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>), nor the passage in <title level="m">Emma</title> where Emma

                            fits the concerns of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, where 
                        narrator, protagonist, and reader all stand and look at the grounds of Donwell Abbey:

                        Free indirect discourse makes it difficult to know if we can take this ideologically 
                        laden view at face value.</note> “Understandably” means we already know why: the 
                   reasons <emph>stand under</emph> our feet, beneath our gaze, without obtruding upon the 
                       page. In a pattern that marks his analysis of Austen, <emph>outstanding</emph> features 
                   are absorbed, folded into the <emph>understood</emph>. At the same time, her “settled and 
                   remarkably confident way of seeing” masks a stunted way of seeing: a “foreshortening” of 
                   perspective, a “blurring of [the] forces” at work on the larger social prospect (120, 166). 
                   Cobbett, perpetually riding by on his horse, can read “class” written on the countryside; 
                   Austen, perpetually “inside the houses,” “can never see that”: the common “underlying 
                   economic process” (117). When Edward Said quotes these lines in <title level="m">Culture 
                       and Imperialism</title> (84), Susan Fraiman calls him—and Williams—out for clinging to 
                   “the myth of feminine myopia”: 
                   <quote>While Said wants to go beyond Williams’s class analysis, his Austen, too, is tied 
                       to and constrained by a domestic purview in a specifically gendered way. Defined thus, 
                       her work is offered as “the perfect example” (<title level="m">C&amp;I</title>, 59) 
                       of the hegemonic geography emergent in the pre-imperialist period, centered on a 
                       Eurocentric formulation of the category “home.” Positioned at the beginning of his 
                       genealogy and at the heart of his argument, Austen’s fiction works, at least in part, 
                       to characterize as domestic and to sex as feminine the larger body of European 
                       culture. (Fraiman 819)</quote>

                           crucially, he ignores the ways gender inflects the novel’s presentation of empire

                                his book (1).</note> Fraiman’s reading of Said suggests that Williams’s 
                    positioning of Austen serves as a way of domesticating and feminizing—and I would 
                    add, <emph>immobilizing</emph>—the landholding class and the culture it produced, validating 
                    by contrast a certain modern—and masculinized—ethic of mobility.</p>
                  <p>“Ethic of mobility” is a term borrowed from Elizabeth Deeds Ermarth’s foundational study of 
                  realist fiction, <title level="m">Realism and Consensus in the English Novel: Time, Space 
                      and Narrative</title> (1983). The term implies that Austen’s status for Williams is not 
                  just a function of gender; it may also be a question of genre. Ermarth explains how pictorial 
                  perspective finds its narrative counterpart in literary realism and how this shared logic of 
                  perspective demands from both an “ethic of mobility” (Ermarth 55–58). I cannot do justice 
                  here to Ermarth’s meticulous work, but the link she forges between perspective and realism 
                  reminds us that Williams approaches the English novel as a realist project. More significantly, 
                  her insights suggest that <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, with its 
                  investment in perspective, adopts the techniques of realist fiction—and nowhere more overtly 
                  than in <title level="a">Three around Farnham.</title> That chapter asks the reader to track 
                  and compare three specific cases, unified in time and space, in order to arrive at an abstract 
                  idea of what Williams calls “real history.” In perspectival drawings, Ermarth explains, “the 
                  actual form of something [its identity] emerges from a series of vantage points” or 
                  “appearances”; realist narrative similarly depends upon a reader sorting and comparing multiple 
                  appearances (e.g., Cobbett, Austen, White) in order to compose a social whole.
                  <quote>[The] invariant identity of anything
                    cannot be identified at once, but only eventually, through a series where
                    similitudes and recurrent elements can be distinguished among the differences.
                    [Given a homogeneous sense of time and space] the details . . . understood as

                    visual apprehension, or, as in the novel, of apprehension by any single
                    individual, in a single moment. (Ermarth 16)</quote>
                  What Ermath designates as “series,”
                    Williams dubs “pattern” or “general movement” made visible by the moving
                    escalator—and the ongoing motions of reading; the “hidden whole” is the social
                    totality or “real history.” For Ermarth, an ethic of mobility both supports and
                    follows from the work perspective performs in painting and narrative realism; it
                    applies as well to the work perspective performs in Williams’s mode of critical
                    reading.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ermarth distinguishes perspectival painting 
                        from the realist novel: “viewpoint in realist fiction is not (despite the spatial 
                        metaphor) a matter of sight and space; it is a matter of time and consciousness” (64). 
                        Williams seems to collapse this distinction, repeatedly mapping the time of reading as 
                        a realm of vision and space.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ermarth derives the term “ethic of mobility” in contrast to the “ethic of stillness” which Leo 
                    Bersani uses to characterize Austen’s <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. Stillness makes 
                    that novel a limit case, whose “social universe is inimical to the values of realism” and whose 
                    “social hierarchy . . . depends upon maintaining position” (Ermarth 55). Or, as Bersani puts 
                    it, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> is a novel where a “tremblingly still Fanny Price” 
                    registers “a sense of the dangers”—and <emph>demands</emph>, we might add, thinking of the way 
                    Fanny is swapped between homes—“of movement” (Bersami 75). Bersani and Ermarth together suggest 
                    that Austen’s fiction may not always fit the logic of perspective governing realism; it may not 
                    always move in the ways narrative realism would come to demand. Indeed, recent critical work by 
                    Anne-Lise François (on <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>), Sonia Hofkosh (on <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>), and Williams Galperin (on all the novels) have given us 
                    ways of reading Austen against the currents of realism, and within a capacious understanding of 
                    romance. We might simply recall the fragile bubble of romance in <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, where the lovers step away from vision, sightlines and 
                    chronological time: they “slowly pace,” “heedless of every group around them, seeing neither 
                    sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and 
                    children, . . . and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end” (240–41).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The scene modifies one in <title level="m">Emma</title>, mentioned 
                        in <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.gilmartin.html">Kevin Gilmartin’s

                                perspective as she stands in the shop door, seeing members of more
                                than one class move through the main street of Highbury.</note> Another reason 
                    that Austen fails to appear fully in Williams’s work, then, could be this: her fiction 
                    cannot be seen fully within the framework of the realist novel; it eludes a realist mode 
                    of reading.</p>
                  <p>When Williams does envision a concrete image of Austen the novelist—“behind these [looks, etc.], 
                    all the time . . . watching, observing, <emph>physically</emph> recording and reflecting”—the 
                    image startles: not just because its apparently 3D depiction of Austen relies on a hard-to-locate 
                    “behind” (is she behind the faces? behind the words we read?); and not just because 
                    “<emph>physically</emph> recording and reflecting” raises further questions about the materiality 
                    of the scene (does <emph>physically</emph> recording describe an act of eye, hand, or ear? 
                    Does <emph>physically</emph> also modify reflecting?) (<title level="m">Country</title> 166). 
                    The language startles because the watcher-recorder surfaces only to vanish again. Just watch: 
                    “Her eye for a house, for timber, for the details of improvement,” Williams notes, “is quick, 
                    accurate, monetary” (115). We see a quick eye, her eye. Then:
                    <quote>Yet money or other kinds, from the trading houses, from the colonial plantations, has 
                        no visual equivalent; it <emph>has to be converted</emph> into these signs of order <emph>to 
                            be recognised</emph> at all. This way of seeing is especially representative. <emph>The 
                                land is seen</emph> primarily as an index of revenue and position; its visible order 
                        and control are a valued product, while the process of working <emph>it is hardly seen</emph> 
                        at all. (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 22; <title level="m">Country</title> 115; 
                            emphasis added)</quote>
                  What happens to her eye, to her, in “this way of seeing”?
                    Elsewhere in this collection of essays, Brian McGrath diagnoses this recurrent
                    feature of Williams’s prose, the recourse to the passive voice. Used sometimes
                    ironically, the passive voice can demonstrate, McGrath writes, “how difficult it
                    can be to determine and stabilize the difference between subjects and objects
                    (the agents who act and the things that are acted upon)” (McGrath). Like
                    perspective, then, the passive voice operates as another mechanism for holding
                    together the individual instance with the larger social whole. In Williams’s
                    writing about Austen, though, its use matches a pervasive disappearing of this
                    woman and her novels. Some unstated generality or abstracting force (“the land
                    is seen,” “the process . . . is hardly seen”) absorbs the novelist, leaving “no
                    visual equivalent” of her “process of working” (the irony hits hard) (<title level="m">Country</title> 115). The abstracting happens again when Williams 
                    decrees,  “Where only one class is seen, no classes are seen” (117). And again, 
                    when “through the holes of this tightly-drawn mesh most actual people are not to be 
                    seen,” the mesh-maker in turn drops from view, written over by abstraction and stark 
                    impersonality (call it the park wall) (118). D. A. Miller will later twist the 
                    characterization, attributing to the novelist this refusal of embodied personhood, 
                    as if it were a mode of protection, effacing <emph>perforce</emph> her “peculiar” social 
                    status as spinster-woman-author, before “disappearing” into a flawless style 
                    (Miller 8–9).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Nick Dames adapts Williams’s 
                        characterization: “Austen has that trick of slipping out of focus, of seeming to be 
                        vanishing into the historical background even as she’s coming closer to us” 
                        (95).</note> Williams shows less sympathy. His paragraph concludes:
                    “No other community [than the landed gentry] . . . is by any means knowable. And
                    it is not only most of the people who have disappeared. . . . [it] is also most
                    of the country, which becomes real [in these novels] only as it relates to the
                    houses which are the real nodes; for the rest the country is weather or a place
                    for a walk” (<title level="m">Country</title> 166).</p>
                  <p>The taut cadence and irony of that last clause—“for the
                    rest the country is weather or a place for a walk”—is nearly Austenian. It
                    signals, if not contempt, then at least Williams’s alienation from this specific
                    “knowable community” and its mode of seeing. But Williams overlooks Austen’s own
                    ironies, and overlooks too her own manner of alienation from the network of
                    manor houses (and her sometimes forced movement among them), all of which might
                    position her differently on the landscape, with a less stable angle of vision.
                    Both <title level="m">The English Novel</title> and <title level="m">The City and the 
                        Country</title> ignore the slippages and fissures of Austen’s irony, emphasizing 
                     instead the “achievement of a unity of tone,” “her remarkable unity of tone,” “a 
                     unity of language in all its main uses,” “a remarkable unity of tone” and what the 
                     editors of <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> echo in citing her 
                     “extraordinary unity of tone” (<title level="m">Country</title> 115, 116, 
                     169; <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 228). With George Eilot, 
                     Williams can hear fracture and inconsistency, a “break in the texture” and 
                     coherent “idiom” inherited from Austen. Such dissonance gives evidence of the 
                     “acute difficulty” Eliot takes on when trying to comprehend a broader social 
                     world than her predecessor (<title level="m">Country</title> 168–69).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In an extraordinary passage, Williams announces his class 
                         sympathies with Eliot (168–71).</note> In Austen’s fiction he hears no 
                     dissonance; hardly seeing, he seems hardly to hear. Impervious unity of tone 
                     provides the aural equivalent of her “remarkably settled and confident way of 
                     seeing,” elsewhere concretized in the impregnable walls that fix and delimit Jane 
                     Austen. All three—enclosing walls, settled way of seeing, unified tone—betoken 
                     the exclusive <emph>status</emph> (quite literal) of Austen’s social world. 
                     Features of the landscape as much as features of style, they function as 
                     objective correlatives of the otherwise “unseen formula” or rigid “grammar” 
                     of Austen’s writing, where “improvement is or ought to be improvement” (<title level="m">Country</title> 116). As William Galperin points out in <title level="m">Historical Austen</title>, Williams’s approach “assumes that 
                     Austen’s representational technique could only work in one register and to a single 
                     purpose” (Galperin 2). One might add: and from one fixed location and in one tone.</p>
                  <p>The urge to position Austen in terms of something settled, composed, and unified aligns with 
                     Williams’s need for a “point of origin” or, more precisely, a point of departure for critique 
                     (“to be <emph>taken outside the park walls</emph>”). The effort to keep Austen a settled matter 
                     nonetheless produces its own strain and discomposure in Williams’s writing, which 
                     characteristically gravitates toward a mobile and shifting perspective (the escalator), or 
                     toward friction, and unsettledness. I have remarked on the awkward picture of the novelist 
                     “behind . . . <emph>physically</emph> recording”; there is also the “is <emph>or ought to 
                         be</emph>” which snags the neat formula of Austen’s settled view of improvement. 
                     Additionally there are repeated (apologetic?) notes of exceptionalism (“outstanding,” 
                     “remarkable,” “extraordinary”) that jar an account that otherwise assimilates Austen’s work 
                     into a representative, hegemonic, and uniform way of seeing.</p>
                  <p>The effort to maintain Austen as a fixed entity—the requisite vanishing point—does begin to wobble 
                later, in <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>. There Williams suggests that Austen’s 
                achieved unity was hardly achieved: “In my view Jane Austen makes a very <emph>strenuous</emph> 
                attempt to unify what was not unifiable” (228; emphasis added). Or achieved only through magic: 
                he calls up a favorite image of the novelist accomplishing the “reconciliation of property and 
                value like a supernatural lawyer.” The supernatural lawyer appears in both <title level="m">The 
                    English Novel</title> and <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>: this third time it 
                feels almost insistent (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 23; <title level="m">Country</title> 
                116; <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 228). Williams’s simile introduces a note of 
                historical impossibility, of fantasy operating in a world he otherwise subjects fully to the 
                protocols of realism. In claiming that her “settlements are an artificial solution” that will 
                provide the “basis for critique” in the work of subsequent novelists, Williams seems not quite to 
                recognize that the manifest artificiality, extraordinariness, and, for lack of a better word, 
                <emph>romance</emph> of these settlements already form a kind of critique (<title level="m">Politics 
                    and Letters</title> 228).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This recognition of the critical force 
                        of romance at work in Austen’s realism animates Galperin’s study, and warrants his revision 
                        of what it means for Austen to be “historical.” In <title level="a">The Illusionist: <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> and Austen’s Uses of Enchantment,</title> Sonia
                                Hofkosh similarly renovates a strain of criticism that pulls Austen’s fiction away 
                                from conventional realism. Williams does indicate that if he had begun his history of 
                                the English novel in the 1790s, “I think this would have yielded a different 
                                perspective on Jane Austen” (225). His comments suggest that the fiction of the 
                                1790s (e.g., Godwin’s) had to be suppressed after the turn of the century and did 
                                not resurface until the 1830s. Presumably Austen would for Williams mark suppression 
                                or reaction, not continuation of earlier Gothic and romance impulses.</note> Quietly, 
                slightly, something begins to shift and move in the way he speaks of Austen. After pages spent 
                fending off the stringent objections of his interlocutors on the topic of Austen’s fiction, objections 
                which seem to stand in for a discussion of tradition and literature <emph>per se</emph>, Williams 
                turns an unforeseen corner. What had been assumed “understandably” in <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title> now needs to be investigated: “In Austen’s case, I would now say that two 
                special conditions of her ideological stance were decisive: She was doubly marginalized in relation 
                to her class, as a dependent within it, and as a woman” (<title level="m">Politics and 
                    Letters</title> 230). The ground shifts, sending Austen to a more precarious position on the 
                margins of the propertied class. To which Williams’s interlocutors respond, “Turning to 
                Dickens . . .” (230).</p>

                    insights, to engage Austen anew through the more mobile, multistranded and
                    contentious mode that Williams developed for his histories of film and
                    television, media forms which have amply welcomed Jane Austen—her fiction and
                    her fictionalized life. Features that had hardened into familiarity, the park
                    walls drawn around that “subject,” are set in motion when television, film, and
                    a range of digital media testify that the “areas of common life” denominated by
                    “Jane Austen” extend now—and have in fact extended for a century—well beyond an
                    English countryside, and indeed beyond an English or even literary tradition,
                    and well beyond the enclosure of a unified style.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Claudia Johnson’s 
                        work (<title level="a">The Divine Miss Jane</title>; <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Cults and
                                Cultures</title>) has paved the way to a sophisticated recognition of various “Jane 
                        Austens” travelling since the mid-1800s throughout Anglo-American popular culture and well into 
                        subcultures.</note> Two concerns emerge with this change of approach. First, the terms Williams 
                 develops to speak of new media—television especially—help us perceive how deeply Austen’s fiction is 
                 informed and vexed by questions of motion, temporality, and tempo (rather than the questions of vision 
                 and space raised by Williams’s earlier work). Of course motion has a place in all Austen’s fiction (think 
                 only of Catherine Morland’s carriage ride with John Thorpe, or Elizabeth Bennett’s muddy walk); but motion 
                 (along with stasis) is subject to severe scrutiny in her later work: <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and <title level="m">Sanditon</title>. Second, Williams’s analysis also suggests that in grasping this aspect 
                 of Austen’s work, new media risk exploiting and sanitizing it, smoothing its
                    vexations into harmonious and continual “flow.” In short, Williams’s writing on
                    media reveals the limitations of both his early work on Austen’s novels and the
                    later adaptation of those novels by new media. If Austen led him to translate
                    reading to a mode of seeing, new media lead him to worry about reading converted
                    to a mode of watching.</p>
                  <p>With the move to the study of media comes a heightened attention in Williams’s method to multiple lines of 
                development (no single tradition or <emph>telos</emph>) as well as a reconsideration of the appeal of 
                mobility. He finds for instance that <emph>independent of narrative content</emph>, the medium of film 
                provides “experiences of mobility, dislocation and alienation, but also intense curiosity 
                <emph>about</emph> movement and newly possible dynamic forms” (142; emphasis added). The emphasis extends 
                to his reflections on television, which offers not just a curiosity about mobility but—and again, 
                independent of specific content—a newly mobile way of viewing: the “primary processes of the technology 
                [of television],” he explains, promote a new “kind of attention,” “an experience of visual mobility, of 
                contrast of angle, of variation of focus, which is often very beautiful” (<title level="m">Television</title> 
                74–75). In both film and television the movement associated with the technology and an individual’s 
                experience of that movement form part of a “whole social experience . . . of greater physical and social 
                mobility” (87–88). Television makes Williams’s figure of the escalator (strained to begin with) unusable: 
                motion expands almost infinitely even as it becomes more recursive and constraining. Wary of the greater 
                mobility of new media, Williams’s analyses discard the spatialized, perspectival vision that informs <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, working instead with temporal markers of rhythm and tempo, 
                as well as sonic qualities of dissonance and silence.</p>
                  <p>What preoccupies Williams about television especially (and his “television” powerfully anticipates 
                subsequent new media) is the “concept of flow,” a reformulation of sequence and interval without 
                interruption, where rhythmic and seemingly “natural breaks” foster “the impulse to go on watching”—not 
                unlike, perhaps, the experience of reading serialized novels in print. Yet “watching” directs itself at no 
                particular content, but simply an undifferentiated, horizonless, and ever-streaming “television,” quite 
                distinct from the topographical model of seeing/reading promoted in <title level="m">The Country and the 
                    City</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the continuing relevance of Williams’s <title level="m">Television</title>, see Jim McGuigan, <title level="a">What Can We Still Learn about

                                scale that not long ago would have seemed utopian. These are the
                                contemporary tools of the long revolution towards an educated and
                                participatory democracy, and of the recovery of effective

                subordinate to a certain tempo and movement captured by the liquid “flow” of ceaseless programming. 
                Williams searches for both revolutionary and counterrevolutionary impulses in the phenomenon, 
                but <title level="m">Television</title> ends on this dystopian note:
                <quote>Under cover of talk about choice and competition, a few
                    para-national corporations, with their attendant states and agencies, could

                    individual and collective response to many different kinds of experience and
                    problem became almost limited to choice between their programmed possibilities.
                    (151)</quote>
                In contrast to older and, as Williams sees it, more
                    “static” notions of programming (in conventional modes of entertainment and
                    education), “the flow [of new media] is always accessible, in many simultaneous
                    and alternative sequences, at the flick of a switch”—or, we might now say, at
                    the touch of a button or utterance of a command. “Both internally, in its
                    immediate organization, and as a generally available experience,” “flow”
                    indicates a mobile, primarily <emph>temporal</emph> mode of experience, inflected but not broken or 
                divided by individual activity (95). As one scholar put it, Williams finds in the “flow” of television 
                the theater of capitalism—and an apt image for capitalism’s principle of utter fungibility and 
                exchangeability.<note place="foot" resp="editors">John Hartley, quoted on the back cover of the

                  <p>What would happen if we understood Jane Austen within that flow, continuously available “at the flick of 
                 a switch” in multiple, simultaneously streaming manifestations? And what might Austen know of flow? A 
                 concept of flow might be one way of reconsidering the recursive everydayness of a novel like <title level="m">Emma</title> and its investigation of how choice—even for the privileged heroine—resides 
                 only in “programmed possibilities.” More specifically, such an approach would suggest how and to what 
                 extent <title level="m">Emma</title>’s creation of a fictional everyday—praised by Walter Scott for its 
                 seamless fusion with the reader’s “own social habits” such that “the youthful wanderer may return from 
                 his promenade to the ordinary business of life, without any chance of having his head turned by the 
                 recollection of the scene through which he has been wandering”—might coincide with the ordinary business 
                 and ongoing flow of new media (68). (In addition to several film versions, “Clueless” [1995] adapted 
                 from <title level="m">Emma</title> and translated to Beverly Hills, spawned a TV series, <title level="a">Clueless</title> [1996–1999] and the video blog, <title level="a">Emma Approved,</title> all 
                 of which are continuously flowing through online media services. “Stream Anytime,” Amazon advises.) In the 
                 space that remains, though, I follow “flow” and the attendant qualities of tempo and silence in another 
                 direction, using the case of Austen’s last novel, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>,
                    and its televised 1996 remediation directed by Roger Michell (later turned into
                    a film, also available for streaming).<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        has lent itself to television on several occasions. Four made-for-television adaptations of the novel 
                        were made in Britain, beginning in 1960. The most recent was in 2007 for ITV1. The 1995 miniseries 
                        was subsequently released as a film in the United States, following the success of Ang Lee and Emma 
                        Thompson’s <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1996).</note> In <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, punctual event, threat, and work itself (domestic and military) 
                 promote competing and sometimes irreconcilable rhythms and temporalities, resolved uncertainly by what 
                 the last page of the novel calls “the tax of quick alarm.” These competing tempos provide part of the 
                 historical and critical force of the novel. But they are absorbed by the televised version and, as 
                 Williams guides us to see, channeled via transnational capitalism into a more harmonious flow.</p>
                  <p>It will be obvious to most Austen readers that <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, the one novel of hers 
                   that Williams cites, however sparingly, is also the novel least stabilized by the economies of the park wall 
                   and the landed gentry. <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is Austen’s most aqueous book, set in motion 
                   by the return of naval officers. Sir Walter Elliott must move to leased housing in Bath and rent his family 
                   estate; his renter is Admiral Croft, flush with prize money and newly returned from the Navy in 1814, the 
                   year of the so-called false peace (in this novel Austen <emph>does</emph> work carefully to bring together 
                   the upending events of the Napoleonic Wars with the unsettling social reality of the home front). Social 
                   instability is newly, baldly evident in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> in the figures of the scheming
                   widow Mrs. Clay, the gossiping invalid Mrs. Smith, and the wounded officer, Captain Harville (the
                    mobility of the latter two seriously, physically impeded). A disturbing sense of
                    flux lurks in unelaborated memories of the sailors’ years at sea and in the
                    visit the protagonists make to Lyme Regis, where they walk upsetting promenades
                    at the water’s edge. A pervasive unease makes itself heard, moreover, in the
                    unprecedented bitterness of the narrator’s ironies and “lapses” of tone: a
                    report, for instance, on “the large, fat sighings” of a mother recalling the
                    death of her son, “whom alive nobody had cared for” (68).<note place="foot" resp="editors">D. A. Miller

                   that are new to Austen’s fiction, agitation asserts itself. In the various falls, faints, and dizziness that 
                   beset its characters and organize its plot, mobility-as-dislocation signals more than an economic and social 
                   experience, and more than an occasion for moral improvement. They penetrate now somatically and affectively, 
                   revealing “what escapes or seems to escape from the fixed and the explicit and the known”—revealing, that is, 
                   what Williams names a “structure of feeling.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">I gave a reading of these

               Whatever loss the lines might register is pacified by repetition (the flowing sequence of exchangeable similes, 
               the feminine rhyme, the easy concord of the reciters) as well as the excerptability of the lines, their ready 
               portability from one story to another and another. More formally, the TV series opens and closes with scenes shot 
               on water. An extraordinary underwater shot, all blue flow—beautiful in the way Williams identifies the contentless 
               visual mobility of television—is the first thing to appear on screen, the camera then surfacing to the steady, 
               diagetic pulse of oars (with extradiegetic harpsichord) as rowers ferry Admiral Croft to his ship. The abstraction 
               of the initial image and the cadence of the oars together defuse any turbulence an underwater view might portend 
               to the men of the Royal Navy. The film ends, again at sea, with another wordless scene Austen did not imagine: 
               now married to Captain Wentworth, Anne Elliott stands with him on the deck of a ship he commands as sailors go 
               about their daily chores (swabbing the deck, etc.). The camera pulls back to display the man-of-war floating 
               serenely westward, then  silhouetted against a glorious sunset. Like the first underwater shot, the final image 
               surrenders depth to undulation across a two-dimensional surface. A swelling orchestral arrangement gives way to 
               the piano, which closes the film in simple descending chords. The two final shots of the film, the naval vessel 
               moving west and then poised on the horizon, were taken from footage of the film <title level="m">The
                   Bounty</title>, a 1984 remake of <title level="m">The Mutiny on the
                Bounty</title> and the latest of five film versions (Parrill 156). A ready portability from one story to 
                another and another.</p>
                  <p>From one image of the British Navy, a mutiny in the South Pacific in 1789, to this peaceably unmappable picture 
                of married contentment (perhaps post-Waterloo: the novel and miniseries are pointedly set in 1814, but we have no 
                idea when Wentworth is sent back to sea with Anne nor if, as in 1815, Britain is again at war), the movement of 
                this footage from film to television is itself made possible by flow—in this case, the flow of capital funding 
                for <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. What began as a BBC project became a global enterprise via partnership 
                with station WGBH in Boston, sponsored in turn by the Mobile Oil Corporation,  backer of WGBH’s popular 
                Masterpiece Theater program, and joined ultimately with Millésime Productions, a French company. (The TV 
                miniseries–turned–feature film was distributed by Sony Classics beginning in 1997). With this boost of funding, 
                the project moved from a chamber piece set primarily indoors to a much more ambitious historical romance, with 
                the ability to film outdoors on location (in Bath and Lyme) and to purchase footage from the American-British-New 
                Zealand product <title level="m">The Bounty</title> (starring the Australian Mel Gibson and Welsh actor Anthony 
                Hopkins). Expanding what might be considered the world of the novel, taking it well beyond the park walls, the 
                scenes at sea also participate materially and thematically in the concept of flow as Williams defines it.</p>
                  <p>Such transnational enterprises have marked Austen’s entry into film and television for decades, and effectively 
                made of Jane Austen a brand that circulates the globe. This is not news. But the concept of flow and its 
                soothing rhythms, which so thoroughly inhabit the 1995 television adaptation of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, set in relief the less steady motions, the discordant tempos of the novel. 
                If, in closing, we return to the novel not looking at its topography, nor pacified
                    by memory of the flowing films, but with an ear for its own distinctive tempos,
                    we can hear its enduring, unsettled dissonances more sharply.</p>
                  <p>On the largest scale we might point to the difference between Anne’s domesticating rhythms and those of the 
                military enterprise that employs Wentworth and his fellow sailors. But such differences can be registered on 
                smaller scales as well. The bouts of dizziness, for instance, that punctuate <title level="m">Persuasion</title>—like the several falls, evidence of unsteady and erratic movement as well 
                as historical instability—are mostly filtered through a free indirect discourse tied to Anne. Her 
                consciousness is “bombarded,” as A. Walton Litz puts it, leaving her to endure private, interior waves of 
                turbulence (228). That internal rhythm is juxtaposed to an exterior tempo embodied by Wentworth. As John 
                Wilshire has remarked, Captain Wentworth serves as an agent of speed and suddenness: he is described often 
                in motion, moving “in an instant” with a “quicker step,” often threatening Anne’s equilibrium (Wiltshire 171). 
                The two rhythms, of inner turbulence and outer impetuousness, are so starkly opposed that they seem impossible 
                to harmonize—until they do, magically, when Anne and Wentworth finally manage to be alone together. But the 
                deep discord of those competing rhythms rumbles in the last lines of the novel, where the narrator relays that 
                <quote>[h]is profession was all that could ever make her friends
                    wish [Anne’s] tenderness less; the dread of a future war all that could dim her
                    sunshine. She gloried in being a sailor’s wife, but she must pay the tax of
                    quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more
                    distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance. (<title level="m">Persuasion</title> 252)</quote>
                It’s a foreboding resolution, to say the least, the
                    repeated “all” of the opening sentence hardly sounding settled or promising
                    stability. And who thinks “if possible”: Anne? The narrator? Social consensus?
                    There is no firm ground; point of view—that is, <emph>perspective</emph>—feels impossible 
                to secure. Reading instead for tempo (“all that could
                    make . . . all that could dim”), what strikes me now is the odd phrase, “must
                    pay the tax of quick alarm.” The phrasing is rhythmic and precise, a small
                    shadow neatly tucked under the sunny smile of “she gloried.” In contrast to the
                    preceding sentences, its monosyllables offer something simple, matter-of-fact,
                    and almost proverbial. Yet “quick alarm” worries in part because of its seeming
                    redundancy: the novel has been full of quick alarms, but this phrase raises the
                    possibility of slow alarms we have not registered.</p>
                  <p>In these irreconcilable tempos, the novel here and elsewhere works with and against the concept 
                 of flow. “Paying the tax of quick alarm” yokes Anne’s emotional state to the coffers of the state, 
                 which had routinely, and more aggressively in the decades since Napoleon’s rise, proliferated modes of 
                 taxation so as to fund the wars with France (William Pitt introduced, among other funding schemes, the 
                 first individual income tax) (Brewer 110–11). But it is not clear what relation between our heroine’s 
                 emotional life and the state economy is suggested by the phrase. Had the author of <title level="m">Keywords</title> included “tax” in his vocabulary of society and culture, he would have 
                 noted the slow turn away from the etymological link between “tax” and an obligatory “task” or job, and 
                 toward its current association with money exacted by government authorities. He might have noted as well 
                 the way taxes can coordinate individual activity (e.g., labor) with the demands of a larger sociopolitical 
                 entity through the medium of money. Austen’s language insists on tax as payment. But in what sense must 
                 Anne <emph>pay</emph> taxes? And is paying the tax a consequence of her “profession,” understood less as 
                 work (task) than as a mode of being (<emph>glorying</emph> and exhibiting “domestic virtues”)? Or is paying 
                 tax  a <emph>duty</emph> (another word for tax) evenly distributed across the
                    populace? I wonder whether the tax she must pay is a one-time offering or part
                    of a general pattern, a periodic or indeed continuous demand. “Tax” hints that
                    some species of slow alarm subtends the quick alarms so crisply forecast.</p>
                  <p>In any case, the notion of payment proposes to regulate feeling: paying a tax helps to pace Anne’s 
                undifferentiated dread into smaller installments of quick alarm. Paying the tax furthermore recycles 
                alarm—quietly, with no need for Anne to say a word—into the hands of the state, where it can flow out to 
                support future military endeavors. All that could make, all that could dim, all channeled into paying the 
                tax. And yet the resolution proposed here for coordinating Anne’s interior state with the workings of a 
                militarized state can hardly be read as smoothly reassuring. Rather, it exposes and questions the 
                mechanisms by which such resolutions are engineered.</p>
                  <p>Written by the sister of naval officers, <title level="m">Persuasion</title> understands paying attention as 
                paying a tax, funneling one’s private, emotional turbulence into the ongoing operations of the British Navy 
                and the empire it will maintain. In <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, a militarized state anticipates the 
                “para-national corporations, with their attendant states and agencies,” that “could further reach into our 
                lives, at every level from news to psycho-drama” (Williams, <title level="m">Television</title> 151). When 
                Williams meditates on “the concept of flow,” and studies how new media like television ask us simply and 
                continually “to watch,” he is updating a Romantic phenomenon that Lily Gurton-Wachter, in her <title level="m">Watchwords</title>, has illuminated so well—and that Austen fully grasps.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This paragraph owes a debt to Gurton-Wachter’s important analysis of the culture 
                        of alarm and attentiveness in Romantic-era Britain.</note> The friction she generates in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> offers proleptic resistance to that flow Williams locates in the 
                theater of capitalism. Watching, she might say, can be taxing.</p>
                  <p>It should not surprise us that television cannot admit such taxation. The 1995 television adaptation 
                   of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> eliminates the dread, the tax, and the quick alarm. It
                    does not wrestle to coordinate Anne’s domesticating rhythms with those of the
                    man of war; she enters his world fully and wordlessly. The two stand together on
                    the deck of a battleship, smile at each other, and look out placidly, watching,
                    watching the empty ocean. A ship floats in silhouette on the flowing water.
                    Everything is externalized, and everyone at sea.</p>

                    writers on two sides of the park wall, and argue that the Past Masters volume on
                    Cobbett deserves to be more fully appreciated as a significant late work, both in
                    terms of its historical method and its sense of the significance of the Romantic
                    period, which is strikingly aligned with Williams’s own contingent historical

                  <p>In writing a doctoral thesis in English in the late 1980s on the
                radical journalism of William Cobbett, William Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt, I was
                assisted by remarkably supportive dissertation committee, and by the way the New
                Historicism directed attention to literary expression as material practice and to
                texts that were once regarded as nonliterary. At the same time, I was persistently
                reminded of resistance within Romantic studies, particularly in North America, to
                the literary study of nonfiction prose that had little to do with poetry and
                fiction, and that first appeared in ephemeral newspapers and magazines. In
                retrospect, a proposed but never written chapter on Percy Shelley became a
                placeholder for a more direct engagement with the Romantic canon, in a dissertation
                that wound up instead arguing for the richness and complexity of radical expression
                on its own terms. While Hazlitt and Hunt had acquired ancillary status through their
                critical and personal relationships with the major Romantic poets, Cobbett was the
                real outlier and a source of difficulty as the dissertation project developed. To be
                sure, there were developments within Romantic studies that encouraged attention to
                Cobbett and the radical press, notably Marilyn Butler’s <title level="m">Romantics,
                    Rebels, and Reactionaries</title> (1982) and Jon Klancher’s <title level="m">The
                    Making of English Reading Audiences</title> (1987). But through the earliest
                conceptions of the project, my interest in regarding Cobbett as a matter of 
                <emph>literary</emph> history was shaped by the work of Raymond Williams.
                Where Romantic studies typically restricted Cobbett to footnotes, as a source of
                inert historical fact or distorted polemic, <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> offers a very different critical account of Cobbett, in the company
                of other major literary figures. In a revealing opening contrast with Edmund Burke,
                followed by a related pairing of Robert Southey with Robert Owen, Williams situates
                Cobbett at the head of a strand of cultural discourse that emerges in response to
                the economic, social, and political changes that shaped modern Britain. Given the
                limited attention Romanticists then paid to nonfiction prose, the treatment of
                Burke, Cobbett, Southey, and Owen within a tradition that ran forward through
                Carlyle, Newman, Arnold, Ruskin, and Morris was remarkable in itself.</p>
                  <p>In a casual remark on Orwell in the <title level="m">Politics
                    and Letters</title> interview collection, Williams identifies Cobbett as "a case I
                often return to" (387). And return he did, across a range of topics—politics,
                economics, agriculture, education, communication—in nearly all his major historical
                studies and essay collections, beginning with <title level="m">Culture in
                    Society</title> (1958), and continuing through <title level="m">The Long
                        Revolution</title> (1961), <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973),
                 <title level="m">Keywords</title> (1976), <title level="m">Problems in
                     Materialism and Culture</title> (1980), <title level="m">Writing in Society</title>
                 (1983), and <title level="m">Resources of Hope</title> (1989). Yet the occasional note
                struck by the sense of a case to which one returns does not capture the way in which
                Cobbett came increasingly to serve as a key figure—arguably <emph>the</emph> key 
                figure—connecting Williams and his readers back to the vexed early
                phase of a long revolution in politics, economics, and communication that shaped
                British cultural modernity. Williams’s abiding concern for rural life and
                agricultural experience heightened the affinity, as did a sense of late
                twentieth-century postwar crisis that echoed back through the experience of the
                aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. Over the course of his life, the account of
                Cobbett developed in ways that register a growing appreciation for a body of writing
                that is at once personal and communal, descriptive and imaginative. This line of
                response culminated in the 1983 Past Masters volume, <title level="m">Cobbett</title>,
                where what could have been a brief primer on the career of an early
                nineteenth-century journalist becomes instead a more expansive meditation on
                essential problems of historical method and contemporary argument, evident in
                Williams’s searching reflections on what it means to attend closely to a voice from
                the past and to witness change across two centuries.</p>
                  <p>My aim in tracking this critical engagement with Cobbett is in
                part to provide a sense of development, but also to demonstrate just how fully
                Cobbett figured in some of Williams’s most significant contributions to literary and
                cultural studies. Notable here is his rethinking of the literary and the aesthetic
                in ways that reconfigure the canon of course, but also open up new ways of thinking
                about transmission and continuity in literary history, in part by considering
                writing as a material practice that shapes even as it is shaped by social and
                economic change. As an agrarian countryman who advocated subsistence farming even as
                he wrote to support himself, Cobbett was distinctively positioned to reveal some of
                the contradictions at work in early industrial society. At issue here are ways of
                thinking historically about class, and these will be particularly evident in
                Williams’s paired treatment of Cobbett and Austen in <title level="m">The Country
                    and the City</title>. But while that discussion has often been noticed because it
                seems to diminish Austen and restrict her social vision, for Williams it is part of
                a larger attempt to come to terms with elements of early nineteenth-century society
                that can challenge some of his own Marxist and socialist conceptions of historical
                change. And it is finally the willingness to rethink his own historical position and
                expectations with Cobbett, through the pivotal transitions of early
                nineteenth-century industrial society, that shapes the Past Masters volume, whose
                final phases are as provocative and experimental as anything in Williams’s critical
                prose, particularly as the writer searches for new ways of thinking historically
                about the literature of the past with respect to the present.</p>

                  <head>Literary Tradition and Industrial Transformation</head>
                  <p>We can begin as so often for Williams with language. In
                assessing the difficulty of "history" as a critical and interpretive term, David
                Simpson has suggested that <title level="m">Keywords</title> offers less a definition
                than a "compromise," in which "the urgency of history" lies not in wholeness or
                totality but rather in "its immediate applicability to a range of options for
                reading the past and projecting the future" (9). He cites a sentence from the close
                of the <title level="m">Keywords</title> entry on "history," after Williams explores
                the way that "organized knowledge of the past" came from the eighteenth century to
                acquire a more general association with "human self-development" through "continuous
                and connected process," so that "history" potentially lost its "exclusive
                association with the past" and became "connected not only to the present but also to
                the future." Noting that "it is . . . not easy to say which sense of <emph>history</emph> 
                is currently dominant," Williams closes by
                contrasting the specificity of such variants as "historian" and "historical" with
                the wider scope of the root term: "History itself retains its whole range, and
                still, in different hands, <emph>teaches</emph> or <emph>shows</emph> us most 
                kinds of knowable past and almost every kind of imaginable
                future" (146–48). One aim of this essay is to demonstrate that this sense of
                instruction and demonstration is increasingly evident in Williams’s writing about
                Cobbett as he comes to wrestle with problems of perception and voice across time, so
                as to bring a knowable past to bear upon an uncertain but imaginable future. An
                astute and materially engaged observer, an engaging communicator, and a forceful
                critic of economic dispossession through the critical early phase of industrial
                capitalism, the figure of Cobbett as fully developed in the Past Masters volume is
                also a profoundly important <emph>historical</emph> figure in Williams’s
                fullest sense, a guide to the past whose expectations about a future that is now
                past can also shape our own future expectations and projections.</p>
                  <p>Given Cobbett’s presence in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> as part of a preliminary set of contrasts, it is not surprising
                that the discussion there is schematic, unfolding through a sequence of extracts
                with minimal commentary. In a retrospective introduction, Williams observes that the
                writers treated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> had not "been seen as
                connected in this way" before, and in some sense the case for Cobbett develops over
                the course of the book as he becomes a "touchstone," and his perspective returns in
                discussions of Coleridge, Mill, Carlyle, Dickens, Disraeli, Eliot, Morris, Lawrence,
                and Leavis (x, 105).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The term "touchstone" appears 
                    in a discussion of George Eliot, and for Cobbett with respect to other 
                    writers mentioned here see <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 56, 58, 
                    78, 96, 99, 150.</note> That said, the initial discussion does involve some
                strikingly dismissive observations, notably that Cobbett "had nothing of Burke’s
                depth of mind" and that his "relative indifference to ideas" meant that he was
                "often simply a Philistine" (12–13, 18). While this was not revoked in Williams’s
                later work, the tone shifts considerably, to the point where Simpson convincingly
                charges Williams with having "failed to hear the uglier voices in Cobbett" (12)—the
                sensationalism, the personal invective, the racism, the misogyny, the
                    anti-Semitism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This critique connects with 
                        Edward Said’s critique of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> for 
                        its "failure to deal with the imperial experience at all" (65). Cornel West 
                        suggests that while "Williams provides indispensable analytical tools and historical
                            sensibilities for reflections on empire, race, color, gender and sexual
                            orientation, the relative silences in his work on these issues bear the
                            stamp of his own intellectual and existential formation" (8).</note> In 
                    exploring Williams’s writing on Cobbett, it is worth
                acknowledging Simpson’s point at the outset: there is a consistent filtering out of
                what W. D. Rubinstein has termed "the dark side" of British radical populism (339).
                In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, the sense of Cobbett as a writer
                impervious to ideas aligns what is valuable about his prose with impression and
                feeling rather than thought, with a "sureness of instinct" evident above all in his
                rural and agricultural writing. The perspective of the "countryman" enabled a
                critical response to industrialization, as Cobbett witnessed the development of a
                "new class system" that sharply divided laborer and landowner, rich and poor (14).
                In revising earlier individualist conceptions of property through an insistence that
                the working poor possessed a property in their labor, Cobbett extended property
                rights to "a whole new class" (17) and provided a radically new framework for class
                conflict and collective action that fundamentally disrupted the existing order.</p>
                  <p>Beyond these and other convictions that Williams tracks
                primarily through the <title level="m">Political Register</title>, it is worth
                identifying two features of the treatment of Cobbett in <title level="m">Culture
                    and Society</title> that he develops more fully in his later work. First is a
                matter of historical method that at this point runs primarily from present to past
                in the form of a potential misrecognition that tests our retrospective assumptions:
                "The terms of Cobbett’s social criticism so much resemble later and more organized
                critiques that it is easy to forget the basis of experience from which he worked,
                and the values by which he judged" (14). While a claim for the distinctiveness of
                Cobbett’s experience is clear enough, Williams does not attempt to account for the
                remarkable resemblance to later social criticism, nor does he say much about the
                value (or the limitations) of a relatively unformed and disorganized early
                nineteenth-century perspective. Again, much rests here on assigning Cobbett’s own
                critical responses to instinct and experience rather than intellect or coherent
                analysis, and this indicates a second strand of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> that extends through Williams’s later writing, the tendency to
                value Cobbett’s instinct and experience rather than his intellect. While Williams
                does insist that "the sureness of instinct was no accident—it was rather, vital and
                impregnable, a genuine embodiment of value," the contrast with Burke is in this
                respect clearly diminishing (13). Where this gets mitigated is through a
                countervailing insistence that Burke’s value also lies in feeling and experience.
                What we learn from the author of the <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution
                    in France</title> (1790), notably through his insistence on social complexity and
                historical community, has less to do "with his position than his manner of
                thinking," a manner that Williams suggests is not even "thinking" in the usual sense
                but rather "a special immediacy of experience, which works itself out, in depth, to
                a particularly embodiment of ideas" (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                4–5). In this way the contrast between instinct and intellect softens, and Burke
                meets Cobbett on the common ground of personal experience and expression: "Burke’s
                writing is an articulated experience, and as such it has a validity which can
                survive even the demolition of its general conclusions. . . . It is, finally, a
                personal experience become landmark" (5).</p>
                  <p>With Crabbe, Hardy, Lawrence, and Wordsworth, Cobbett is among
                the most frequently cited writers in <title level="m">The Country and the
                City</title>, and his role in the unfolding argument of the book is more fluid and less
                narrowly defined than in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. The value of
                Cobbett’s experience as a "countryman" and a farmer is amplified as Williams infuses
                the book with the perspective of his own Welsh village upbringing. While there are
                continuities of principle and method from <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, it is clear that Williams’s
                thinking has shifted in ways that shape the treatment of Cobbett. Among other
                things, what came between the two books were developments in the British New Left,
                notably Williams’s role in the 1967 <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>, which
                expressed disenchantment with the rightward movement of the British Labour 
                Party.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Williams
                    and the <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>, see Chun
                    86–87.</note> A line of argument that Williams developed in <title level="a">The
                British Left,</title> a 1965 <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article reprinted in
                the volume <title level="m">Resources of Hope</title> (1989), is particularly
                instructive. Here, an assessment of "the state of the Left in Britain" begins with
                an assessment of the Labour Party. The integrity of the party as "a mass party and a
                permanently potential government, based primarily on the most organized sections of
                the working class," can help account for its strengths and weaknesses, notably its
                limited effectiveness as an "instrument of socialist change." But Williams insists
                on looking beyond the framework of a parliamentary party (as he did in the <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>), and beyond the 1960s, to "the complicated
                intellectual and structural traditions of other kinds of social criticism and
                opposition," in particular, "the origins of the British working-class movement, in
                the years 1790–1835" (<title level="m">Resources</title> 133). While he and E. P.
                Thompson disagreed within the <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title> on the role
                of the Labour Party in bringing about social change through parliamentary politics,
                with Williams no longer expecting Labour to advance socialism (Chun 86), in the 1965
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article on the British left Williams
                invokes in his own support of <title level="m">The Making of the English Working
                    Class</title>, which appeared just two years earlier and manifestly shapes the
                ensuing discussion.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title level="j">NLR</title> 
                    interviews collected in <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, Williams
                            asserts that he and Thompson were "not in contact with each other" about
                            their work in these years. He acknowledges that "if I had read <title level="m">The Making of the English Working Class</title> when I
                                was writing <title level="m">Culture in Society</title>, it would have
                            been a very different book," and specifically indicates a desire to have
                            written about "the extraordinary transposition of varieties of
                            radicalism that occurred between 1790 and 1840—which I never mentioned
                            in the book" (108). Given Cobbett’s prominent role in <title level="m">Making</title>, the "very different book" Williams posits 
                    would likely have involved a very different figure of William
                    Cobbett.</note> Taken in conjunction with subsequent developments, the
                early decades of British working-class radicalism (where Cobbett is an anticipatory
                figure) help account for tensions in the relationship between trade union
                organization and radical political initiative, and for strengths and weaknesses in
                "the inherited system of ideas" that shape the British left (<title level="m">Resources</title> 135). While an enduring commitment to trade union 
                solidarity may blunt social and political ambition, according to Williams it also sustains a
                characteristic "inward-turning loyalty" that fosters working-class resilience
                through periods of economic adversity and political defeat.</p>
                  <p>In the <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article Williams
                proceeds to trace this resilience to union organization but also to "certain
                pre-political values" (we might consider Cobbett’s instincts) and a "self-generating
                tradition" that has found expression in "the moral critique of industrial
                capitalism," and that "has been paralleled throughout by a literary tradition of
                comparable importance" (<title level="m">Resources</title> 136). The figures in this
                 tradition are familiar from <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, yet here
                Williams more fully asserts a distinctively working-class commitment to the life of
                the imagination and human fulfillment despite the corrosive effects of industrial
                capitalism. The alignment of "moral critique" with "literary tradition" tells us
                much about how Williams worked to introduce Cobbett to the literary canon and even,
                as we will see, to Romanticism’s visionary company. Cobbett’s profile rises further
                as Williams looks past the Labour Party and past his own present crisis to identify
                forces that have shaped radical social change. While he acknowledges the
                contribution of religious nonconformity to working-class values, Williams turns to
                literary tradition for an ethos that is more emancipatory and less restrictive than
                puritan tradition:
            <quote>There has been an important tradition of ideas and feelings which is not puritan, and
                which in my view lies just as deeply in the moral consciousness. The claims of
                Cobbett, Ruskin, William Morris—to name three of the most influential writers—were
                no more puritan than the novels of Dickens. What is asserted in this tradition is
                the claim to life, against the distortion of humanity by the priorities and
                disciplines of industrial capitalism. . . . If we actually look at British
                working-class life, rather than at the stereotypes provided for political analysis
                and export, we find this, again pre-political, emphasis breaking out again and
                again. It is often anarchic, in its immediate forms, but in its insistence on
                satisfaction and excitement it is a moral challenge of no less weight than that of
                puritanism. (<title level="m">Resources</title> 136–37)</quote>
               Along with the decisive identification of Cobbett with <emph>literary</emph> 
                 tradition,<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Keywords</title> Williams both
                            traced and interrogated "the attempted and often successful
                            specialization of <hi rend="bold">literature</hi> to certain kinds of
                            writing," and particularly "within the basic assumptions of Romanticism"
                            to "<emph>imaginative writing</emph>" (185–86). His own work
                            is what he identifies as a challenge to the narrowing sense of
                            literature "by concepts of <emph>writing</emph> and 
                     <emph>communication</emph> which seek to recover the most
                            active and general senses which the extreme specialization had seemed to
                            include" (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 187). At the same time, his
                            practice retained "literature" and the "literary" in broad senses, and
                            in the <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> interview on <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, the interviewer
                            identifies a range of conceptions of literature, from a "record of human
                            experience" and "a response" to "a dramatization of values" (303).</note> there 
                 is a shift here from the "instinct" of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 
                 to the richer possibilities of a "moral
                consciousness," where the "moral critique" meets "literary tradition." As a result,
                the author of <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> (1830) takes on some of the
                visionary proportions that Romantic studies has typically associated with Blake and
                Shelley, though at this point Williams still looks ahead—itself a tribute to
                Cobbett, who becomes the sole forebear of a distinguished nineteenth- and early
                twentieth-century tradition. Assessing this tradition, he writes: "Cobbett, Dickens,
                Ruskin, Morris, Lawrence: all these in their lifetimes fought utilitarianism, and
                all except Ruskin fought the kind of moral paternalism which was the other main line
                of reform. What they claimed, positively, was man’s absolute priority as a creative
                and independent being. From this creativity and independence came cooperation and a
                good society" (<title level="m">Resources</title> 137). To be sure, there may be a
                return by way of a more structural Williams to the early sense of "instinct" in the
                claim that the "important tradition of ideas and feelings which is not puritan" and
                which ran through literature and through "British working-class life" was
                "pre-political." What does it mean to identify "values" (136) or a "level" (137) as
                "pre-political," within an essay that involves a concerted and intensively situated
                argument about political action and organization? And yet the account here of a
                resilient and persistently anarchic working-class tradition, allowing for its
                imprecision, does register the emergence in Williams’s work of a more positive way
                of thinking about the relatively disorganized critique of capitalism associated with
                Cobbett and others in the decades before a fully developed socialism. If the early
                Williams challenged Cobbett’s reliance on instinct, the later Williams was
                challenged by the insight Cobbett offered into a pre-socialist challenge to
                industrial capitalism that was no more fully developed than the economic system it
                confronted.</p>
                  <p>This is reinforced in a <title level="j">New Left Review</title> interview on <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, conducted in 1977 and published in the
                    <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> collection, where Williams compares
                the English tradition surveyed in the book with continental sociology and asserts
                that "the very rapid and brutal experience of industrialization" in England
                triggered a particularly critical response, again in the years from 1790 through the
                1830s. "The thinking about the process of industrial transformation that was done in
                the period between Blake and Wordsworth and Southey and the young Carlyle, although
                it is very early and confused, still seems to me absolutely crucial. Some of the
                questions then asked, more persistently by Cobbett than by anyone else, about the
                whole nature of the industrial project and the consequences for social relations,
                still have to be answered today" (115).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Blackburn 
                    for the observation that "the generosity of Williams’s approach to pre-socialist, 
                    or even anti-socialist, traditions was disconcerting to critics on the Left"
                            (14).</note> The positive emphasis on Cobbett as against his
                 more canonical contemporaries is a striking shift from the tone of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, and the insistence that the questions posed 
                 in the early years of industrialization—however "confused" they may now seem—have "still
                have to be answered today" registers a challenge from the past to the present that
                Williams continued to explore through his later career. In a sense the imperfect
                formation of Cobbett’s social and economic critique accounts for its compelling
                present relevance, as any radical movement must acknowledge an imperfect
                understanding of the future it wants to shape.</p>
                  <p>In historicizing misapprehensions within the New Left, Williams finds himself looking
                back with more respect to an earlier era of writers who were similarly coming to
                terms with a crisis of uncertain outcome, in ways that belie the more assured
                critical and historical perspective of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>.
                As evidence of the way history can challenge socialist theory, he observes that "the
                characteristic rhetoric" of Marxism in the 1930s would have anticipated the failure
                of capitalism and the triumph of Soviet productivity, whereas the postwar period
                instead ushered in "the new kind of productive explosion that capitalism had in
                store." Unanticipated historical experience motivates the sympathetic return to an
                early and essentially presocialist struggle to contest industrial capitalism.
                Williams writes, "It was then that the questions posed by Blake or Cobbett acquired
                their force for me" (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 115). The acutely
                disorienting postwar experience, and the attendant return for critical understanding
                to an earlier era, frames the transition from <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>. Williams leaves
                no doubt that the questions posed by Romantic period writers, and "more persistently
                by Cobbett than by anyone else," were at the front of his mind in the early 1970s:
                "<title level="m">The Country and the City</title> was written very much in
                response to them" (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 115). In this sense,
                the fragmented and unsystematic critique associated with an early phase of
                industrialization becomes less a liability to be overcome through corrective
                historical analysis than an opportunity for salutary self-recognition across two
                centuries of profound social and economic change. No wonder then that Cobbett’s
                instinct, far from being insufficiently thought through, becomes an imaginatively
                vital and anarchic insistence on the whole range of individual and collective human
                experience.</p>

                            framed in terms of "knowable community," and where Austen’s limited
                            social range is brought out through a comparison with George Eliot
                            (14–18, 24–26).</note> White becomes a two-page coda at the end
                of the chapter, and while he does importantly register the emergence of "a natural
                order" that "could now be separated from man," for my purposes the central contrast
                is between Cobbett and Austen (119). Following on a historical treatment of
                enclosure and property rights, Williams develops the chapter in terms of the
                response to historical change. With "the economic system of landlord, tenant and
                labourer" now "in explicit and assertive control," rural communities were forced to
                adapt in order to survive (107). What Simpson has termed Williams’s "appetite for
                immediacy" is fully evident (22), as Cobbett appears in the familiar guise of close
                observer and careful recorder—though now without Burke casting the invidious shadow
                of intellectual deprivation, and with Austen and White as fellow observers. The
                questioning presence of Cobbett in the <title level="j">New Left Review</title>
                interview is also pertinent, as interrogation supplements observation and
                description: "What Cobbett gives us is detailed social observation, from the point
                of view of the condition of the majority of men. He combined Arthur Young’s
                attention to the detailed practice of a working agriculture with a more persistent
                social questioning and observation" (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>
                109).</p>
                  <p>While Cobbett’s willingness to identify with the condition of the laborer offers a
                fundamental shift in perspective, it is his capacity for observation—to have "looked
                very carefully" (110) and registered a "visible disturbance" (111)—that occasions
                Williams’s most developed account yet of the role of the rural rider in a 
                <emph>literary</emph> tradition that typically involves imaginative
                writing. Where the eighteenth-century poetry of Goldsmith and Crabbe provided moral
                caution of a kind that Williams explores in previous chapters of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, the more fully developed capitalism of 
                the early nineteenth century demanded organized action and resistance, of a kind that prior
                literary conventions could not provide. Under these conditions, Cobbett becomes "the
                outrider" of "a new kind of country writing" that sustains description and
                reflection while accounting for "action," in both its own communicative effects and
                what it witnessed among the working poor. Cobbett "described and campaigned", and in
                doing so set the terms for developments in prose fiction that made social realism a
                prevailing form of the mid-nineteenth century novel (<title level="m">Country</title>
                112). The line of development from Goldsmith to Cobbett to Dickens can seem
                counterintuitive, running as it does from country to city, and from poetry through
                nonfiction prose to the novel, but Williams insists upon tracing this line in order
                to register in literary history what he often noted in economic history: that
                capitalism transformed the English countryside through the reorganization of
                agricultural production well in advance of urban industrialization.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, <title level="m">Cobbett</title> 68–69.</note> No
                surprise then that Cobbett the radical journalist would be in a position to pick up
                on observations about rural social change indicated earlier in poetry as a matter of
                meditation, and then transmit his own activist disposition ahead to a socially
                committed fiction. It is through the paired treatment of Austen and Cobbett that we
                can appreciate Williams’s own effort to think historically about class as he worked
                back through the early phases of industrial society.</p>
                  <p>Williams’s ironic recasting of the famous opening sentence of <title level="m">Pride 
                and Prejudice</title> as part of the initial development of his account of
                Austen is among the chapter’s more frequently noticed gestures:
            <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that Jane Austen chose to ignore the decisive
                historical events of her time. Where, it is still asked, are the Napoleonic wars:
                the real current of history? But history has many currents, and the social history
                of the landed families, at that time in England, was among the most important. As we
                sense its real processes, we find that they are quite central and structural in
                Austen’s novels. (<title level="m">Country</title> 113)</quote>
               Readers of Austen can be protective of their author, so it is not surprising that the
               discussion in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> has raised objections
                and spirited critical response. Yet given that the whole point of this passage is to
                show that Austen was in fact engaged in the "the real current of history," once we
                acknowledge social as well as political and military history, it is surprising that
                Williams has been taken to task here for "a classic statement of the view that Jane
                Austen the novelist repudiates any serious concern with larger social and political
                events" (Crary 145). Fortunately, Devoney Looser’s observation that Williams is
                writing "facetiously" and that he goes on to argue "to the contrary" is more
                characteristic of the way historicist critics have responded (216). And yet the
                recognition that Williams considers Austen to be a historically engaged novelist may
                miss a more subtle point about the argument of <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title>, one that gets obscured by the way the chapter vividly reopens, as it
                were, through this allusion to the opening of <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title>. For this is not the transition from Cobbett to Austen. That
                comes in the previous paragraph, as part of a stark contrast between the perspective
                of the two writers that follows directly from the argument about the author of the
                <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> as an "outrider" for literary developments
                that are more fully realized in Victorian fiction:
            <quote>But this change in the novel did not happen in Cobbett’s time. Through his middle
                years, while the social changes were happening, Jane Austen was writing from a very
                different point of view, from inside the houses that Cobbett was passing on the
                road. When he was writing about the disappearance of the small gentry he was riding
                through Hampshire, not far from Chawton. It was also in Hampshire that he made his
                list of the new owners of country-houses and estates, from nabobs to stock-jobbers.
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 112)</quote>
              This claim about a difference in perspective despite a shared affinity for close
                observation becomes a key strand in the ensuing discussion of Austen, even as the
                movement forward and back again in time (a method that is characteristic, yet
                somehow intensified when Williams writes about Cobbett) highlights the sense of
                "action" with respect to a campaigning journalist who recognized and endorsed
                working-class organization against capitalist transformations of the countryside.
                For Williams, Cobbett’s "newly typical action" is another dimension of the contrast
                with Austen, and it is accentuated by the preliminary glance ahead to "a new kind of
                novel, which was to become, from the 1830s, the dominant literary form" (112). Put
                in Williams’s own terms, Cobbett provides what the later Gaskell or Dickens cannot,
                a strand of literary history that indicated how even Austen’s celebrated powers of
                observation would become residual.</p>
                  <p>The sharp distinction that places the domestic novelist "on the other side of the
                park wall" from the rural rider has also occasioned spirited response in Austen
                criticism (113), particularly as it gets reworked towards the end of the chapter,
                where Williams once again switches temporal registers, speculating that if Austen
                had ventured "outside the park walls, into a very different social experience," her
                writing would have "become not a moral but a social criticism" of the kind found
                later in George Eliot:
            <quote>We must emphasize here again the importance of Cobbett. What he names, riding past on
                the road, are classes. Jane Austen, from inside the houses, can never see that, for
                all the intricacy of her social description. All her discrimination is,
                understandably, internal and exclusive. She is concerned with the conduct of people
                who, in the complications of improvement, are repeatedly trying to make themselves
                into a class. But where only one class is seen, no classes are seen. (117)</quote>
               It is important to acknowledge that subsequent work on Austen, sensitive to gender,
                commerce, domesticity, sociability, and public and private spheres, demonstrates
                that the catalog of what Williams himself fails to see, on both sides of the park
                wall, is as lengthy as it is troubling. A vivid case in point would be Adela Pinch’s
                wonderful reading of the scene in <title level="m">Emma</title> where the heroine
                breaks away from her friend Harriet’s distracted shopping to look out the door of
                Ford’s shop, observing and envisioning a range of characters from within and beyond
                the plot of the novel. Expecting perhaps the apothecary Mr. Perry, the lawyer
                William Cox "letting himself in at the office door," and the carriage horses of the
                newly genteel tradesman Mr. Cole, along with "a stray letter-boy on an obstinate
                mule," she is not disappointed "when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his
                tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs
                quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker’s
                little bow­window eyeing the gingerbread" (Austen 183). The liminal perspective, at
                the door of a shop looking out over a village high street, is itself suggestive with
                respect to Williams’s impermeable park wall, and so too is Pinch’s insistence that
                for all the "gritty everydayness" (xxiv) of the scene there is evidence of an
                important shift in literary history:
            <quote>Austen is doing something quite revolutionary in presenting to us a woman standing in
                a shop door. It is hard for us to find this ordinary image revolutionary, but in
                fact what is revolutionary is that a woman loitering in a shop door in England in
                1815 seems ordinary. It is an image we cannot imagine finding in a novel before this
                moment. Emma’s activity is new, and so is the kind of contemplation Austen
                represents Emma as practicing. (xxiii)</quote>
               Pinch is alert to the role of commerce and "the consumption of fashionable goods" in
                the novel, and to patterns of circulation between London and Highbury, and she
                insists that "this scene must be seen in its entirety as a shopping scene." But she
                also draws a comparison with Burney’s <title level="m">Camilla</title> to refine our
                sense of what is at stake when Emma takes a moment to pause and reflect. Highbury
                suddenly appears to be a "considerably less orderly" village, and we are made aware
                that even a realistically rendered social world recedes beyond apprehension and
                suggests "glimpses of the inexhaustibly unknown" (xxii–xxiv).</p>
                  <p>There is much about this close attention to a historically situated female
                experience—transpiring outside the home, in a world of circulating goods and
                traveling persons—that belies Williams’s narrow and reductive schema of outside and
                inside, of traveling on the public road as against settlement behind the park wall.
                Williams acknowledges little of what Austen and Pinch render so vividly, and his
                vision was no doubt restricted by his interest in sharing Cobbett’s perspective and
                listening closely to Cobbett’s voice. While Pinch does not reference <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, others have. Helena Kelly
                acknowledges in Williams a "necessary corrective to Jane’s genteel comedy of
                manners," but reminds us that many "pivotal scenes in [her] novels take place
                outdoors," and that even when indoors "we’re not invariably ‘inside the houses.’
                Sometimes we’re in inns, assembly buildings, hotels, cramped rented rooms" (225–26).
                In bringing Austen and her characters out from behind the park wall and onto the
                road, Kelly invokes another episode in <title level="m">Emma</title>, where Harriet
                Smith walks out with a friend on "the Richmond road," an excursion that is
                "apparently public enough for safety" but ends nevertheless in a terrified encounter
                with "a party of gipsies" and rescue at the hands of Frank Churchill (Austen
                    261).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a compelling treatment of property

                        Houghton-Walker 155–85.</note> The conventional device of male rescue only
                heightens the extent to which Austen knew and rendered what Williams overlooks in
                his easy contrast between Cobbett "riding past on the road" and Austen writing "from
                inside the houses": the male privilege at work in the relative freedom from
                geographical restriction and threat of assault enjoyed by Cobbett throughout 
                the <title level="m">Rural Rides</title>.</p>
                  <p>As a narrative of mistaking and then finding one’s social place, the Harriet Smith
                subplot in <title level="m">Emma</title> indicates the range of Austen’s social
                vision. A village boarding schoolgirl of uncertain parentage, Harriet is raised to
                genteel company at Highbury by a misguided Emma and eventually aspires to marry Mr.
                Knightly, only to return through the process by which the novel disciplines the
                heroine’s imagination to a more suitable marriage with Knightley’s tenant farmer,
                Mr. Martin, which terminates any special intimacy with Emma. The social distinctions
                at issue here and throughout her fiction have led Austen scholars to challenge
                Williams on the question of class. According to Roger Sales, "the wide social
                distance between the aristocratic Mr. Yates and the lower-middle-class Price family"
                in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> undermines the "basic thesis that Austen
                only represents one class" (253n10). A consensus about social range in recent Austen
                scholarship is suggested in Juliet McMaster’s compelling chapter on <title level="a">Class</title> for <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to Jane 
                        Austen</title>, which sets out from a
                proposition that "class difference was . . . a fact of life for Austen, and an acute
                observation of the fine distinctions between one social level and another was a
                necessary part of her business as a writer of realistic fiction" (111). McMaster
                goes on to provide a complex and dynamic map of status in Austen’s fiction,
                beginning with such titled characters as Lord Osborne (in the fragment <title level="a">The
                Watsons</title>) and Lady Catherine de Bourgh, extending down through the landed gentry,
                gentlemen with incomes, professional men, and those who make or made their money in
                trade (some of whom acquire gentility), and closing with servants and brief glimpses
                of laboring people and the poor.</p>
                  <p>Yet before concluding that Williams has been effectively superseded, it is worth
                returning to what he actually says about Austen in <title level="m">The Country and
                    the City</title>. Against the perception that Austen is primarily interested in
                individuals and their "personal relationships," he insists that her preoccupation is
                with "social <emph>conduct</emph>: a testing and discovery of the
                standards which govern human behaviour in real situations." And such situations are
                crucially dynamic and uncertain, a matter of "changing fortunes" rather than any
                "settled ‘traditional’ world" (113). This leads directly to a recognition of the
                social range and complexity that Austen scholars are inclined to invoke against him,
                as Williams surveys a range of characters with respect to property, income, and
                manners, including Sir Thomas Bertram, the Crawfords, Darcy, Mr. Knightley, Mr.
                Martin, the Coles, and Catherine Moreland. Change and motion are again keynotes: "It
                must be clear that it is no single, settled society, it is an active, complicated,
                sharply speculative process. It is indeed that most difficult world to describe, in
                English social history: an acquisitive, high bourgeois society at the point of its
                most evident interlocking with an agrarian capitalism that is itself mediated by
                inherited titles and the making of family names." Given the difficulty of even
                describing this world, Williams marvels at Austen’s ability to maintain "a unity of
                tone, of a settled and remarkably confident way of seeing and judging, in the
                chronicle of confusion and change" (<title level="m">Country</title> 115). The point
                is important, and gets at the complexity and indeed the <emph>necessity</emph> of 
                irony as a way for Austen to write about class: if Emma
                misleads Harriet into misunderstanding her own social status and destiny, their
                mutual confusion is in many respects more interesting and revealing than the
                denouement that divides them and returns them to their proper places. In this sense,
                Emma’s apparently misguided plotting reveals what the resolution of the novel
                conceals.</p>
                  <p>Yet Williams returns, with a bracing consistency, to a sense of Austen’s
                limitations. His assessment of her paradoxical achievement follows directly from the
                observation that "she is more exact about income, which is disposable, than about
                acres, which have to be worked" (<title level="m">Country</title> 115), and involves
                an interlocking set of distinctions, familiar to readers of <title level="m">Keywords</title>, within contemporary senses of the terms "improvement" and
                "cultivation" (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 92–93, 160–61).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The observation about income as against acres is consistent with 
                    Edward Copeland’s assertion that "<emph>money</emph>, especially
                            money as spendable income, is the love-tipped arrow aimed at the hearts
                            of Jane Austen’s heroines and her readers" (128).</note> There
                was improvement in working agriculture, and improvement in parks and artificial
                landscapes; there was cultivation of the soil, and cultivation in polite society. In
                both cases, the revenue from the first could be applied to the second. In writing
                about "an active, complicated, sharply speculative process," Austen achieved her
                remarkable consistency of tone in part by overlooking "working" improvement and
                cultivation while seeing "social" improvement and cultivation "very clearly indeed"
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 116).<note place="foot" resp="editors">I do not 
                    share William Galperin’s sense that Williams regards Austen as a writer 
                    who resists change and is "regulatory" in "discriminating among improvements" 
                    (27–28).</note> For those troubled by the crudeness of the distinction between
                Cobbett "riding past on the road" and Austen writing "from inside the houses," I
                would offer this more subtle distinction as a redeeming corrective. To be sure,
                there are grounds for contesting Williams’s assessment, notably in <title level="m">Emma</title>, in the scene where Mr. Knightley meets his brother John at Highbury
                and speaks "as a farmer," as the two men share an interest in plans around draining
                and fencing, the removal of a tree, "and the destination of every acre for wheat,
                turnips, or spring corn" (Austen 81). And yet Williams’s larger point stands, and
                has been reinforced in a recent chapter on agriculture in the volume <title level="m">Jane Austen in Context</title>. Here Robert Clark and Gerry Dutton
                propose the striking absence "to the historian’s eye" of farmers and farm workers in
                film and television versions of Austen, and then trace that conspicuous absence to
                the fiction itself: "Only the relatively minor character of Robert Martin 
                in <title level="m">Emma</title> [serves] to represent the most numerous social 
                orders in a period when even the King was affectionately known as ‘Farmer 
                George’" (185).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The chapter
                            draws on the surviving letters of Austen’s parents to portray a
                            household deeply involved in farming and the social and economic changes
                            it involved.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In any case, just as the allusive quip about a prevailing view of Austen does not
                mean that Williams considered her fiction out of touch with history, so too his
                positioning of the domestic novelist and the rural rider on opposite sides of a park
                wall does not involve a reductive, still less static, account of her fiction.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Although Austen scholars and "literary" readers tend 
                    to object to the <emph>distinction</emph> Williams makes when he places the two
                            writers on opposite sides of a park wall, there is reason to suspect
                            that the offense may lie instead in a contaminating lack of distinction,
                            and in the leveling audacity that would discuss Austen and Cobbett in
                            the same breath and reach this conclusion: "Cobbett and Jane Austen mark
                            two ways of seeing, contrasted viewpoints, within the same county" (<title level="m">Country</title> 118). See, for example, Jonathan Bate’s
                    discussion of Austen (with Hardy) in the opening chapter of <title level="m">Song 
                        of the Earth</title>, which comes, by way of
                            Williams, to the geographical proximity of Austen and Cobbett, but
                            immediately works to distinguish the two on the grounds of the bluntness
                            and aggressiveness of Cobbett’s distinction between "a 
                            resident <emph>native</emph> gentry" and those who profit from the soil
                            at a distance: 
                    <quote>Jane Austen explores exactly
                            the same distinction between good stewardship and absenteeism, though by
                            example and not by polemic. And she is more discriminating in her
                            judgements: where Cobbett flails indiscriminately at all the
                            representatives of new money—financial speculators, nabobs and
                            negro-drivers, generals and admirals—Austen is more doubtful about some
                            (Sir Thomas Bertram, the bad father who has bought Mansfield Park on the
                            proceeds of his sugar plantations in Antigua) but robustly defensive of
                            others (admiral Croft, the good husband who in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> rents Kellynch Hall on the proceeds of his
                            successes during the Napoleonic Wars). Knightley is her prime example of
                            the "resident <emph>native</emph> gentry, attached to the
                            soil." (Bate 7–8)</quote>Leaving aside all that may

                            Napoleonic Wars," it is possible to share Bates’s concerns about the
                            extremes of Cobbett’s invective, and allow a romance reader’s affection
                            for the likes of Knightley and Mr. Darcy, while still appreciating
                            Williams’s insistence that we consider the perspective and condition of
                            ordinary English laborers and in doing so recognize the dispossession,
                            condescension, and dehumanization that is embedded in the very idea of a
                            virtuous "resident <emph>native</emph> gentry," regardless of
                            whether it is politely or crudely conceived.</note> In
                assessing what he meant by restricting her vision to "one class," we can begin with
                what he did <emph>not</emph> mean, and with another Austen scholar who has
                taken exception to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>. In the
                introduction to <title level="m">Jane Austen and the Fiction of Her Time</title>, Mary
                Waldron promises to avoid the distorting effects of "a sort of historical criticism"
                that threatens "to damage the coherence of a novel" by prioritizing "what we think
                was important over the perceptions of the author working within the cultural
                parameters of his/her time." Waldron associates Williams with this kind of
                historicism:
            <quote>Cultural historians like Raymond Williams may be right in their terms to see Austen’s
                fictional world as essentially class-based, but "class" in the Marxist sense that
                they use did not exist in Austen’s lifetime; her society was only just emerging from
                a semi-feudal situation. It is interesting to identify foreshadowings in the novels
                of what were to become elements in the adversarial world of Marx—bourgeois versus
                proletarian—but they tell us nothing about the world within which Austen’s
                characters interact, the world which she and they assume. (11–12)<note place="foot" resp="editors">I have omitted the opening of the first sentence, 
                    in which Arnold Kettle is included with Williams.</note>
                     </quote>
              It is hard to know where to begin in contesting these two sentences. While
                "semi-feudal" elements of English society certainly persisted in Austen’s lifetime
                and beyond, and Williams himself provided powerful interpretive language for
                thinking about this, to claim that England in the early decades of the nineteenth
                century "was only just emerging from a semi-feudal situation" is to ignore the
                massive changes in agriculture, commerce, industry, and empire that had shaped
                England for centuries, supplementing and replacing "feudal" authority with a complex
                interlocking urban and rural and imperial network of titled, landed, agricultural,
                commercial, professional, and political elites, and leaving the common people with a
                complex array of potential relationships with their superiors. It is difficult to
                say what an account of Austen as a novelist representing a world "only just emerging
                from a semi-feudal situation" would look like, but it would certainly be reductive
                and distorting. The claim about what Austen and her characters "assume" reduces to a
                claim about what Austen herself assumes, and it is certainly true that Williams does
                not want his readers to be confined to those assumptions and to that world. But his
                approach is not to impose elements of his own world on the past. Rather, he draws
                the contrast with Cobbett in part to show that others in the period saw the world
                differently, and did so in part by attending with all of Austen’s fine
                discrimination to other elements of the world. Far from telling "us nothing about
                the world within which Austen’s characters interact," Cobbett’s perception of a
                world antagonistically divided between rich and poor tells us something important
                about the world of Jane Austen, whether or not it is visible in her novels. And far
                from complacently affirming a Marxist vision of "bourgeois versus proletarian," the
                process by which Cobbett became increasingly important to Williams was a consequence
                of his recognition of the value of ways of thinking critically about economic and
                social change in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that do not
                easily align with later socialist terms.</p>
                  <p>To understand what Williams meant in asserting that Austen saw only one class, we
                need to appreciate the importance of Cobbett’s emerging sense that interlocking
                economic, political, and social systems were effectively creating two classes with
                antithetical interests and experiences—rich and poor, consumers and producers,
                masters and slaves. I have already mentioned Williams’s account of "the new class
                system" in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, where he cites an April 1821
                article in the <title level="j">Political Register</title> that finds Cobbett accusing
                an opponent of wanting to reduce "the community to two classes: <emph>Masters</emph> 
                and <emph>Slaves</emph>" (15). Cobbett figures again in
                the <title level="m">Keywords</title> entry on class, as Williams distinguishes a
                sense of class as "precise descriptive grouping" from a newer usage in the early
                nineteenth century that involves "basic relationship," and particularly "basic
                economic relationships (as between employers and employed, propertied and
                propertyless)." Cobbett’s 1825 observation "that there is one class of society
                united to oppose another" is cited for the latter, along with an 1805 assertion by
                Charles Hall that, while there may be many different orders in "a civilized state,"
                for the purposes of assessing well-being "they need only be divided into two
                classes, viz. the rich and the poor." Williams suggests that the ambiguity of the
                term has led to "persistent but confused arguments between those who, using 
                <hi rend="bold">class</hi> in the sense of basic relationship, propose two or three
                basic <hi rend="bold">classes</hi>, and those who, trying to use it for descriptive
                groupings, find they have to break these divisions down into smaller and smaller
                categories" (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 66–67).<note place="foot" resp="editors">What distinguishes Marxist conceptions of class in this 
                    historical analysis is less essential economic relationship or social 
                    antagonism than the decided shift from two or three basic classes to two, 
                    "the <emph>bourgeoisie</emph> and the <emph>proletariat</emph>" (67).</note> Some 
                of this ambiguity and confusion seems to be at work
                when Austen scholars object to Williams’s claim that Austen failed to see classes
                because she saw only one class: they are committed to the fine social and economic
                distinctions at work in her fiction. Williams recognizes these, but wants to
                disclose through Cobbett an emerging sense of essential economic division that she
                overlooked, working as she did overwhelmingly on one side of the question—in
                Cobbett’s terms, on the side of the rich and the consumers and the masters.</p>
                  <p>Of course none of this indicates that Cobbett was correct about a world being reduced
                to two classes with antithetical interests and experiences, any more than <title level="m">Emma</title> demonstrates that differences between the likes of Emma
                and Mrs. Elton represent a particularly significant moral or social divide in early
                nineteenth-century England. And Williams certainly takes for granted that Cobbett
                witnessed the development of class divisions that became increasingly important
                features of English society over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth
                centuries. But what Williams does show, through Cobbett, is that we cannot simply
                say that Austen failed to represent class, in the sense of basic economic
                relationship, because no one in the period had such a perception. Waldron
                notwithstanding, Williams knew well that "bourgeois versus proletarian" were not
                operative categories in Austen’s time, and he worked as hard as anyone to 
                think <emph>historically</emph> about class. In doing so, he showed that some of
                Austen’s contemporaries <emph>were</emph> coming to think about a society
                fundamentally divided between adversarial classes. For all we may commend Austen’s
                extraordinary precision, her social range was meaningfully limited. By drawing a
                line from Goldsmith and Crabbe through Cobbett to Dickens and Eliot, Williams
                contends that by the early nineteenth century we have reached a point in English
                social history where failing to represent ordinary working men and women risks
                essential oversight.</p>
                  <p>With this in mind, there is something haunting about the way Emma seems to approach
                the shop door of Ford’s expecting that she will primarily see other characters named
                in the novel (Mr. Perry, Mr. William Cox, Mr. Cole) only to then observe nameless
                figures (a butcher, an old woman, a group of children) who have no part in the
                narrative, and in that sense function as setting rather than agent. It is as if the
                novel fleetingly defies its own expectations, as registered by the heroine. Emma is
                unperturbed—"she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough" (Austen 183)—but
                the reader can be forgiven for a sense of surprise at the abrupt appearance of the
                sort of nameless common people not typically encountered in an Austen novel. And
                that surprise could foster a recognition of the extent to which reading Jane Austen
                can be a matter of internalizing her oversights as well as her insights.</p>

                  <p>By contrast with the account of Austen in <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title>, Williams’s Past Masters monograph on Cobbett has received scant
                notice, even in major studies of Williams, where its appearance is typically limited
                to the bibliography of his publications.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, 
                    O’Connor, Eldridge and Eldridge, and Inglis.</note> In some sense this is
                unsurprising, given that <title level="m">Cobbett</title> was published in an Oxford
                University Press series associated with elementary introductions to a life and
                works. And yet the book is interpretively ambitious and original. Certainly if
                Williams had produced a study with similar claims about Blake or Wordsworth, there
                would be wider notice in Romantic studies. My aim here will not be to offer a
                comprehensive reading of the volume, but instead pick up on a key strand of my
                discussion so far: how in writing about Cobbett as a key figure in the early
                response to industrial capitalism Williams developed particular ways of thinking
                historically about the literature of the past with respect to the present. The
                challenge is something Williams confronted as early as 1969, in an introduction to
                the second volume of <title level="m">The Pelican Book of English Prose</title> that
                was revised and reprinted in <title level="m">Writing in Society</title> as <title level="a">Notes on English Prose, 1780–1950.</title> The first phase of the 
                literary chronology presents particular challenges of familiarity and distance that

            <quote>We shall see, on closer examination, how much has changed in English prose, but the
                stress on continuity is worth making at the beginning. The two centuries since 1780
                are the making of modern Britain. But the connections and the gaps between some of
                the early and some of the later stages are significant. There are moments when we
                know Coleridge or Cobbett or Paine or Jane Austen as ancestors: as connected with us
                in a land and through a language, but across an evident gap of historical time.
                There are also moments when in a thing seen, a thing said, a thing written in a
                particular way, we feel not distance but closeness: a man or a woman; a writer; a
                known experience or idea; a known country. (<title level="m">Writing in

               It was through Cobbett more than any other writer from this "early" period,
                essentially the Romantic period, that Williams explored this problem of distance and
                familiarity, of reading across a historical "gap" that presented acute challenges of
                recognition and understanding. In this sense Cobbett was for Williams the most
                compelling writer of the Romantic period.</p>
                  <p>The book opens inauspiciously, with a requisite biographical chapter that recalls
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> in the way it reduces to excerpts and
                condensed commentary, here, under the heading of years or ranges of years in
                Cobbett’s life. Williams does introduce "a problem of perspective" that returns
                throughout, as when he remarks that some of the best-known publications (<title level="m">A Year’s Residence in the United States of America</title>, <title level="m">A Grammar of the English Language</title>) were from a period of
                exile, 1817 through 1819, when Cobbett returned to America to evade prosecution at
                home. In their "vigorous plain style" and their sense of an "irrepressible
                personality," these texts engage modern readers, yet they are written at a distance
                from the political crisis that shaped Cobbett even as it was shaped by his prose.
                "Cobbett wrote the books," Williams observes, "but also these years of exposure and
                practice wrote Cobbett" (19). In the second part of the volume, "Themes," the
                challenges of moving back and forth in time become increasingly evident. Cobbett’s
                claims about property in labor and the right of combination were "cast in
                conventional terms" and yet pressed to "subversive" conclusions, so as to produce
                "shock (certainly then; and in some places still)" (32–33). His commitment to a
                reform of parliament and the poor laws was consistent with "the radicalism of the
                period," though it found Cobbett "at the edge of his thinking, moving beyond these
                kinds of change," notably in "his practical affiliation to the great majority of
                working and poor people" for whom these reforms would eventually prove inadequate
                (34). In practice Cobbett "was prefiguring the later movement" in working-class
                activism but he "did not in fact reach its characteristic shaping ideas," notably in
                his failure to engage "the new kinds of co-operative and collective social
                provision" that were evident in the work of Paine and Owen (34–35). His "hatred of
                the great proprietors and manufacturers" fostered his sympathy for emerging labor
                organization, yet he still adhered to "an old and idealized social model" that had "a
                limited understanding of the new forces and relations of industrial production"
                (37). The Cobbett of Past Masters can be as socially and historically blinkered as
                the Austen of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, and this last insight
                about his animosities and sympathies yields the paradoxical assertion that what
                limited Cobbett in his own time somehow releases him in our own: "This is one of
                several instances where Cobbett’s older kind of radicalism . . . is at once limited
                and partial in his own day yet, in broader terms, still relevant and even prophetic"
                (37).</p>
                  <p>Where the intermediate <title level="a">Themes</title> portion of the volume offers 
                 brief topical surveys of Cobbett’s writing on economics, politics, and education, the 
                 third and final part, <title level="a">Issues,</title> is more interpretively and 
                 analytically comprehensive, bringing together matters that Williams himself returned 
                 to throughout his career: "the rural economy in its relation both to a developing 
                 industrialism and to the capitalist system and the state" (28). An opening paragraph 
                 recasts the problem of historical method as a matter of style and voice:
            <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">One sense of history requires that we see Cobbett in his time: "in his period." We
                then study his campaigns in relation to the immediate conditions and events that
                provoked them. We study his ideas within the thinking and prejudices of his day. We
                applaud and apologise within his time-bound perspective.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">One sense of writing requires that we see Cobbett both in his time and in ours. His
                use of language belongs to his time: the condition of English in the early
                nineteenth century; the social relations within which he developed particular
                uses—those distinctive combinations of formality and colloquial polemic . . . It is
                in the grafting of colloquial phrases and oral emphases on to the still formal
                strengths of the consciously public address of his period that his most distinctive
                practice can be recognized and defined. Pointing forward, this combination is still
                extraordinarily readable. Much of his writing still directly engages us: never
                irrespective of his time but not bound by it either. There are different
                preferences: for the rural rider; for the democratic pamphleteer; for the practical
                countryman. Yet all these as a writer: the writing outlasting its occasions.
                (54–55)</p>
                     </quote>
               Again and again in the final phase of the volume, Cobbett is released from the early
                nineteenth century, even as Williams the cultural critic is released, with
                kaleidoscopic effect, from writing about the early nineteenth century. Some of this
                has to do with what the critic regards as valuable about his author. The voice, to
                be sure, and the way his ideas "jump at us from his pages" so that "we can hear him
                speaking them, in his usual plain and simple and decided way" (44). Yet if this
                betrays something uncritical about Williams, what Simpson terms his "appetite for
                immediacy," much of what is best about the analysis of Cobbett from the opening
                pages of the volume undermines simple presence through an exploration of bewildering
                historical contradiction and inconsistency.</p>
                  <p>Thus Williams expresses a preference not for Cobbett the farmer and landholder at
                Botley, but rather for the work of the 1820s, after the loss of the Botley farm and
                the writer’s establishment of a more "commercial base" at Kensington. Here he set
                about promulgating subsistence in <title level="m">Cottage Economy</title>, even as he
                undid such tenets in own commercial practice as a seed farmer and purveyor of
                nursery trees, and in his authorial practice as a publisher of books mediating any
                return to the land. As Williams writes of the volume, "It is at once a consciously
                examined renewal of the elements of a subsistence economy, and yet in the practice
                and in the writing an enterprise beyond subsistence" (24). Williams foregrounds
                these contradictions and embraces a similar paradox about the <title level="m">Rural 
                    Rides</title>, which record Cobbett "riding out on business, whether in
                politics or in one of his commercial enterprises" even as he sought "to look, and
                listen" in ways that evince "the whole man, with whole interests" (<title level="m">Cobbett</title> 24–25). In Blakean fashion, this "whole man" under early
                capitalism is a riven and contradictory figure, his radical agrarian principles
                extending out through metropolitan commercial and communicative circuits. The
                opening of the third and final part of the volume finds Williams acknowledging
                "different preferences" among different readers of Cobbett, while insisting that the
                man cannot simply be read "in his period" since "the writing outlasts it occasions."</p>
                  <p>Where the <title level="a">Notes on English Prose</title> numbered Coleridge, 
                 Cobbett, Paine, and Austen among the Romantic period writers who "remain connected 
                 with us," Cobbett was for Williams the most sustained connection, one he was 
                 determined to make available again to his own readers. To achieve this there is a 
                 need to exceed the one sense of history" and the "one sense of writing" sketched 
                 above:
            <quote>These are reasonable senses of both history and writing. But there are other senses,
                which ought now to be explored. There is a sense of history as connecting rather
                than separating his time and ours. Not then this period and that, but a common
                country, in an actual succession, inheritance, of lives. And not then writing as
                style: the critical or textual study; but writing as a practice, within this country
                and inheritance: the giving and taking of energy, in this durable form, to attempt
                or actually to make new kinds of relationship. William Cobbett as contributing, in
                this continuing life. (<title level="m">Cobbett</title> 55)</quote>
               To be sure, the sense of "a common country" and "an actual succession" may give
                pause, in its geographical restriction, and this early twenty-first century American
                reader wonders whether Williams’s point may be exclusionary. At the same time, the
                very inclusion of Cobbett in a Past Masters series that favors the world historical
                figure, running as it does from Homer, Confucius, Plato, and Jesus through Mohammed,
                Shakespeare, Marx, and Tolstoy, indicates something provocative about the claim for
                the local and the immediate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the gendered 
                    restrictions of the Past Masters series—"all these men were written about by 
                    men"—see Delamont 157.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worth closing with a consideration of the meaning, in terms of Williams’s own
                critical and interpretive practice, of a "sense of history" that would understand
                Cobbett "in his time and in ours," and would connect rather than separate the times
                in a shared succession and inheritance. There are some extraordinary claims in a
                section on <title level="a">Cobbett and the New England</title> that follows 
                directly on <title level="a">Cobbett and the Old England.</title> The rural rider 
                experienced "a transforming history" that we tend to
                package and label as "‘Modern England’; ‘Industrial England’; ‘Industrial-Capitalist
                England’; ‘Imperial England’" (<title level="m">Cobbett</title> 57). These are some of
                the terms that counterhistoricist advocates of aesthetic integrity charge Williams
                with injecting into the era of Cobbett and Austen. But he disavows them here,
                aligning all such labeling with a subsequent sense "of an achieved state," which can
                only regard Cobbett as a "good old chap" who was for all his virtues "not on our
                road" (57). Rather than fixing Cobbett historically, Williams proposes that we share
                with him an ongoing experience of a crisis extending from his time to our own:
            <quote>So there can be no indulgent trailing after Cobbett’s ghost; no lifting of his bones.
                What we can actually learn from him is different, and less flattering: what it is
                like to be living through a time when an old social order is visibly breaking up but
                when we do not have the advantage of hindsight to show us the new social order that
                is succeeding it. This uncertain and restless condition is very characteristic of
                the most concerned and most passionate men of Cobbett’s own day. It is marked,
                paradoxically, by intense radical convictions: of the evils of the time, of the
                depths of its disturbances; of the new thing that must happen, the new life that is
                coming through. In Cobbett and Blake, in Shelley and Carlyle, for all their
                individual differences, there is this characteristic intensity and denunciation of
                what is happening in their world, and also this characteristic confidence that these
                evils cannot last, that something radically new must come. Yet what came as new,
                whatever else may be said of it, was not within their line of vision at all; indeed
                was in many of its elements only an intensification of what they had denounced.
                    (58)<note place="foot" resp="editors">The "lifting of his bones" is an 
                        allusion to Cobbett’s disinterment of the remains of Tom Paine, which Williams 
                        discusses earlier in the book (20–21).</note>
                     </quote>
               For literary readers, the company of Blake, Shelley, and Carlyle seems to raise
                Cobbett’s stature, so it is worth insisting again that Williams proceeds from quite
                different assumptions. Cobbett was in fact the leading figure among a group of
                Romantic-period visionaries who contested without fully comprehending the early
                impact of industrial capitalism.</p>
                  <p>Williams’s recognition, towards the end of his life, that his own understanding of
                the situation in the 1980s looking ahead might be no better than Cobbett’s in the
                1820s is as poignant as it is bracing. And yet that is not his final point. Rather,
                he stresses shared historical experience and expectation across the centuries:
            <quote>But if we have any sense of history we cannot . . . forget the picture we have been
                given: of those earlier people who were struggling, bravely enough, with forces they
                did not understand. We may suppose we can exempt ourselves from this likely
                deficiency. Indeed that vanity is often the condition of hope. But what we can not
                reasonably do is miss the community of situation: an old order breaking up;
                uncertainty and restlessness, but in these men radical convictions, that certain new
                things must happen. (59)</quote>
               The later pages of the <title level="m">Cobbett</title> volume are remarkable for the
                way they draw on this acknowledgment in order to freely read, analyze, and engage
                "in his time and in ours," through a series of searching critical explorations that
                escape period restriction, with William Cobbett everywhere in evidence as a
                challenging yet affirming presence. Thus an account of the amplification of "the
                organizing and organized labour movement" in the later nineteenth century leads into
                a consideration of the uneven development of socialism, and of the "complacency"
                with which new movements often regard an earlier history, confident that social and
                economic relations are about to be improved and harmonized, somehow transforming the
                "Great Britain Ltd" of the twentieth century into "Great Britain, the Modern and
                Caring Society." Instead, persistent crisis yields a current situation where cynical
                voices "speak of the forced ‘de-industrialisation’ of Britain." Meanwhile disruptive
                economic change continues unabated and "Great Britain in either of its versions
                exports capital and imports weapons of mass destruction, while settling to an
                apparently unending period of widespread unemployment and redundancy" (71). The
                insistence, which becomes a kind of refrain, that it "cannot be Cobbett who shows us
                any way out of this deep failure" is less a critique of his limitations than a bleak
                reflection on our own. To my mind, the third part of <title level="m">Cobbett</title>
                is as compelling as anything in Williams’s later prose. And the problem in
                overlooking Williams’s writing on Cobbett is less what we fail to learn about
                Cobbett than what we miss about Raymond Williams.</p>

                  <p>I want to use this paper to explore what has always been a
                    central paradox for me about Raymond Williams’s work, and to consider how
                    knowing more about the sources and implications of the historical tensions at
                    the heart of this paradox can help to illuminate the intersection between our
                    work as Romantic critics and broader debates about the humanities today. On the
                    one hand, Williams’s writing has been one of the most fundamental influences on
                    my own interest in the changing cultural landscape of the Romantic period, and
                    particularly, in the highly mediated and politically charged struggles over the
                    definition of literature that shaped this period in such memorable and
                    influential ways. On the other hand, I have never found his analyses of
                    particular Romantic authors helpful in ways that resonated with my work despite
                    these larger theoretical convergences. I can think of several reasons for this.
                    Williams’s often-noted preference for fiction and drama directed his attention
                    more to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (the worlds of Dickens and
                    Hardy, Ibsen and Brecht), and his inclination to formalist approaches diminished
                    his interest in writing about the intersections between debates about literature
                    and the nitty-gritty world of political struggles that writers such as E. P.
                    Thompson focused on. It may also have had a lot to do with generational
                    differences, though ironically, this is primarily because so much of Williams’s
                    pioneering work has passed into mainstream thought as today’s received wisdom.
                    His analyses, which were usually limited to a few of the canonical poets (mainly
                    Wordsworth and Blake), are often rooted in largely unqualified references to a
                    "Romantic" mindset with the attendant set of implicit assumptions that so much
                    of the best work of the past few decades has been pushing back against. It isn’t
                    that these sorts of analyses are wrong, but as Williams had himself repeatedly
                    argued about the dangers of abstractions generally, they are reductive in ways
                    that distort the historical complexities of the era.</p>
                  <p>So how to square these two sides of Williams’s work? Ironically, Williams’s own evolving 
                understanding of the legacy of the cultural dynamics of this period may provide the best 
                answer. As he argued most explicitly in later works such as <title level="m">Marxism 
                    and Literature</title>, the Romantic period’s greatest impact may be the
                    enduring influence of the shift towards an ideology of the aesthetic marked by a
                    "false attachment" to literature and art as an autonomous realm, with the
                    related set of assumptions about genius, the imagination, and creativity, that
                    supported this new way of thinking about aesthetic value (43). The impact of
                    this paradigm shift as a form of "abstraction" that alienated literature and art
                    from the stubborn complexities of lived experience (as controversial as his
                    insistence on that phrase has been) would mark his own thinking in fundamental
                    ways, but as he famously pointed out, this period also witnessed the emergence
                    that broader realm hailed as "culture" whose intellectual possibilities would
                    ultimately reinforce his self-reflexive commitment to charting the history of
                    these dynamics (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 47).</p>
                  <p>Williams’s awareness of both the theoretical limitations
                    and the political cost of aesthetic forms of abstraction (as well as his
                    sympathetic understanding of the historical pressures that produced them) <emph>and</emph> 
                of the enabling critical potential of modern ideas of culture as a realm of theoretical 
                engagement helps to explain the paradox that I noted at the outset: in many ways, 
                Williams’s work was driven by his awareness of the vital importance of <emph>unlearning</emph> 
                the inherited assumptions that had helped to shape his own canonical understanding of 
                literary history. It was, as he put it in the extensive interviews published as <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, "a clearing operation" aimed at jettisoning 
                inherited but indefensible assumptions in the hope that "once the ground has been 
                cleared of the received idea of literature, it will be possible to find certain new 
                concepts that would allow for special emphases" (335, 325). Both of these impulses (the 
                commitment to unlearning outmoded assumptions and the need to do so) can, as his own work 
                has demonstrated, be traced back to these contrapuntal developments which emerged in the 
                late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>
                  <p>The impact of this intervention was reinforced by the unflinchingly dialectical nature of 
                Williams’s work: it was animated by his abiding interest in knowing more about how these 
                historical dynamics could help him to respond to the political and cultural pressures of 
                his own day, and just as valuably, how a more clearly self-reflexive awareness of his own 
                critical position had shaped his understanding of this history in the first place. If, 
                as he insisted in the conclusion to <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "the 
                history of the idea of culture is a record of our
                    reactions, in thought and feeling, to the changed conditions of our modern
                    life," it was equally true that "these, in turn, are only understood within the
                    context of our actions" (295).</p>
                  <p>This process of unlearning or "clearing" was at the heart of the genealogical impulse 
                that defined early projects such as <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>, which foregrounded a history of thinking about the phenomenon of 
                culture that had long remained virtually invisible precisely because it <emph>was</emph> 
                so fundamental, but it also reflects the evolution of his approach as he moved from what 
                Williams himself described as the "first-stage radicalism" of his earlier work towards 
                the more rigorously skeptical perspective that would define his interest in the idea of 
                literature as an historically arbitrary category in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 110). The blind 
                spots that are clearest in the uncritically canonical spirit of Williams’s response to 
                Romantic literature (as feminist critics have long pointed out, one would never guess 
                that there were any women writers in the period, apart from Jane Austen) are themselves 
                the best evidence of the extraordinary importance of this endeavor to come to terms with 
                the shaping influence of the long history of these disciplinary formations and the 
                aesthetic values that supported them.</p>
                  <p>The real value of understanding these developments in Williams’s work—both the deformations 
                that his work was aimed at "clearing" and the traces of his inscription within these 
                influences—may be the ways that they can in turn help us to think about the challenges 
                that we face in our own struggle to articulate the public value of the humanities today 
                and, like Williams, to bring this public role to bear on the broader political struggles 
                of our day. Williams’s 1984 <title level="j">London Review of Books</title> essay on 
                Georg Lukacs, published just four years before his death, was on one level an eloquent 
                if implicit reflection on many of these aspects of Williams’s own career. Having praised 
                Lukacs as "one of the more interesting and tolerable Marxist critics of literature," 
                Williams attributed his relative obscurity amongst British readers to three principal 
                causes: "the breadth of his learning and his relative freedom from dogmatism"; his 
                alignment with "an old and fruitless kind of Marxism" that was reminiscent of Marxist 
                theory’s "Stalinist phase"; and perhaps worst of all, his alignment with "the ‘humanist 
                fallacy’ in Western Marxism, in his reliance on notions of ‘man as subject’ and more 
                directly in his kind of socialism, which is more properly a ‘romantic anti-capitalism’" 
                (<title level="a">A Man</title> 14). As a leading proponent of the New Left, Williams was 
                never in much danger of being branded a Stalinist, but arguably, the other two factors 
                might well help to explain Williams’s own shifting stature within theoretical debates. 
                During the heyday of the theory wars when the most damning charge in graduate school was 
                to be guilty of residual humanism, exposed as being still in thrall to all of those 
                ideological forces that one <emph>thought</emph> one was resisting but apparently was not, 
                Williams’s cultural materialism was overshadowed by the theoretical interventions of 
                French poststructuralists whose work offered an uncompromising critique of humanist 
                thought.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Terry Eagleton’s strident and often strangely 
                    personal critique of his former teacher in <title level="m">Criticism and 
                        Ideology</title>, which zeroed in on what Eagleton rejected
                                as Williams’s gradualist approach, may have been the most prominent
                                of critical arguments that Williams’s work had failed to absorb the
                                important lessons of Marxists such as Louis Althusser, whose work
                                owed its prominence to its deft mixture of Lancanian insight about a
                                radically decentered subjectivity and its scientific claims for
                                Marxism.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Arguably, this may have had as much to do with image as content. Being Welsh lacked 
                the allure of <emph>avant-garde</emph> radicalism at a time when being Parisian was an 
                unspoken but crucial ingredient in the cultural capital that was a major part of the 
                attractions of theory on many North American campuses. Being the son of a railway worker 
                from a village called Pandy, a few miles from the market town of Abergavenny, was no 
                match for the <emph>frisson</emph> of Left Bank intellectualism. But as literary critics 
                have become increasingly wary of what Rita Felski has called "the hermeneutics of 
                suspicion" and dubious of the political upside of the zero-sum version of power 
                implicit in Louis Althusser’s and Michel Foucault’s arguments, which seemed to have 
                thrown any possibility of agency out with the humanist bathwater, Williams’s work 
                has garnered renewed interest.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The phrase recurs 
                    throughout Rita Felski’s <title level="m">The Limits of Critique</title>. It has 
                    gained momentum more broadly in recent years as a shorthand for concerns about the 
                    excessively accusatory tone of many critics who, as Felski argues, often exempt 
                    themselves from the suspicions of any possibility of agency that ground their 
                    analyses.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Timothy Brennan, a leading voice within recent debates
                    about globalization, has argued over the course of several essays and books that
                    Williams offers a crucial underacknowledged voice within theoretical debates.
                    Like Williams’s own discussion of Lukacs, Brennan suggests that this may be
                    partly because the extraordinary breadth of Williams’s intellectual scope makes
                    a proper level of engagement with his work especially challenging. As Brennan
                    argues, the "deceptively straightforward" style of Williams’s writing "at the
                    level of the sentence" is belied by the unique level of the challenges posed,
                    both by "the volumes of prior reading required to appreciate his range of
                    reference," and perhaps even more dauntingly, by the "<emph>symphonic</emph>"
                    nature of Williams’s work, which channels various currents of thought into a
                    particular argument in ways that make it "extraordinarily difficult to analyze
                    the intricate architecture of its individual components" (<title level="a">Running</title> 287).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also 
                            Brennan’s discussion of the impact of Williams’s <title level="m">The 
                                Country and the City</title>, a study whose particular
                                approach exemplifies this "symphonic" style: "His work proliferates,
                                spiraling outwards, spun out at a level of complexity, and delivered
                                in a relaxed and knowing comprehensiveness, over the wide ambit of
                                associations, imageries, feelings, attitudes and cultural tics,
                                until one comes to see the unresolved and constantly morphing
                                conflict between country and city as the primary contradiction of
                                all social life" (<title level="a">On the Image,</title> 38–39).</note> As 
                Brennan points out, precisely because of this paradoxical blend of insights and challenges, 
                the influence of Williams’s work is most often felt in indirect or derivative forms. In 
                the opening page of <title level="m">Wars of Position</title>, Brennan excoriates 
                an academic (whom he politely leaves
                    unnamed) who, having been asked about her use of the phrase "structures of
                    feeling," explained that she got it from a book on Hollywood cinema without any
                    apparent recognition of the fact that it had been introduced and popularized by
                    Williams (1). For Brennan, this personal oversight matters because "higher
                    stakes" are involved than a simple failure of attribution (1).</p>
                  <p>The nature of these "higher stakes" becomes clearer in
                    Brennan’s discussion of Edward Said’s larger attack on the "abdication of
                    responsibility" that characterized poststructuralist theoretical debates (<title level="m">Wars</title> 99). Said’s brand of discourse analysis in <title level="m">Orientalism</title> has often invited assumptions about his debt 
                to Foucault, but as Brennan points out, Said’s sustained critique of the appeal of 
                Foucault’s "flawed attitude to power," which "captivated not only Foucault himself but 
                many of his readers" as a way of "justify[ing] political quietism with sophisticated 
                intellectualism," stands out especially strongly when set against "the excitement Said 
                has" when he discusses Williams’s work (qtd. in Brennan, <title level="m">Wars</title> 
                112, 111). This double sense of intellectual debt (theoretical and political) converged 
                in Said’s own call to "reconsider, reexamine, and reformulate the relevance of humanism" 
                as "a useable praxis for intellectuals and academics who want to know what they are 
                doing, what they are committed to as scholars, and who want also to connect these 
                principles to the world in which they live as citizens," particularly in a "turbulent 
                world . . . brimming over with belligerency, actual wars, and all kinds of 
                terrorism" (Said 6, 2).</p>
                  <p>Said’s increasingly explicit call for a renewed form of
                    radical humanism underscores the larger importance of Williams’s earlier
                    commitment to mapping out a history of the idea of culture as it emerged "in the
                    last decades of the eighteenth century, and in the first half of the nineteenth
                    century" as part of a broader shift in the meaning of a constellation of words
                    such as "<emph>industry</emph>, <emph>democracy</emph>, <emph>class</emph>, 
                and <emph>art</emph>" that was driven by more fundamental changes "in our 
                characteristic ways of thinking about our common life: about our social, political 
                and economic institutions; about the purposes which these institutions are designed 
                to embody; and about the relations to these institutions and purposes of our 
                activities in learning, education, and the arts" (Williams, <title level="m">Culture</title> xiii). Williams felt compelled to chart the impact of
                    these earlier shifts in large part because of the parallels he saw between the
                    struggles of early nineteenth-century thinkers for whom the idea of culture
                    offered a powerful basis for resistance and "the post-1945 crisis of belief and
                    affiliation" that Williams himself was confronted by as <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> was taking shape. Understanding the challenges inherent in this 
                earlier epoch that we now think of as the Romantic period was, for Williams, an 
                important "way of finding a position from which I could hope to understand and act 
                in contemporary society, necessarily through its history, which had delivered this 
                strange, unsettling, and exciting, world to us" (<title level="m">Culture</title> xii).</p>
                  <p>Returning to this work decades later as he prepared a new introduction to <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> for the Morningside edition in 1982, that 
                 sense of a "now major crisis" had only intensified in the face of Thatcherite 
                 conservatism (ix). The need for developing a "detailed and complex thinking about 
                 culture which has been active and vibrant at every stage" had lost none of its 
                 urgency, in large part because the historical turn in <title level="m">Culture and 
                     Society</title> anticipated the double imperative inherent in Said’s call
                    for a form of radical humanism as a basis for political engagement that was at
                    the same time driven by self-critique about the limitations of the tradition out
                    of which it emerged (viii). As Williams’s work demonstrated, the modern idea of
                    culture that had developed in the Romantic period was similarly ambivalent: it
                    provided thinkers with an intellectual basis for resisting the contradictions of
                    industrial capitalism, but because it had also tended to be deployed as a
                    bulwark against the perceived excesses of modernity generally (including its
                    more progressive aspects such as democracy and the rise of a mass public
                    culture), its radical potential was, more often than not, compromised by an
                    underlying conservatism. Shining a historical light on both sides of these early
                    debates about the modern idea of culture enabled Williams to demonstrate more
                    clearly how aligning one’s work with this intellectual tradition might provide a
                    "way of finding a position from which [one] could hope to understand and act in
                    contemporary society" even as it foregrounded the need to clarify the historical
                    limitations of these inherited ideas.</p>
                  <p>Fortified by what Williams has described as "the key move"
                    in the evolution of his own thinking "to the notion of cultural production as
                    itself material" (an insight that reinforced his challenge to reductive accounts
                    of the notorious Marxist distinction between base and superstructure), his work
                    increasingly foregrounded the underlying classificatory assumptions that
                    structured the literary field as a primary focus of analysis in themselves
                    (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 139). What may be most valuable about Williams’s
                    historicism, though, is the strikingly empathetic nature of his ability to blend
                    critique with a sense of affirmation. Rather than simply debunking these earlier
                    mystifications of literature and art as acts of theoretical bad faith,
                    Williams’s "clearing operation" remained animated by his sense of both the
                    extraordinary efforts of earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures of their
                    own day, and even more importantly, of the extent to which these mystifications,
                    once exposed as "false attachment[s]," could nonetheless also be seen in terms
                    of the positive cultural work they also enabled (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 
                43). The equation of literature with "creative writing" may have been inherently reductive, 
                but as he also pointed out, critical awareness of the "actively ideological" nature of 
                the "powerful and often forbidding" impact of these ideas needed to be balanced against 
                an appreciation of both the deeply "affirmative" spirit of their origin as a strategy 
                for resisting "the socially repressive and intellectually mechanical forms of a new 
                social order: that of capitalism and especially industrial capitalism," and more broadly, 
                their capacity to manifest themselves in more beneficial ways: "What was laid down as a 
                defensive reaction became in the course of the century a most important positive 
                principle, which in its full implications was deeply and genuinely humane" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 43, 50; <title level="m">Culture</title> 40). The fact 
                that this new aesthetic ideology would itself often be embraced in "socially 
                repressive" and "intellectually mechanical ways" on behalf of the dominant social 
                order did not negate the legacy of these more positive dimensions. The real challenge 
                was to develop ways of engaging with "the very complicated pressures and limits which, 
                in their weakest forms, these [emerging] definitions falsely stabilized, yet which, in 
                their strongest forms, they sought to emphasize as new cultural practice" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 145).</p>
                  <p>For Williams, "the human commitments of these earlier
                    writers came through, in a majority of cases, as the voices of fellow strugglers
                    rather than of historically dated or periodised thinkers," an archeology of
                    resistance, however imperfect, whose larger effect was to offer an important
                    "sense that such a tradition existed" (<title level="m">Culture</title>, xi, x). As
                    Williams’s language, with its emphasis on a sense of continuity with the "human
                    commitments" of these "fellow strugglers" in their "thinking about our common
                    life" suggests, his work remained unapologetically rooted within precisely the
                    sort of humanist impulse that he cites as a reason for Lukacs’s undeserved
                    neglect: it was a "way of finding a position from which" we in turn can "hope to
                    understand and act in contemporary society" in terms that reinscribed a faith in
                    the possibility of agency even as it rejected any naïve assumptions about the
                    potential of this position (<title level="m">Culture</title> xii). However strongly 
                Williams’s work may have gravitated towards a sense of the need to critique the 
                influence of the ideas about the aesthetic that emerged in the Romantic period, this 
                critical spirit was always balanced against his recognition of the efforts of these 
                earlier thinkers to wrestle with the pressures of their day, even where the legacy of
                    their ideas remained the focus of his own critical efforts.</p>
                  <p>Where New Historicist critics often read the theories of
                    the aesthetic that emerged in this period as a flight from the pressures of
                    history, Williams tended to approach the efforts of these authors as the work of
                    "fellow strugglers" engaged in flawed but still valuable efforts to wrestle with
                    the idea of culture, not as a means of evasion or as a formal and
                    all-encompassing ideological system but as a basis for confronting "the lived
                    dominance and subordination of particular classes" in specific historical
                    contexts (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 110). Williams was definitely not 
                uncritical of Romantic theories of the aesthetic. He warned that the tendency to "isolate 
                art, to specialize the imaginative faculty to . . . one kind of activity" amounted to a
                    "false attachment" to art as an autonomous realm that was little more than "a
                    saving clause in a bad treaty" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 43, 67). This 
                elevation of art into "a symbolic abstraction for a whole range of human experience" may 
                have been a "valuable abstraction" in many ways because of the transformative power 
                that it attributed to art in the face of dehumanizing pressures, but it was "an abstraction
                    nonetheless, because a general social activity was forced into the status of a
                    department or province, and actual works of art were in part converted into a
                    self-pleading ideology" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 47). This process amounted 
                to a "defensive reaction" that legitimated "the separation of poets from other men, and 
                their classification into an idealized general person, ‘Poet’ or ‘Artist,’ which was to be 
                so widely and damagingly received" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 48). But having 
                emphasized the cost of this impulse towards abstraction, Williams refused to allow 
                readers to forget the "deeply and genuinely humane" source of this shift: "What was 
                important at this time was the stress given to a mode of human experience and activity 
                which the progress of society seemed increasingly to deny" (<title level="m">Culture</title> 40, 39). Approached in a spirit of historical complexity,
                    this Romantic-era impulse towards abstraction must be understood, not by
                    imposing further layers of abstraction by imposing our own inadequately
                    historicized interpretations on it but by recognizing it as a flawed but
                    understandable "social activity" in its own right in the face of larger hostile
                    pressures.</p>
                  <p>As the renewed critical attention that it has received in recent years suggests, Williams’s 
                work has itself become a crucial part of the history of cultural analysis that his own work 
                charts, an exemplary moment in a tradition of resistance that both focused and intensified 
                the efforts of these earlier "fellow strugglers." In this as in so many other instances, 
                humanism (in both its radical and more conventional forms) remains deeply palimpsestic: a 
                way of responding to the pressures of our own day by understanding more clearly the legacy 
                of the efforts of previous thinkers to wrestle with similar challenges in their earlier 
                forms. If, as Williams suggested, Robert Southey’s invocation of the ghost of Thomas More 
                in <title level="m">Colloquies</title> "indicates a conscious continuity with the first phase of
                    the humanist challenge" that emerged during the Renaissance
                    (<title level="m">Culture</title> 24), Williams’s own engagement with Southey and his
                    contemporaries suggests a similarly "conscious continuity" with this subsequent
                    early nineteenth-century phase in this "humanist challenge." This, for Williams,
                    is why the emergence of our modern idea of culture in the Romantic period was so
                    vital. It offered (in the historical interventions charted by Williams and in
                    his own work) a "special kind of map by means of which the nature of the
                    changes" "in our social, economic and political life" can be charted (<title level="m">Culture</title> xvii). But crucially for Williams, if culture provides a
                    unique way of mapping these changes, the very nature of this map itself was
                    changing in fundamental ways. Its initial function as "a separate body of moral
                    and intellectual activities" and as "a court of human appeal" had extended to a
                    far broader and more fundamental understanding of culture as "a whole way of
                    life, not only as a scale of integrity, but as a mode of interpreting all our
                    common experience, and, in this new interpretation, changing it" (<title level="m">Culture</title> xviii). This understanding of culture has, like Harry
                    Potter’s Marauder’s Map, become both mobile and self-reflexive: a critical
                    disposition focused on charting dynamics rather than fixed topographies and
                    highlighting our own position within them: "Each [literary] convention must be
                    assessed by what it is rooted in and what it does: an assessment that is related
                    to a much more general historical judgment that is also an affiliation—not
                    history as all that has happened, but as where oneself is in it" (<title level="m">Politics</title> 307).</p>
                  <p>However necessary it may be to delineate the theoretical
                    differences between the different stages of Williams’s career, particularly as
                    his work became more overtly engaged with current Marxist debates, on the one
                    hand, and more energized by both his involvement in the radical political
                    struggles associated with the May Day Manifesto and by his theoretical
                    insistence on the materiality of culture, on the other, it remains equally
                    important to emphasize the continuities implicit in Williams’s efforts to chart
                    the relations between different forms of cultural production and broader social
                    and political relations.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Williams’s role in 
                        these political struggles, see Fred Inglis, <title level="m">Raymond
                            Williams</title> (196–217), and Williams’s own account in <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> (361–83)</note> Reflecting on 
                the enthusiastic response that his more overt engagement with Marxist theory in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> garnered in some quarters—"the 
                positive relief with which some my students said—at last he’s talking 
                about Marxism directly, he’s got over
                    his hang-ups and become a real person"—Williams countered that this sense of a
                    change in his thinking missed the far more fundamental continuities across the
                    whole of his work, in all of which he had been "arguing with what I take to be
                    official English culture," even if he had "done that in different ways in
                    different phases" (<title level="m">Politics and
                    Letters</title> 317, 316). The common thread running through these
                    different phases had been Williams’s interest, not just in mapping out the
                    broader relations that exposed the limitations of this "official" version of
                    culture, but perhaps more importantly, highlighting a history of earlier
                    writers’ similar efforts.</p>
                  <p>This cartographic impulse to map out the connections that
                    define an increasingly complex understanding of our "whole way of life" has
                    become important in new but familiar ways in the face of the complexities that
                    confront us in the opening decades of the twenty-first century. In <title level="m">Age of Discovery</title>, Ian
                    Goldin and Chris Kutarna argue in a similar spirit that like earlier eras, our
                    age is a precarious but exciting transitional moment faced with enormous
                    possibilities and hazards. Faced with spiralling levels of complexity on
                    multiple fronts, Goldin and Kutarna echo Williams’s fundamental lesson about the
                    challenge this implies: "Every day in which we do not actively map out new
                    connections, we become more lost in their complexity" (255). The key to managing
                    these changes, they argue, is that we emulate earlier thinkers (in their case,
                    the "learned people in the Renaissance" rather than the Romantic period) who,
                    faced with similar pressures and opportunities, "completely changed their mental
                    map of the world to suit the challenges they faced" (251). Williams’s
                    intervention, which was grounded in his study of early nineteenth-century
                    thinkers’ efforts to change their own "mental map of the world," has lost none
                    of its urgency or relevance.</p>
                  <p>For those of us who work in the humanities, these
                    challenges have been felt in especially immediate ways. In her landmark 2010
                    book, <title level="m"> Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities</title>, 
                Martha Nussbaum warned that "we are in the midst of a
                    crisis of massive proportions and grave global significance": not "the global
                    economic crisis that began in 2008" whose ultimate outcome may well be the rise
                    of alt-right populist extremism one decade later, but the widespread erosion of
                    support for the humanities both within and outside of universities (1). The
                    urgency of the topic has generated an avalanche of books, studies, and articles
                    in a range of venues, from academic journals to leading magazines and
                    newspapers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See, for instance, Rens Bod, <title level="m">A New History of the Humanities</title>; Stefan Collini, <title level="m">What Are Universities For?</title>; Thomas Docherty, <title level="m">For the University</title>; Tamson Pietsch, <title level="m">Empire

                        Future</ref> (2013)—suggests, the cartographic impulse embraced by Williams 
                and echoed by Goldin and Kutarna remains central to these responses. As humanist 
                thinkers have always recognized, this task of mapping the future begins with a 
                clearer understanding of the historical force of the cultural formations whose 
                stubbornly prescriptive influence did so much to define the disciplines within which 
                we study them.</p>
                  <p>Stefan Collini’s argument that we need "to start from
                    further away in order to revitalize ways of understanding the nature and
                    importance of universities that are in danger of being lost sight of in the
                    present" underscores the continuing importance of Williams’s historical turn to
                    the project of developing an archeology of ideas forged by earlier thinkers in
                    the face of similar pressures as a basis for responding to current issues (19).
                    Williams’s genealogical work on culture never explicitly engaged with the
                    emergence of modern institutional forms of the humanities in these same decades,
                    however closely intertwined these histories may have been, but as his analyses
                    make clear, the work of these earlier writers amounted to exemplary instances of
                    the humanities in action: critical reflections on the nature and role of culture
                    as a transformative domain within a modern industrial society. If talk of
                    "crisis of the humanities" has declined over the past few years, this may be in
                    part because there are bigger crises to worry about. The issue seems less and
                    less to be what society can do for the humanities, than what the humanities can
                    do for a society in the face of a rising spirit of authoritarianism. But the
                    key, as Williams argued in the face of very different pressures, begins with
                    resisting the lure of reifying supposedly autonomous sites of resistance,
                    whether that be "culture" or its institutional cousin, "the humanities."</p>
                  <p>The implications of Williams’s particular form of radical humanism become clearest 
                in his discussion of hegemony in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, 
                where, aligning his approach with Gramsci, Williams
                    explicitly distinguishes the idea of hegemony as "a lived system of meanings and
                    values" that is fundamentally shaped by "relations of domination and
                    subordination" without ever being reduced to them—"a whole body of practices and
                    expectations, over the whole of living: our senses and assignments of energy,
                    our shaping perceptions of ourselves and our world"—from the more abstracted and
                    endlessly "generalized system" that theorists such as Althusser described as
                    "ideology" (109–10). Where the idea of ideology developed by Althusser implied a
                    "relatively formal and articulated system of meanings, values, and beliefs, of a
                    kind that can be abstracted as a ‘world-view’ or ‘class outlook’" and then
                    mapped onto cultural analyses of "works of art" as "fully articulate and
                    systematic expressions of this ideology," the concept of hegemony favored by
                    Williams suggested a work-in-progress: a sense of contingency rooted in people’s
                    actual struggles to engage with the pressures of their day: "the relatively
                    mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate consciousness of actual men [and
                    women] in that period" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 109). This shift 
                (from ideology as wall-to-wall
                    consciousness to hegemony as a site of struggle) is crucial because it
                    transforms culture, and therefore, the study of it, from a mere "superstructure"
                    reflecting "a formed social and economic structure" to a vital set of activities
                    that actively help to shape people’s historical moment (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 111). In this sense, the idea of "a lived hegemony" is
                    never, "except analytically, a system or a structure. It is a realized complex
                    of experiences, relationships, and activities, with specific and changing
                    pressures and limits" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 112).</p>
                  <p>This recourse to a rhetoric of the lived experiences of "actual men" was reinforced by 
                the autobiographical dimension of his work, especially in <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title>, which was peppered with passages such as his comment that 
                "I know these feelings at once, from my own experience. The only landscape I ever 
                see, in dreams, is the Black Mountain village in which I was born. When I go back 
                to that country, I feel a recovery of a particular kind of life, which appears, as 
                an inescapable identity, a more positive connection than I have known elsewhere" 
                (84). There is, according to the almost Wordsworthian logic of these sorts of 
                invocations, a kind of personal and unmediated "truth" here that can be extrapolated 
                into a broader social truth in opposition to the distortions of power. It was no 
                accident that <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> opens with what, for many critics, was a surprisingly sympathetic 
                discussion of Edmund Burke, the great champion of the importance of feelings to any 
                sustainable vision of common life. Returning to this idea three years later in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, Williams would provide a name for this 
                theoretical focus: "structure[s] of feeling," a term that would become a hallmark of 
                his work and which was intended to convey a phenomenon that was, paradoxically, both 
                "firm and definite," grounded in particular forms of social organization, and 
                evanescent, operating "in the most delicate and least tangible parts of our 
                activities" (64).</p>
                  <p>Williams’s stress on the importance of this fleeting world
                    of deeply felt but sometimes only half-recognized emotional life has rendered
                    his work vulnerable to the criticism that, despite his insistence to the
                    contrary, it presumes the availability of some preideological realm of
                    unmediated self-presence. But as Williams has always argued, this recourse to
                    lived experience was primarily a strategy for resisting the dangers of
                    abstraction (whether it is in the name of poetry or art or culture or the
                    humanities) without denying the unique value of the forms of knowledge and
                    potential for political engagement that these phenomena also afford. This
                    position may have been grounded in an overly confident appeal to the authentic
                    experience of actual men and women, but this interpretive fallacy does not
                    negate the importance of Williams’s related effort to ground the possibility of
                    political resistance in a cultural vision that recognized the transformative
                    promise of affect as a domain that could never be fully recontained within
                    dominant systems of power in terms that reflect Gramsci’s vision of hegemony as
                    process: "the relatively mixed, confused, incomplete, or inarticulate
                    consciousness of actual men [and women] in that period" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 109). If Williams’s work, both in its limitations and the
                    critical scrutiny that he brought to bear on the historical sources of these
                    limitations, offered a compelling counterpoint to the strengths and the problems
                    inherent in Romantic authors’ own efforts to advance a similar recognition of
                    the primacy of lived experience in face of the hostile pressures of their day,
                    his understanding of these authors as both a pioneering force in the development
                    of new ideas about the role of culture and as cautionary examples of the
                    dangerous tug of abstraction may well be more material than ever.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">The problem of determination takes particular shape during the nineteenth
                    century, as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept of
                    determination from Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the ways
                    preexisting conditions fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as 
                    <emph>determined</emph> comes also to mean "unwavering" or "persistent").
                    In this essay I track these two competing definitions of <emph>determined</emph> through 
                    the writing of Raymond Williams and William Wordsworth.
                    As critical concepts open to caricature, Romanticism and Marxism are sometimes
                    placed in tension: where Romanticism prioritizes the power of the individual will,
                    Marxism prioritizes the external forces that condition it. But the texts we choose
                    to read closely often challenge the characterizations we bring to bear on them.
                    Williams, for instance, struggles against Marxism’s focus on economic determinism
                    and Wordsworth concludes Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—a poem that
                    celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the importance of
                    "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In this way, both
                    writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses of
                    "determination" in their work. In placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests
                    turn grammatical, for Williams and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice
                    in their writing about determination. If both writers share an interest in
                    determination and its various and competing connotations, what can we learn about
                    the concept from attending to the grammatical, even stylistic, choices writers make
                    when writing about determination?</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>A few years ago the institution that employs me put together an advertising campaign
                that I enjoy imagining as Hegel-inspired. For purposes of attracting donations and
                student applications, the campaign’s featured slogan, "Determined Spirit," describes
                a shared, tenacious drive. And indeed, Clemson students often win awards for what
                gets called "school spirit." But given the various and sometimes competing senses of
                "determined," the slogan also introduces the possibility that "spirit" at Clemson is
                expected, even compulsory. A determined spirit, in other words, is also a
                predetermined spirit, a spirit determined in advance.</p>
                  <p>In his <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Raymond Williams explores the complex range
                of definitions associated with the word <emph>determine</emph> as he
                focuses on the distinction between determination and determinism, where the word 
                <emph>determination</emph> refers to an unwavering individual will and the
                word <emph>determinism</emph> refers to the opposite, a will caught up in
                general processes beyond its control. Williams writes that even the most insistent
                and pseudoauthoritative application of one fixed sense of the word <emph>determined</emph> 
                cannot avoid the other line of meaning. He illustrates the potential difficulty 
                <emph>determine</emph> introduces with the sentence, "I am determined not
                to be determined," where the two meanings of determine vie for control (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 102). On the one hand, the "I" of the sentence is
                resolved to remain free from determination, free from all constraints, bounds, and
                definitions. In this way the "I" pursues a model sovereignty. On the other hand, the
                sentence also suggests that this pursuit of a model sovereignty is already and from
                the start determined, a sign of the subject’s unfreedom; there may be nothing less
                free than the subject’s supposedly free pursuit of freedom. And even these two broad
                interpretations of Williams’s sentence do not exhaust the interpretive
                possibilities, which is one of the reasons he offers it. One might still stress how
                the sentence produces an "I" that is resolved to be unresolved, an "I" that would
                prefer not to act and will say "no" to making any and all future decisions: "I am
                determined not to have to determine anything (myself)." Or perhaps this "I" has been
                determined this way, an "I" destined for indetermination: as if Williams had in mind
                Melville’s Bartleby or were commenting on the Supreme Court under Chief Justice
                Roberts. Needless to say, the sentence is not easy to translate, though as an
                experiment I did type the sentence into Google Translate and received this sentence
                in German, "Ich bin entschlossen, nicht bestimmt zu sein," which takes care of some
                of the difficulty <emph>determined</emph> introduces into English by
                translating one use of <emph>determined</emph> as <foreign xml:lang="de">entschlossen</foreign> and the other as <foreign xml:lang="de">bestimmt</foreign>. If one
                feeds this German translation back into Google Translate one receives in return: "I
                am determined not to be specific." Not uninteresting, but not quite the same.</p>
                  <p>For Williams, the problem of determination takes particular shape during the
                nineteenth century, as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept
                of determination from Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the
                ways preexisting conditions fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as
                    <emph>determined</emph> comes also to mean "unwavering" or
                "persistent," and as the idea of the sovereign individual, the lyric "I," takes
                shape). William Keach develops this line of thinking in <title level="m">Arbitrary
                    Power</title>, where he remarks on the importance of determination to the
                nineteenth century: "Whether as a question of the ‘general will’ of the polis or of
                the individual will of a political agent or writer, ‘determination’ structures
                nineteenth-century efforts to understand the constitution of society and culture"
                    (22).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On determination, historicism, and Romanticism, 
                        see also Chandler 36. On determination and aesthetic and medical discourse,

                        earlier draft of this essay.</note> My interests are in part historical. 
                With Williams’s attention in mind to the
                importance of determination as a concept during the nineteenth century and his
                attention to the ways its meaning shifts, I turn to Book I of William Wordsworth’s
                <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, which features the word <emph>determined</emph> 
                at several key moments. As Wordsworth begins his biographical
                poem, he wonders whether he was determined by some external force to be a poet and
                whether he is determined enough to become one. In this essay I track these two
                competing definitions of <emph>determined</emph> through the writing of
                Williams and Wordsworth, a Marxist cultural critic on the one hand and a Romantic
                poet on the other. As critical concepts open to caricature, Romanticism and Marxism
                are sometimes placed in tension: where Romanticism prioritizes the power of the
                individual will, Marxism prioritizes the external forces that condition it. But the
                texts we choose to read closely often challenge the characterizations we bring to
                bear on them. Williams, for instance, struggles against Marxism’s focus on economic
                determinism, and Wordsworth concludes Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>—a
                poem that celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the
                importance of "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In
                this way, both writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses
                of "determination" in their work.</p>
                  <p>But in placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests turn grammatical, for
                Williams and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice in their writing about
                determination. They also both frequently employ empty grammatical subjects when
                writing about determination, which has the effect of making the subject of a key
                sentence about determination itself difficult to determine. Some of the interpretive
                problems posed by Williams’s sentence ("I am determined not to be determined") might
                be described in grammatical terms: is the first-person pronoun the agent of the
                action (in which case the sentence is read as active voice) or is some other,
                unnamed subject the agent of the action (in which case the sentence is read as
                passive voice)? The difference emerges when one rewrites the sentence, for instance,
                as "I am determined (by my class) not to be determined." If both writers share an
                interest in determination and its various and competing connotations, what can we
                learn about the concept from attending to the grammatical, even stylistic, choices
                writers make when writing about determination?</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>No Problem More Difficult</head>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, Williams begins his chapter
                 <title level="a">Determination</title> by identifying the term’s importance to 
                 Marxism: "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is more difficult, 
                 than that of ‘determination’" (83). Williams attempts to rescue Marxism 
                 from too rigid an emphasis on determination
                without, however, giving up on the importance of the term to cultural theory in
                general. As he concludes the first paragraph: "A Marxism without some concept of
                determination is in effect worthless. A Marxism with many of the concepts of
                determination it now has is quite radically disabled"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 83). Today, given developments
                in disability studies, the subtle personification of Marxism as "radically disabled"
                is difficult to ignore and worth attending to. But Williams is attempting to
                navigate between, for him, two undesirable versions of Marxism, neither capable of
                developing an adequate cultural theory: one without any concept of determination and
                one with too rigid a concept of determination.</p>
                  <p>Williams attempts to rescue Marx from Marxism, as he objects to the ways determinism
                became widely known, in Marxism, as "economism" (which Williams describes as
                "worthless" [<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86]). Certain
                versions of Marxism, and certain poor readers of Marx, totalize determinism as
                economism and mistakenly erase from Marx any idea of direct agency. Over the course
                of the nineteenth century, Williams laments, Marx gives way to Marxism: "With bitter
                irony, a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not only in practice but
                at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity and reification against
                which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to operate"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86). Williams argues against
                this abstract determinism, for the full concept of determination is crucial to save
                Marxism from such abstractions: "In practice determination is never only the setting
                of limits; it is also the exertion of pressures. As it happens this is also a sense
                of ‘determine’ in English: to determine or be determined to do something is an act
                of will and purpose" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 87). As in
                <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Williams in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> turns to the resources of language itself, here the resources of
                the English language in particular, for help unsettling various attempts to fix
                meaning and thereby produce pseudoauthoritative doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To explore why "determination" is the most difficult problem in Marxist cultural
                theory, Williams turns to a well-known passage from the 1859 preface to <title level="m">A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</title>, which
                features what Williams refers to as Marx’s "normal word" for determine, <foreign xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign>. "It is not the consciousness of men that
                determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines
                their consciousness," writes Marx in a paragraph that Williams quotes at length in
                <title level="a">Base and Superstructure,</title> the chapter that immediately precedes 
                the <title level="a">Determination</title> chapter (qtd. in <title level="m">Marxism</title> 75). As Williams notes when he returns to the preface 
                in the next chapter, <foreign xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign> appears four times 
                    in Marx’s original German but only three times in the English translation 
                    (the one Williams quotes). And one appearance of
                    <emph>determine</emph> in the English version actually translates a
                different German word, <foreign xml:lang="de">konstatieren</foreign>. Williams does 
                not blame the translator for this discrepancy. "The point here," writes Williams, 
                "is not so much the adequacy of the translation as the extraordinary linguistic 
                complexity of this group of words. This can best be illustrated by considering 
                the complexity of ‘determine’ in English" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 84).
                Attuned to the complexity of such groups of words, Williams reads almost as a poet
                committed to language really used—and, as suggested by his reading of the word 
                <emph>determine</emph>, language overused and worked over.</p>
                  <p>Of the various Romantic writers and poets Williams draws on to advance arguments in
                his many books, Wordsworth is not always the most important. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
                plays a more vital role in the early chapters of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society 1780–1950</title> and in its sequel, <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>, for instance. And yet, Williams’s repeated turns to language
                echo Wordsworth’s famous interest in language "really used by men" (Wordsworth, 
                <title level="m">Selected</title> 281). As Williams writes in the introduction 
                to <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "I feel myself committed to the study of
                actual language: that is to say, to the words and sequences of words which
                particular men and women have used in trying to give meaning to their experience"
                (xix). While Williams translates Wordsworth’s adverb ("really") into an adjective
                ("actual"), he develops Wordsworth’s poetics as advanced in the preface to <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> into a detailed critical method. And
                Williams’s commitment to actual individual statements over what he calls "a system
                of significant abstractions" echoes Wordsworth’s distrust of personified
                abstractions of ideas (<title level="m">Culture</title> xix). At
                moments like these it can seem that Williams is a determined Wordsworthian.</p>

                  <head>Of Determined Bounds</head>
                  <p>If a poor reading of Marx absolutizes one sense of "determination," then a poor
                reading of Romanticism absolutizes the other (as if Romanticism named nothing other
                than the systematic assertion of the individual will). I turn now to Wordsworth and
                the opening book of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, in which Wordsworth’s
                poet-speaker poses two related questions: Was I determined (by Nature) to be a poet;
                and Am I determined (enough) to <emph>become</emph> one? Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title>, in other words, is motivated by the question of
                determination, and the word <emph>determined</emph> appears in the text at
                two key moments in the first book, once near the beginning where he announces his
                longing for a "determined aim," and once near the end where he celebrates his having
                settled on a theme, one with "determined bounds" (<title level="m">Prelude</title> 34,
                64). Reading Wordsworth after Williams helps make legible the importance of
                determination to Wordsworth’s thinking about the self. </p>
                  <p>Wordsworth opens <title level="m">The Prelude</title> by rewriting the conclusion to
                 Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>. In the closing lines of Milton’s
                poem, Adam and Eve wonder "where to choose / Their place of rest" after expulsion
                from Eden; and with "providence their guide," hand in hand they wander (618).
                Wordsworth replaces Milton’s guide, "providence," with a wandering cloud: "should
                the guide I chuse / Be nothing better than a wandering cloud / I cannot miss my way"
                (<title level="m">Prelude</title> 28).<note place="foot" resp="editors">1805, Book I, 
                    lines 17–19. Future citations of the poem will be to this edition and included 
                    parenthetically (book, line numbers).</note> In doing so, Wordsworth negates 
                 the possible tragedy of <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>. Though Wordsworth 
                 does not know what guide to choose, there is no
                 tragedy in the choice, for, unlike in <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, there is
                no wrong choice: "Whither shall I turn, / By road or pathway, or through open field,
                / Or shall a twig or any floating thing / Upon the river point me out my course?"
                (I.29–32). Wordsworth records that after wondering for two days he arrived at his
                hermitage and he describes the love that greeted him. He is happy for a time.</p>
                  <p>At this point, and after some rest, Wordsworth characterizes himself as determined,
                as interested in determining an aim for himself, though what Wordsworth actually
                writes is quite complicated: "But speedily," writes Wordsworth, "a longing in me
                rose / To brace myself to some determined aim" (I.123–24). Characteristically,
                Wordsworth introduces the importance of individual will via syntax that throws into
                question the active, individual will. A longing arises in him, he writes, as if the
                longing were to some degree or other independent of him, as if the longing were not
                entirely his own. Though grammatically the sentence is not in the passive voice, the
                subject of the sentence is this longing and not Wordsworth himself, not the first
                person, as Wordsworth positions himself as the object acted upon. Bracing himself
                for some determined aim, Wordsworth progresses through Book I worrying over various
                possible choices for poetic composition, as undisturbed delight gives way to concern
                over a selection process for a proper poetic theme. As Wordsworth wonders what he
                should write about to prove his worth as a poet, and as he chronicles the various
                topics for a great poem he entertains only to dismiss, from some British theme or
                old "Romantic tale by Milton left unsung" to "some philosophic song" (I.180, 230),
                Wordsworth famously wonders "Was it for this / That one, the fairest of all rivers,
                loved / To blend his murmurs with my nurse’s song" (I.271–72)? Wordsworth takes
                stock and determines that he does not lack a vital soul and is not "naked in
                external things, / Forms, images, nor numerous other aids" (I.165–66), and yet he
                still must ask: Was it for this? The poet’s self-consciousness results in a question
                about determination, about the poet’s determination: Was Wordsworth determined for
                this? And then, subsequently, and thinking of determined as meaning "persistent," is
                Wordsworth persistent enough to follow through on the promise? Wordsworth’s poem, in
                other words, shows his sensitivity to the complexity of <emph>determination</emph> 
                (as word and concept). And this sensitivity can seem to
                result in the repeated use of dummy pronouns, as the antecedent for "it" in "was it
                for this" is famously open and opaque.</p>
                  <p>When Wordsworth concludes Book I, having found his theme at last, he returns to the
                opening lines of the poem and figures himself as doubly determined. And the word
                itself makes a potentially surprising second appearance. Wordsworth replaces the
                wide range of options introduced at the beginning of the poem—where he wonders
                whether to follow a road or a pathway, a cloud or a floating thing, and write a
                romantic tale or some philosophic song—with a single option: "The road lies plain
                before me. ’Tis a theme / Single and of determined bounds, and hence / I chuse it
                rather at this time than work / Of ampler or more varied argument" (I.668–71).
                Wordsworth has settled on his theme, "the story of [his] life," and this theme
                already has a revivifying force ("One end hereby at least hath been attained— / My
                mind hath been revived" [I.664–65]). Wordsworth chooses a road that lies plain
                before him, a road, in other words, somewhat well-travelled—even though one might
                expect him to follow a less pre<emph>determined</emph> path. Despite the
                many ways we associate Romantic texts with the rise of the self-determining
                individual, the poem carefully anticipates and complicates such a characterization.
                In choosing a road, Wordsworth’s way is determined; it is before him. And he
                foregrounds the question of determination explicitly by comparing his theme to a
                road in describing its "determined bounds." Because the theme has determined bounds,
                Wordsworth is determined to choose it. If the opening of Book I is a return to <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>, so too is the end of Book I. But whereas Adam
                and Eve wander, Wordsworth hits the road. His direction, clearly marked, opens
                before him. Had Wordsworth followed a cloud or floating thing across an open field,
                his chosen path would have fit more comfortably within the usual stories one hears
                about Romanticism (as a celebration of nature, of the individual, of the individual
                imagination, etc.); but instead of wandering across an open field, Wordsworth
                chooses a road and, additionally, one that "lies plain before [him]."</p>
                  <p>Near the beginning of Book I, Wordsworth wonders if he was determined by nature to
                produce <title level="m">The Prelude</title>; by the end of Book I, he has determined
                his theme, one with determined bounds, a theme that is not varied. In a sense the
                one meaning of determination (as fixed) combines with the other, as Wordsworth makes
                his choice and thereby asserts himself as active agent. He chooses (determines) a
                theme with determined bounds, and as a result Wordsworth—over the course of 
                Book I—draws together, like Williams later, the two meanings of
                    <emph>determination</emph>. To borrow Williams’s imagined sentence
                from <title level="m">Keywords</title>, Wordsworth is determined
                to be determined. If Raymond Williams hopes to complicate a version of Marxism too
                enamored of "determinism" by reintroducing the importance of individual will,
                Wordsworth’s <title level="m">The Prelude</title> complicates a too-simple version of
                Romanticism too enamored of "determination" <emph>as</emph> individual
                will, as he reintroduces the importance of determined (and determining) bounds at
                the close of Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title>.</p>

                  <head>Passive Voices</head>
                  <p>I have been focusing on what we might call a lexical problem, but as I have already
                hinted in my opening paragraphs, I would like to turn as well to syntax and to some
                of the ways lexical and syntactical questions are intertwined in Wordsworth and
                Williams. The question of determination from Wordsworth to Williams turns on one’s
                ability to decide whether the subject acts (determines itself for itself) or is
                acted upon (is determined by something else). The grammatical, or more specifically
                the syntactical, corollary to the question of "determination" is something like
                voice, specifically the difference between active and passive voice, where passive
                constructions invert normal subject and object noun phrases. In the active voice,
                the subject of the sentence is also the agent of the action. In the passive voice,
                the object acted upon becomes the subject, and the agent of the action is introduced
                belatedly, often in a prepositional phrase. For instance, in the sentence
                "Wordsworth wrote <title level="m">The Prelude</title>," the subject of the sentence
                (Wordsworth) precedes and acts upon the object of the sentence (<title level="m">The Prelude</title>). But in "<title level="m">The Prelude</title> was written by
                Wordsworth," the object acted upon comes first. By inverting subject and object, the
                agent of the action becomes the object of the sentence. And the object acted upon
                (<title level="m">The Prelude</title>) becomes the grammatical subject of the
                sentence. For this reason, writing guides often advise against using passive voice.
                Famously, George Orwell strongly advises against the passive voice in <title level="a">The Politics of the English Language,</title> where he suggests 
                that one should "never use the passive
                where you can use the active" (119). Of more philosophical importance, especially
                for an essay that began with the difficult problem of determination, passive
                constructions show just how easily subjects and objects can be reversed, as the
                agent capable of acting becomes an object and the object acted upon becomes a
                subject. In other words, passive constructions show how difficult it can be to
                determine and stabilize the difference between subjects and objects (the agents who
                act and the things that are acted upon). Passive constructions also showcase how
                quickly the agent of the action can disappear from a sentence. In some passive
                constructions, that is, the agent is left, either accidentally or intentionally,
                undecidable (as in a sentence like "<title level="m">The Prelude</title> was
                written"). One famous and much cited example is "Mistakes were made," where the one
                who made the mistakes, the agent of the action, the rhetorical (if not grammatical)
                subject of the sentence, goes unnamed. As Orwell argues, such a construction allows
                those in power to stay in power by strategically disappearing. At moments like this
                one, the agent is determined not to be determined.</p>
                  <p>In their related attempts to think the difficult problem of determination, both
                Wordsworth and Williams repeatedly use the passive voice, as their grammar and
                syntax raise questions about who or what acts and who or what is acted upon. In the
                writing of Wordsworth and Williams, it is often difficult to determine who is doing
                what to whom. For instance, early in the glad preamble to <title level="m">The
                    Prelude</title> and after Wordsworth asserts that he "cannot miss [his] way" for
                his joy is great, he uses a passive construction that leaves the precise cause of
                his happiness unknown:
                <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">

                     </quote>
              At first it is unclear to a reader what the antecedent for "it" is, but after a line
                or two it becomes clear that Wordsworth describes the burden of his own unnatural
                self, a burden that is shaken off. Readers are then able to reread the sentence as
                "The burthen of my own unnatural self is shaken off." But even when one learns what
                has been shaken off, the passive construction leaves undisclosed the active agent
                (the rhetorical if not grammatical subject).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On 
                    similar impersonal constructions in Wordsworth, see François and Banfield, 
                    especially the fifth chapter, <title level="a">The Sentence Representing 
                        Non-reflective Consciousness and the Absence of the Narrator.</title>
                     </note> We 
                know who is all shook up, but who or what has performed the shaking? In this
                opening example, Wordsworth seems to use the passive voice to deepen the mystery of
                a miraculous gift. For poetic reasons, Wordsworth does not name, and so leaves
                undetermined, the agent of the action.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See 
                    also Johnson, who suggests that Wordsworth uses the passive voice when 
                    "the speaker is caught up in a mode of perception that takes him beyond his 
                    ordinary, active consciousness to a larger and more indefinite 
                    perspective" (5).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most relevant to my purposes, Wordsworth employs passive voice in the final verse
                paragraph of Book I of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> as well, where the
                question of determination is thematized most explicitly. As Wordsworth draws the
                first book to a close, he acknowledges that despite continuing difficulties "One end
                hereby at least hath been attained— / My mind hath been revived" (I.664–65). Who or
                what has revived the mind? Is it Wordsworth or Nature? Or the act of writing about
                himself and Nature? The agent of the action is again left unclear, and the effect is
                particularly Wordsworthian. Wordsworth turns to the passive voice at key moments
                like these because he does not wish to determine absolutely agents of action. To
                determine Nature as the active agent makes Wordsworth a passive object. He will have
                been determined absolutely by an external force. Conversely, to determine Wordsworth
                himself as the active agent makes Nature a passive object. Wordsworth’s
                philosophical questions about the relation between poet and Nature lead him
                inexorably toward the passive voice. Because it is difficult to determine one’s
                determination, Wordsworth is determined to use the passive voice.</p>
                  <p>Williams’s own efforts to think determination similarly result in a high degree of
                indetermination: determination, for Williams, is always "an active and conscious as
                well as, by default, a passive and objectified historical experience"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 88). He is interested in
                determination because it can be difficult to determine adequately when historical
                experience results from one’s determination (one’s active persistence) and when it
                results from one’s determination (one’s objectified historical experience). Williams
                can sound a bit like Wordsworth from <title level="a">Tintern Abbey</title> here: as 
                if historical experience were half-perceived and half-created. Wordsworth hopes neither to
                prioritize poet over Nature nor Nature over poet; and Williams, likewise, hopes to
                keep both meanings of determination in play. As a result, both repeatedly write in
                the passive voice.</p>
                  <p>In a key sentence in which Williams objects to some of the ways Marxism (against
                Marx, argues Williams) privileges one sense of determination over another to develop
                a theory of "economism," Williams uses the passive voice conspicuously: "With bitter
                irony," writes Williams, "a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not
                only in practice but at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity
                and reification against which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to
                operate" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 86). Williams laments
                the degree to which Marxism’s focus on passive reification precludes attention to
                determination as active and conscious. But Williams chooses the passive voice in
                order to formulate his lament. Marx’s critical and revolutionary doctrine was
                changed, but changed by whom? Here and elsewhere in his writing, Williams turns to
                the passive voice as he attempts to rescue "determination" from a determinism that
                changes active agents into passive objects of cultural and economic forces. Faced
                with the indeterminate nature of <emph>determine</emph> in English, and in
                an effort to draw it out, Williams intensifies a syntactical tic.</p>
                  <p>For a second example, we can return to another passage I have already quoted. In the
                paragraph discussed above, in which Williams examines a translation of Marx’s
                preface to <title level="m">A Contribution to the Critique of Political
                    Economy</title> and points to the linguistic complexity of <emph>determine</emph> 
                in English, the word translators often use to render Marx’s <foreign xml:lang="de">bestimmen</foreign> into English, Williams writes: "The point here is
                not so much the adequacy of the translation as the extraordinary linguistic
                complexity of this group of words. This can best be illustrated by considering the
                complexity of ‘determine’ in English"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 84). In the second sentence
                quoted, Williams leaves blank the rhetorical subject of his sentence, the agent of
                the action, as the "I" capable of illustrating and considering complexity is left
                out. And this sentence is illustrative of Williams’s style more generally, for
                Williams not only leaves out the agent of the action but also the object acted upon:
                to what does "this" refer to, this "this" that can best be illustrated? An inelegant
                version of Williams’s sentence might read: "I will illustrate this complexity by
                considering the complexity of ‘determine’ in English." Williams removes the agent
                that will perform the action and also leaves "this" to stand alone. Once again,
                Williams’s syntax raises questions about determination, as Williams leaves much
                undetermined. He can sound quite Wordsworthian. But just as the point for Williams
                is not the adequacy of translation, the point for me is not the adequacy of
                Williams’s style. What interests me most is how often in his writing about
                determination Williams uses the passive voice. A cursory glance at the
                "Determination" chapter of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> will show
                how often Williams repeatedly uses the passive voice and begins sentences with
                expletives or dummy pronouns (sentences that begin with an empty grammatical subject
                like the "it" of "it is raining"), a construction that often follows from the
                passive voice. To quote from sentences early in the chapter that introduce some
                complexity, especially if one wishes to linger over Williams’ syntax:
            <quote>According to its opponents, Marxism is a necessarily reductive and determinist kind
                of theory: no cultural activity is allowed to be real and significant in itself, but
                is always reduced to a direct or indirect expression of some preceding and
                controlling economic content. . . . In the perspective of mid-twentieth century
                developments of Marxism, this description can be seen as a caricature. Certainly it
                is often asserted with a confidence as solid as it is out of date. Yet it can hardly
                be denied that it came . . . from a common form of Marxism.
                (<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Marxism </hi>83) </quote>
               Williams presents a caricature of Marxism as determinism that he then acknowledges
                cannot be denied. He will go on to argue for a less deterministic Marxism. But in
                the concluding sentences of the above quotation, Williams’s prose features a series
                of "it" pronouns. The "it" of "certainly it is often asserted" refers to the
                caricature, though who is asserting it is left open. The "it" of "yet it can hardly
                be denied" is an expletive, an empty pronoun that serves a grammatical function but
                has no real antecedent. For Williams, the problem of determination is not
                independent from certain grammatical and syntactical arrangements, arrangements that
                make "it," for instance, difficult to determine.</p>
                  <p>Wordsworth and Williams share not only an interest in the complexity of 
                <emph>determination</emph> in English, as word and concept, but also an
                interest in the passive voice and in uses of language that showcase with a certain
                lightness of touch the ways objects can become subjects and the ways subjects can
                drop from view, especially in sentences that leave undisclosed and indeterminate the
                agent of the action.</p>

                  <p>It can be hard to tell whether passive constructions determine Wordsworth’s and
                Williams’s abstract philosophical speculation or whether abstract philosophical
                speculation determines passive constructions. In general, one might be satisfied
                with an either/or. But when it comes to <emph>determination</emph> itself,
                determining how much determination (as a philosophical question, say) is determined
                (by grammar, say) can get complicated quickly. How can we know anything 
                about <emph>determination</emph> if we cannot determine how much our discussion
                of determination is itself already determined?</p>
                  <p>When readers bring Marxist cultural criticism and Romanticism into contact, one
                often senses a need to choose between them. Either Romanticism is little more than
                an ideology that denies the importance of external economic forces, or it is a
                vibrant celebration of human potential. In focusing on some of the ways Wordsworth
                and Williams think determination with and through the passive voice, I have tried
                for new points of contact. If we take seriously the ways Wordsworth and Williams
                both foreground passive voice in their writing about determination, we discover
                stylistic similarities in discourses often perceived to be antithetical, especially
                when Williams stands in for Marxist cultural materialism and Wordsworth for Romantic
                idealism. We know that Williams was dissatisfied with certain versions of Marxism
                and Wordsworth with certain versions of idealism. Both found in "determination"
                strategies for resisting the pull of familiar isms and both used the passive voice
                to make a little more restless our attempts to characterize historical experience as
                either active or passive.</p>
                  <p>Theory in recent decades has become increasingly proficient at marshalling
                increasingly complicated philosophical and scientific concepts (let’s call them
                tropes) in the service of urgent speculation. But some of the most pressing social
                issues today also hold a grammatical edge, as those urging adoption of
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">l’écriture inclusive</foreign> in France know
                well. (In French, an adjective that refers jointly to masculine and feminine nouns
                agrees only with the masculine one, thus perpetuating [argue protesters] French
                linguistic patriarchy.) I sometimes worry that theory left grammar behind too
                quickly as theory courses proliferated in university curricula, even though we
                always knew (and still know) that there is no style of thought without a grammar.
                But what if, in place of "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is more difficult,
                than that of ‘determination,’" Williams had written "No problem in Marxist cultural
                theory is more difficult than that of passive voice"? What sort of theory would have
                emerged? For decades, Romanticism has played a key role in the development of theory
                (or Theory, or theories). I cannot determine whether Wordsworth led me to Williams
                or Williams led me to Wordsworth, just as I cannot tell whether interest in the
                question of determination leads to passive voice or if interest in the passive voice
                leads to questions about determination. It may be impossible to tell. To encounter
                the impossibility of telling, though, may be one of the only ways to open a new
                question.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">The concept of "industrialism" was the antithesis of the idea of "culture" 
                    that ran through the work of Raymond Williams. I want to suggest that the dichotomy, which
                    remains remarkably durable even in his later work, represents a reductive account of
                    the complexities of the project of the Industrial Revolution at odds with the way
                    that cultural materialism in the hands of Williams was more generally alert to the
                    contradictions at work in relations between economic developments and cultural
                    forms. Williams on "industrialism" perpetuated the invisibility of the literary and
                    intellectual culture of manufacturing towns like Manchester in traditional Romantic
                    scholarship. This essay uses the method of later Williams against the more
                    "Romantic" Williams to give a sense of the way writing from within the Industrial
                    Revolution might be regarded as a key genre of the literature of the period, one
                    increasingly riven by contradictions between its aspirations towards human
                    flourishing and the emergence of a society of the machine.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>Christine MacLeod’s study of the early nineteenth-century struggle over the memory of
                the inventor James Watt identifies Raymond Williams with a "catastrophist" view of
                the Industrial Revolution (11). She sees Williams as the origin of a powerfully
                influential idea that "culture" in its modern sense(s) developed as the humane
                ethical alternative to industrial capitalism as an irreducible tragedy. "Nothing
                celebratory," writes MacLeod, of "‘the new industrial society’ emerges from beneath
                this condemnatory weight: it is crushed out of the record" (12). Certainly, in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> (1958), still probably his most widely
                read work, Williams did claim that culture in its modern sense "came into English
                thinking in the period . . . of the Industrial Revolution" (viii). Little wonder
                that the book is popular among Romanticists. Although his aim may have been to
                describe the evolution of this idea of "culture," rather than advocate it as an
                antidote to what he called "industrialism," the Industrial Revolution as a kind of
                fall recurs even in later works like <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>
                (1973) and <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> (1977). The writing on
                "industrialism"—the term, tellingly enough, he adopted from Thomas Carlyle—often
                seems to elide contradictions that might provide the objects of an immanent
                critique. One does not have to celebrate "industrialism" to see that varieties of
                late eighteenth-century radicalism, for instance, had a complex dialectical
                relationship to nineteenth-century liberalism.</p>
                  <p>My own current project concerns the "culture" of improvement in the manufacturing
                towns of the early phases of the Industrial Revolution, but not in any sense of the
                word understood by the "culture and society" tradition. Instead, I want to test the
                possibility of adapting post-Latourian network analysis to attempt a "redescription"
                of a phenomenon that ranged across the domains of literary, scientific, and
                technical invention, but without losing sight of emergent forms of domination
                (Latour 226). "Culture"—in the tradition MacLeod identifies with Williams—has tended
                to place itself <emph>outside</emph> these historical processes, but the
                cultural materialism of Williams’s later career lends itself to an immanent critique
                of contradictions revealed <emph>within</emph> them. Immanent critique, in
                the sense associated with the critical theory of Adorno and the Frankfurt School,
                operates by revealing "the contradictions of claim and context, to transform
                legitimations into emancipatory weapons" (Antonio 338). More than Adorno’s
                characteristic pessimism perhaps, or his Hegelian sense of totality, the later work
                of Williams may help provide an understanding of this culture of improvement as
                something more complicated than the objectivist reflection of epochal relations. It
                might be treated not as anterior to the development of industrial capitalism, nor
                without contradictions as it morphed into an aspect of the dominant culture, but
                instead as "part of the material social process itself" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 60). In this regard, the
                characteristic concern with immanence in Williams—at least in his later cultural
                materialist phase—helps navigate between the tendency to formalism in Bruno Latour’s
                network theory and the epochalism of late Marx (Jones).</p>
                  <p>In a belated commentary on <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, Williams
                regretted its neglect of William Godwin because, he said, his book had been blind to
                English radicalism’s "insight—even if from a rather simplified rationalist point of
                view—that you could reform character by environment, that all kinds of error and
                injustice should be seen in a social perspective, and then also in its encounter
                with a more complex experience at the point where its formula broke down" (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 123). The idea of the reform of
                character through environment was a key aspect of Industrial Enlightenment,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Mokyr (2009) and others who use the idea of
                                an "Industrial Enlightenment" have not tended to explore these
                                aspects of the technical thinking they see as part of a cultural
                                approach to the Industrial Revolution, but they underpinned ideas
                                about the reorganization of the workforce found in the Kennedy and
                                Baines Jr. texts discussed below.</note> not least in
                the elaboration of work-time discipline, but this thread was not followed by
                Williams. Instead his discussion took the now-familiar route of discussing state
                repression in the 1790s. Much of the literary and cultural criticism devoted to the
                Romantic period, including my own, has focused on this political story rather than
                on the Industrial Revolution’s materialist interest in reshaping human character.
                When the idea of industrial transformation as a kind of revolution started to appear
                in the 1820s, it was often to suggest that the Industrial Revolution represented a
                paradigm shift for the possibilities of human progress at least equal to the effects
                of French Revolution, and even the earlier transformative impact of print, often
                appropriating a language of reform from the 1790s in the process.</p>
                  <p>This essay explores the usefulness of cultural materialism to assist with an account
                of this historical process, not least by drawing attention to the way it worked its
                way through networks formed in and between the industrial towns. Places like
                Manchester remain more or less invisible in the literary geography of
                Romantic-period scholarship. True, individuals associated with the region, including
                Anna Barbauld, her brother John Aikin, and their friend William Roscoe, are
                increasingly written about by scholars (James and Inkster; White). There is even a
                developed scholarship now on the literary productivity of the oppositional culture
                of Rational Dissent to which the trio above belonged, but this work rarely follows
                through on the way its values could transmute into forms of dark materialism within
                the historical process, freedom of enquiry turning into a resistance to curbs on
                industrial exploitation, and ideas of reshaping human character through reformed
                institutions producing instead "laboratories of virtue" (Meranze). My version of
                immanent critique contains a geographically literal understanding of the way that
                anxiety about and even criticism of industrialization emerged <emph>within</emph> 
                this networked territory (as well as beyond it). This development
                gives the sense of the ambiguities as a constitutive part of the "structure of
                feeling" articulated in relation to the lived experience within these locations,
                forms that remained "in solution," to use Williams’s characteristic metaphor. In his
                later use of his most famous phrase, where it usually appears as the plural
                "structures of feeling," Williams applies it to groups shaped into "cultural
                formations." As the editors of this volume point out in their <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.intro.html">introduction</ref>,
                his previous emphasis on social experience in solution develops into a sense of "the
                complex relation of differentiated structures of feeling to differentiated classes"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 134). The formation I discuss
                in this essay only uneasily precipitated into something like liberal ideology,
                itself never without its ambiguities and contradictions, or into literary genres
                like the industrial novel, including Elizabeth Gaskell’s <title level="m">Mary
                    Barton</title> (1848), a novel deeply imbricated in the networks described here.
                Contrary to the binary of Romanticism and industrialism that implicitly informed <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, the more nuanced idea of structures of
                feeling found in late Williams allows us to see the writing that emerged in and
                around the Manchester cotton boom between 1780 and 1850 as part of a complicated
                relationship between residual, emergent, and dominant formations that developed as
                the middle class came to know—incompletely—its own power. My approach takes from
                Williams his sense of hegemony as something that needed to be "continually renewed,
                recreated, defended, and modified"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 112). The work of writing the
                "transpennine enlightenment" (Mee and Wilkes) as it territorialized a new domain of
                industrial progress was a practice that continually disclosed possibilities of
                resistance through its own unstable contradictions and conflicts.</p>

                  <head>Williams and "Industrialism"</head>
                  <p>MacLeod’s judgment of Williams’s "catastrophism" draws on Stefan Collini’s account of
                the myth of the village laborer in the historiography of the British Left (11).
                Collini notes that in the 1940s and 50s Williams was trained as a tutor in the adult
                education ethos steeped in the idea of "culture" as a response to the economism
                associated with the Industrial Revolution and the tragic loss of communal village
                life (107–8). In <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, as Collini
                concedes, Williams positioned himself as "a trenchant critic of precisely that kind
                of ‘ruralist nostalgia’" (95). What he retained from his training was a tendency to
                identify the Industrial Revolution with the emergence of a new kind of society
                totally dominated by "industrialism": "His larger ambition was to extrapolate from
                the notion of culture as ‘a whole way of life’ to provide a more inclusive and
                enabling conception which would encompass forms of working-class organization and
                solidarity," Collini rightly notes, but "in so doing, he in effect tied the
                emergence of the concept of culture itself to the great rupture in English history
                which marked the arrival of a ‘new civilization’ at the end of the eighteenth
                century" (108). From this perspective, Williams’s lifelong struggle against
                abstraction in Marxist theory let itself down by losing a proper sense of
                contradictions within the society that produced "industrialism."</p>
                  <p>A lack of curiosity about those contradictions that were immanent to "industrialism"
                was exacerbated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> by the structural
                decision to orchestrate key chapters around a series of "contrasts" (see the essays
                by Favret [link] and Gilmartin [link] in this volume). Although this strategy allows
                for some sense of the mutual implication of utilitarian and Romantic ways of
                thinking, the binaries obscured the complexities within the emergent power of the
                industrial classes. Williams later regretted his sense of the heroic status of
                figures like Edmund Burke and Carlyle, but, even then, reiterated his praise for
                Carlyle’s grasp of "fundamental changes within the labor process itself [and] the
                relations between human society and the non-human physical environment" (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 105). In the original rather
                unsatisfactory chapter on <title level="a">The Romantic Artist</title> in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, "literature" is defined in terms of a critique 
                of economic rationalism in ways that understate, for instance, some of the political
                conservatism of this articulation in its time found in authors like Robert Southey
                (Connell 265–73). Furthermore, and more relevant to my argument here, Williams
                ignores critiques of economic rationalism from within the historical process he
                names "industrialism." <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, for all its
                skepticism about "ruralist nostalgia," retains a melancholy strain attached to the
                fate of the English village. There is an acknowledgement of progressive
                possibilities in the new urban experience, primarily identified for Williams with
                the emergence of the popular press and the spread of literacy, but this note very
                quickly modulates into a critique—quite right in itself—of Marxist celebrations of
                "mastery" over nature (<title level="m">Country</title> 37).</p>
                  <p>To note the lack of any real engagement by Williams with the diversity of writing
                emerging from the manufacturing towns is not to dissent from this point about
                mastery over nature, but his chapter on "Change in the City" is instructive in terms
                of the blind spots noted by Collini and MacLeod. It appears to end by opening out to
                a sense of the vitality of urban change beyond London. Quoting percentage statistics
                for urban growth in the manufacturing towns between 1821 and 1841, Williams notes
                that they eclipsed London in the sheer rate of increase: "The industrial cities were
                something different again. Though still in their early stages they announced, even
                more decisively than the growth of capitals, the new character of the city and the
                new relations between city and country" (<title level="m">Country</title> 152). One
                might expect some account of the cultural aspects of this momentous change, but the
                next chapter, <title level="a">People of the City,</title> is focused on the old critical 
                chestnut of Dickens and London. The closest Williams ever really gets to engaging with the
                cultural side of "industrialism" is in his various treatments of Elizabeth Gaskell,
                but these never really progressed beyond his sense of "the intensity of the effort
                to record, in its own terms, the feel of everyday life in the working-class homes"
                (<title level="m">Culture</title> 121). Collini (108n38) finds it
                telling that Williams chose William Cobbett and his attacks on the "Seigneurs of the
                Twist, sovereigns of the Spinning Jenny, great Yeoman of the Yarn" as his author for
                the influential Past Masters series (qtd. in Williams, <title level="m">Cobbett</title> 37). One implication of this choice is that within the emergent
                formation of "industrialism," to modulate MacLeod’s claim, there seems to be nothing
                that could be called "culture." In this regard, Williams would seem to come close to
                the kind of "‘epochal’ analysis" that
                <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> very deliberately
                distinguished from his later cultural materialism (121). Against epochal analysis,
                my aim is to develop recent network theory’s concern with "the pattern of recurring
                links," both interpersonal and across "institutional organizations," most obviously
                here the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (DeLanda 56, 66). I map a
                conflicted territory of improvement that shaped an emergent voice of opposition to
                aristocratic hegemony and fed directly, not least via the conflicts within the
                constituency of Protestant Dissent, into contradictions of the kind Williams hinted
                at in his analyses of Gaskell’s fiction.</p>
                  <p>Many of the figures mentioned in the final section of my essay played a role in the
                struggle to have James Watt commemorated in Westminster Abbey, a struggle—finally
                successful in 1834—that MacLeod identifies with the articulation of a middle-class
                identity very different to the account of the national imaginary in Linda Colley’s
                <title level="m">Britons</title> (1992). Colley sees two decades of war confirming
                the grasp of an aristocratic elite on power, especially consolidated around the
                figure of the Duke of Wellington (MacLeod 92). The contrast between Watt, as a hero
                of invention, and Wellington was a key aspect of "culture" in the Romantic period
                that finds no place in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. Nor is it much
                discernible anywhere in the many literary studies of the 1810s and 20s. The complex
                structure of feeling that gave affective power to the campaign to install Watt’s
                statue in Westminster Abbey is not reducible to "industrialism," as, for instance,
                MacLeod’s account of the role of working-class agitation on the matter shows. My own
                account here doesn’t pursue this particular aspect of the campaign, but instead
                looks at the emergent insurgency against aristocratic hegemony that in its earlier
                formulations took "invention" to be a quality common to the poet and the engineer.
                My next section looks at this idea in relation to John Aikin’s account of the
                transpennine enlightenment in the region around Manchester.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>John Aikin in the Transpennine Enlightenment</head>
                  <p>John Aikin’s <title level="m">Description of the Country for Thirty to Forty Miles
                    round Manchester</title> (1795) was published two years into Britain’s war against
                revolutionary France, but it was devised earlier, as a published call for
                subscriptions from 1793 indicates (<title level="m">Proposals</title>). This dating
                matters, as it suggests that Aikin’s project originated in a period when an optimism
                about general improvement was more sustainable than after the political polarization
                of the war years had bitten more deeply, only a few years later. MacLeod sees in
                Aikin and in his collaborations with his sister, Anna Barbauld, the emergence of a
                structure of feeling that precipitated around the figure of Watt (166, 170).
                Certainly, Aikin’s <title level="m">Description of Manchester</title> retained an
                authority for later texts much closer to the ideology of "industrialism" as defined
                by Williams, like Edward Baines Jr.’s <title level="m">A History of the Cotton
                    Manufactures</title> (1835), although even there the dark turn in the transpennine
                enlightenment was not without its contradictions. More striking, perhaps, is the
                fact Aikin’s book made its way into first volume of Marx’s <title level="m">Capital</title> (1867), probably via the intimate knowledge Engels had 
                of the antinomies of Manchester liberalism (Seed 20). The copy Marx used is still on
                display in the window seat of Cheetham’s Library in Manchester where he worked on
                <title level="m">Capital</title>.</p>
                  <p> Marx used Aikin’s book in his account of the transition in the social life of the
                manufacturing classes between what Marx called the "age of manufactures" and "modern
                capitalism":
            <quote>Even in the early part of the 18th century, a Manchester manufacturer, who placed a
                pint of foreign wine before his guests, exposed himself to the remarks and
                headshaking of all his neighbors. Before the rise of machinery, a manufacturer’s
                evening expenditure at the public house where they all met, never exceeded sixpence
                for a glass of punch, and a penny for a screw of tobacco. It was not till 1758, and
                this marks an epoch, that a person actually engaged in business was seen with an
                equipage of his own. "The fourth period," the last 30 years of the 18th century, "is
                that in which expense and luxury have made great progress, and was supported by a
                trade extended by means of riders and factors through every part of Europe." (Marx
                594–95; the phrases in quotation marks are from Aikin, <title level="m">Description</title> 182)</quote>
              Marx makes the "rise of machinery" the basis for the transformation of social life of
                the middle classes. He quickly moves to describe that transformation in terms of a
                will to capital accumulation:
            <quote>Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets! "Industry furnishes the
                material which saving accumulates." Therefore, save, save, <emph>i.e.</emph>, 
                reconvert the greatest possible portion of
                surplus-value, or surplus-product into capital! Accumulation for accumulation’s
                sake, production for production’s sake: by this formula classical economy expressed
                the historical mission of the bourgeoisie, and did not for a single instant deceive
                itself over the birth-throes of wealth. (595)</quote>
               Here is the "industrialism" of Williams, but what Marx doesn’t quite do is identify
                Aikin with this epochal gospel. Rather, he suggests that Aikin inhabits a
                qualitatively different space and time: "What would the good Dr. Aikin say if he
                could rise from his grave and see the Manchester of today?" (595).</p>
                  <p>Aikin is now primarily remembered as Barbauld’s brother. They collaborated on
                various literary and educational projects, but he could hardly be claimed as an
                advocate of "culture" in any binary opposition to "industrialism." <title level="m">A Description of Manchester</title> is explicitly a celebration of the development
                of the Manchester textile industry and the spirit of technical innovation he saw in
                it, "absolutely unparalleled in the annals of trading nations" (3), but in a way
                that subscribed to a practical project of "improvement" that did not define these
                developments as at odds with an idea of "genius" incorporating forms of artistic
                endeavor. Although the cotton manufactures provide the putative focus of Aikin’s
                volume, it is transport and communications that really seem to fire his imagination.
                Canals, bridges, and aqueducts loom large as media of "internal communication"
                (117), not least because they had allowed information for his volume to reach him in
                London from across the region. Freedom of communication is a key refrain of the
                book, whether of technical innovations or a more general circulation of knowledge.
                Suspicious of court and aristocracy, the volume downplays the region’s old families
                and big houses. Aikin was certainly invested in the idea of the flat network
                promoting the circulation of commerce in goods and ideas against inherited vertical
                hierarchies. Where he differed from the accounts of this phenomenon given recently
                by economic historians like Margaret Jacob and Joel Mokyr, discussed below, was in
                his reservations about the moral implications of the capital accumulation Marx saw
                as powering the rise of machinery. Nor was Aikin comfortable with the idea of his
                communication network as mastery over nature.</p>
                  <p>He could sound visionary when it came to hymning this system of improvement:
                "Manchester is, as it were, the heart of this vast system, the circulating branches
                of which spread all around it" (<title level="m">Description</title> 3). His maps of
                the area—with their emphasis on vein-like roads, canals, and bridges—translate the
                geographical space around Manchester into the pumping heart of a renovated body
                politic. Given his wider political and religious affiliations in the 1790s, there
                seems a covert validation of middle-class values against the entrenched interests of
                London. In his political writing from this period, this tendency was much more
                explicit: "<emph>the middle class</emph>," he insisted in his <title level="m">Address to the Dissidents of England</title> (1790), published after
                the failure to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, were "the most virtuous, the
                most enlightened, the most independent part of the community" (18). "If this nation
                is ever to improve," he insisted, "or even if it is to retain, the freedom it
                possesses, to this class alone must it be indebted for the blessing," but this
                middle-class radicalism is only a muted presence in the Manchester book (<title level="m">Address</title> 18). His private correspondence, edited by his
                daughter Lucy, show that various colleagues from the area had warned him against
                writing about his political opinions too explicitly (L. Aikin 159–60). Criticism of
                the slave trade and its role in the affluence of Liverpool was also relatively muted
                (<title level="m">Description</title> 339), a factor picked up in another of
                Marx’s references to Aikin’s book (Marx 759).</p>
                  <p>In his account of Manchester, Aikin particularly celebrated "the wonderful
                self-instructed genius" James Brindley’s role in the construction of the Duke of
                Bridgewater’s canal as an example of "true <emph>inspiration</emph>, which
                poets have almost exclusively arrogated to themselves, but which men of original
                genius in every walk are actuated by, when from the operation of the mind acting
                upon itself, without the intrusion of foreign notions, they create and invent" (<title level="m">Description</title> 112, 144). The judgment may sound like the
                displacement of humanistic values by useful knowledge, but to say only this much
                would underestimate Aikin’s concern with literary culture, broadly understood,
                witnessed, for instance, by his collaborations with his sister and his own volume of
                poetry published in 1791 by Joseph Johnson. Aikin was part of an important early
                formation associated with the Dissenters at Warrington Academy, where he was
                educated and his father was a tutor. This cultural formation celebrated commercial
                exchange, because it was seen as the underpinning of moral and cultural improvement,
                but he also worried that it might undermine these benefits though narrow pursuit of
                the profit motive. Like his friend the Liverpool banker and poet William Roscoe, who
                in the late 1780s gave a paper on the relative values of the arts and sciences at
                the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, an institution to which I’ll
                return, Aikin was alarmed at the idea of commercial self-interest breaking free from
                ideas of the public good. These reservations surface even in the paean to Brindley,
                who he described as an "enthusiast" for valuing technical innovation above the
                natural beauties of the rivers he built over: "the triumph of art over nature,"
                Aikin suggested, "led him to view with a sort of contempt the winding stream, in
                which the lover of natural beauty delights" (<title level="m">Description</title>
                141). Against the notion of innovation as the product of mind acting upon itself,
                Aikin tended towards an idea of genius as a social process that ought, at least, to
                be oriented towards the general good rather than profit. Later his weighty <title level="m">General Biography</title> (1799–1815) insisted on a meritocratic idea
                of genius that emphasized literature, technology, and science at the expense of
                martial heroism. When it came to the sources of "genius," its preface argued, there
                could be no "precise line" between "invention and improvement": all the "great
                discoveries," Aikin argued, are the product of "gradual advances given to them by
                successive improvers" (3–4). From this kind of perspective, ideas of individual
                genius were in a complex loop with an understanding of society and of the mind, not
                to mention roads, bridges, and canals, as material assemblages directed towards the
                public good.</p>
                  <p>Aikin’s <title level="m">Description</title> was itself a material product of the
                networks he celebrated in that its information was gathered by informants from
                across the region. Among the key contributors to the volume, acknowledged by Aikin,
                was his friend Thomas Percival. Another literary physician, whose children’s books
                were also published by Joseph Johnson (himself originally from Liverpool), Percival
                had been publishing on the medical effects of the new factories and contributed this
                data, among other things, to Aikin’s volume (<title level="m">Description</title>
                 219–20; cited in Marx 759). <title level="m">A Description of Manchester</title>
                explicitly praised another example of the region’s collaborative enterprise in the
                form of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Founded by Percival in
                1781 with others associated with the Warrington Academy, including the
                chemist-apothecary Thomas Henry and the Unitarian clergyman Thomas Barnes, Aikin
                himself was vigorously involved from early on and contributed papers to the society
                even after he had left the region, including one—read in 1791—on the effect of
                reality in dramatic representations.</p>
                  <p>Historians of science have long debated the role of the Literary and Philosophical
                Society in the Industrial Revolution. For some scholars, it was understood fairly
                straightforwardly as a kind of think tank where scientific ideas were circulated
                among men of business for application in Manchester’s textile industry. In the 1970s
                an alternative perspective began to read the society’s role more in terms of the
                developing self-image of the middle classes. At the forefront here were Roy Porter
                and, especially, a classic essay by Arnold Thackeray on the "Manchester model" that
                effectively read the society as the cultural arm of Marx’s "historical mission of
                the bourgeoisie." Although Porter called for scholarship to pay attention to the
                word "literary" in the title of the society (25), his account was largely concerned
                with science as a form of cultural expression: the society was a means by which the
                rising middle classes performed their cultural hegemony through institutions of
                politeness. Thackray understood the literary and scientific interests of the society
                as primarily "ornamental": effectively an epiphenomenal institutional superstructure
                to a socioeconomic base.</p>
                  <p>It need hardly be said that any approach indebted to the cultural materialism of
                Williams is not likely to find this functionalist account sufficient. Writing from a
                very different perspective, the recent work of Margaret Jacob and Joel Mokyr avoid
                the class determinism of Porter and Thackray to return to a revamped version of the
                older model that closely linked the domains of scientific knowledge and technical
                innovation. Jacob and Mokyr make the development of the "first knowledge economy"
                the key factor in the early period of the Industrial Revolution. The contemporary
                European appetite for "useful knowledge" is decisive for them, refined by a broader
                Enlightenment faith in progress and commitment to dissemination that ensured that
                the rage for invention was sustained and developed. In their narratives of economic
                growth, networks and cultural institutions do play an important role. Although
                neither see the knowledge economy as a democratic event, they do represent it as
                sustained by relatively marginal figures constellated into flat networks committed
                to the distribution of useful knowledge. In this regard, their work shows some
                overlaps with Bruno Latour’s network theory, even if the references to his work in
                Mokyr’s <title level="m">Gifts of Athena</title> are somewhat wary (61, 63). Jacob and
                Mokyr might well regard my own account as a Latourian redescription too far, but
                their work does retain a role for culture as the domain of these networks, including
                the odd mention, in Jacob’s case at least (105), of the importance of the "liberal
                arts" in the early years of the Manchester society. More generally, though, neither
                allows much of a role for the "literary" in sustaining even the idea of progress.
                Not that the domain of literary studies, for its part, has ever really taken up the
                challenge of thinking about the role of the "literary" in this territory,
                unsurprisingly since the disciplinary authority of the category of Romanticism,
                mediated in part by heavily partisan contemporaries like Thomas De Quincey,
                explicitly defined its keys terms—especially "genius" and "imagination"—against the
                role of networks and related institutions in literary production (Klancher 28–29).
                I’ll return to De Quincey, who grew up in the circles of the Literary and
                Philosophical Society, briefly at the end of this essay.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge economy described by Jacob and Mokyr was rather more conflicted than
                their account of flows of information around flat networks implies. Nor was it as
                unambiguously committed to capital accumulation. In order to develop the point, I
                will concentrate on a particular strain of debate concerned with philosophical
                materialism and relations between mind, matter, and machine that came out of the
                Manchester society. These debates were an immanent part of the complex process
                connecting Aikin’s golden vision of Manchester to the dreadful conditions described
                by Marx in <title level="m">Capital</title> as the outcome of the gospel of capital
                accumulation. Part of the dialogue between scientific and literary matters at the
                Manchester society in the 1780s and early 90s were topics like imagination, taste,
                and genius. Recent studies in Romanticism, at least since Alan Richardson’s <title level="m">British Romanticism and the Science of the Mind</title> (2001), have
                shown a renewed interest in such topics from a materialist perspective, but usually
                in ways that take the intellectual and literary issues out of the domain of changes
                in modes of production. Such issues were a hot topic in in places like Manchester,
                because, more than anywhere else, they revealed the possibilities of reshaping
                biological life through manipulation of the material environment, not least via the
                elaboration of work-time discipline. Perhaps the most obvious early example of the
                region’s interest in these issues were John Howard’s prison reforms, on which he had
                worked with Aikin—whom he also chose as his biographer—at the Warrington Academy (L.
                Aikin 63). Those reforms, which produced concrete changes to the architecture of
                prisons, and eventually, factories, were centered on emancipation from various forms
                of corporeal punishment associated with an unreformed aristocratic order, but the
                ideas of prisons as "laboratories of virtue," to use Meranze’s phrase in its
                original penal context, were to have their part in the dialectic of Enlightenment as
                the darker consequences of the new penitentiary system emerged.</p>
                  <p>In the 1780s and early 90s, though, what was constantly being fought over in the
                Manchester society was the extent to which the material processes of the body could
                entirely account for taste, imagination, and the principle of life itself. It was a
                topic at the heart of Aikin’s paper to the society on the reality of dramatic
                performances, for instance, but it became fraught in the debate on materialism
                between Thomas Cooper and his friend John Ferriar, on the one hand, and Thomas
                Barnes, on the other. In a paper given at the Manchester society in 1783, <title level="a">On the Influence of the Imagination and the Passions upon Our 
                    Understanding,</title> Barnes had
                argued for a view of imagination as one of several mental modes that together made
                up the mind as—following Joseph Priestley here—"ONE UNCOMPOUNDED ESSENCE" (377).
                Cooper thought that the idea of different modes in one essence nonsensical: an
                attempt to preserve a place for "spirit" within the universe of Priestley’s <title level="m">Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit</title> (1777). In his rebuttal of
                Barnes at the society, published as <title level="a">Sketch of the Controversy on 
                    Materialism</title> in his <title level="m">Tracts</title> (1789), Cooper insisted on 
                the familiar materialist position that the source of life was organization acted upon by external
                stimulation. Cooper was supported by another literary physician, John Ferriar, in
                his attack on modern species of "immaterialism," as they both called it. Ferriar was
                working with Cooper and Percival at the time on wresting control of the Manchester
                infirmary from an entrenched Tory elite (Pickstone 406). Ferriar’s <title level="a">Observations
                Concerning the Vital Principle</title> condemned the vitalism of the Scottish physicians
                John Hunter and Alexander Monro as a throwback to Platonism, but then followed up
                with a paper that rallied his friend Cooper for the mechanism of his version of
                materialism.</p>
                  <p>On the face of it, this Manchester debate anticipates the later dispute between John
                Abernethy and William Lawrence now routinely adduced as a context for Mary Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> (1818).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an 
                    account of the Abernethy-Lawrence controversy, see Jacyna, whose survey omits 
                    any mention of the controversy in Manchester.</note> Cooper’s position is
                much like Lawrence’s materialism, but Ferriar’s position is harder to describe as he
                attacked both Abernethy’s hero John Hunter and distanced himself from Cooper’s
                certainty that the brain is the mind. The debate in Manchester was three-cornered
                and harder to read than the dispute between Abernethy and Lawrence. Where it did
                anticipate the later dispute was in the way it was picked up at the national level
                in terms of an ideological binary. The dispute—couched in amiable terms between
                Cooper and Ferriar themselves—was quickly seized upon by the anti-Jacobin campaign
                against "French" materialism. Cooper was its target: he had been named in Parliament
                by Burke for attending the Jacobin Club in Paris, but the debate also made waves in
                its own more sympathetic constituency of Rational Dissent. Hannah Lightbody’s diary
                for February 1788 contains an account of a tea-table discussion of "the dispute
                between Mr. Cooper and Dr. Barnes on Materialism" (14). A few days later her mentor,
                the literary physician James Currie—an honorary member at the Manchester society,
                later famous as the editor and biographer of Burns—restaged the dispute with "a very
                liberal defender of [Cooper’s] doctrine" (23). Hannah Lightbody later moved from
                Liverpool to Manchester and married the millowner Samuel Greg. She had encouraged
                her future husband to worship at a new Unitarian chapel in Mosley Street in
                competition with Barnes’s at Cross Street (Sekers 80). The new
                chapel adopted a liturgy created by Lightbody’s own minister in Liverpool.
                Priestley, who thought it more properly Unitarian, preached at the new chapel in
                1791, and mocked Barnes’s jealousy at its success
                (<title level="m">Life</title> 35, 109). Where these disputes
                about religious forms intersect with the debates on materialism is that the new
                liturgy more clearly parsed Priestley’s monism (which Barnes played down in his
                paper to the Manchester society to Cooper’s disgust). Debates around materialism and
                related doctrinal differences indicate some of the fractures forming around the
                doctrine of materialism in these networks. They also suggest something of what is
                lost in "epochal" accounts of the emergence of middle-class ideology. Attending in
                descriptive detail to the formation of networks in a Latourian manner coincides in
                this regard with the critique of the assumption that the social is "always formed"
                in the later work of Williams
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). Williams denies dominant
                forms ever exhaust "<emph>all human practice, human energy, and human
                    intention</emph>" (125). Redescribing the networks around Manchester can provide a
                sense of "new meanings and values, new practices, new relationships and kinds of
                relationships being created," in ways encouraged by his later cultural materialism,
                while still attending to emergent forms of domination (Williams, <title level="m">Marxism</title> 123).</p>

                Austen, William Cobbett, and Gilbert White on the basis of their shared proximity to
                the leafy Surrey town (see the essays by <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.favret.html">Favret</ref> and <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.gilmartin.html">Gilmartin</ref> in 
                    this volume). The choice of writers and location—in the rural home counties—is strange
                given the decisive role that Williams gives to the Industrial Revolution in his
                larger argument, but <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> is suffused
                with a sympathy for "a precarious rural-intellectual radicalism: genuinely and
                actively hostile to industrialism and capitalism; opposed to commercialism and to
                the exploitation of environment; attached to country ways and feelings, the
                literature and the lore" (36). In this final section of my essay, I attempt a
                playful rewriting of the Williams trope that takes the Manchester cotton industry
                and the region territorialized by Aikin’s text as its locus. Selective and sketchy
                my account must be, but placing these writers—Robert Owen, Hannah Greg, John
                Kennedy, John Phillips Kay, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Thomas De Quincey—in relation to
                each other around industrial Manchester helps reveal the tensions and contradictions
                that emerged from within the structures of feeling to be found in <title level="m">A 
                    Description of Manchester</title>.</p>
                  <p>Literary scholarship frequently identifies the industrial novel as the place where
                these contradictions emerged most glaringly, as Williams effectively does in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, but Gaskell’s fiction inhabits the
                networked territory that produced Aikin’s book, with some of its contradictions only
                more apparent. As the biographer of Gaskell’s early life has revealed in great
                detail, she was a belated member of the networks that surrounded the Manchester
                Literary and Philosophical Society, including Hannah Lightbody Greg’s circle, and
                even lived in the house of the founder of its offshoot society in Newcastle, the
                Unitarian minister William Turner II, before her marriage (Chapple 351–70). As a
                child, Turner had been the dedicatee and recipient of an early poem of
                Barbauld’s—<title level="a">Verses Written in the Leaves of an Ivory 
                    Pocketbook</title>—inscribed on a
                tablet. The poem has recently been read as a trope for the materialist psychology of
                these groups and their educational interests in the role of environment in shaping
                character (Wharton 31–33). In this regard, Turner stands as a link between the early
                and late phases in the evolution of this distinctive structure of feeling towards a
                broader cultural formation within middle-class liberalism: his career in many ways
                confirms the script written for him in Barbauld’s poem, not least in his
                encouragement of her interest in literary, scientific, and social issues in his
                daughter Mary Turner and in Gaskell.</p>
                  <p>I’ve already noted that celebrations of Priestley and associated branches of
                materialism have become a salient part of contemporary Romantic studies,<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richardson, Wharton, White and others have
                                made significant contributions to this scholarship, which usually

                directed—implicitly or explicitly—against traditional accounts of the
                "Romantic Artist." The progressive aspects of these formations morphed into
                altogether darker shapes across a generation. This claim does not mean that this
                dark materialism always existed as the real meaning of this historical process. It
                certainly fed into versions of work-time discipline found in John Kennedy, and even
                into the parallelograms of paupers associated with Robert Owen, but what also
                remained was a hankering after the emancipatory promise of the project of
                improvement that might be described as residual. Perhaps this is nowhere more
                obvious than in the case of Robert Owen, whose participation in the debates on
                materialism at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society is a routinely
                ignored part of his intellectual formation. By the account in his own <title level="m">Life of Robert Owen</title> (1857), which is not entirely reliable,
                Owen was encouraged into the Manchester society because of his knowledge of the new
                industrial processes, but there are plenty of signs that he also engaged with its
                debates on philosophical materialism, not least his amusing account of a feisty
                encounter with Ferriar in a debate on "genius" which left the doctor blushing (37).
                Even prior to joining the Manchester society, Owen had been part of a small debating
                club where his friends had dubbed him "the reasoning machine—because they said I
                made man a mere reasoning machine made to be so by nature and society" (36). His
                dispute with Ferriar probably revolved around the doctor’s resistance to the
                mechanical determinism of Owen’s version of materialism glimpsed in these comments.
                None of the papers Owen gave at the Literary and Philosophical Society have
                survived, but a record of their titles exists (Fraser 37–38). They suggest there is
                some truth to Owen’s claims of a lifelong consistency to his belief in the doctrine
                of circumstance: <title level="a">Remarks on the Improvement of the 
                    Cotton Trade</title> (November 1794); <title level="a">The Utility of

                    Social Virtues</title> (January 1796). There
                seems a remarkable series here from practical industrial issues to questions of
                social virtue.</p>
                  <p>These ideas were elaborated in his time at New Lanark, outside Glasgow, into <title level="m">A New View of Society</title> (1813) described by Williams in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> as "low rationalism" in their "social
                engineering," but "innovating in their humanity and kindness" (44–45). Williams
                didn’t notice the relation to the contradictions within the structure of feeling of
                Manchester materialism. In <title level="m">A New View of Society</title>, Owen
                addressed the cotton manufactures on behalf of the "vital machines" they neglected
                in favor of the "inanimate machines" (5). His metaphor of "vital machines" suggests
                the persistence of a version of materialism closer to Cooper’s mechanistic
                determinism than, for instance, Ferriar’s idea of genius. Certainly, the mechanistic
                aspects of Owen’s thinking—its "low rationalism"—remained in force even as his ideas
                more generally developed towards the abolition of private property. Like the
                reformed prisons encouraged by Howard’s plans, Owen’s utopian factory settlements
                were "laboratories of virtue" that continued to manifest contradictions between the
                promise of human emancipation and definitions of life in terms of productive
                efficiency. Early on, at least, they attracted manufacturers who saw them as
                remodeling factory discipline on a benign basis. Hannah Greg encouraged her husband
                to introduce them to their colony mill at Quarry Bank, but he distrusted Owen
                (Sekers 167–68). Samuel Greg was probably wary of Owen’s irreligion based on their
                time together in Manchester’s textile industry and as members of the Literary and
                Philosophical Society. Of course, as Hazlitt predicted when he first reviewed <title level="m">A New View of Society</title>, once Owen’s ideas developed towards a
                critique of private property, what support there was among factory owners
                evaporated, but even then, in Owen’s later utopian experiments, there remained a
                sense that the productive machine was a key measure of his ambitions for human being
                (Morris 122).</p>
                  <p>Owen’s position on the machine, especially the steam engine, took it to be a social
                evil primarily in so far as it encouraged capital accumulation into fewer hands and
                debased human labor into an easily expendable commodity. His ideas emerged onto the
                national stage at a period in the 1810s when Manchester’s manufacturers were also
                starting to think more broadly about the social effects of improvement, partly in
                response to calls for Parliament to intervene in the factory system on the questions
                of child labour and long hours. In 1815, the Manchester society hosted a paper from
                one of the town’s largest manufacturers, John Kennedy, who had
                worked with Owen there in the early 1790s (Owen 26). Kennedy’s <title level="a">Observations on the
                Rise and Progress of the Cotton Trade</title> acknowledged the dangers of social
                dislocation in bringing workers from the country to the city, but presented
                work-time discipline as a compensation that offered a new punctual form of being.
                Margaret Jacob has recently used Kennedy as an example of the capitalist motivated
                by technical knowledge as much as by profit, but his paper isn’t so much about
                applied science as it is about forms of social being emerging from the new
                industrial process. This double vision, not entirely squared off in Kennedy’s paper,
                marks his place in a period of transition, as does his rejection of Malthus in his
                defense of poor relief in the next paper he gave to the society. Kennedy’s position
                has at least partly to do the maintenance of a pool of already-disciplined labour to
                await the recovery of the trade cycle, but there is enough revulsion at Malthus’s
                iron laws of nature to suggest the retention of Aikin’s moral vision of improvement
                from a manufacturer who still worshipped—with Hannah Greg and her husband—at the
                Unitarian chapel Priestley had visited back in 1791.</p>
                  <p>Kennedy’s first paper was advocating a future in many ways yet to come as well as
                redescribing the improvements celebrated in Aikin’s book. Kennedy praised the steam
                engine for allowing power to be taken into the towns—"instead of carrying people to
                the power, it was preferable to place the power among the people"—but the battle
                between water and steam was not to be decided for several decades, as Andreas Malm
                has shown (Kennedy <title level="a">Observations,</title> 15–16; Malm 148). Kennedy 
                presented the triumph of steam as the inevitable outcome of an internal logic of technical 
                progress that partially elides his own self-interest. His essay is a conspicuous example 
                of the "productive force" of writing as ‘"the application and development of a certain 
                body of social knowledge" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 91), not a simple reflection of
                changes in factory production, but actively contributing to a new kind of
                technodeterminism that justified "industrialism" as a necessary and inevitable part
                of an emancipatory project of modernity. The generic indeterminacy of Kennedy’s
                writing, neither technical in Jacob’s sense, nor quite the condition-of-England
                essay later associated with Carlyle, suggests its relationship to "social
                experiences in solution" (Williams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 242).</p>
                  <p>By the time James Phillips Kay—another infirmary doctor—joined the Literary and
                Philosophical Society in 1829, the pressure on the manufacturing sector from working
                class organization and from Tory radicals had ratcheted up in ways that intensified
                a felt need to justify the narrative of "improvement" that Kennedy was adapting from
                Aikin. With Edward Baines Jr. and others in the region, Kay represented a vein of
                provincial opinion active in favour of political reform prior to 1832, but, unlike
                some middle-class radicals, one reluctant to interfere in the functioning of the
                factory system. First elaborated in a paper given to the society shortly before its
                publication, Kay’s <title level="m">Condition of the Working Classes</title> (1832)
                isolated the "social" as a specific zone of intervention in the name 
                of physical and moral health (Poovey 7). Early
                on in his pamphlet, Kay acknowledges the psychological and moral effects of the
                division of labour but quickly elides them in an attack on the moral contagion of
                Irish migration. This contagion, Kay suggests, has sapped the ability of the native
                workmen to manage the kind of transition to work-time discipline Kennedy described
                as the gift of the industrial system. A tendency towards abstraction described in
                Mary Poovey’s analysis of Kay’s "social body" looks like a reification of the
                medical materialism of the 1790s. Indeed, the medical historian John V. Pickstone
                contrasted Kay with Ferriar specifically around this issue of abstraction. Where
                Ferriar’s medical materialism operated with a sense of a biosphere inhabited by
                owners and workers alike, their fates necessarily entangled, Phillips Kay’s "social
                body" is a domain of observation and intervention for the scientific observer that
                comprised literacy, moral education, and domestic economy. This sphere was granted a
                position abstracted from the commercial system and its consequences, not unlike the
                position, structurally at least, "culture" occupies in the "Culture and Society"
                tradition, although rarely offering its working-class subjects the pleasures of the
                imaginative arts.</p>
                  <p>Kay and his collaborators in the newly founded Manchester Statistical Society,
                Kennedy and the sons of Hannah and Samuel Greg among them, refused to concentrate on
                questions of production and employment—as government enquirers had asked—and focused
                their investigations into social poverty on religion and education. Earlier literary
                physicians, including Ferriar and Percival, had shown an interest in using data
                provided by parish records as the basis of social enquiry, but they did not shy away
                from a critique of the factory system. In the Statistical Society, Phillips Kay and
                his friends turned to methods of social quantification as part of a campaign against
                the reduction of working hours. Political economy was preserved as an inviolable
                separate sphere in the Statistical Society. Nevertheless, as Cullen pointed out,
                these categorical distinctions rarely survived unshaken their encounters with the
                suffering they proposed to solve (106–10). Raymond Williams once suggested that the
                Statistical Society was an institution that linked Gaskell with Engels (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 116–17). Engels certainly admired—with
                reservations—Phillips Kay’s <title level="m">Condition of the Working Classes</title>
                and Gaskell mixed in the same Manchester intellectual milieu (Selleck 73, 272). In
                many ways, it ought to be regarded as a late intervention in a remarkable range of
                writing generated by medico-literary debates on materialism that emanated from the
                Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. Questions about the origins of "life"
                and the fate of the body, especially the bodies of the urban poor, were given
                urgency on the front line where technological innovation was reshaping human being
                and the global ecology. They were not simply circulating knowledge across flat
                knowledge networks. These networks shaped and responded to questions about power,
                progress, and emergent forms of social life.</p>
                  <p>Even towards the end of his career, Raymond Williams still read Romanticism as a form
                of resistance "to the socially repressive and intellectually mechanical forms of a
                new social order" (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 50). Now, though, he gave more
                attention to the dangers of "a necessarily selective and self-defining area" aligned
                with "a metaphysics of subjectivity and the imaginative process"
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 15). One influential statement
                of this "metaphysics" is to be found in Thomas De Quincey’s distinction between
                literatures of knowledge and literatures of power staked around a contrast between
                Watt’s steam engine and Wordsworth’s poetry (De Quincey 10:48). In one version, De
                Quincey traced his revelation of Wordsworth’s poetic power to a moment within the
                networks I have been describing (2:123–29). He contrasted the power of "connexion"
                wielded by the Roscoe circle with his own personal conversion experience. This
                foundation myth was implicitly reinforced in his autobiography by various sallies
                against the pretensions of Roscoe’s friend Thomas Percival. De Quincey’s selective
                definition of Wordsworth’s literary "power" involved the repression of debates
                about, for instance, medico-literary matters that would have made his binary look
                artificial, to say the least, especially in the context of the debates about
                literary genius described earlier. These received a late iteration in John Ferriar’s
                <title level="m">Essay towards a Theory of Apparitions</title> (1813). Ferriar’s
                idea of the imagination outlined there was materialist enough to provoke <title level="m">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</title> to declare its "decided
                anti-ferriarism" in the very issue it launched its famously scathing attack on Keats
                (<title level="a">Phantasmagoriana</title> 595). Ferriar’s essay has recently gained attention from
                scholars of Hogg and Scott (Faubert; Ferris 62–69). It deserves attention in its own
                right as part of the "forming and formative processes" of this period of transition
                into Marx’s machinery age (Wiliams,
                <title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). In this spirit, as part of
                "the multiplicity of writing" (146), texts like Aikin’s <title level="m">Description 
                    of Manchester</title> and Phillips Kay’s <title level="m">Condition
                    of the Working Classes</title> might also repay analysis by Romanticists. Such
                analysis might reshape our understanding of terms like "literary" and "culture"
                beyond the definitions offered by the "Culture and Society" tradition. Attending to
                their development in this context might also tell us something about the "new spirit
                of capitalism" (Boltanski), its current investment in flat networks as productive
                and liberating products of modernity, and related narratives of the development of
                new forms of technology as the necessary future of the human being supposedly freed
                from its past.</p>
