            <p class="noCount">The problem of determination takes particular shape during the nineteenth century,
               as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept of determination from
               Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the ways preexisting conditions
               fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as <em>determined</em> comes also to mean "unwavering" or "persistent"). In this essay I track these two
               competing definitions of <em>determined</em> through the writing of Raymond Williams and William Wordsworth. As critical concepts
               open to caricature, Romanticism and Marxism are sometimes placed in tension: where
               Romanticism prioritizes the power of the individual will, Marxism prioritizes the
               external forces that condition it. But the texts we choose to read closely often challenge
               the characterizations we bring to bear on them. Williams, for instance, struggles
               against Marxism’s focus on economic determinism and Wordsworth concludes Book I of
               <em>The Prelude</em>—a poem that celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the importance
               of "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In this way, both
               writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses of "determination"
               in their work. In placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests turn grammatical,
               for Williams and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice in their writing
               about determination. If both writers share an interest in determination and its various
               and competing connotations, what can we learn about the concept from attending to
               the grammatical, even stylistic, choices writers make when writing about determination?</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>A few years ago the institution that employs me put together an advertising campaign
                  that I enjoy imagining as Hegel-inspired. For purposes of attracting donations and
                  student applications, the campaign’s featured slogan, "Determined Spirit," describes
                  a shared, tenacious drive. And indeed, Clemson students often win awards for what
                  gets called "school spirit." But given the various and sometimes competing senses
                  of "determined," the slogan also introduces the possibility that "spirit" at Clemson
                  is expected, even compulsory. A determined spirit, in other words, is also a predetermined
                  spirit, a spirit determined in advance.</p>
               <p>In his <em>Keywords</em>, Raymond Williams explores the complex range of definitions associated with the word
                  <em>determine</em> as he focuses on the distinction between determination and determinism, where the
                  word <em>determination</em> refers to an unwavering individual will and the word <em>determinism</em> refers to the opposite, a will caught up in general processes beyond its control.
                  Williams writes that even the most insistent and pseudoauthoritative application of
                  one fixed sense of the word <em>determined</em> cannot avoid the other line of meaning. He illustrates the potential difficulty <em>determine</em> introduces with the sentence, "I am determined not to be determined," where the two
                  meanings of determine vie for control (<em>Keywords</em> 102). On the one hand, the "I" of the sentence is resolved to remain free from determination,
                  free from all constraints, bounds, and definitions. In this way the "I" pursues a
                  model sovereignty. On the other hand, the sentence also suggests that this pursuit
                  of a model sovereignty is already and from the start determined, a sign of the subject’s
                  unfreedom; there may be nothing less free than the subject’s supposedly free pursuit
                  of freedom. And even these two broad interpretations of Williams’s sentence do not
                  exhaust the interpretive possibilities, which is one of the reasons he offers it.
                  One might still stress how the sentence produces an "I" that is resolved to be unresolved,
                  an "I" that would prefer not to act and will say "no" to making any and all future
                  decisions: "I am determined not to have to determine anything (myself)." Or perhaps
                  this "I" has been determined this way, an "I" destined for indetermination: as if
                  Williams had in mind Melville’s Bartleby or were commenting on the Supreme Court under
                  Chief Justice Roberts. Needless to say, the sentence is not easy to translate, though
                  as an experiment I did type the sentence into Google Translate and received this sentence
                  in German, "Ich bin entschlossen, nicht bestimmt zu sein," which takes care of some
                  of the difficulty <em>determined</em> introduces into English by translating one use of <em>determined</em> as <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">entschlossen</span> and the other as <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">bestimmt</span>. If one feeds this German translation back into Google Translate one receives in
                  return: "I am determined not to be specific." Not uninteresting, but not quite the
                  same.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For Williams, the problem of determination takes particular shape during the nineteenth
                     century, as it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle the concept of determination
                     from Marxism on the one hand (as Marxism focuses attention on the ways preexisting
                     conditions fix a course of events) and Romanticism on the other (as <em>determined</em> comes also to mean "unwavering" or "persistent," and as the idea of the sovereign
                     individual, the lyric "I," takes shape). William Keach develops this line of thinking
                     in <em>Arbitrary Power</em>, where he remarks on the importance of determination to the nineteenth century: "Whether
                     as a question of the ‘general will’ of the polis or of the individual will of a political
                     agent or writer, ‘determination’ structures nineteenth-century efforts to understand
                     the constitution of society and culture" (22).

                     </div> My interests are in part historical. With Williams’s attention in mind to the importance
                     of determination as a concept during the nineteenth century and his attention to the
                     ways its meaning shifts, I turn to Book I of William Wordsworth’s <em>The Prelude</em>, which features the word <em>determined</em> at several key moments. As Wordsworth begins his biographical poem, he wonders whether
                     he was determined by some external force to be a poet and whether he is determined
                     enough to become one. In this essay I track these two competing definitions of <em>determined</em> through the writing of Williams and Wordsworth, a Marxist cultural critic on the one
                     hand and a Romantic poet on the other. As critical concepts open to caricature, Romanticism
                     and Marxism are sometimes placed in tension: where Romanticism prioritizes the power
                     of the individual will, Marxism prioritizes the external forces that condition it.
                     But the texts we choose to read closely often challenge the characterizations we bring
                     to bear on them. Williams, for instance, struggles against Marxism’s focus on economic
                     determinism, and Wordsworth concludes Book I of <em>The Prelude</em>—a poem that celebrates certain forms of self-determination—by foregrounding the importance
                     of "determined bounds," bounds that have been determined by others. In this way, both
                     writers are sensitive to the various and sometimes competing senses of "determination"
                     in their work.</p>
               </div>
               <p>But in placing Wordsworth alongside Williams my interests turn grammatical, for Williams
                  and Wordsworth are often drawn to the passive voice in their writing about determination.
                  They also both frequently employ empty grammatical subjects when writing about determination,
                  which has the effect of making the subject of a key sentence about determination itself
                  difficult to determine. Some of the interpretive problems posed by Williams’s sentence
                  ("I am determined not to be determined") might be described in grammatical terms:
                  is the first-person pronoun the agent of the action (in which case the sentence is
                  read as active voice) or is some other, unnamed subject the agent of the action (in
                  which case the sentence is read as passive voice)? The difference emerges when one
                  rewrites the sentence, for instance, as "I am determined (by my class) not to be determined."
                  If both writers share an interest in determination and its various and competing connotations,
                  what can we learn about the concept from attending to the grammatical, even stylistic,
                  choices writers make when writing about determination?</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">No Problem More Difficult</span></h2>
               <p>In <em>Marxism and Literature</em>, Williams begins his chapter 
                  “Determination”
                  by identifying the term’s importance to Marxism: "No problem in Marxist cultural theory
                  is more difficult, than that of ‘determination’" (83). Williams attempts to rescue
                  Marxism from too rigid an emphasis on determination without, however, giving up on
                  the importance of the term to cultural theory in general. As he concludes the first
                  paragraph: "A Marxism without some concept of determination is in effect worthless.
                  A Marxism with many of the concepts of determination it now has is quite radically
                  disabled" (<em>Marxism</em> 83). Today, given developments in disability studies, the subtle personification
                  of Marxism as "radically disabled" is difficult to ignore and worth attending to.
                  But Williams is attempting to navigate between, for him, two undesirable versions
                  of Marxism, neither capable of developing an adequate cultural theory: one without
                  any concept of determination and one with too rigid a concept of determination.</p>
               <p>Williams attempts to rescue Marx from Marxism, as he objects to the ways determinism
                  became widely known, in Marxism, as "economism" (which Williams describes as "worthless"
                  [<em>Marxism</em> 86]). Certain versions of Marxism, and certain poor readers of Marx, totalize determinism
                  as economism and mistakenly erase from Marx any idea of direct agency. Over the course
                  of the nineteenth century, Williams laments, Marx gives way to Marxism: "With bitter
                  irony, a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not only in practice but
                  at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity and reification against
                  which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to operate" (<em>Marxism</em> 86). Williams argues against this abstract determinism, for the full concept of determination
                  is crucial to save Marxism from such abstractions: "In practice determination is never
                  only the setting of limits; it is also the exertion of pressures. As it happens this
                  is also a sense of ‘determine’ in English: to determine or be determined to do something
                  is an act of will and purpose" (<em>Marxism</em> 87). As in <em>Keywords</em>, Williams in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> turns to the resources of language itself, here the resources of the English language
                  in particular, for help unsettling various attempts to fix meaning and thereby produce
                  pseudoauthoritative doctrine.</p>
               <p>To explore why "determination" is the most difficult problem in Marxist cultural theory,
                  Williams turns to a well-known passage from the 1859 preface to <em>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</em>, which features what Williams refers to as Marx’s "normal word" for determine, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">bestimmen</span>. "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary,
                  their social being that determines their consciousness," writes Marx in a paragraph
                  that Williams quotes at length in 
                  “Base and Superstructure,”
                  the chapter that immediately precedes the 
                  “Determination”
                  chapter (qtd. in <em>Marxism</em> 75). As Williams notes when he returns to the preface in the next chapter, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">bestimmen</span> appears four times in Marx’s original German but only three times in the English
                  translation (the one Williams quotes). And one appearance of <em>determine</em> in the English version actually translates a different German word, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">konstatieren</span>. Williams does not blame the translator for this discrepancy. "The point here," writes
                  Williams, "is not so much the adequacy of the translation as the extraordinary linguistic
                  complexity of this group of words. This can best be illustrated by considering the
                  complexity of ‘determine’ in English" (<em>Marxism</em> 84). Attuned to the complexity of such groups of words, Williams reads almost as
                  a poet committed to language really used—and, as suggested by his reading of the word
                  <em>determine</em>, language overused and worked over.</p>
               <p>Of the various Romantic writers and poets Williams draws on to advance arguments in
                  his many books, Wordsworth is not always the most important. Samuel Taylor Coleridge
                  plays a more vital role in the early chapters of <em>Culture and Society 1780–1950</em> and in its sequel, <em>The Long Revolution</em>, for instance. And yet, Williams’s repeated turns to language echo Wordsworth’s famous
                  interest in language "really used by men" (Wordsworth, <em>Selected</em> 281). As Williams writes in the introduction to <em>Culture and Society</em>, "I feel myself committed to the study of actual language: that is to say, to the
                  words and sequences of words which particular men and women have used in trying to
                  give meaning to their experience" (xix). While Williams translates Wordsworth’s adverb
                  ("really") into an adjective ("actual"), he develops Wordsworth’s poetics as advanced
                  in the preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> into a detailed critical method. And Williams’s commitment to actual individual statements
                  over what he calls "a system of significant abstractions" echoes Wordsworth’s distrust
                  of personified abstractions of ideas (<em>Culture</em> xix). At moments like these it can seem that Williams is a determined Wordsworthian.</p>

            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <h2><span class="head">Of Determined Bounds</span></h2>
               <p>If a poor reading of Marx absolutizes one sense of "determination," then a poor reading
                  of Romanticism absolutizes the other (as if Romanticism named nothing other than the
                  systematic assertion of the individual will). I turn now to Wordsworth and the opening
                  book of <em>The Prelude</em>, in which Wordsworth’s poet-speaker poses two related questions: Was I determined
                  (by Nature) to be a poet; and Am I determined (enough) to <em>become</em> one? Wordsworth’s <em>The Prelude</em>, in other words, is motivated by the question of determination, and the word <em>determined</em> appears in the text at two key moments in the first book, once near the beginning
                  where he announces his longing for a "determined aim," and once near the end where
                  he celebrates his having settled on a theme, one with "determined bounds" (<em>Prelude</em> 34, 64). Reading Wordsworth after Williams helps make legible the importance of determination
                  to Wordsworth’s thinking about the self.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wordsworth opens <em>The Prelude</em> by rewriting the conclusion to Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>. In the closing lines of Milton’s poem, Adam and Eve wonder "where to choose / Their
                     place of rest" after expulsion from Eden; and with "providence their guide," hand
                     in hand they wander (618). Wordsworth replaces Milton’s guide, "providence," with
                     a wandering cloud: "should the guide I chuse / Be nothing better than a wandering
                     cloud / I cannot miss my way" (<em>Prelude</em> 28).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>1805, Book I, lines 17–19. Future citations of the poem will be to this edition and
                              included parenthetically (book, line numbers).</span></div>
                     </div> In doing so, Wordsworth negates the possible tragedy of <em>Paradise Lost</em>. Though Wordsworth does not know what guide to choose, there is no tragedy in the
                     choice, for, unlike in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, there is no wrong choice: "Whither shall I turn, / By road or pathway, or through
                     open field, / Or shall a twig or any floating thing / Upon the river point me out
                     my course?" (I.29–32). Wordsworth records that after wondering for two days he arrived
                     at his hermitage and he describes the love that greeted him. He is happy for a time.</p>
               </div>
               <p>At this point, and after some rest, Wordsworth characterizes himself as determined,
                  as interested in determining an aim for himself, though what Wordsworth actually writes
                  is quite complicated: "But speedily," writes Wordsworth, "a longing in me rose / To
                  brace myself to some determined aim" (I.123–24). Characteristically, Wordsworth introduces
                  the importance of individual will via syntax that throws into question the active,
                  individual will. A longing arises in him, he writes, as if the longing were to some
                  degree or other independent of him, as if the longing were not entirely his own. Though
                  grammatically the sentence is not in the passive voice, the subject of the sentence
                  is this longing and not Wordsworth himself, not the first person, as Wordsworth positions
                  himself as the object acted upon. Bracing himself for some determined aim, Wordsworth
                  progresses through Book I worrying over various possible choices for poetic composition,
                  as undisturbed delight gives way to concern over a selection process for a proper
                  poetic theme. As Wordsworth wonders what he should write about to prove his worth
                  as a poet, and as he chronicles the various topics for a great poem he entertains
                  only to dismiss, from some British theme or old "Romantic tale by Milton left unsung"
                  to "some philosophic song" (I.180, 230), Wordsworth famously wonders "Was it for this
                  / That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved / To blend his murmurs with my nurse’s
                  song" (I.271–72)? Wordsworth takes stock and determines that he does not lack a vital
                  soul and is not "naked in external things, / Forms, images, nor numerous other aids"
                  (I.165–66), and yet he still must ask: Was it for this? The poet’s self-consciousness
                  results in a question about determination, about the poet’s determination: Was Wordsworth
                  determined for this? And then, subsequently, and thinking of determined as meaning
                  "persistent," is Wordsworth persistent enough to follow through on the promise? Wordsworth’s
                  poem, in other words, shows his sensitivity to the complexity of <em>determination</em> (as word and concept). And this sensitivity can seem to result in the repeated use
                  of dummy pronouns, as the antecedent for "it" in "was it for this" is famously open
                  and opaque.</p>
               <p>When Wordsworth concludes Book I, having found his theme at last, he returns to the
                  opening lines of the poem and figures himself as doubly determined. And the word itself
                  makes a potentially surprising second appearance. Wordsworth replaces the wide range
                  of options introduced at the beginning of the poem—where he wonders whether to follow
                  a road or a pathway, a cloud or a floating thing, and write a romantic tale or some
                  philosophic song—with a single option: "The road lies plain before me. ’Tis a theme
                  / Single and of determined bounds, and hence / I chuse it rather at this time than
                  work / Of ampler or more varied argument" (I.668–71). Wordsworth has settled on his
                  theme, "the story of [his] life," and this theme already has a revivifying force ("One
                  end hereby at least hath been attained— / My mind hath been revived" [I.664–65]).
                  Wordsworth chooses a road that lies plain before him, a road, in other words, somewhat
                  well-travelled—even though one might expect him to follow a less pre<em>determined</em> path. Despite the many ways we associate Romantic texts with the rise of the self-determining
                  individual, the poem carefully anticipates and complicates such a characterization.
                  In choosing a road, Wordsworth’s way is determined; it is before him. And he foregrounds
                  the question of determination explicitly by comparing his theme to a road in describing
                  its "determined bounds." Because the theme has determined bounds, Wordsworth is determined
                  to choose it. If the opening of Book I is a return to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, so too is the end of Book I. But whereas Adam and Eve wander, Wordsworth hits the
                  road. His direction, clearly marked, opens before him. Had Wordsworth followed a cloud
                  or floating thing across an open field, his chosen path would have fit more comfortably
                  within the usual stories one hears about Romanticism (as a celebration of nature,
                  of the individual, of the individual imagination, etc.); but instead of wandering
                  across an open field, Wordsworth chooses a road and, additionally, one that "lies
                  plain before [him]."</p>
               <p>Near the beginning of Book I, Wordsworth wonders if he was determined by nature to
                  produce <em>The Prelude</em>; by the end of Book I, he has determined his theme, one with determined bounds, a
                  theme that is not varied. In a sense the one meaning of determination (as fixed) combines
                  with the other, as Wordsworth makes his choice and thereby asserts himself as active
                  agent. He chooses (determines) a theme with determined bounds, and as a result Wordsworth—over
                  the course of Book I—draws together, like Williams later, the two meanings of <em>determination</em>. To borrow Williams’s imagined sentence from <em>Keywords</em>, Wordsworth is determined to be determined. If Raymond Williams hopes to complicate
                  a version of Marxism too enamored of "determinism" by reintroducing the importance
                  of individual will, Wordsworth’s <em>The Prelude</em> complicates a too-simple version of Romanticism too enamored of "determination" <em>as</em> individual will, as he reintroduces the importance of determined (and determining)
                  bounds at the close of Book I of <em>The Prelude</em>.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Passive Voices</span></h2>
               <p>I have been focusing on what we might call a lexical problem, but as I have already
                  hinted in my opening paragraphs, I would like to turn as well to syntax and to some
                  of the ways lexical and syntactical questions are intertwined in Wordsworth and Williams.
                  The question of determination from Wordsworth to Williams turns on one’s ability to
                  decide whether the subject acts (determines itself for itself) or is acted upon (is
                  determined by something else). The grammatical, or more specifically the syntactical,
                  corollary to the question of "determination" is something like voice, specifically
                  the difference between active and passive voice, where passive constructions invert
                  normal subject and object noun phrases. In the active voice, the subject of the sentence
                  is also the agent of the action. In the passive voice, the object acted upon becomes
                  the subject, and the agent of the action is introduced belatedly, often in a prepositional
                  phrase. For instance, in the sentence "Wordsworth wrote <em>The Prelude</em>," the subject of the sentence (Wordsworth) precedes and acts upon the object of the
                  sentence (<em>The Prelude</em>). But in "<em>The Prelude</em> was written by Wordsworth," the object acted upon comes first. By inverting subject
                  and object, the agent of the action becomes the object of the sentence. And the object
                  acted upon (<em>The Prelude</em>) becomes the grammatical subject of the sentence. For this reason, writing guides
                  often advise against using passive voice. Famously, George Orwell strongly advises
                  against the passive voice in 
                  “The Politics of the English Language,”
                  where he suggests that one should "never use the passive where you can use the active"
                  (119). Of more philosophical importance, especially for an essay that began with the
                  difficult problem of determination, passive constructions show just how easily subjects
                  and objects can be reversed, as the agent capable of acting becomes an object and
                  the object acted upon becomes a subject. In other words, passive constructions show
                  how difficult it can be to determine and stabilize the difference between subjects
                  and objects (the agents who act and the things that are acted upon). Passive constructions
                  also showcase how quickly the agent of the action can disappear from a sentence. In
                  some passive constructions, that is, the agent is left, either accidentally or intentionally,
                  undecidable (as in a sentence like "<em>The Prelude</em> was written"). One famous and much cited example is "Mistakes were made," where the
                  one who made the mistakes, the agent of the action, the rhetorical (if not grammatical)
                  subject of the sentence, goes unnamed. As Orwell argues, such a construction allows
                  those in power to stay in power by strategically disappearing. At moments like this
                  one, the agent is determined not to be determined.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In their related attempts to think the difficult problem of determination, both Wordsworth
                     and Williams repeatedly use the passive voice, as their grammar and syntax raise questions
                     about who or what acts and who or what is acted upon. In the writing of Wordsworth
                     and Williams, it is often difficult to determine who is doing what to whom. For instance,
                     early in the glad preamble to <em>The Prelude</em> and after Wordsworth asserts that he "cannot miss [his] way" for his joy is great,
                     he uses a passive construction that leaves the precise cause of his happiness unknown: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="indent4">It is shaken off,</div>
                           <div class="l">As by miraculous gift ’tis shaken off,</div>
                           <div class="l">That burthen of my own unnatural self,</div>
                           <div class="l">The heavy weight of many a weary day</div>
                           <div class="l">Not mine, and such as were not made for me. (I.21–25)</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> At first it is unclear to a reader what the antecedent for "it" is, but after a line
                     or two it becomes clear that Wordsworth describes the burden of his own unnatural
                     self, a burden that is shaken off. Readers are then able to reread the sentence as
                     "The burthen of my own unnatural self is shaken off." But even when one learns what
                     has been shaken off, the passive construction leaves undisclosed the active agent
                     (the rhetorical if not grammatical subject).

                     agent of the action.

                              is caught up in a mode of perception that takes him beyond his ordinary, active consciousness
                              to a larger and more indefinite perspective" (5).</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>Most relevant to my purposes, Wordsworth employs passive voice in the final verse
                  paragraph of Book I of <em>The Prelude</em> as well, where the question of determination is thematized most explicitly. As Wordsworth
                  draws the first book to a close, he acknowledges that despite continuing difficulties
                  "One end hereby at least hath been attained— / My mind hath been revived" (I.664–65).
                  Who or what has revived the mind? Is it Wordsworth or Nature? Or the act of writing
                  about himself and Nature? The agent of the action is again left unclear, and the effect
                  is particularly Wordsworthian. Wordsworth turns to the passive voice at key moments
                  like these because he does not wish to determine absolutely agents of action. To determine
                  Nature as the active agent makes Wordsworth a passive object. He will have been determined
                  absolutely by an external force. Conversely, to determine Wordsworth himself as the
                  active agent makes Nature a passive object. Wordsworth’s philosophical questions about
                  the relation between poet and Nature lead him inexorably toward the passive voice.
                  Because it is difficult to determine one’s determination, Wordsworth is determined
                  to use the passive voice.</p>
               <p>Williams’s own efforts to think determination similarly result in a high degree of
                  indetermination: determination, for Williams, is always "an active and conscious as
                  well as, by default, a passive and objectified historical experience" (<em>Marxism</em> 88). He is interested in determination because it can be difficult to determine adequately
                  when historical experience results from one’s determination (one’s active persistence)
                  and when it results from one’s determination (one’s objectified historical experience).
                  Williams can sound a bit like Wordsworth from 
                  “Tintern Abbey”
                  here: as if historical experience were half-perceived and half-created. Wordsworth
                  hopes neither to prioritize poet over Nature nor Nature over poet; and Williams, likewise,
                  hopes to keep both meanings of determination in play. As a result, both repeatedly
                  write in the passive voice.</p>
               <p>In a key sentence in which Williams objects to some of the ways Marxism (against Marx,
                  argues Williams) privileges one sense of determination over another to develop a theory
                  of "economism," Williams uses the passive voice conspicuously: "With bitter irony,"
                  writes Williams, "a critical and revolutionary doctrine was changed, not only in practice
                  but at this level of principle, into the very forms of passivity and reification against
                  which an alternative sense of ‘determinism’ had set out to operate" (<em>Marxism</em> 86). Williams laments the degree to which Marxism’s focus on passive reification
                  precludes attention to determination as active and conscious. But Williams chooses
                  the passive voice in order to formulate his lament. Marx’s critical and revolutionary
                  doctrine was changed, but changed by whom? Here and elsewhere in his writing, Williams
                  turns to the passive voice as he attempts to rescue "determination" from a determinism
                  that changes active agents into passive objects of cultural and economic forces. Faced
                  with the indeterminate nature of <em>determine</em> in English, and in an effort to draw it out, Williams intensifies a syntactical tic.</p>
               <p>For a second example, we can return to another passage I have already quoted. In the
                  paragraph discussed above, in which Williams examines a translation of Marx’s preface
                  to <em>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</em> and points to the linguistic complexity of <em>determine</em> in English, the word translators often use to render Marx’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">bestimmen</span> into English, Williams writes: "The point here is not so much the adequacy of the
                  translation as the extraordinary linguistic complexity of this group of words. This
                  can best be illustrated by considering the complexity of ‘determine’ in English" (<em>Marxism</em> 84). In the second sentence quoted, Williams leaves blank the rhetorical subject
                  of his sentence, the agent of the action, as the "I" capable of illustrating and considering
                  complexity is left out. And this sentence is illustrative of Williams’s style more
                  generally, for Williams not only leaves out the agent of the action but also the object
                  acted upon: to what does "this" refer to, this "this" that can best be illustrated?
                  An inelegant version of Williams’s sentence might read: "I will illustrate this complexity
                  by considering the complexity of ‘determine’ in English." Williams removes the agent
                  that will perform the action and also leaves "this" to stand alone. Once again, Williams’s
                  syntax raises questions about determination, as Williams leaves much undetermined.
                  He can sound quite Wordsworthian. But just as the point for Williams is not the adequacy
                  of translation, the point for me is not the adequacy of Williams’s style. What interests
                  me most is how often in his writing about determination Williams uses the passive
                  voice. A cursory glance at the "Determination" chapter of <em>Marxism and Literature</em> will show how often Williams repeatedly uses the passive voice and begins sentences
                  with expletives or dummy pronouns (sentences that begin with an empty grammatical
                  subject like the "it" of "it is raining"), a construction that often follows from
                  the passive voice. To quote from sentences early in the chapter that introduce some
                  complexity, especially if one wishes to linger over Williams’ syntax: <span class="quote">‘According to its opponents, Marxism is a necessarily reductive and determinist kind
                     of theory: no cultural activity is allowed to be real and significant in itself, but
                     is always reduced to a direct or indirect expression of some preceding and controlling
                     economic content. . . . In the perspective of mid-twentieth century developments of
                     Marxism, this description can be seen as a caricature. Certainly it is often asserted
                     with a confidence as solid as it is out of date. Yet it can hardly be denied that
                     it came . . . from a common form of Marxism. (<span style="font-style:italic">Marxism </span>83)’</span> Williams presents a caricature of Marxism as determinism that he then acknowledges
                  cannot be denied. He will go on to argue for a less deterministic Marxism. But in
                  the concluding sentences of the above quotation, Williams’s prose features a series
                  of "it" pronouns. The "it" of "certainly it is often asserted" refers to the caricature,
                  though who is asserting it is left open. The "it" of "yet it can hardly be denied"
                  is an expletive, an empty pronoun that serves a grammatical function but has no real
                  antecedent. For Williams, the problem of determination is not independent from certain
                  grammatical and syntactical arrangements, arrangements that make "it," for instance,
                  difficult to determine.</p>
               <p>Wordsworth and Williams share not only an interest in the complexity of <em>determination</em> in English, as word and concept, but also an interest in the passive voice and in
                  uses of language that showcase with a certain lightness of touch the ways objects
                  can become subjects and the ways subjects can drop from view, especially in sentences
                  that leave undisclosed and indeterminate the agent of the action.</p>

               <p>When readers bring Marxist cultural criticism and Romanticism into contact, one often
                  senses a need to choose between them. Either Romanticism is little more than an ideology
                  that denies the importance of external economic forces, or it is a vibrant celebration
                  of human potential. In focusing on some of the ways Wordsworth and Williams think
                  determination with and through the passive voice, I have tried for new points of contact.
                  If we take seriously the ways Wordsworth and Williams both foreground passive voice
                  in their writing about determination, we discover stylistic similarities in discourses
                  often perceived to be antithetical, especially when Williams stands in for Marxist
                  cultural materialism and Wordsworth for Romantic idealism. We know that Williams was
                  dissatisfied with certain versions of Marxism and Wordsworth with certain versions
                  of idealism. Both found in "determination" strategies for resisting the pull of familiar
                  isms and both used the passive voice to make a little more restless our attempts to
                  characterize historical experience as either active or passive.</p>
               <p>Theory in recent decades has become increasingly proficient at marshalling increasingly
                  complicated philosophical and scientific concepts (let’s call them tropes) in the
                  service of urgent speculation. But some of the most pressing social issues today also
                  hold a grammatical edge, as those urging adoption of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’écriture inclusive</span> in France know well. (In French, an adjective that refers jointly to masculine and
                  feminine nouns agrees only with the masculine one, thus perpetuating [argue protesters]
                  French linguistic patriarchy.) I sometimes worry that theory left grammar behind too
                  quickly as theory courses proliferated in university curricula, even though we always
                  knew (and still know) that there is no style of thought without a grammar. But what
                  if, in place of "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is more difficult, than that
                  of ‘determination,’" Williams had written "No problem in Marxist cultural theory is
                  more difficult than that of passive voice"? What sort of theory would have emerged?
                  For decades, Romanticism has played a key role in the development of theory (or Theory,
                  or theories). I cannot determine whether Wordsworth led me to Williams or Williams
                  led me to Wordsworth, just as I cannot tell whether interest in the question of determination
                  leads to passive voice or if interest in the passive voice leads to questions about
                  determination. It may be impossible to tell. To encounter the impossibility of telling,
                  though, may be one of the only ways to open a new question.</p>
