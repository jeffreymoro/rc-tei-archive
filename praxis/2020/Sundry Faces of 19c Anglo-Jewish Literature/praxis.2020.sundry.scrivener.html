            <p class="noCount">Although critics have studied extensively the Gothic writings of Charlotte Dacre (Rey,
               King, Rosa Matilda), they have rarely discussed her work as Jewish writing, and they
               have largely ignored the poetry and fiction of her younger sister Sophia King (Fortnum).
               In fact, both sisters, daughters of perhaps the most well-known Jew in England at
               the time, John King (Rey), never severed connections with their father and wrote both
               directly and obliquely as Jewish women; moreover, they were read as Jewish women.
               The historical trauma of the Jewish expulsion from Iberia and the persecution by the
               Inquisition is reflected in the writings of these Sephardic women. Fearlessly innovating
               within the Gothic, sentimental, and philosophical traditions of writing, they also
               subversively played against sexual stereotypes, linking their work to women like Aphra
               Behn and Eliza Haywood, and anticipating the sexually explicit work of Philip Roth
               and I. B. Singer. Moreover, their use of the supernatural draws upon Jewish traditions
               of dybbuks and demons in the past and in the future. Reading the work of Charlotte
               Dacre and Sophia King re-inscribes the importance of Jewish contexts within Romantic
               aesthetics.</p>

            <p>Although accomplished literary scholars have written about the fiction and poetry
               of Charlotte (1781/82–1826) and Sophia King (1782–after 1805), the daughters of John
               “Jew” King (1753–1823; see Endelman), they rarely have read the King sisters in terms
               of a Jewish tradition of writing. Adriana Craciun, Diane Hoeveler, Lisa Wilson, Ann
               Jones, and others have written perceptively about Charlotte’s work, only rarely about
               Sophia, so that at least Charlotte is fairly well known, at least to scholars of the
               Gothic. The sisters’ work, however, is part of Jewish literature, even though the
               most obvious and immediate influences of the sisters, especially Charlotte, were on
               Byron and P. B. Shelley. I will show a circuitous route of connection between the
               sisters and modern Jewish literature, and I will illustrate the ways their work is
               meaningfully Jewish. </p>
            <p>Philip Roth’s postmodernist playing with his own identity in his fiction with the
               Zuckerman series and other novels harkens back to Lord Byron’s similar but Romantic
               playing with his own identity in <em>Childe Harold</em>, <em>Manfred</em>, <em>Don Juan</em>, and other poems. Some critics such as the British-American novelist Benjamin Markovits
               (2011, 2018) have drawn the connection between Roth (1933–2018) and Byron (1788–1824),
               and between Byron and the protagonist David Lurie, a secular Jew, in John Coetzee’s
               <em>Disgrace</em> (1999), a novel that evokes both Roth and Byron. The daughters of John “Jew” King
               had a deep if rarely acknowledged influence on the noble poet. Charlotte’s <em>Hours of Solitude</em> (1805) led to Byron’s <em>Hours of Idleness</em> (1807), not just in the similarity of titles but in the sentimental and Della Cruscan
               style of both volumes. Also, the connection between Byron and modern writers like
               Roth and Coetzee entails a thematic preoccupation with sex that is a primary focus
               in their work. Roth acquired a notoriety not just for satirizing aspects of contemporary
               Jewish life, but especially for his representations of sex. While it might seem to
               some that Roth’s focus on sex is radically new, in fact there is a tradition of Jewish
               writers preoccupied in similar ways. The King sisters were pioneers in this area.
               They drew upon not just Mary Robinson (1758–1800) and her theatrical display of her
               beauty and her use of various pseudonyms, but also the Restoration/early eighteenth-century
               writing by women like Aphra Behn (1640–89) and Eliza Haywood (1693–1756). Haywood’s
               <em>Fantomina</em> (1725), whose heroine displays inventive sexual initiative in her pursuit of the
               man she wants, seems like a precursor of <em>Zofloya</em> (1806) and Charlotte’s other novels. The King sisters’ poetry and fiction are filled
               with illicit desires and transgressive sexual activity, often by women and from a
               woman’s perspective. One thinks of Virgina Woolf’s essay 
               “Professions for Women”
               (1931), where she acknowledges the taboo area of women writing about their authentic
               desires. Both Charlotte and Sophia wrote extensively about women characters struggling
               with desires that violated social norms. The young Jewish women deepened a sexual
               focus in their work rather than disguised it, and they resisted the ascendant prudish
               norm (for the norm, see Poovey), perhaps because, as socially marginal young women,
               they could be daring, especially with the example of their father in mind, a Jew who
               survived and thrived despite hostile public opinion and legal problems. Also they
               could use the notorious precedent of Lewis’s <em>Monk</em> (1796) to expose the hypocrisy of a sexual double standard. Unlike Byron’s or Roth’s
               male characters, the Kings’ female characters paid a much heavier price than similar
               male characters ever paid for similar activities.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of Byronism prominent in Roth’s work is theatrical role playing so
               that the author intentionally suggests a connection, whether true or not, between
               him and his characters (on theatricality in late-eighteenth century England, see Pascoe).
               Charlotte was a practiced disguiser and revealer of her own identity and autobiography
               in her poetry and fiction, using pseudonyms such as Rosa Matilda, to evoke the associations
               with Matthew Lewis’s villain Rosario, who appears to be a young man, but who is actually
               a woman named Matilda, who seduces the monk Ambrosio and turns him to the dark side.
               She further obscured her real identity by using Charlotte Dacre as her “real” name,
               to which she attached an engraved image of herself on the title page, an image of
               a pretty dark-haired young woman wearing a close-fitting, low-cut dress. It was not
               usual for women writers to present themselves to the reading public with a sexy portrait
               of themselves (Mary Robinson excepted). Byron, in a characteristically High Romantic
               move, satirizes Charlotte’s poetry and fiction dismissively in <em>British Bards and Scottish Reviewers</em> (1809), as though he himself were not a student of her writing. A note appended to
               the second edition of <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em> where “Rosa Matilda” receives fourteen lines (756–64, 926–30) reads as follows: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">This lovely little Jessica, the daughter of the noted Jew K[ing], seems to be a follower
                  of the Della Cruscan School, and has published two volumes of very respectable absurdities
                  in rhyme, as times go; besides sundry novels in the style of the first edition of
                  the Monk. (Byron <em>Works</em> 1: 413)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Anyone capable of connecting the dots would realize that Charlotte Dacre, Rosa Matilda,
               and Charlotte King signified the same individual, the same Jewish woman, the daughter
               of a man who socialized frequently with William Godwin and who had financial dealings
               with him as well as Byron and Shelley (Byron <em>Letters</em> 1: 89n1; St. Clair 353 ; Reiman vii; Scrivener, 
               “Philosopher”
               241–60). Moreover, Byron is connecting Charlotte to Shakespeare’s Shylock, the most
               hated Jew in English literature. Also, Byron’s early lyrics so closely resemble those
               of Charlotte that at least one of her poems was sometimes mistaken for his, namely
               
               “The Mountain Violet.”
               To distance himself from and repudiate a style of poetry he himself practiced and
               for which he was criticized, Byron scapegoats Rosa Matilda, in what Jerome McGann
               aptly calls “a typically Romantic act of displacement” (
               “‘My brain’”
               56).</p>
            <p>Charlotte’s first novel is dedicated to Matthew Lewis (1775–1818), author of <em>The Monk</em>, a scandalous novel even in 1806 when Charlotte’s own novel appears. Lewis was compelled
               to expurgate the first edition of his novel under threat of prosecution for blasphemy
               and obscenity (Gamer 1046). When Byron indicates that it is the first edition of <em>The Monk</em> to which Rosa Matilda has affinity, he is linking her with a notorious breach of
               cultural norms. Moreover, Charlotte’s inserting in the title page a print of her attractive
               physical image provoked at least one reviewer to read it as sexual advertising: “Whether
               Miss Rosa has other views than that of having her poetry admired we cannot say” (Rev.
               of <em>Hours</em> 429). With the <em>Hours of Solitude</em> dedicated to a rich, powerful, older, unmarried man—John Penn, M. P. (1760–1834)—and
               the volume repeatedly reminding the reader of the poet’s youth—twenty-three at the
               time of publication, and much younger for some of the poems—Charlotte communicates
               an ambiguous sexualized message. A woman author can present herself to the public
               in one of several roles: a daughter helping the family (Emma Lyon, <em>Miscellaneous Poems</em> 1812), a mother supporting her children (Charlotte Smith, <em>Elegiac Sonnets</em> 1784), a married woman not writing for money but for the public benefit (Anna Barbauld
               1790s), a genteel woman writing as a “lady” rather than someone needing money (Jane
               Austen). Although an unmarried woman who cannot claim financial necessity can claim
               the status of a Lady, like Jane Austen, Rosa Matilda/Charlotte Dacre is not claiming
               the Lady status and if she is writing for money, the absence of a protecting father
               or husband or brother suggests sexual availability. “John Penn” is a patron figure,
               but he is also a category of man who is neither husband nor family member, hence <em>The British Critic</em>’s reading the book as sexual advertising. Another way to look at Charlotte’s self-fashioning
               is that it was performing a kind of sexual freedom without hypocrisy, a way to break
               down the double standard that allowed men wide parameters for pursuing their desires,
               but prohibited women from doing something similar.</p>
            <p>Her younger sister Sophia, who was married by the time she published her second volume
               of poetry in 1804, establishes a literary lineage like that of her older sister. In
               the prefatory section of <em>Poems, Legendary, Pathetic and Descriptive</em>, she calls attention to her pseudonym Sappho in the newspapers—thus calling to mind
               both the Greek poet and Mary Robinson, famous for her sonnet series in <em>Sappho and Phaon</em> (1796), an inspiring role model for Charlotte (Cross 190–218)—and aligns her work
               with Matthew Lewis’s as well. She describes her poetry thus: <span class="quote">‘Much of this poetry is in the legendary stile. Tales of wonder, and of spectres,
                  have been much in vogue since the poems of Mr. Lewis; and it is hoped therefore that
                  now to offer such to the public, will not be conceived a dereliction from good taste:
                  the fairy world of ghosts, and of magic, offer, without doubt, sublime images in poetry.
                  Amid the horrible, and the extraordinary, the fantastic imagination roves unshackled,
                  free from the more rigid discipline of reason; and perhaps the exuberances of the
                  wildest fancy, may often interest and chain the attention, when the cold, and puerile
                  love-sonnets, and invocations which have deluged the public, may fail of exciting
                  the least notice. (Fortnum) ’</span> Lewis’s <em>Tales of Wonder</em> (1801), a collection of Gothic verse, and a similar volume, <em>Tales of Terror</em> (1801, 1808), have gotten far less attention than canonical texts like <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798, 1800) because Lewis’s volumes were <em>exclusively</em> Gothic. While there are points of contact between Sophia’s “fantastic imagination”
               and Wordsworth/Coleridge’s natural supernaturalism, her preference for unrestrained
               wildness undisciplined by reason has little purchase on the classical tradition, from
               which her kind of Romanticism is an uncompromising departure. Sophia is using Lewis
               to authorize a literature repudiating a certain masculine lyricism—the “cold” and
               “puerile” sonnets. “Cold” suggests lack of passion, and “puerile” suggests immature
               sexuality. Sophia’s manifesto-like preface uses an emancipatory rhetoric of being
               liberated from the shackles of “reason” and being able to freely explore the imagination.
               The Gothic and sentimental literature she celebrates share the virtue of representing
               areas of experience ordinarily neglected by the neoclassical sensibility shaped by
               an Oxbridge education.</p>
            <p>Sophia wrote another manifesto-like preface in 1801, this time introducing—as Sophia
               King, with no attempt to conceal her Jewish identity—a piece of Gothic fiction, <em>The Fatal Secret</em> (1801). In this seven-page statement she complains to the public about her undeserved
               poverty and neglect as a prolific writer of now four novels of meritorious quality;
               she contrasts her own neglect with the success of William Godwin and Matthew Lewis,
               who make use of the Gothic conventions associated with Ann Radcliffe and women’s magic;
               she points to the hypocrisy of decrying the Gothic fiction as unrespectable and morally
               transgressive, while at the same time it provides two male authors—Godwin and Lewis—an
               avenue to fame and fortune. She had visited Godwin, one of her father’s friends, several
               times, usually with her sister, and her mocking tone in discussing him displays her
               fearless attitude in confronting what she considers a double standard, especially
               as Godwin’s <em>St. Leon</em> (1799) was somewhat influenced by Sophia’s own novel, <em>Waldorf</em> (1798). The character Berenza in Charlotte’s <em>Zofloya</em> seems to be a satirical attack on Godwin or Godwinism.</p>
            <p>She begins the preface comparing herself to Job: “‘May mine enemy write a book,’ exclaimed
               Job” (<em>Fatal Secret</em> i). She is referencing the section where the tragic biblical hero argues that if
               he has sinned, then he invites the appropriate punishment, but he is not aware of
               having committed any transgressions. “Oh that one would hear me! Behold, my desire
               <em>is, that</em> the Almighty would answer me, and <em>that</em> mine adversary had written a book” (<em>King James Bible</em>, Job 31.35). Sophia is comparing her own suffering from literary neglect—poverty,
               ill treatment by booksellers and reviewers, isolation, wandering, and the threat of
               prison—to one of the most well-known victims in the Hebrew Bible. The two sisters
               in their Gothic writing make few Christian references, except ones that are unavoidable
               in Gothic writing. She figures the writer as “prowling in melancholy solitude” wandering
               like Cain, with a hateful “mark” that “entails misery” (ii). She compares reviewers
               to “little animals” who survive by eating remnants in the teeth of crocodiles. Contemptuous
               of the literary world that has victimized her, and confident of her own worth, feeling
               she deserves “the civic crown of glory”, this self-assured nineteen-year-old defends
               the Gothic genre—coming from the “glorious Radcliffe” (iv)—while at the same time
               exposing the hypocrisy of a culture that loves to read Gothic, which it also abjects
               as feminine, immoral, and sub-literary. Although men of privilege like Godwin and
               Lewis can shock public opinion with apparent immunity and achieve “the acme of fame,”
               a teenaged woman writer is subject to the double standard.</p>
            <p>Although sister Sophia does not appear in Byron’s writing by name, I assume he read
               her work because of her connection with her sister and from his relationship with
               her father, from whom he borrowed money. The King sisters are unacknowledged influences
               on an important aspect of Byron’s work, the so-called Byronic hero. Sophia’s 1805
               <em>Victor Allen</em>, for example, presents the reader with an anti-hero protagonist, the kind of character
               that became the norm for Byron’s equivocal heroes in the Eastern Tales (1813–16),
               <em>Manfred</em> (1816–17), and <em>Don Juan</em> (1819–24). Sophia’s Victor Allen, through whom the novel is focalized, is a bastard
               and a murderer, but he also provokes the reader’s sympathy as a victim, by being rejected
               unjustly by his father, long before he had committed any anti-social deeds, and pursued
               relentlessly by false reports that ruin his reputation, in a way to remind the reader
               of Godwin’s tragic hero, Caleb Williams, who is tormented by the aristocratic Falkland
               and his agent Gines (<em>Caleb Williams</em> [1794]). The dark-skinned Victor is both Satanic and a victim of prejudice, a pursuer
               of revenge, a sexual adventurer, and a thief, but he is also mocked and humiliated
               as illegitimate, and excluded from any supportive family. He refuses to accept the
               judgment of a society that hates him, much like Frankenstein’s monster. The trope
               of the isolated Satanic hero which Byron employed recurrently appears not just in
               <em>Victor Allen</em>, but explicitly in <em>The Fatal Secret</em>, where the Satanic figure is a woman, the married female protagonist who has adulterous
               desire for someone who turns out to be Satan after she has killed her sister and tried
               to kill her husband. Charlotte used this Satanic trope in her <em>Zofloya</em>, where the protagonist Victoria murders her husband and her rival for the man she
               desires, only to find out that her accomplice and newest object of desire, Zofloya,
               a dark-skinned Moor, is actually Satan, who destroys her at the novel’s end. Anti-heroes
               who challenge the reader’s sympathies are common in Roth’s work, as well as Isaac
               B. Singer’s (1902–91), and in the work of Mendele Moykher Sforim—Mendele the Bookpeddler,
               whose birth name was Sholem Yankev Abramovitsh (1835–1917).</p>
            <p>Unlike the cases of Roth, Mendele, or Singer, the question of the King sisters’ Jewishness
               is not simple because even though both were Sephardic Jews, in their writing the sisters
               only rarely reference things directly Jewish and in their lives they married non-Jews,
               possibly (but not necessarily) converting to the Church of England (on the English
               Sephardim, see Hyamson). Sophia married Charles Fortnum in 1802 when she was about
               twenty, needing father John King to grant permission because she was a minor, and
               with sister Charlotte serving as witness. Charlotte married a Christian, Nicholas
               Byrne, in 1815 when she was about thirty-five, having already had three children with
               him out of wedlock. Both sisters could have followed their father’s example of marrying
               a non-Jew without converting (it was difficult but not impossible at the time). John
               divorced his Jewish wife Sara in 1784, and married the Irish aristocrat Jane Butler,
               countess of Lanesborough (1737–1828) in 1790. When Charlotte had her three children
               baptized in 1811, she herself did not get baptized, an omission that indicates a reluctance
               to leave Judaism. A strong sign of their Jewishness is that Christianity in their
               literature almost never has any spiritual significance, even in Charlotte’s first
               novel, <em>Confessions of the Nun of St. Omer</em> (1805). After her father’s death in 1823 Charlotte and her mother contributed to
               the Sephardic synagogue Bevis Marks to honor John King’s memory, thus indicating her
               connection with the Jewish community, especially as her contribution of fifty pounds
               is signed Rachel Charlotte Rey, her birth name (Scrivener, <em>Jewish Representation</em> 137–58). In sister Sophia’s fourth publication, <em>Victim of Friendship</em> (1801), she includes a warm dedication to her father, whom she acknowledges as the
               only patron who has ever helped her in a substantial way. She explicitly defends John
               King from his “enemies,” thus publicly aligning herself with an embattled and scandal-ridden
               Jewish father, arguably the most well-known Jew in England. Charlotte, despite several
               pseudonyms, was well known as a Jewish woman, especially after Lord Byron outed her
               in his <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em> (1809), as “lovely little Jessica” (Byron <em>Works</em> 1: 413). Jews at the time, as now, had a wide range of positions on their Jewish
               identity, and intermarrying is at one end of the spectrum. The writing of the King
               sisters should be considered Anglo-Jewish, regardless of the paucity of explicit Jewish
               references in the writing itself. A rare instance of a Jewish reference occurs in
               <em>Victor Allen</em> (1805) where the anti-hero protagonist figures himself not just as Satan but, after
               he has exacted revenge on his enemies, as the biblical Samson, having just pulled
               down the pillars on the Philistines (Fortnum II: 152).</p>
            <p>The King sisters are not the only Jewish writers who express Jewishness in oblique
               ways. A modern parallel would be Franz Kafka (1883–1924), one of the most important
               Jewish writers according to Ruth Wisse in her great book on the modern Jewish canon
               (20; 66–86). In Wisse’s admirable book there is, however, little on the Gothic and
               the uncanny, but the King sisters’ work in the Gothic genre is in the Jewish mainstream.
               So many Jewish authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries write about the uncanny,
               demons, golems, dybbuks, angels, magic, and Satan: I. L. Peretz (1852–1915), S. Ansky
               (S. Z. Rappoport 1863–1920), Tony Kushner (<em>Angels in America</em> 1991, <em>The Dybbuk</em> 1997), Michael Chabon (<em>Kavalier and Clay</em> 2000), Isaac Singer (1904–1991), and even the secularist Abraham Cahan (1860–1951),
               whose <em>David Levinsky</em> (1917) refers frequently to the temptations of Satan. Freud’s great essay on the
               uncanny (1919) rests on a Jewish tradition of such literature and folklore, even though
               it focuses explicitly on E. T. A. Hoffmann’s tale 
               “The Sandman”
               (1816). The Gothic permits exploration of psychological depths that usually elude
               the realist tradition. The Gothic is not escapist but designed to articulate truths
               that realism cannot express. The uncanny, according to Freud, is “something which
               ought to have remained hidden but has come to light” as the return of the dead, a
               haunting, a breach in the wall between imagination and reality (142–45). Moreover,
               the uncanny and its Gothic expression illustrate the return of the repressed at not
               just the individual psychological level but also the cultural and political levels
               (Grumberg 1–33).</p>
            <p>There are ways that the King sisters express Jewish themes in their novels and poetry,
               without naming the Jewishness as such. The main trauma for Sephardim was their expulsion
               from Iberia and their constrained lives within Iberia as secret Jews who could be
               exposed and punished at any time by the Inquisition and the political authorities.
               The Inquisition figures in many of the King sisters’ writing, including <em>Zofloya</em>. By now there is a large body of writing based on years of research on transgenerational
               trauma experienced by Jews and other victims of violence and persecution (Schwab 2010).
               One should take for granted that the sisters absorbed the Iberian trauma while they
               were growing up. In <em>Zofloya</em>, for example, the action of the novel starts in the late fifteenth century—when Iberia’s
               Jews were expelled—in Venice, Italy—where many Sephardim escaped to. Venice of course
               is where the most despised Jew in English literature, Shylock, resided. Within the
               first few pages we learn that the aristocratic rule of Venice entails strict authoritarianism,
               including secret trials, torture, and public executions of people suspected of subversive
               opinion (ch. 1). The Loredani family experiences a chain of disasters from outside
               their community, namely from a German Baron who seduces the mother and breaks up the
               family. (The name Loredani suggests Charlotte’s mother’s family, the Laras, as well
               as Radcliffe’s wicked Signora di Laurentini of <em>Mysteries of Udolpho</em> [1794]). Count Ardolf acquired his “depravity” in England and France (ch. 2). Long
               before the reader meets a real “demon” in the person of Zofloya, Ardolf is called
               one (ch. 2), showing the reader that the supernatural is an intensification of human
               qualities, not something utterly remote. The adulterous mother Laurina is called an
               “apostate,” a word ordinarily used in a religious context (ch. 4). The unquestionable
               Gothic villain is Ardolf, but Laurina’s moral status is ambiguous, as she is arguably
               a victim, both conflicted and complicitous. Her outward compliance but inner resistance
               reflect the tragic experience of Iberia’s hidden Jews, appearing in public one way,
               living as Jews secretively. Victoria plays the Gothic heroine role in unusual ways,
               as she is a rebellious daughter, independent minded, capable of escaping her Gothic
               imprisonment (as Jews escaped Iberia), and she initiates a sexual affair with an older
               man who thinks he has seduced her, and this man Berenza—some twenty years her senior
               to the teenager Victoria—is ultimately killed by Victoria when she tires of him and
               prefers someone else. Victoria is powerful, quite a reversal of the Sephardic (woman’s)
               historical experience, but compelling as wish-fulfillment.</p>
            <p>The other Jewish references are considerable. The slippage between Moor and Jew in
               this context is fairly obvious, as both are “defeated” people hunted down by Catholic
               Iberia. Zofloya’s expertise, passed down from ancestors, in herbs, drugs, chemistry
               and medicine (ch. 18) evokes Jewish stereotypes about magic and sorcery (stereotypes
               Walter Scott will connect with Rebecca in <em>Ivanhoe</em> [1819]). Blackness aligned with Jewishness is dramatically illustrated with Victoria
               hating the blonde Lilla, whom Victoria kills with a knife with erotic zeal (ch. 29).
               The relationship between the Moor Zofloya and Victoria is complex, especially as he
               enters her consciousness first in the form of a dream, and he later serves as her
               therapist/analyst/confidant as much as her servant. He seems to be a creation of Victoria’s
               deepest desires rather than some external demon who has invaded her life. Much of
               the novel’s action is in Venice, scene of the most famous Jewish representation in
               English literature. Charlotte herself is a “Jessica,” the Jew’s daughter. Victoria’s
               rage at Berenza for thinking she was not good enough to marry because of her adulterous
               mother (ch. 16) is homologous with Jewish anger at anti-Semitic snobbery. The dichotomy
               of dark Victoria and light Lilla represents an ethnic competition on the level of
               sexual beauty, which is drawn to the reader’s attention with the striking image in
               the title page of a dark-haired “Rosa Matilda” who resembles Victoria, but not in
               any way Lilla.</p>
            <p>The novel intriguingly does not correspond to what Anne Mellor calls a female Romanticism
               accenting women’s self-control and rational restraint to assume leadership in guiding
               the nation toward nonviolent reform (1993, 2000). Although <em>Zofloya</em> and Charlotte King’s other novels follow in some respects what Mellor calls a masculine
               Romanticism of unrestrained individualistic rebellion linked with an emancipation
               of the imagination, Charlotte’s fiction does not follow the didactic model of Wollstonecraft.
               As Kim Ian Michasiw points out, Charlotte’s writing assumes the stance of neither
               the “proper lady” nor “didactic maternalism,” two major options women writers take
               in the Romantic era (vii-xxx).</p>
            <p>To conclude, I would like to refer back to the paternal grandfather of Charlotte and
               Sophia King, Moses Rey (d. 1764), dressed up like a Turkish “Sultan” and supplied
               coffee-house patrons “from Cornhill to Charing-cross” with “cane-strings, c--d--ms,
               sealing wax, and bawdy books.” As a boy John King doubled the profits of his North
               African-born father by selling candy made by his mother (<em>Authentic Memoirs</em> 27–28). I am using this vignette to connect the commercial theatricality of poor
               Jews who sold goods on the street to literary theatricality. The grandfather’s role-playing
               to please an audience eager for sweets and sex is not unlike what his literary granddaughters
               did as writers, who from a Sephardic subject position fashioned Gothic fiction and
               lyrical poetry for readers eager for sensational literature dealing with sex, violence,
               magic, the uncanny, and extreme emotions.</p>
