            </header>
            <p class="noCount">Nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish literature engages a wide range of thematic and aesthetic
               preoccupations. This volume brings together several essays that highlight such breadth,
               even as the essays converge upon several questions that recur consistently throughout
               this literature: what does it mean to advertise oneâ€™s subjectivity, especially where
               the expression of such subjectivity is inflected by aesthetic and formalist concerns
               that are historically connected to English nationalism? Such questions are especially
               relevant when considered alongside the historical context: Jews in England did not
               achieve political emancipation until 1858, and they were widely regarded as racially
               other for much of the century. Jewish writers do not answer such questions with one
               voice; however, their political and cultural contexts put pressure on their aesthetic
               choices, and we explore these choices in the essays that follow.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="noCount">This volume was designed and encoded at the University of Colorado, Boulder by Cayla
               Eagon, Site Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. The banner image includes a portrait of "Rosa Matilda" by Adam Buck, from the Victoria
               and Albert Museum, London; a portrait of Grace Aguilar by J. Cochran, from the Jewish
               Museum, London; and a portrait of Israel Zangwill by Walter Richard Sickert from the
               Scottish National Gallery Of Modern Art, Edinburgh. The initial transformation from
               WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</a> tool, with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders
               text in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell
               and Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided
               by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML.</p>

            </header>
            <p class="noCount">The <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> is devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation
               of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation
               of Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <em>RCPS</em> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand,
               dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other,
               retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions
               of today. <em>RCPS</em> is committed to mapping out this terrain with the best and most exciting critical
               writing of contemporary Romanticist scholarship.</p>
