               <head>About this Volume</head>
               <p rend="noCount">Nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish literature engages a wide range of
                    thematic and aesthetic preoccupations. This volume brings together several
                    essays that highlight such breadth, even as the essays converge upon several
                    questions that recur consistently throughout this literature: what does it mean
                    to advertise one’s subjectivity, especially where the expression of such
                    subjectivity is inflected by aesthetic and formalist concerns that are
                    historically connected to English nationalism? Such questions are especially
                    relevant when considered alongside the historical context: Jews in England did
                    not achieve political emancipation until 1858, and they were widely regarded as
                    racially other for much of the century. Jewish writers do not answer such
                    questions with one voice; however, their political and cultural contexts put
                    pressure on their aesthetic choices, and we explore these choices in the essays
                    that follow.</p>

               <head>About the Design and Markup</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> This volume was designed and encoded at the University of
                    Colorado, Boulder by Cayla Eagon, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic
                        Circles</title>. The banner image includes a portrait of "Rosa Matilda" by Adam Buck,
                    from the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; a portrait of Grace Aguilar by J. Cochran,
                    from the Jewish Museum, London; and a portrait of Israel Zangwill by Walter Richard Sickert
                    from the Scottish National Gallery Of Modern Art, Edinburgh. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using
                    the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with
                    further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text
                    in archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and
                    Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided
                    by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to
                    convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

               <head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</head>
               <p rend="noCount"> The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is
                    devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
                    investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of
                    Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated
                    domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual
                    terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period
                    and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a
                    vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of
                    today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain
                    with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
                    scholarship.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish literature engages a wide range of
                    thematic and aesthetic preoccupations. This volume brings together several
                    essays that highlight such breadth, even as the essays converge upon several
                    questions that recur consistently throughout this literature: what does it mean
                    to advertise one’s subjectivity, especially where the expression of such
                    subjectivity is inflected by aesthetic and formalist concerns that are
                    historically connected to English nationalism? Such questions are especially
                    relevant when considered alongside the historical context: Jews in England did
                    not achieve political emancipation until 1858, and they were widely regarded as
                    racially other for much of the century. Jewish writers do not answer such
                    questions with one voice; however, their political and cultural contexts put
                    pressure on their aesthetic choices, and we explore these choices in the essays
                    that follow.</p>

               <p> This <title level="j">Praxis</title> volume brings together essays about
                    Anglo-Jewish culture of the nineteenth century. This simple description,
                    however, belies some significant problems in classification, and indeed, it is
                    this very complexity about classification that unites these essays. For the very
                    meaning of “Anglo-Jewish” is no less conflicted than the definition of
                    “culture.” Indeed, we may well ask: who qualifies for the designation of
                    “Anglo-Jewish”? Does the hyphen always apply to English writers who happen to be
                    born as Jews? What if they do not directly or explicitly explore Jewish themes
                    in their works, or if they do not explicitly self-identify as Jews or maintain
                    any semblance of direct Jewish communal life? When mainstream authors engage
                    themes with pronounced Jewish inflections, are they participating in a
                    burgeoning Jewish culture? And what counts as a “Jewish inflection” in the first
                    place? All of the essays in this volume engage the complexity of this delicate
                    process of self-identification, and indeed of communal identification. The field
                    of Anglo-Jewish nineteenth-century literature has been gaining traction of late,
                    and the time has come to explore authors and subjects that sometimes skirt the
                    margins of the field. </p>
               <p> The questions about Jews and nineteenth-century literature are essentially
                    questions about Romanticism and modernity. As such, these essays span such
                    topics as aesthetic form and Jewish cultural inheritance; experimentation with
                    narrative structure in novels and fictional prose; ethics and morality; and
                    theories of cultural, religious, and aesthetic inheritance. What we call “Jewish
                    cultural inheritance,” however, is not reducible to a totalizing definition, and
                    it is perhaps for this very reason that the study of Anglo-Jewish culture throws
                    into sharp relief some of the most pressing questions relevant to the very
                    intricate nineteenth century more generally: how do we define our cultural
                    inheritance, and what is at stake in so doing? How far can we go in designating
                    literary or cultural “influence” without falling prey to oversimplifications
                    about cultural transmission? How do we demarcate and circumscribe our selective
                    attention in defining the shifting boundaries of center and margin? To what
                    degree do racial, ethnic, and religious categories inflect inherited aesthetic
                    norms? When Meri-Jane Rochelson, for example, examines a later
                    nineteenth-century novel set in Romantic-era England, its analytic yield
                    includes clarity about social criticism whose provenance—and
                    influence—spans centuries and cultures. All the same, <title level="m">The
                        King of Schnorrers</title> (1894), the novel by Israel Zangwill that she
                    subjects to such multi-faceted scrutiny, begins with a satiric overview of a
                    setting that heralds a very knowing Jewish narrator: “In the days when Lord
                    George Gordon became a Jew, and was suspected of insanity; when, out of respect
                    for the prophecies, England denied her Jews every civic right except that of
                    paying taxes . . .” (1). </p>

                    increased through the nineteenth century, agitation for relief from the Jewish
                    civil and political disabilities became an increasingly public concern. These
                    included, among other disabilities, an inability to vote or to trade in the City
                    and on the Exchange, and exclusion from membership in Parliament. Jews could not
                    officially own freehold land, but since law tended to follow precedent in the
                    matter of Jewish disabilities, and since some wealthy Jews in England did indeed
                    hold land, this restriction was abandoned in the 1840s. In the early part of the
                    nineteenth century, Jews were excluded from most professions and corporations,
                    since they required swearing allegiance to the articles of the Church of
                    England.</p>
               <p>These disabilities notwithstanding, British Jews in the nineteenth century tended
                    to recognize England as a land that had granted them freedom, and political and
                    social refuge. After all, the Portuguese Inquisition, from which many Jews fled
                    to England, was not disbanded until 1821. The characteristic stance of British
                    Jews throughout the nineteenth century was one of gratitude for safe haven, even
                    when they acknowledged the significance of their restrictions, one of which was
                    represented by their exclusion from study and later from fellowship at England's
                    ancient universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, a condition that was not
                    remedied until 1871 with the passage of the Universities Tests Act. </p>
               <p> The Jewish civil disabilities are by no means the sole defining or even the most
                    important context for Jews in the nineteenth century. Especially in comparison
                    with most of their coreligionists on the continent, English Jews occupied an
                    enviable position of wellbeing. For England, national Christianity was defined
                    by the Church of England. Penal law had enacted civil disabilities against
                    Protestant Nonconformists and Catholics in the seventeenth century with the goal
                    of ensuring that municipal, civil, or military office be held only by members of
                    the Church of England. In 1828 Parliament easily passed the Sacramental Test
                    Act, which repealed the Test and Corporation Acts for Nonconformists.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a helpful summary, see Michie, <title level="a">

                    received emancipation in 1829 with the passage of the Catholic Relief Act. This
                    left only the Jews still subject to the civil disabilities. Oaths “on the true
                    faith of a Christian” were still mandatory. When the Jewish Relief Bill of 1830
                    failed to pass Parliament, the Jews, as Michael Clark observes, “were now no
                    longer part of a broad excluded group but a deliberately stigmatized community;
                    the only politically disadvantaged minority in Britain” (31). One of the Jewish
                    community's leaders, Francis Goldsmid, referred to the bill's failure as a
                    “badge of dishonour” (34). </p>
               <p> The invective raised against Jews whenever their statutory rights were addressed
                    tended to be registered as invective against Jews as Jews, not simply as persons
                    who subscribe to a faith other than the Church of England. The condition of the
                    Jews in England, that is, was not analogous to that of Nonconformists or
                    Catholics. Indeed, the subject of nationalism for British Jewish subjects was
                    never an elementary affair. An earlier controversy also bears relevance to this
                    history. I refer to the Jewish Naturalization Bill of 1753, the so-called “Jew
                    Bill” that was in fact repealed almost immediately after it was passed. It
                    produced one of the most fiery political clamors of the eighteenth century, and
                    some of its resonances were felt into the nineteenth century. The Jew Bill
                    sought to change the constitutional requirements that would grant Parliament the
                    right to confer naturalization for professing Jews; this process could only have
                    been granted, however, through a private act of Parliament, an expensive and
                    inevitably rare prospective occurrence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See

                    and religious clamor of the eighteenth century. It was quickly repealed before
                    ever once being resorted to, and still its tremors raged. Eventually the storm
                    died down, with very little real political fallout.</p>
               <p>The storm may well have died down, but it remained a point of reference for Jews
                    even a century later. As Todd Endelman describes it, <quote> . . . opponents of
                        the act resurrected crude medieval libels and made extravagant claims about
                        the consequences of the legislation. Britain would be swamped with
                        unscrupulous brokers, jobbers, and moneylenders, who would use their
                        ill-gotten gains to acquire the estates of ruined landowners. Moreover,
                        because dominion followed property, Jews would control Parliament (which
                        would be re-named the Sanhedrin), convert St. Paul's to a synagogue,
                        circumcise their tenants, and perpetrate countless other anti-Christian
                        crimes. (<title level="m">Jews of Britain</title> 75) </quote> England may
                    well have been enjoying a time of relative tranquility in the eighteenth
                    century, but a noisy, reactive din presented itself in the 1750s when it was
                    presumed that the Jew could present himself for citizenship. While the
                    nineteenth century did realize some significant gains in the acceptance of Jews
                    as part of the British polity, Jews were frequently reminded of the tenuous
                    nature of their absorption within England’s self-definition.</p>
               <p> Such is the historical context in which nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish
                    literature takes its place. It is a literature that does not respond with a
                    single voice to its antecedents. This volume therefore seeks to provide
                    representative examples of poetry and prose that span the entire century. Jews
                    found their way into sundry forms and genres even when such aesthetic
                    inheritances could be complicated within a Jewish refraction. It is these
                    nuanced appropriations of aesthetic categories, and the questions they raise,
                    that inspire the essays that follow. Indeed, the very title of Michael
                    Scrivener’s article highlights the urgency of such questions to our very
                    understanding of mainstream culture: <title level="a">Situating the King Sisters
                        within Literary Tradition.</title> Scrivener’s argument sustains a bold
                    claim, and his argument surveys a vast array of cultural kinds, with special
                    attention given to the Gothic, Della Cruscan, the erotic and the popular. The
                    latter reflect the contributions of Charlotte King (better known as Charlotte
                    Dacre) and Sophia King, daughters of John “Jew” King (1753–1823), infamous
                    moneylender and stern critic of political convention. For Scrivener, we ignore
                    such authors at our peril, for the work of Charlotte and Sophia King was central
                    to such high canonical authors as Shelley and Byron. More urgently, Scrivener is
                    the first critic to read the King sisters in terms of mainstream and Jewish
                    traditions, a brilliantly audacious argument to make about authors who do not
                    directly address exclusively Jewish themes in their work. Although both
                    Charlotte and Sophia married outside of the Jewish faith and did not describe
                    themselves as Jewish authors, Scrivener subtly reads their work and their
                    self-representations in terms of a self-conscious theatricality. Some aspects of
                    that theatricality reflect a kind of sublimated Jewish self-consciousness.
                    Performing daring roles, including sexual ones, they seek to overcome the
                    pejorative associations with their father, whose notoriety as “Jew King” was
                    never detached from his putative embodiment of stereotypical Jewish
                    characteristics. To read Charlotte and Sophia King, then, is to become oriented
                    to a formative expression of British Romanticism that, for Scrivener, finds its
                    ground in a vexed Jewish self-identification.</p>
               <p> Heidi Kaufman takes up the author Maria Polack, often identified as the first
                    Jewish woman novelist, and her novel <title level="m">Fiction Without
                        Romance</title> (1830). Romance has been a key term in the newly established
                    scholarly field of nineteenth-century Jewish fiction; as Michael Galchinsky has
                    pointed out, romance is a genre well suited to nineteenth-century Jewish women
                    novelists who sought to counter Christian conversionist texts. Such authors
                    could also mobilize the features of romance fiction to address their own
                    frustrations over their coreligionists’ treatment of women in communal life. As
                    Kaufman points out, however, Polack’s novel is situated in a rural community,
                    and its heroine is a Christian Protestant who undergoes a specifically Christian
                    education in a pastoral setting. Polack’s concerns in this novel focus primarily
                    on morality and education as they are found in English society. The question
                    begs itself: why would an urban Jewish writer engage such thematic
                    preoccupations? Does this text properly belong to a tradition of Jewish
                    literature? To be sure, the novel does include minor plots involving Jewish and
                    Catholic elements, but Eliza Desbro, the Christian protagonist, exemplifies a
                    successful process of Christian moral education. Does Polack even have cultural
                    standing to wield such literary types? Kaufman’s nuanced reading of the
                    situation sees Polack as finally appropriating the demands of the romance genre
                    to produce a new form of literary realism. This is a concern that dates back to
                    the 1790s, and to those authors who sought to transcend the restrictions of
                    romance by sustaining a steady gaze on historical reality. The historical
                    reality inhabited by Maria Polack is one in which assimilation to dominant norms
                    is an imperative with which Jews and Christians alike must contend. Kaufman’s
                    project, then, seeks to extend the reach of Anglo-Jewish literature in the
                    nineteenth century by reading its crossing of boundaries, both religious and
                    culture. Ultimately, for an Anglo-Jewish writer to cross boundaries in this
                    manner is for her to instantiate an Anglo-Jewish identity. </p>
               <p> Sarah Gracombe reads the appropriations of the biblical Ruth by various authors,
                    and while she does give due attention to Grace Aguilar, the Anglo-Jewish author,
                    she also casts a wide net, one that includes Keats, Thomas Hood, and others.
                    This stands as an important contribution to the study of Jewish representations
                    in English literary history, for Gracombe engages the subjects of geographical
                    territory and historical alienation as lyrical tropes that are refracted through
                    the prism of the historical Jew in nineteenth-century England. The Bethlehem of
                    the biblical Ruth, after all, tended in this century to be conflated with
                    England, and the land of England was increasingly defined in terms of its own
                    self-differentiation from its alien others. Gracombe gauges highly nuanced
                    interpretations of the Jewish resonance across a variety of nineteenth-century
                    poems. The biblical Ruth, perhaps Judaism’s most famous convert, stands, in
                    Keats’s celebrated formulation in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title>
                    “amid the alien corn.” Even with the love and reassurance of her mother-in-law,
                    indeed she stands “sick for home.” The biblical Ruth makes appearances in Blake,
                    in Thomas Hood, in Felicia Hemans, and in texts from many other
                    nineteenth-century authors, and these appearances are often refracted through a
                    cultural interpretation of the Jew within the English nation. Gracombe reminds
                    us that Ruth as psychological other, as outcast, is not merely theoretical or
                    historical; indeed, she joins the variously lyricized Ruths to the sociological,
                    political, and historical discussions about English nationhood. Could Jews
                    presume to embody Englishness? What do mainstream English authors imagine when
                    they imagine a Jewish woman calibrating the extent of her alienation? </p>
               <p> With Meri-Jane Rochelson’s essay on Israel Zangwill, we move finally to the end
                    of the century, one in which the Jewish population in England has exploded to
                    more than a quarter of a million, and Jewish civil and political disabilities
                    have been fully abolished. Zangwill, as Rochelson points out, was “the
                    best-known Jew in the Anglophone world” at the end of the nineteenth century,
                    and he enjoyed status as a genuine literary celebrity. Rochelson takes as her
                    example Zangwill’s novel <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> (1894),
                    a work of comedy set in late-eighteenth-century England that manages to train a
                    steady and critical eye on the social experience of the Jew in England.
                    Serialized in <title level="j">The Idler</title>, the work boldly stakes a claim
                    to the cultural authority of English letters; as such, Zangwill seeks to
                    naturalize Jewish life for high culture. To <foreign xml:lang="de">schnor</foreign> is to inveigle funds from another person, and in a wry
                    Foreword to one of the reprints in 1894, Zangwill avers of the <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorrer</foreign> that he “is as unique among beggars as
                    Israel among nations” (v). What does such “uniqueness” mean when studied against
                    the ever-increasing numbers of Jews in England? Indeed, what does publicly
                    displayed Jewish wit over Jewish idiosyncrasies portend in a world still anxious
                    about immigration, aliens, and otherness? For as Rochelson argues, <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> exists outside of the boundaries of
                    respectable society, and yet Zangwill represents it, and its concomitant wit,
                    learning, creativity, <emph>and</emph> instability, as essential to the reality
                    of social functioning. It is no surprise, then, that Zangwill attained near
                    heroic stature among immigrant east-end London Jews.</p>
               <p> If <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> echoes the historical, political
                    effort to take what one rightfully deserves, then Zangwill’s effort to put
                    Jewish <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> on public display in a
                    mainstream publication begs larger questions. What is the relationship of Jewish
                    self-representations to the ways in which Jews tended to be defined within
                    mainstream culture? Perhaps more pressing is the dynamic that this volume as a
                    whole seeks to throw into relief: our aesthetic and cultural norms exist in a
                    delicate balance with their diffusion through the broadest cultural history. A
                    robust engagement with nineteenth-century literature marries depth to
                    breadth.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Although critics have studied extensively the Gothic writings of
                    Charlotte Dacre (Rey, King, Rosa Matilda), they have rarely discussed her work
                    as Jewish writing, and they have largely ignored the poetry and fiction of her
                    younger sister Sophia King (Fortnum). In fact, both sisters, daughters of
                    perhaps the most well-known Jew in England at the time, John King (Rey), never
                    severed connections with their father and wrote both directly and obliquely as
                    Jewish women; moreover, they were read as Jewish women. The historical trauma of
                    the Jewish expulsion from Iberia and the persecution by the Inquisition is
                    reflected in the writings of these Sephardic women. Fearlessly innovating within
                    the Gothic, sentimental, and philosophical traditions of writing, they also
                    subversively played against sexual stereotypes, linking their work to women like
                    Aphra Behn and Eliza Haywood, and anticipating the sexually explicit work of
                    Philip Roth and I. B. Singer. Moreover, their use of the supernatural draws upon
                    Jewish traditions of dybbuks and demons in the past and in the future. Reading
                    the work of Charlotte Dacre and Sophia King re-inscribes the importance of
                    Jewish contexts within Romantic aesthetics.</p>

               <p>Although accomplished literary scholars have written about the fiction and poetry of
                Charlotte (1781/82–1826) and Sophia King (1782–after 1805), the daughters of John
                “Jew” King (1753–1823; see Endelman), they rarely have read the King sisters in
                terms of a Jewish tradition of writing. Adriana Craciun, Diane Hoeveler, Lisa
                Wilson, Ann Jones, and others have written perceptively about Charlotte’s work, only
                rarely about Sophia, so that at least Charlotte is fairly well known, at least to
                scholars of the Gothic. The sisters’ work, however, is part of Jewish literature,
                even though the most obvious and immediate influences of the sisters, especially
                Charlotte, were on Byron and P. B. Shelley. I will show a circuitous route of
                connection between the sisters and modern Jewish literature, and I will illustrate
                the ways their work is meaningfully Jewish. </p>
               <p>Philip Roth’s postmodernist playing with his own identity in his fiction with the
                Zuckerman series and other novels harkens back to Lord Byron’s similar but Romantic
                playing with his own identity in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, and other poems.
                Some critics such as the British-American novelist Benjamin Markovits (2011, 2018)
                have drawn the connection between Roth (1933–2018) and Byron (1788–1824), and
                between Byron and the protagonist David Lurie, a secular Jew, in John Coetzee’s
                <title level="m">Disgrace</title> (1999), a novel that evokes both Roth and Byron. The
                daughters of John “Jew” King had a deep if rarely acknowledged influence on the
                noble poet. Charlotte’s
                <title level="m">Hours of Solitude</title> (1805) led to Byron’s
                <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title> (1807), not just in the similarity of
                titles but in the sentimental and Della Cruscan style of both volumes. Also, the
                connection between Byron and modern writers like Roth and Coetzee entails a thematic
                preoccupation with sex that is a primary focus in their work. Roth acquired a
                notoriety not just for satirizing aspects of contemporary Jewish life, but
                especially for his representations of sex. While it might seem to some that Roth’s
                focus on sex is radically new, in fact there is a tradition of Jewish writers
                preoccupied in similar ways. The King sisters were pioneers in this area. They drew
                upon not just Mary Robinson (1758–1800) and her theatrical display of her beauty and
                her use of various pseudonyms, but also the Restoration/early eighteenth-century
                writing by women like Aphra Behn (1640–89) and Eliza Haywood (1693–1756). Haywood’s
                <title level="m">Fantomina</title> (1725), whose heroine displays inventive sexual
                initiative in her pursuit of the man she wants, seems like a precursor of
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title> (1806) and Charlotte’s other novels. The King
                sisters’ poetry and fiction are filled with illicit desires and transgressive sexual
                activity, often by women and from a woman’s perspective. One thinks of Virgina
                Woolf’s essay <title level="a">Professions for Women</title> (1931), where she
                acknowledges the taboo area
                of women writing about their authentic desires. Both Charlotte and Sophia wrote
                extensively about women characters struggling with desires that violated social
                norms. The young Jewish women deepened a sexual focus in their work rather than
                disguised it, and they resisted the ascendant prudish norm (for the norm, see
                Poovey), perhaps because, as socially marginal young women, they could be daring,
                especially with the example of their father in mind, a Jew who survived and thrived
                despite hostile public opinion and legal problems. Also they could use the notorious
                precedent of Lewis’s <title level="m">Monk</title> (1796) to expose the hypocrisy of a
                sexual double standard. Unlike Byron’s or Roth’s male characters, the Kings’ female
                characters paid a much heavier price than similar male characters ever paid for
                similar activities. </p>
               <p>Another aspect of Byronism prominent in Roth’s work is theatrical role playing so
                that the author intentionally suggests a connection, whether true or not, between
                him and his characters (on theatricality in late-eighteenth century England, see
                Pascoe). Charlotte was a practiced disguiser and revealer of her own identity and
                autobiography in her poetry and fiction, using pseudonyms such as Rosa Matilda, to
                evoke the associations with Matthew Lewis’s villain Rosario, who appears to be a
                young man, but who is actually a woman named Matilda, who seduces the monk Ambrosio
                and turns him to the dark side. She further obscured her real identity by using
                Charlotte Dacre as her “real” name, to which she attached an engraved image of
                herself on the title page, an image of a pretty dark-haired young woman wearing a
                close-fitting, low-cut dress. It was not usual for women writers to present
                themselves to the reading public with a sexy portrait of themselves (Mary Robinson
                excepted). Byron, in a characteristically High Romantic move, satirizes Charlotte’s
                poetry and fiction dismissively in <title level="m">British Bards and Scottish
                    Reviewers</title> (1809), as though he himself were not a student of her writing. A
                note appended to the second edition of <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch
                    Reviewers</title> where “Rosa Matilda” receives fourteen lines (756–64, 926–30)
                reads as follows:

                Anyone capable of connecting the dots would realize that Charlotte Dacre, Rosa

                241–60). Moreover, Byron is connecting Charlotte to Shakespeare’s Shylock, the most
                hated Jew in English literature. Also, Byron’s early lyrics so closely resemble
                those of Charlotte that at least one of her poems was sometimes mistaken for his,
                namely <title level="a">The Mountain Violet.</title> To distance himself from and repudiate a style of
                poetry he himself practiced and for which he was criticized, Byron scapegoats Rosa
                Matilda, in what Jerome McGann aptly calls “a typically Romantic act of
                displacement” (<title level="a">‘My brain’</title> 56). </p>
               <p>Charlotte’s first novel is dedicated to Matthew Lewis (1775–1818), author of
                <title level="m">The Monk</title>, a scandalous novel even in 1806 when Charlotte’s
                own novel appears. Lewis was compelled to expurgate the first edition of his novel
                under threat of prosecution for blasphemy and obscenity (Gamer 1046). When Byron
                indicates that it is the first edition of <title level="m">The Monk</title> to which
                Rosa Matilda has affinity, he is linking her with a notorious breach of cultural
                norms. Moreover, Charlotte’s inserting in the title page a print of her attractive
                physical image provoked at least one reviewer to read it as sexual advertising:
                “Whether Miss Rosa has other views than that of having her poetry admired we cannot
                say” (Rev. of <title level="m">Hours</title> 429). With the
                <title level="m">Hours of Solitude</title> dedicated to a rich, powerful, older,
                unmarried man—John Penn, M. P. (1760–1834)—and the volume repeatedly reminding the
                reader of the poet’s youth—twenty-three at the time of publication, and much younger
                for some of the poems—Charlotte communicates an ambiguous sexualized message. A
                woman author can present herself to the public in one of several roles: a daughter
                helping the family (Emma Lyon, <title level="m">Miscellaneous Poems</title> 1812), a
                mother supporting her children (Charlotte Smith, <title level="m">Elegiac
                    Sonnets</title> 1784), a married woman not writing for money but for the public
                benefit (Anna Barbauld 1790s), a genteel woman writing as a “lady” rather than
                someone needing money (Jane Austen). Although an unmarried woman who cannot claim
                financial necessity can claim the status of a Lady, like Jane Austen, Rosa
                Matilda/Charlotte Dacre is not claiming the Lady status and if she is writing for
                money, the absence of a protecting father or husband or brother suggests sexual
                availability. “John Penn” is a patron figure, but he is also a category of man who
                is neither husband nor family member, hence <title level="m">The British
                    Critic</title>’s reading the book as sexual advertising. Another way to look at
                Charlotte’s self-fashioning is that it was performing a kind of sexual freedom
                without hypocrisy, a way to break down the double standard that allowed men wide
                parameters for pursuing their desires, but prohibited women from doing something
                similar. </p>
               <p> Her younger sister Sophia, who was married by the time she published her second
                volume of poetry in 1804, establishes a literary lineage like that of her older
                sister. In the prefatory section of <title level="m">Poems, Legendary, Pathetic and
                Descriptive</title>, she calls attention to her pseudonym Sappho in the
                newspapers—thus calling to mind both the Greek poet and Mary Robinson, famous for
                her sonnet series in <title level="m">Sappho and Phaon</title> (1796), an inspiring
                role model for Charlotte (Cross 190–218)—and aligns her work with Matthew Lewis’s as
                well. She describes her poetry thus:
                <quote>
                Much of this poetry is in the legendary stile. Tales of wonder, and of spectres, have
                been much in vogue since the poems of Mr. Lewis; and it is hoped therefore that now
                to offer such to the public, will not be conceived a dereliction from good taste:
                the fairy world of ghosts, and of magic, offer, without doubt, sublime images in
                poetry. Amid the horrible, and the extraordinary, the fantastic imagination roves
                unshackled, free from the more rigid discipline of reason; and perhaps the
                exuberances of the wildest fancy, may often interest and chain the attention, when
                the cold, and puerile love-sonnets, and invocations which have deluged the public,
                may fail of exciting the least notice. (Fortnum)
                </quote>
                Lewis’s <title level="m">Tales of Wonder</title> (1801), a collection of Gothic verse,
                and a similar volume, <title level="m">Tales of Terror</title> (1801, 1808), have
                gotten far less attention than canonical texts like <title level="m">Lyrical
                Ballads</title> (1798, 1800) because Lewis’s volumes were <emph>exclusively</emph>
                Gothic. While there are points of contact between Sophia’s
                “fantastic imagination” and Wordsworth/Coleridge’s natural supernaturalism, her
                preference for unrestrained wildness undisciplined by reason has little purchase on
                the classical tradition, from which her kind of Romanticism is an uncompromising
                departure. Sophia is using Lewis to authorize a literature repudiating a certain
                masculine lyricism—the “cold” and “puerile” sonnets. “Cold”
                suggests lack of passion, and “puerile” suggests immature
                sexuality. Sophia’s manifesto-like preface uses an emancipatory rhetoric of being
                liberated from the shackles of “reason” and being able to freely explore the
                imagination. The Gothic and sentimental literature she celebrates share the virtue
                of representing areas of experience ordinarily neglected by the neoclassical
                sensibility shaped by an Oxbridge education. </p>
               <p> Sophia wrote another manifesto-like preface in 1801, this time introducing—as Sophia
                King, with no attempt to conceal her Jewish identity—a piece of Gothic fiction,
                <title level="m">The Fatal Secret</title> (1801). In this seven-page statement she
                complains to the public about her undeserved poverty and neglect as a prolific
                writer of now four novels of meritorious quality; she contrasts her own neglect with
                the success of William Godwin and Matthew Lewis, who make use of the Gothic
                conventions associated with Ann Radcliffe and women’s magic; she points to the
                hypocrisy of decrying the Gothic fiction as unrespectable and morally transgressive,
                while at the same time it provides two male authors—Godwin and Lewis—an avenue to
                fame and fortune. She had visited Godwin, one of her father’s friends, several
                times, usually with her sister, and her mocking tone in discussing him displays her
                fearless attitude in confronting what she considers a double standard, especially as
                Godwin’s <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799) was somewhat influenced by Sophia’s
                own novel, <title level="m">Waldorf</title> (1798). The character Berenza in
                Charlotte’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title> seems to be a satirical attack on Godwin
                or Godwinism.</p>
               <p>She begins the preface comparing herself to Job: “‘May mine enemy write a book,’
                exclaimed Job” (<title level="m">Fatal Secret</title> i). She is referencing the
                section where the tragic biblical hero argues that if he has sinned, then he invites
                the appropriate punishment, but he is not aware of having committed any
                transgressions. “Oh that one would hear me! Behold, my desire <emph>is,
                    that</emph> the Almighty would answer me, and <emph>that</emph> mine
                adversary had written a book” (<title level="m">King James Bible</title>, Job 31.35).
                Sophia is comparing her own suffering from literary neglect—poverty, ill treatment
                by booksellers and reviewers, isolation, wandering, and the threat of prison—to one
                of the most well-known victims in the Hebrew Bible. The two sisters in their Gothic
                writing make few Christian references, except ones that are unavoidable in Gothic
                writing. She figures the writer as “prowling in melancholy solitude” wandering like
                Cain, with a hateful “mark” that “entails misery” (ii). She compares reviewers to
                “little animals” who survive by eating remnants in the teeth of crocodiles.
                Contemptuous of the literary world that has victimized her, and confident of her own
                worth, feeling she deserves “the civic crown of glory”, this self-assured
                nineteen-year-old defends the Gothic genre—coming from the “glorious Radcliffe”
                (iv)—while at the same time exposing the hypocrisy of a culture that loves to read
                Gothic, which it also abjects as feminine, immoral, and sub-literary. Although men
                of privilege like Godwin and Lewis can shock public opinion with apparent immunity
                and achieve “the acme of fame,” a teenaged woman writer is subject to the double
                standard.</p>
               <p>Although sister Sophia does not appear in Byron’s writing by name, I assume he read
                her work because of her connection with her sister and from his relationship with
                her father, from whom he borrowed money. The King sisters are unacknowledged
                influences on an important aspect of Byron’s work, the so-called Byronic hero.
                Sophia’s 1805 <title level="m">Victor Allen</title>, for example, presents the reader
                with an anti-hero protagonist, the kind of character that became the norm for
                Byron’s equivocal heroes in the Eastern Tales (1813–16), <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (1816–17), and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819–24). Sophia’s
                Victor Allen, through whom the novel is focalized, is a bastard and a murderer, but
                he also provokes the reader’s sympathy as a victim, by being rejected unjustly by
                his father, long before he had committed any anti-social deeds, and pursued
                relentlessly by false reports that ruin his reputation, in a way to remind the
                reader of Godwin’s tragic hero, Caleb Williams, who is tormented by the aristocratic
                Falkland and his agent Gines (<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> [1794]). The
                dark-skinned Victor is both Satanic and a victim of prejudice, a pursuer of revenge,
                a sexual adventurer, and a thief, but he is also mocked and humiliated as
                illegitimate, and excluded from any supportive family. He refuses to accept the
                judgment of a society that hates him, much like Frankenstein’s monster. The trope of
                the isolated Satanic hero which Byron employed recurrently appears not just in
                <title level="m">Victor Allen</title>, but explicitly in <title level="m">The Fatal
                Secret</title>, where the Satanic figure is a woman, the married female protagonist
                who has adulterous desire for someone who turns out to be Satan after she has killed
                her sister and tried to kill her husband. Charlotte used this Satanic trope in her
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title>, where the protagonist Victoria murders her
                husband and her rival for the man she desires, only to find out that her accomplice
                and newest object of desire, Zofloya, a dark-skinned Moor, is actually Satan, who
                destroys her at the novel’s end. Anti-heroes who challenge the reader’s sympathies
                are common in Roth’s work, as well as Isaac B. Singer’s (1902–91), and in the work
                of Mendele Moykher Sforim—Mendele the Bookpeddler, whose birth name was Sholem
                Yankev Abramovitsh (1835–1917).</p>
               <p>Unlike the cases of Roth, Mendele, or Singer, the question of the King sisters’
                Jewishness is not simple because even though both were Sephardic Jews, in their
                writing the sisters only rarely reference things directly Jewish and in their lives
                they married non-Jews, possibly (but not necessarily) converting to the Church of
                England (on the English Sephardim, see Hyamson). Sophia married Charles Fortnum in
                1802 when she was about twenty, needing father John King to grant permission because
                she was a minor, and with sister Charlotte serving as witness. Charlotte married a
                Christian, Nicholas Byrne, in 1815 when she was about thirty-five, having already
                had three children with him out of wedlock. Both sisters could have followed their
                father’s example of marrying a non-Jew without converting (it was difficult but not
                impossible at the time). John divorced his Jewish wife Sara in 1784, and married the
                Irish aristocrat Jane Butler, countess of Lanesborough (1737–1828) in 1790. When
                Charlotte had her three children baptized in 1811, she herself did not get baptized,
                an omission that indicates a reluctance to leave Judaism. A strong sign of their
                Jewishness is that Christianity in their literature almost never has any spiritual
                significance, even in Charlotte’s first novel, <title level="m">Confessions of the
                Nun of St. Omer</title> (1805). After her father’s death in 1823 Charlotte and her
                mother contributed to the Sephardic synagogue Bevis Marks to honor John King’s
                memory, thus indicating her connection with the Jewish community, especially as
                her contribution of fifty pounds is signed Rachel Charlotte Rey, her birth name
                (Scrivener, <title level="m">Jewish Representation</title> 137–58). In sister Sophia’s
                fourth publication, <title level="m">Victim of Friendship</title> (1801), she includes
                a warm dedication to her father, whom she acknowledges as the only patron who has
                ever helped her in a substantial way. She explicitly defends John King from his
                “enemies,” thus publicly aligning herself with an embattled and scandal-ridden
                Jewish father, arguably the most well-known Jew in England. Charlotte, despite
                several pseudonyms, was well known as a Jewish woman, especially after Lord Byron
                outed her in his <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title> (1809),
                as “lovely little Jessica” (Byron <title level="m">Works</title> 1: 413). Jews at the
                time, as now, had a wide range of positions on their Jewish identity, and
                intermarrying is at one end of the spectrum. The writing of the King sisters should
                be considered Anglo-Jewish, regardless of the paucity of explicit Jewish references
                in the writing itself. A rare instance of a Jewish reference occurs in
                <title level="m">Victor Allen</title> (1805) where the anti-hero protagonist figures
                himself not just as Satan but, after he has exacted revenge on his enemies, as the
                biblical Samson, having just pulled down the pillars on the Philistines (Fortnum II:
                152). </p>
               <p>The King sisters are not the only Jewish writers who express Jewishness in oblique
                ways. A modern parallel would be Franz Kafka (1883–1924), one of the most important
                Jewish writers according to Ruth Wisse in her great book on the modern Jewish canon
                (20; 66–86). In Wisse’s admirable book there is, however, little on the Gothic and
                the uncanny, but the King sisters’ work in the Gothic genre is in the Jewish
                mainstream. So many Jewish authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries write
                about the uncanny, demons, golems, dybbuks, angels, magic, and Satan: I. L. Peretz
                (1852–1915), S. Ansky (S. Z. Rappoport 1863–1920), Tony Kushner (<title level="m">Angels
                in America</title> 1991, <title level="m">The Dybbuk</title> 1997), Michael
                Chabon (<title level="m">Kavalier and Clay</title> 2000), Isaac Singer (1904–1991),
                and even the secularist Abraham Cahan (1860–1951), whose <title level="m">David
                Levinsky</title> (1917) refers frequently to the temptations of Satan. Freud’s
                great essay on the uncanny (1919) rests on a Jewish tradition of such literature and
                folklore, even though it focuses explicitly on E. T. A. Hoffmann’s tale <title level="a">The
                Sandman</title> (1816). The Gothic permits exploration of psychological depths that usually
                elude the realist tradition. The Gothic is not escapist but designed to articulate
                truths that realism cannot express. The uncanny, according to Freud, is “something
                which ought to have remained hidden but has come to light” as the return of the
                dead, a haunting, a breach in the wall between imagination and reality (142–45).
                Moreover, the uncanny and its Gothic expression illustrate the return of the
                repressed at not just the individual psychological level but also the cultural and
                political levels (Grumberg 1–33).</p>
               <p>There are ways that the King sisters express Jewish themes in their novels and
                poetry, without naming the Jewishness as such. The main trauma for Sephardim was
                their expulsion from Iberia and their constrained lives within Iberia as secret Jews
                who could be exposed and punished at any time by the Inquisition and the political
                authorities. The Inquisition figures in many of the King sisters’ writing, including
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title>. By now there is a large body of writing based on
                years of research on transgenerational trauma experienced by Jews and other victims
                of violence and persecution (Schwab 2010). One should take for granted that the
                sisters absorbed the Iberian trauma while they were growing up. In <title level="m">Zofloya</title>,
                for example, the action of the novel starts in the late fifteenth
                century—when Iberia’s Jews were expelled—in Venice, Italy—where many Sephardim
                escaped to. Venice of course is where the most despised Jew in English literature,
                Shylock, resided. Within the first few pages we learn that the aristocratic rule of
                Venice entails strict authoritarianism, including secret trials, torture, and public
                executions of people suspected of subversive opinion (ch. 1). The Loredani family
                experiences a chain of disasters from outside their community, namely from a German
                Baron who seduces the mother and breaks up the family. (The name Loredani suggests
                Charlotte’s mother’s family, the Laras, as well as Radcliffe’s wicked Signora di
                Laurentini of <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> [1794]). Count Ardolf
                acquired his “depravity” in England and France (ch. 2). Long before the reader meets
                a real “demon” in the person of Zofloya, Ardolf is called one (ch. 2), showing the
                reader that the supernatural is an intensification of human qualities, not something
                utterly remote. The adulterous mother Laurina is called an “apostate,” a word
                ordinarily used in a religious context (ch. 4). The unquestionable Gothic villain is
                Ardolf, but Laurina’s moral status is ambiguous, as she is arguably a victim, both
                conflicted and complicitous. Her outward compliance but inner resistance reflect the
                tragic experience of Iberia’s hidden Jews, appearing in public one way, living as
                Jews secretively. Victoria plays the Gothic heroine role in unusual ways, as she is
                a rebellious daughter, independent minded, capable of escaping her Gothic
                imprisonment (as Jews escaped Iberia), and she initiates a sexual affair with an
                older man who thinks he has seduced her, and this man Berenza—some twenty years her
                senior to the teenager Victoria—is ultimately killed by Victoria when she tires of
                him and prefers someone else. Victoria is powerful, quite a reversal of the
                Sephardic (woman’s) historical experience, but compelling as wish-fulfillment. </p>
               <p>The other Jewish references are considerable. The slippage between Moor and Jew in
                this context is fairly obvious, as both are “defeated” people hunted down by
                Catholic Iberia. Zofloya’s expertise, passed down from ancestors, in herbs, drugs,
                chemistry and medicine (ch. 18) evokes Jewish stereotypes about magic and sorcery
                (stereotypes Walter Scott will connect with Rebecca in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>
                [1819]). Blackness aligned with Jewishness is dramatically
                illustrated with Victoria hating the blonde Lilla, whom Victoria kills with a knife
                with erotic zeal (ch. 29). The relationship between the Moor Zofloya and Victoria is
                complex, especially as he enters her consciousness first in the form of a dream, and
                he later serves as her therapist/analyst/confidant as much as her servant. He seems
                to be a creation of Victoria’s deepest desires rather than some external demon who
                has invaded her life. Much of the novel’s action is in Venice, scene of the most
                famous Jewish representation in English literature. Charlotte herself is a
                “Jessica,” the Jew’s daughter. Victoria’s rage at Berenza for thinking she was not
                good enough to marry because of her adulterous mother (ch. 16) is homologous with
                Jewish anger at anti-Semitic snobbery. The dichotomy of dark Victoria and light
                Lilla represents an ethnic competition on the level of sexual beauty, which is drawn
                to the reader’s attention with the striking image in the title page of a dark-haired
                “Rosa Matilda” who resembles Victoria, but not in any way Lilla. </p>
               <p>The novel intriguingly does not correspond to what Anne Mellor calls a female
                Romanticism accenting women’s self-control and rational restraint to assume
                leadership in guiding the nation toward nonviolent reform (1993, 2000). Although
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title> and Charlotte King’s other novels follow in some
                respects what Mellor calls a masculine Romanticism of unrestrained individualistic
                rebellion linked with an emancipation of the imagination, Charlotte’s fiction does
                not follow the didactic model of Wollstonecraft. As Kim Ian Michasiw points out,
                Charlotte’s writing assumes the stance of neither the “proper lady” nor “didactic
                maternalism,” two major options women writers take in the Romantic era
                (vii-xxx).</p>
               <p>To conclude, I would like to refer back to the paternal grandfather of Charlotte and
                Sophia King, Moses Rey (d. 1764), dressed up like a Turkish “Sultan” and supplied
                coffee-house patrons “from Cornhill to Charing-cross” with “cane-strings, c--d--ms,
                sealing wax, and bawdy books.” As a boy John King doubled the profits of his North
                African-born father by selling candy made by his mother (<title level="m">Authentic
                Memoirs</title> 27–28). I am using this vignette to connect the commercial
                theatricality of poor Jews who sold goods on the street to literary theatricality.
                The grandfather’s role-playing to please an audience eager for sweets and sex is not
                unlike what his literary granddaughters did as writers, who from a Sephardic subject
                position fashioned Gothic fiction and lyrical poetry for readers eager for
                sensational literature dealing with sex, violence, magic, the uncanny, and extreme
                emotions. </p>

                        continual basis, and we want the most current text to be the only one
                        generally available to all Internet users. Institutions can, of course, make
                        a link to the copies at Romantic Circles, subject to our conditions of
                        use.</p>

                  <title level="a">Romance in Maria Polack’s Fiction Without Romance</title> looks at the
                    first Anglo-Jewish novelist’s engagement with 1790s debates about romance and
                    realism. In her novel, Fiction Without Romance (1830), Polack does not simply
                    reject romance, but instead suggests a reworking of the form to facilitate
                    female education. By reading a Jewish writer’s work within the context of
                    English, non-Jewish literary contexts, this essay traces the emergence of Jewish
                    literary culture through its investments in literary reform.</p>

               <p>In the Preface to her first and only novel <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance;
                    or, the Locket-Watch</title> (1830) Maria Polack states, “many of the incidents
                alluded to in the tale, may be thought out of date, as it is now some time since it
                was written, having been prevented by illness from publishing it when I first
                intended” (Polack 1: 11).<note place="foot" resp="author">
                     <title level="m">Fiction
                    Without Romance</title> was published just once in
                    1830 by Effingham Wilson. Quotes in this essay taken from this single
                    edition of the novel contain many typographical errors. I have not corrected
                    these errors, nor have I called attention to them in order to let readers
                    encounter the text as it appeared to readers in 1830.</note> Her
                submissive disclaimer hints at a number of vagaries, including elapsed time between
                the novel’s composition and publication and an unspecified illness. Polack lived
                from 1786–1849 and resided throughout her life in the East End of London. Her name
                appears on records connected with prominent Jewish institutions, including the Jews
                Free School, the Great Synagogue, and Brady Street Cemetery. James Picciotto notes
                that her father, Ephraim Polack, was John Braham’s music teacher and the grandfather
                of the playwright Elizabeth Polack (Picciotto 232).<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Braham (1774–1856) was a famous London
                        tenor. For excellent discussions of his life and work see David Conway.</note> Synagogue
                records indicate that Maria Polack lost her father in 1812 and a child named after
                her father in 1816. And Cecil Roth claims that <title level="m">Fiction Without
                    Romance</title> is the first novel written by an English Jew (Roth 4).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Certainly, there were earlier fiction writers
                    who were born Jewish, such as Benjamin Disraeli and the King sisters. I suspect
                    Roth’s claim is based on the notion that at the point when their work was
                    published, these earlier writers did not outwardly identify as Jews. The King
                    sisters married Christians and had nothing to do with the Jewish community or
                    Synagogue life. Disraeli was baptized as a child and remained Anglican
                    throughout his adult life. Hence, Polack is the first known Anglo-Jewish writer
                    to publish a novel while simultaneously identifying outwardly as Jewish. For a
                    rich and important conversation that challenges Roth’s view see Michael
                    Scrivener, especially chapter 5, and Diane Long Hoeveler.</note> Beyond these
                details, Polack’s life and work remain shrouded in mystery.
                Significantly, while extant records connect Polack with institutions in London’s
                Jewish world, the novel’s subject matter ties her to literary debates among English,
                or non-Jewish writers, of the 1790s. It is from this position, straddling English
                and Jewish worlds, where <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> makes some
                of its most controversial and bold arguments. </p>
               <p>In his foundational work on the rise of Anglo-Jewish women’s literary culture in the
                mid-nineteenth century, Michael Galchinsky notes that most Jewish writers from this
                period engaged in some way with the form of the romance. In the years preceding this
                rise of secular Anglo-Jewish literary culture, “Jewish women were specifically
                targeted by ‘tolerant’ conversionist societies . . . They referred to Jewish women’s
                ‘malleability’ and ‘impressionability’, which was assumed to be part of the charm of
                their ‘oriental’ natures” (35). Writing romances offered mid-century Jewish women
                writers a mechanism for reclaiming earlier representations of Jewishness. Galchinsky
                adds, “By adopting or writing against the [romance] genre . . . Jewish women could
                position themselves along a continuum of Jews as traditionalists or reformers” (36).
                Put differently, Galchinsky suggests that this early Victorian generation of Jewish
                women writers used the genre of romance to comment on debates within the Jewish
                community regarding religious traditionalism and reform. </p>
               <p>I’ve argued elsewhere that <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> emerges
                from this juncture where religious leaders and writers were wrestling with the
                demands of becoming modern.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Heidi Kaufman,
                    <title level="a">England’s Jewish Renaissance: Maria Polack’s <title level="m">Fiction Without
                        Romance</title> (1830) in Context.</title>
                  </note> Some wondered how to quell the
                seductions of conversion or to block the rise of religious laxity. Others questioned
                whether Jewish modernity was even possible without significant corruptions of
                religious rituals and Jewish identity. Polack’s novel, I argue, offers a response to
                such concerns signaled by its approach of addressing <emph>both</emph> the
                education of English readers on Jewish subjects <emph>and</emph> the
                education of Jewish readers on English subjects. Working from both directions, the
                novel promotes understanding of and respect for religious pluralism. Only then,
                Polack suggests, will the seductions of assimilation and conversion subside.
                Somewhat paradoxically, however, Polack uses a non-Jewish literary form (the novel)
                to lament the demise of Jewish ways of life. Yet in the process, she argues not for
                reason and rationalism and other Enlightenment subjects to overturn traditional
                religious culture, but for the two systems of belief to work together. Polack’s use
                of the term “rational morality” in her novel echoes language used by her Jewish
                contemporaries who argued that reason and religion were mutually constitutive.
                Michael Scrivener has noted that “Although Britain had no conventional
                Haskalah—modernizing Enlightenment movement of cultural renewal and reform led by an
                intellectual elite—which the German states did indeed have, Britain had a
                modernizing Jewry nevertheless, as well as reformist writers who tried to play the
                role of maskil, someone who was critical of traditional beliefs and practices and
                who adapted Jewish culture to modernity” (<title level="a">British-Jewish Writing</title> 159). Previously,
                I situated Polack within this framework, as one who sought ways to adapt Jewish
                culture for the modern world and who advocated for cross-cultural understanding. In
                the pages that follow I extend this argument to address another key context in the
                novel: Polack’s interest in non-Jewish, English concerns about the intersections of
                education, morality, and literary culture. </p>
               <p>It is unclear what might have prompted Polack, an urban writer living in a Jewish
                community, to center her novel on the development of a Christian character in a
                rural Christian community. And what are we to make of Polack’s choice of the title,
                    <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>, in a novel where she draws from
                romance conventions? Approaching these questions from the perspective of English
                literary history not only helps to highlight some of Polack’s influences, but
                situates the first self-identified Anglo-Jewish novelist in controversies that cut
                across religious boundaries. Jewish and Catholic subplots enter the narrative,
                certainly, but the novel’s central emphasis remains focused on the Protestant Eliza
                Desbro and her exemplary education in a rural cottage where she is raised by a
                Protestant family. While Galchinsky may see Polack’s turn to romance as a statement
                about Jewish reform, I suggest that it also advances an argument in favor of English
                literary reform, and, in particular, an argument for recouping romance to produce a
                new kind of literary realism—what writers of the 1790s described as
                <emph>life as it is</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> tells the story of an infant orphan,
                Eliza Desbro, rescued by her uncle, Edward Frederick Desbro, and brought to a rural
                cottage in Devonshire to be raised and educated by the Reverend George Howard, his
                wife Jane, and his recently widowed sister, Mrs. Wallace, who serves as Eliza’s
                preceptress. Howard, Desbro, and Mrs. Wallace contribute to Eliza’s education,
                discussing educational models and evoking debates from the 1790s about how best to
                teach morality to the young. The novel follows Eliza’s growth from an infant to her
                early adulthood when she marries and establishes a home of her own. Eliza’s
                curriculum is comprised of languages (French and Italian), sacred and religious
                history, music, and geography. The subjects of her studies and exposure to members
                of her rural community help Eliza to cultivate a “rational morality” emphasizing
                charity toward others and a strong moral conviction. Outside of her formal schooling
                Eliza meets a range of people including the Zachariahs, a Jewish family she
                befriends, cottagers struggling to make a living, and wealthy people living in
                self-indulgent, destructive circumstances. Thus, her exposure to a diverse range of
                people, even those lacking respectability, play a central part in Eliza’s education.
                The narrator explains that Mr. Howard’s pedagogy was deliberate:
                <quote>
                First, the basis upon which Eliza’s education was founded, was too solid to be easily
                shaken. Secondly, he wished her to see something <emph>of mankind
                as they are</emph>, for in her uncle, Mrs. Wallace, and (he might
                have added himself,) <emph>she only saw them as
                they ought to be</emph>[.] Third, and lastly, he wished
                her to become acquainted with different characters, in order that she might have
                more scope for forming her opinions, and thus be enabled to judge for herself. (1:
                122; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                The reference in this passage to the distinction between seeing humans “as they are”
                as opposed to ideals, or “as they ought to be,” draws out the novel’s tension
                between the ideal and the real. The best form of education, Polack argues, is that
                which enables young people to judge complex situations for themselves under both
                good and bad circumstances. To develop such consistency and conviction, pupils must
                be exposed to people and circumstances beyond their own social horizons. Yet, they
                also must learn to respect people as they are. In one early section of the
                chapter-less first Volume Mr. Zachariah explains,
                <quote>
                our business is not to fiddle, dance, or game, but it is to be of utility to each
                other; and whether a man be born a prince, or a peasant, he is equally respectable,
                while he acts consistently in that particular sphere of life in which he is placed.
                So with religion,—I am a Jew, yet I love a friend, [Quaker]—I love a Christian,—I
                love all men that are good, and love them <emph>as they are</emph>; but
                the moment they swerve from that, I pity them. (1: 23; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                Here Zachariah promotes a cultural sphere so respectful of religious diversity as to
                make assimilation unnecessary. People are most worthy of respect, he suggests, when
                they are true to their identities, or when they resist the temptation to swerve from
                their distinctiveness. Noteworthy in this passage is Polack’s repeated use of the
                expression “as they are” which resonates directly with literary debates about
                romance’s proclivity for idealism versus fiction’s tendency toward representing life
                as it is—debates hinted at, as we shall see, in Polack’s choice of title,
                <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>.</p>
               <p> While the novel seems mostly focused on Eliza Desbro’s education, at the center of
                the narrative is a mystery about her deceased parents and her uncle’s hidden past.
                Half-way through the two-volume novel, Eliza receives a written document explaining
                her family history, the effects of which shape the plot of the second volume. In
                that document, Eliza learns that her father, Charles Courtney, engaged in bigamy
                when he married her mother, Eliza Courtney. Upon learning about her would-be
                husband’s wife and child, Eliza Courtney becomes ill and perishes. In a fit of
                murderous rage and in defense of his sister’s honor, Edward Desbro stabs Charles
                Courtney. Believing him dead, Desbro whisks the infant Eliza to rural Devonshire to
                be raised by kinder people. Unbeknownst to all, Charles Courtney survives the
                attack, and lives out his life as a destructive profligate. Multiple plot twists
                later, the teenage Eliza meets Henry Cooper, who changed his surname to avoid
                association with his infamous father, Charles Courtney. Soon after their discovery
                that they are half-siblings, Eliza and Henry meet their dying father who, deeply
                repentant, leaves them his fortune. Along the way, Eliza befriends the Jewish
                Rebecca Zachariah, and learns of Rebecca’s sister, Sarah, who made an unfortunate
                marriage with a non-Jew that leads to her illness and death. Finally, readers learn
                about a Mrs. St. Clair, a Protestant woman whose marriage to a Catholic man results
                in disaster. The pattern of bad marriages suggests that men and women of all
                religions are susceptible to errors in judgement, and that young people need
                guidance navigating their culture’s courtship rituals. The temptation to marry out
                of one’s faith, however, is not exclusively a Jewish problem, nor is it solely a
                response to efforts in this period to convert Jews to Christianity; according to
                <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> the pressure to convert or assimilate
                is a wider, more universal problem that seduces the young, overly influenced by the
                hollow promise of romance, toward deadly missteps.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For
                    important discussions of English efforts to convert Jews in this

               </p>
               <p>Polack’s motif of a child raised in rural seclusion is a direct response to earlier
                works—most famously, perhaps, is Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile; or On
                Education</title> (1762) made
                even more (in)famous by Mary Wollstonecraft’s critique of that work in
                <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (1792). In his
                educational novel, Rousseau charts a male child’s development into a rational being.
                Wollstonecraft expands and critiques Rousseau’s vision in her articulation of female
                education:
                <quote>
                The most perfect education, in my opinion, is such an exercise of the understanding
                as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words,
                to enable the individual to attain such habits of virtue as will render it
                independent. In fact, it is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not
                result from the exercise of its own reason. This was Rousseau’s opinion respecting
                men: I extend it to women. (52)
                </quote>
                The subjects of female education and reason tie Polack to these earlier debates of the
                1790s by Wollstonecraft and others. Polack’s choice to name the heroine’s mother
                Eliza Courtney would have recalled Mary Hays’s sensational <title level="m">Memoirs

                            <quote>In delineating the character of
                            Emma Courtney, I had not in view these fantastic models: I meant to
                            represent her, as a human being, loving virtue, loving virtue while
                            enslaved in passion, liable to the mistakes and weaknesses of our
                            fragile nature. —Let those readers, who feel inclined to judge with
                            severity the extravagance and eccentricity of her conduct, look into
                            their own hearts; and should they there find no record, traced by an

                            bear in mind, that the errors of my heroine were the offspring of
                            sensibility; and that the result of her hazardous experiment is
                            calculated to operate as a <emph>warning</emph>, rather than
                            as an example. (36)</quote>

                from its opening pages Hays insisted that her novel be assessed within the new
                tradition of the Jacobin novel or the “fiction of reform” which developed after
                1789, and which was epitomized by Godwin’s <title level="m">Things as They Are; or, The
                Adventures of Caleb Williams</title>: novels which are predicated on the philosophical
                insistence on the shaping power of circumstances and the tracing of the development
                of the mind and character. (18)
                </quote>
                In these texts we see the foundations of Polack’s interest in linking narratives
                about people “as they are”—which Zachariah echoed in his promotion of self-respect
                for religious identity—with questions of character development and reform. And while
                Jacobin advocates of reform may have had something very different in mind than early
                Anglo-Jewish debates over religious reform, Polack weaves them together in her
                depictions of an English girl’s education. Alan Richardson notes that,
                <quote>
                While nearly all women writers of educational treatises and conduct books asserted
                the need for more substantial education and condemned the emphasis on superficial
                ‘accomplishments’ in girls’ boarding schools, they did so with a variety of
                ideological motivations, ranging from Wollstonecraft’s radical egalitarianism to the
                efforts of reactionaries like More and West to buttress the existing political and
                social order through selective reform. (170)
                </quote>
                While <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> wasn’t published until 1830,
                Polack anchors her model of educational reform in literary debates from the 1790s,
                the period of her own youth.</p>
               <p> To situate Polack’s work within the tradition of Jacobin writers might be heavy
                handed, as it would align her with a range of political views and a revolution of
                ideas far broader than <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> explicitly
                indicates. However, 1790s debates about reform clearly resonated with Polack’s
                interest in secular literary culture’s power to address questions of Jewish
                modernity and religious reform. Indeed, it’s difficult to ignore the appearance of
                Jacobin book titles and phrases in <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>,
                such as <title level="m">Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb
                Williams</title>; her references to “Miss Edgeworth’s moral and entertaining
                english [sic] tales,’ or the more beautiful french [sic] ones of ‘Marmontel” (Polack
                1: 96); and her naming of characters that evoke progressive writers from the period
                (Mary Hays’s <title level="m">Emma Courtney</title>, for example) as well as
                anti-Jacobin writers, such as Eliza’s conservative preceptress, Mrs. Howard, who
                evokes Elizabeth Hamilton, author of the more conservative <title level="m">Letters
                on Education</title> (1801). Polack’s Prefatory admission that her novel might be
                thought out of date at the moment of publication—1830—makes more sense when
                contextualized by the novel’s interest in debates from the 1790s. How Polack stages
                these debates by including Jewish characters, combined with her method of
                appropriating features of romance, situate her novel within a number of key intersecting
                contexts. As I suggest below,
                her choice of title—<title level="m">Fiction <hi rend="bold">Without</hi>
                Romance</title>—in a novel that advocates for “rational morality”
                wants readers to believe reason and romance are separable aesthetic fields. Read
                through the lens of the novel, however, the title seems like a tactical choice aimed
                at questioning romance’s ambit and realism’s rising significance. <title level="m">Fiction
                Without Romance</title>, therefore, signals some of the ways Anglo-Jewish
                writers adapted and contributed to non-Jewish, English literary debates.</p>
               <p> In <title level="m">The English Jacobin Novel</title>, Gary Kelly notes that while
                novels included in the category “Jacobin Novel” engaged with a wide array of views
                and political objectives, what they all had in common was the notion “that reason
                should decide the issue in human affairs and human government, not power based on
                money, age, rank, sex, or physical strength” (8). Jacobin texts sought a more
                democratic society based on equality and respect. As Polack integrates such concerns
                about charity—particularly for cottagers, members of the working classes, and
                women—over brutish, selfish assertions of power, she nevertheless remains focused on
                a discourse of reason and rationalism, even in salacious sections of the text
                concerning the “mystery attached to the birth of Eliza” (1: 179). The sympathetic
                Desbro, Eliza’s uncle and teacher, stands as a model for how equality can be both
                exercised individually and taught to the young, thereby insuring its persistence in
                the future. Desbro becomes the spokesperson for female education and rational
                morality. He is described as one who would not marry a woman “unless I truly loved
                her” (1: 42), as he explains:
                <quote>
                Personal admiration alone is not sufficient to ensure a life of happiness, or even
                comfort. While I admire the person, I must be able, also to admire the mind. Perhaps
                I may be rather singular in my opinions on female education, but I am not so foolish
                as to be frightened at what the <emph>vulgar</emph> term “a learned
                woman.” Be assured, Sir, the female mind is equally strong and capacious with our
                own; and when a woman is ignorant, it is the fault of man that she is so. It is a
                sort of vanity, or conscious superiority in our sex, that disdain to acknowledge an
                equal in the other. . . .  And I firmly believe, that the frivolity, so often depreciated
                in women, would cease to exist, if they were properly encouraged in the pursuit of
                more rational amusements. (1: 42)
                </quote>
                Here Polack likely refers to Bathsua Pell Makin’s expression “a learned woman” in her
                work, <title level="m">An Essay to Revise the Antient Education of Gentlewoman, in
                    Religion, Manners, Arts and Tongues</title> (1673). Desbro, a refined and
                thoughtful male character, becomes the defender of a “learned woman” and an
                educational philosophy aimed at “rational amusements” promoted in a previous era—the
                very kind of arguments that surfaced more than a hundred years later in the 1790s.
                In her <title level="m">Essay</title> Makin argues,
                <quote>
                     <emph>To all Ingenious and Vertuous Ladies ...</emph>
                     <lb/>
                Custom, when it
                is inveterate, hath a mighty influence: it hath the force of Nature itself. The
                Barbarous custom to breed Women low, is grown general amongst us, and hath prevailed
                so far, that it is verily believed . . . that Women are not endued with such Reason,
                as Men; nor capable of improvement by Education, as they are. It is lookt upon as a
                monstrous thing; to pretend the contrary. A Learned Woman is thought to be a Comet,
                that bodes Mischief, when ever it appears. To offer to the World the liberal
                Education of Women is to deface the Image of God in Man, it will make Women so high,
                and men so low, like Fire in the House-top, it will set the whole world in a Flame.

                In both the 1670s and 1790s the question of female education turned on the subject of
                women’s capacity for reason and rationalism. Whereas Rousseau would argue in
                <title level="m">Emile</title> that women should be educated to serve men, and not to
                develop their own capacity for independent thought and self-possession, Polack would
                respond—armed with allusions to women writers of the 1790s— in her novel’s Preface
                where she states, “I have endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep within the
                limits of simplicity, for, were I to soar above the mediocrity of power, my
                ignorance would soon be detected and despised . . . I have, therefore, confined
                myself to that rational morality which many, I hope, will admire, and which all can
                comprehend” (1: i–ii). Here Polack hints at her confidence in her readership, and
                her assumption that “rational morality” is something <emph>all</emph>—and
                not just men—can comprehend.</p>
               <p> We may wonder why a religiously traditional writer and the first Anglo-Jewish
                novelist would root the plot of her 1830 novel in debates from the 1790s among
                non-Jews. Born in 1786, Polack likely came of age as a reader in the years
                immediately following these debates. While she would have followed strict religious
                observances as a member of The Great Synagogue, she would not have read Jewish
                secular fiction, as none had yet been written. Hence, her reading habits and
                intellectual interests would have been shaped by books to which she had access,
                books written by non-Jews that rebuked popular gothic romances, promoting in their
                place texts advocating women’s capacity for reason. Polack’s knowledge of the very
                romance her title seems to reject and Jacobin writing from the 1790s is suggestive
                of her access to a broad range of literature. Indeed, her novel’s litany of references to novels,
                political treatises, plays, poetry, and religious history indicate that she was a
                learned woman in her own right.</p>
               <p> While Kelly notes the persistence of debates in Jacobin fiction about the abuses of
                power, Polack’s engagement with rationalism pushes these debates into new territory.
                On the one hand, she includes passages that stridently promote women’s causes from
                across the social landscape; for Courtney abuses middle class women like Eliza’s
                mother as well as the working poor, such as the young maid Susan. Both women perish,
                suggesting that male abuse is a universal problem unaffected by social barriers. It
                is here, in depictions of emotional and physical abuse, where Polack weaves together
                educational philosophy and the mystery of Eliza’s father’s identity. While I agree
                with Galchinsky’s claim that Jewish women’s resistance to romance is tied to
                conversionist efforts of the period, I want to suggest that Polack is up to
                something else in <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>.<note place="foot" resp="author"> According to Galchinsky, “All of the earliest Anglo-Jewish
                    women writers felt that they had to respond to the romance genre” (36).</note>
                Certainly gothic features frequently associated with romance are absent from the
                novel; but the novel’s emphasis on mystery and intrigue, murder, un-restrained
                passions, and women’s sexual vulnerability in the face of seducers and philanderers
                tie the novel to the tradition of eighteenth-century romance writing. As I suggest
                in the following analysis, Polack seems far less interested in rejecting the
                tradition of romance, than she does in reforming it. In effect, her novel moves
                romance away from the preserve of entertainment and toward a foundation for rational
                education. Thus, when she refers to fiction <emph>without</emph> romance,
                Polack signals both an approval of fiction (as it was defined by her contemporaries)
                and a concern for the potentially threatening effects of romance novels (as they
                were written) on young, female audiences. She therefore bends the tradition of
                romance to serve her higher goals of promoting female reason and morality.</p>
               <p>The romance obviously has a long history, changing over time to accommodate shifting
                audiences and tastes as well as cultural functions of fiction. Toni Wein has noted
                of this history that “the aesthetic conflicts provoked by the romance revivalists
                [in the late eighteenth century] speak to a growing awareness of literature’s
                fitness for ideological service [. . . while] arguments on its behalf testify to the
                increasing importance of reading as a mode of entertainment” (40). She adds that one
                of the dominant features of romance in this period was the “topos of discovered
                origins” and of creating fictions that “reinstill[ed] the desire for social
                hierarchy” (40). On one level, <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>
                emphasizes a more democratic and pluralistic image of English society, one inclusive
                of immigrants, Jewish people, Catholics, and those living in poverty, and thus
                speaks to some of the ideological conventions Wein details. The novel’s interest in
                charity simultaneously imagines beneficent communal leaders who model forms of
                kindness and respect for the poor while using their higher social positions to
                benefit others. Discussions among characters about how to educate children or why
                learned women shouldn’t be perceived as a threat advance the novel’s political and
                literary concerns. Nevertheless, the mystery of Eliza’s past and the revelation of
                her rakish father and murderous uncle aestheticize mystery, drawing readers into a
                hidden plot of damsels in distress, sexual predators, and acts of intrigue performed
                by characters of ill-repute. Indeed, the novel’s emotional draw emerges through the
                slow unfolding of family secrets and the salacious revelation that, had such details
                <emph>not</emph> been revealed, Eliza may have accidentally married
                her half-brother. For these reasons, romance is not just present as a sub-plot in
                the novel; it’s the aesthetic force driving discussions about slow courtship rituals,
                the advocacy of parental authority in questions of marriage selection, and the
                importance of marrying into one’s faith group. In other words, Polack is not
                rejecting romance: she’s using it to further her vision of a rational educational
                agenda. </p>
               <p>When Desbro arrives at the Howard home without explanation and with an infant in his
                arms, the narrator notes, “There was much mystery in the affair, and mystery is
                seldom the companion of virtue” (1: 14). Subsequent references to his unknown past
                repeat the word “mystery” as if to build wonder and suspense with each new mention.
                In a later passage even the level-headed Howard notes, “there was a mystery attached
                to the birth of Eliza, some parts of which were still wrapt in obscurity, in fact,
                they might never be elucidated” (1: 179). Withholding information to keep readers in
                suspense was a well-known trait of the romance. As Eliza’s Jewish friend, Rebecca
                Zachariah, explains when Eliza impatiently asks too many questions, “You would make
                a terrible heroine of romance . . . you want to know all the mystery at once” (2:
                34). The mysteries of Desbro are disclosed in the final pages of the first volume.
                His history, which has been transcribed and saved by Howard, recounts Desbro’s
                moment of pure passion and unreason upon hearing Courtney confess without remorse,
                “It has ever been my fate, to love variety, and as your sister was not really my
                wife, [because he was already married] I was not compelled to sacrifice my
                inclination longer than I pleased” (1: 241). Desbro details his reaction to his
                would-be brother-in-law’s arrogant disregard for his sister Eliza’s well-being:

                The cool, taunting, and insulting tone in which all this was uttered, irritated me
                more than the coarsest invectives could have done, I felt chokeing,—my eyes rolled
                with all the wildness of passion, unfortunately, a knife lay on a table near which I
                stood,—I seized it, and in a moment of phrenzy, plunged it into his bosom to the

                recollection of what I had done, and its probable consequences, I left the house,
                regardless of my own safety, but my niece! the orphan so awfully bequeathed to me!
                the thought of her, brought me to a full sense of my situation. . . . I ran without
                stopping, till I arrived at the house of Mrs. Ellis [Eliza’s caretaker]. . . . I
                laid down, and soon found myself incapable of rising, the agitation of my mind, had
                brought on a fever, I lay for a fortnight hardly conscious of my own existence; and

                The novel’s careful withholding and eventual disclosure of the
                attempted murder sub-plot recall tropes of romance novels, including bigamy and
                murder. Desbro’s wildness of passion in response to Courtney’s bigamy aligns
                Polack’s anti-romance novel with the very qualities it purports to define itself
                against. The reader’s challenge is to find a way to integrate seemingly
                contradictory pressures on romance and rationalism.</p>
               <p>Gillian Beer explains that in the late eighteenth century the romance was thought to
                focus on “ideal possibilities” in contrast to the novel, which focused on “actual
                possibilities” (53). Richardson’s eponymous hero, Pamela, summarizes some of the
                most compelling arguments against romance when she claims:
                <quote>
                There were very few novels and romances that my lady would permit me to read; and
                those I did, gave me no great pleasure; for either they dealt so much in the
                marvelous and improbable, or were so unnaturally inflaming to the passions, and so
                full of love and intrigue, that most of them seemed calculated to fire the
                imagination, rather than to inform the judgement. (qtd. in Beer 14)
                </quote>
                Beer adds that the romance Pamela critiques, “drowns the voice of reason, it offers a
                dangerously misleading guide to everyday life, it rouses false expectations and
                stirs up passions best held in check” (14). The distinction between romance and
                realism was not simply a literary delineation, but was one bound up by questions
                concerning the effects of literary form on unsuspecting readers. The 1780s and 90s
                witnessed a rise of criticism of the kind of romances Pamela critiques. In
                <title level="m">The Progress of Romance</title> (1785) one of Clara Reeve’s
                characters declares, “If read indiscriminately they [romances] are at best
                unprofitable, frequently productive of absurdities in manners and sentiments,
                sometimes hurtful to good morals” (7). Later this same character notes, “A
                Circulating Library is indeed a great evil,—young people are allowed to subscribe to
                them, and to read indiscriminately all they contain; and thus both food and poison
                are conveyed to the young mind together” (77). In such descriptions, literary
                dangers are tied to education and the choice of reading material. If only parents
                would teach young readers <emph>how</emph> to read and select works of
                literature, these critiques suggest, they could mitigate romance’s dangers.</p>
               <p>Other significant strands of the debates about romance’s dangers focused on
                distinctions of literary form. Isaac D’Israeli among others claimed that “From
                Romances, which had now exhausted the patience of the public, sprung NOVELS,”
                adding, “It is not surprising that romances have been regarded as pernicious to good
                sense, morals, taste, and literature” (D’Israeli 2: 258). Sir Walter Scott responded
                to Dr. Johnson’s definition of romance by claiming, “We would be rather inclined to
                describe a Romance as a ‘a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of
                which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents;’ thus being opposed to the
                kindred term <emph>Novel</emph>, which Johnson has described as ‘a smooth
                tale, generally of love’; but which we would rather define as ‘a fictitious
                narrative, differing from the Romance, because the events are accommodated to the
                ordinary train of human events, and the modern state of society’” (65). In her
                Preface to <title level="m">The Old English Baron</title> (1778), a response to Horace
                Walpole’s <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> (1764), Clara Reeve argued
                that history, fictional or not, “represents human nature as it is in real life,
                alas, too often a melancholy retrospect! Romance displays only the amiable side of
                the picture; it shews the pleasing features, and throws a veil over the blemishes”
                (12). Her emphasis on real life anticipates later literary interests in realism.
                However, at the point when Polack is writing—the first two decades of the nineteenth
                century—writers are not thinking about later Victorian debates about realism’s
                limits, but instead are preoccupied with the challenge of representing plausible
                events as a model for instruction. In fact, another Jacobin novel to which Polack
                refers, <title level="m">Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb
                Williams</title> (1794) in which the titular figure engages in a murder in the name
                of justice, much like Desbro’s attempted murder of Charles Courtney, readers are led
                to sympathize with murderous acts committed for just causes that seek an end to
                abuses of power. And while stories of love had the potential to lead young women
                astray, or to mistake the fantasies they read about in romance novels with the
                actual worlds in which they lived, it was also the presence of what Deborah Lutz
                calls “the dangerous lover” who was considered to be a threat to young girls. Lutz
                describes this type of character as “the one whose eroticism lies in his dark past,
                his restless inquietude, his remorseful and rebellious exile from comfortable
                everyday living” (ix). In <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> dangerous
                lovers do manage to hurt several women, and stand in stark opposition to the more
                educated, refined gentleman who turn out to be far better marriage material. Yet,
                characters such as Desbro bridge these categories, and suggest either that what
                looks like romance might in fact be something else—something more like
                <emph>life as it is</emph>. Alternately, Desbro’s care of his niece Eliza
                and dedication to his sister’s good character spin moments of passion and violence
                as potentially worthy of forgiveness. If romances depicted villains giving way to
                passionate outbursts and violence, Polack’s adaptation of this form is to make their
                violence both justified and redeemable. In her vision of <emph>life as
                it is</emph>, characters grow and change, and therefore stand in sharp contrast to
                romance’s stock and static characters who stand for recognizable villainous
                types.</p>
               <p>I’m suggesting that to read <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>
                exclusively in the context of Anglo-Jewish literary history misses an opportunity to
                understand Polack’s engagement with English writers. Similarly, to read English
                writers of this era outside of the contexts of the rise of Jewish secular culture,
                and that of other marginalized writers, is to miss seeing how literary debates from
                the center were variously interpreted, how they were evoked by writers from the
                margins, such as Polack, who expanded discussions of reason and rationalism as they
                advocated for religious pluralism and reform. Michael Ragussis illuminates other
                related features of these debates. During the very period when writers were carving
                out distinctions between romance and fiction, Protestant English culture became
                focused on what he describes as “the rhetoric of conversion and the figure of the
                Jewish convert” (1). Conversion entailed more than acts of transforming Jews into
                Christians; it was also interested in, Ragussis notes, advancing a form of repentance
                and reconciliation with God in the wake of transgressive acts. Ragussis explains,
                “the conversion of the Other (heathen, infidel, or Jew) is the surest sign of the
                conversion of the self, so that the true convert proves himself by becoming a
                proselytizer” (2). The prominent model of conversion in English fiction was
                therefore one that welcomed Jews (and others) into Christianity. Such logic had the
                advantage of positioning the English as liberal and tolerant of difference, open to
                accepting Jews, as long as they were willing to abandon their Jewish identity.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For a fuller discussion see Heidi Kaufman,

                    British Novel</title>, especially chapters 1 and 3.</note> Polack’s interest
                in promoting respect for religious difference surely grew out of conversion
                pressures in this period that rejected religious pluralism. Polack’s insistence on
                religious consistency, read in light of this context, is not a sign of Jewish
                resistance to change, but serves as a bulwark against the seductions of
                conversionist rhetoric, much of which had been imbibed and propelled by romance
                novels.</p>
               <p>Interactions between Jewish and Christian families in <title level="m">Fiction
                Without Romance</title> are presented as an opportunity to dispel prejudice and to
                help readers see and respect people as they are. Polack’s
                insistence on respect for religious difference and promotion of religious diversity
                invites us to consider how religious instruction converged with literary debates.
                Richard Altick notes that the rise of religious-based criticism against romances
                intensified in the early years of the nineteenth century as, he explains,
                <quote>
                The hostility to novels which had been building up for several decades reached its
                peak in the early nineteenth century. The primary target was the circulating-library
                novel, compact of sensationalism, sentimentality, and (in the evangelical view)
                salaciousness. It was this very kind of book, however, which was best adapted to the
                taste of the reader whose limited education equipped him to relish little else . . .
                By barring from cheap religious reading matter the qualities most attractive to the
                novice reader; by denying him any acquaintance with pleasurable reading in
                elementary schools, village libraries, and other educational agencies under their
                control . . . the religious parties severely limited both the range and the
                attractiveness of the literary experience available to the working class. (123)
                </quote>
                What gets lost in Altick’s discussion is a fullness of religious perspectives, and an
                awareness of the ways non-normative religious groups—and particularly Jewish
                working-class writers like Polack—actively participated in educational and religious
                debates <emph>through</emph> the use of romance. In the 1841 census Polack
                is listed as a teacher. Given the reading level of <title level="m">Fiction Without
                    Romance</title>, it’s likely that Polack wrote it for classroom use to educate
                children about the dangers of romance and the importance of cultivating rational
                morality. Perhaps it’s not surprising that an educator would preface her novel by
                stating, “I am not so presumptuous as to say, that I do not fear criticism; nor am I
                so pusillanimous as to shrink from it. I shall receive it as the wholesome
                chastisement which a judicious tutor bestows on the pupil whom he wishes to train
                towards proficiency” (1: i). Indeed, the novel and its paratexts are tied on all
                fronts to an educational philosophy rooted in reading and writing with proficiency.
                Yet, in such opening remarks Polack places herself in the position of the student
                who awaits “wholesome chastisement” from her teacher/reader. While this might be a
                sign that Polack had hopes of publishing again under the tutelage of her critics, it
                also reveals her opinion of how book reviews should work. Sadly, Polack never
                received the kind of feedback she describes in this passage. Her novel is listed in
                several newspapers announcing newly published books, but most fail to offer
                commentary—wholesome or otherwise—on the quality of the writing or her treatment of
                her subjects.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Only two Reviews

               <p>While <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> has clear associations with
                English literary culture, one of its boldest moves was to connect Jacobin concerns
                about educational reform with Jewish debates about modernity and emancipation. In
                the novel’s publication year (1830)
                <quote>
                all public offices were closed to professing Jews. They were debarred from Parliament
                and from civic office and were disqualified from any employment connected to the
                administration of justice. In the civil sphere, Jews were obstructed from entering
                professions which demanded a Christian oath: most branches of schoolteaching,
                medicine and the Bar were closed to them and, for the same reason, Jews were
                ineligible to take degrees or hold any office at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
                Between the years 1830–1871 these political and civil disadvantages were erased.

               <p>As Anglo-Jews fought for and won political emancipation, they simultaneously faced
                evangelical conversionist efforts. In fact, the rise of conversionist activity and
                discourse had the effect of mobilizing Jewish communities throughout London. Gerry
                Black explains,
                <quote>
                The most important Societies were the Missionary Society (not specifically aimed at
                the Jews), founded in 1795; the London Missionary Society, effectively a committee
                of the Missionary Society that was created to work exclusively among the Jews; and
                the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews (LSPCJ), founded in
                1809. Between 1806 and 1813, three missionary schools were established in and around
                the Jewish quarter. (Black 29–30)
                </quote>
            As a resident and teacher in the Jewish quarter, Polack would have known first-hand
                the work of these missionary schools and her community’s response. The Rabbi of her
                Synagogue, Chief Rabbi Hirschell, spoke out on several occasions about the
                manipulations of missionary groups who made a habit of bribing Jewish children with
                food, clothing, and money (Black 30). According to Ragussis, “missions to convert
                the Jews became the subject of public scandal in the opening decades of the
                nineteenth century [during which] . . . English national character and its reputation
                for tolerance were called into question” (3). In subsequent years these conversion
                efforts made their way into British literary culture. He adds,
                <quote>
                What had been throughout most of the eighteenth century a steady (if somewhat
                negligible) stream of literature on the conversion of the Jews and their restoration
                to Palestine became nothing short of a torrent in the 1790s. In the tumultuous
                events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, millenarians saw the signs
                of the Second Coming, which, according to biblical prophecy, was to be preceded by
                the restoration of the Jews to Palestine and their conversion. (Ragussis 4)
                </quote>

               <p>
                  <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>’s emphasis on marrying within one’s
                faith emerges directly from such fears about conversion and religious intermarriage.
                By imaging a friendship between Jewish and Christian young girls who educate one
                another on their differing religious cultures, Polack sets up a model for
                anti-conversionist tactics and learned respect for religious difference. In the
                process, she forges a new relationship between Jews and Christians governed by
                education and respect rather than a the compulsion of one group to conquer the other
                through conversion. We see this pattern played out repeatedly in conversations about
                the treatment of Jewish characters in the novel. A discussion of religious
                persecution between Eliza and Desbro helps to ground and unite these isolated
                moments. Eliza asks, “But, how is it, my dear uncle . . . that you seem so much more
                attached to the members of that nation [the Jewish people] than of some others? For
                instance, do you not think highly of the society of friends?” (2: 10) to which
                Desbro replies:
                <quote>
                Most assuredly I do . . . but they are not so much entitled to our commiseration,
                having never undergone the various kinds of persecution, at least, in so great a
                degree, as the Jews have been fated to endure . . . while in the society of the
                Israelite . . . though their tenets are rigidly severe among themselves, yet, in the
                company of others, they are sprightly, intelligent, and among the better sort,
                generally men of refined education and polished manners. . . . [their women are]
                amiable and very lively; they have the reputation for great modesty, and for their
                exemplary conduct as wives and mothers, I believe they almost stand unrivalled. (2:
                10–11)
                </quote>
                Desbro supports the notion that children should be made to feel at ease with a range
                of people from disparate cultures and religious backgrounds, and to sympathize with
                those who have suffered from unjust persecution and prejudice. While much of Eliza’s
                education takes place in the cottage, sequestered from urban life, she has
                opportunities to meet visitors from London, and later to travel to London where she
                encounters refugees from Europe, and learns from her uncle Desbro—the would-be
                murderer with a passion for violence—how and why one must treat others with respect.
                Through these narrative turns, Polack focuses on questions at the center of secular
                English culture about the importance of educating children to honor religious
                pluralism. In so doing, Polack sketches the stakes of those debates for a wider
                audience of novel readers that included both Jewish and English audiences. The
                putative turn away from romance was thus a turn toward plots that readers could find
                in real life, things as they are, and from which they could develop a moral
                sensibility through the experience of reading romance in fiction without
                romance.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay explores why so many nineteenth-century British writers
                    and artists reimagined the biblical figure of Ruth, beginning with Keats’s <title level="a">Ode
                    to a Nightingale,</title> which surprisingly depicts Ruth as “sick for home… amid the
                    alien corn.” It also considers works by Felicia Hemans, Thomas Hood, John
                    Adams-Acton, and Grace Aguilar that follow in Keats’s wake but have received
                    little scholarly attention. I argue that Keats shaped a new representational
                    tradition in which Ruth becomes a figure of alienation and homesickness. In
                    doing so, Keats departs from the Bible but aligns with contemporaneous anxieties
                    about psychological, national, religious, and even racial otherness. </p>

                        The Book of Ruth can be read as a

                  <p>In the penultimate stanza of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> (1819), Keats
                                    takes an unexpectedly biblical turn, describing how the titular
                                    bird’s song was once heard by Ruth “when, sick for home, / She
                                    stood in tears amid the alien corn” (lines 66–67). This
                                    reference to the protagonist of the Book of Ruth is unexpected
                                    first because the poem has previously eschewed religious
                                    allusions in favor of those from classical mythology,
                                    Shakespeare, and Milton; Keats himself privileged poetic
                                    imagination over religious revelation. As Adam Plunkett
                                    explains, “Shakespeare was scripture for him, and scripture was
                                    not; he knew them but didn’t revere them.” But it is even more
                                    unexpected because of its interpretation of Ruth herself.
                                    Keats’s description of Ruth as homesick in an “alien” land is,
                                    as we shall see, not in keeping with the biblical text nor with
                                    the general tenor of nineteenth-century responses to it—of which
                                    there were many. Indeed, along with Keats, the
                                    nineteenth-century British writers and artists who adapted or
                                    alluded to Ruth’s story include William Blake, Thomas Hood,
                                    Felicia Hemans, Christina Rossetti, Grace Aguilar, William
                                    Tennant, Benjamin Farjeon, George Eliot, George Dawe, Charles
                                    Eastlake, George Frederick Watts, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward
                                    Burne-Jones, William Morris, Walter Crane, Simeon Solomon,
                                    Thomas Matthews Rooke, and John Adams-Acton. Such a list, by no
                                    means comprehensive, prods us to consider why so many British
                                    artists and writers from this period imagined—and
                                    reimagined—Ruth.</p>
                  <p>The Book of Ruth itself continues to generate diverse interpretations.
                                    Scholars as varied as J. Hillis Miller, Julia Kristeva, Sylvia Barack Fishman,
                                    and Bonnie Honig have read the Book of Ruth to comment on the nature of literary
                                    theory and translation, twentieth-century debates about European immigration, and
                                    the liberating power of mothers in the Bible, respectively. But nineteenth-century
                                    British <emph>cultural adaptations</emph> of the Book of Ruth have generated limited scholarly analysis. Given how deeply the Bible saturated this culture, this gap is surprising, and one I hope to begin to fill in by examining Romantic interpretations of Ruth, attending to the intertextuality of literary and artistic production. According to Northrop Frye, one of the few critics to treat literary adaptations of Ruth, this “comparative neglect” can be traced to what he terms “the irrepressible cheerfulness of the story, which is all about completely normal people fully understanding one another and leaves the literary imagination little to do.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Frye discusses the Book of Ruth in <title level="a">The Bride from a Strange
                                        Land</title> (58). Eve Stoddard’s <title>A Genealogy of Ruths: From Alien Harvester
                                            to Fallen Woman in Nineteenth-Century England</title> is the only other attempt
                                        to assess Ruth as a nineteenth-century figure I have encountered. Stoddard focuses
                                        on echoes of Ruth in poems about harvesting that do not mention the Book of Ruth.
                                        She also hears echoes of the biblical Ruth in Elizabeth Gaskell’s <title level="m">Ruth</title> and Wordsworth’s poem of an abandoned, mad young woman
                                        named Ruth, leading Stoddard to argue for connections between the biblical story
                                        and female fallenness (though she admits that the connection is “somewhat tenuous
                                        and ironic” in Wordsworth’s case (53)). While very interesting, these biblical
                                        echoes are somewhat faint.</note> As I demonstrate, some of the nineteenth-century
                                    writers and artists who <emph>did</emph> imagine Ruth would disagree. For, as
                                    <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> reminds us, their renderings of
                                    Ruth, particularly as a stranger in a strange land, a foreigner in a new nation,
                                    are not always “irrepressibl[y] cheerful.”</p>
                  <p>There are many reasons Ruth became a compelling vehicle for
                                    Romantic writers and artists but all stem from the way the
                                    particulars of her biblical narrative chimed with the cultural
                                    dynamics of their own era. Despite being one of the shortest
                                    parts of the Bible, The Book of Ruth entails everything from
                                    religious conversion, mother-daughter relationships, and
                                    marriage laws, to agricultural practices and migration, not to
                                    mention love, loss, birth, and sex—in other words, topics with
                                    longstanding appeal but specific early nineteenth-century
                                    iterations. Like many of the writers I consider, I am
                                    particularly interested in Ruth as a figure who traverses
                                    geographic, religious, and national boundaries. In fact, the
                                    Book of Ruth has been read as a welcoming counterpoint to the
                                    ethnic isolationism and tribalism of later books Ezra and
                                    Nehemia. </p>
                  <p>The story opens when Naomi, her husband, and her sons leave
                                    Bethlehem due to famine and arrive in Moab, where the sons marry
                                    Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah. After the death of her sons and
                                    husband, Naomi decides to return to Israel, apparently never
                                    having felt at home in the “country of Moab” (<title level="m">King
                                    James Bible</title>, Ruth 1.6), one of the first signals
                                    that the text conceptualizes “home” in both familial and
                                    national terms. Initially, Ruth and Orpah say they will follow
                                    Naomi. But when Naomi urges them to “return each to her mother's
                                    house,” only Ruth refuses, pledging in what have become among
                                    the Bible’s most quoted lines, “whither thou goest, I will go;
                                    and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
                                    people, and thy God my God” (1.16). Together, they journey to
                                    Bethlehem. There, Ruth gleans in fields that turn out to belong
                                    to Boaz, a kinsman of Naomi’s who protects Ruth even though she
                                    is a “Moabitish damsel,” a “stranger” (2.6, 2.10). Through Ruth,
                                    the incorporation of strangers, foreigners, immigrants, into the
                                    Jewish people is celebrated, seen as her “full reward . . . given thee
                                    of the Lord God of Israel” (2.12), as well as Naomi’s reward for
                                    her past suffering. Boaz and Ruth go on to marry and have a son,
                                    Obed, who becomes a forbearer of David and Christ, making Ruth,
                                    an outsider, essential to both Jewish and Christian lineage. </p>
                  <p>Moreover, in both Jewish and Christian theology, Ruth has been seen as an early, if not
                                <emph>the</emph> earliest, convert. But there is some ambiguity about just what she converted
                                    <emph>to</emph>: a family, a faith, an ethnic group, or something more like a nation? The ambiguity
                                    is embedded in Ruth’s pledge to Naomi. The “ands” (“. . . I will go;
                                    <emph>and</emph> where thou lodgest . . . thy people shall be my people,
                                    <emph>and</emph> thy God my God”) simultaneously elide and distinguish between territory, family,
                                    ethnicity, and religion. Because the Book of Ruth can be read at once as lauding and exposing the
                                    uncertainty of religious conversion and national belonging, its narrative resonated with nineteenth-century
                                    anxieties about Englishness and what Michael Ragussis has termed its “culture of conversion,” one fixated on
                                    Jews (15–17). Increasingly, writers, Christian and Jewish, employed the Book of Ruth as a lens through which
                                    to examine not only gender and conversion, but immigration, national belonging, and Jewish acceptance in modern England.</p>
                  <p>In the works about Ruth I consider in this essay, these topics manifest themselves in the emphasis (or notable
                                    lack thereof) on Ruth’s familial relationships and faith in God, depictions of land and landscape, and conception
                                    of “home,” a frequently invoked term intertwined with English domestic ideology
                                    <emph>and</emph> experiences of migration. I focus on Keats’s <title level="a">Ode,</title> then consider works that follow in its wake:
                                    Felicia Hemans’s and Thomas Hood’s poems entitled <title level="a">Ruth</title> and sculptor John Adams-Acton’s
                                    <title level="a">Ruth Amid the Alien Corn.</title> I conclude with a reading of Anglo-Jewish writer Grace Aguilar’s
                                    exegesis of Ruth in <title level="m">The Women of Israel</title> (1886), which
                                        subtly fashions Ruth not just as a Moabite convert to
                                        Judaism but as a Jewish immigrant in England. How might
                                        Keats’s revision of Ruth—one that reads her against the
                                        grain, to use an apt harvest metaphor—elucidate Romantic
                                        dynamics of longing and belonging? What does it mean to
                                        recast Ruth as an emblem of loneliness, in effect as an
                                        out-of-place immigrant, at this moment in early
                                        nineteenth-century English culture? I argue that Keats
                                        shaped a new representational tradition in which Ruth
                                        becomes a figure of alienation and loss. In doing so, Keats
                                        departs from the Bible but aligns with contemporaneous
                                        sympathies and anxieties about psychological, national, and
                                        religious otherness. As Aguilar averred, “the women of the
                                        Bible are but mirrors of ourselves” (8).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All Aguilar quotations come from

                  <p>That nineteenth-century writers saw England as analogous to
                                    Ruth’s Bethlehem is supported not only by the general view of
                                    England as a “new Israel” but by the specifics of the imagery
                                    and language used in some texts and visual art. Take Scottish
                                    poet William Tennant’s <title level="a">Ruth and Naomi</title> (1836), a poem reprinted

                                    associated with Romanticism to portray Ruth. In

                                    (213). He takes up Ruth in more detail in two captivating
                                    images, <ref target="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1795-William-Blake-Naomi-entreating-Ruth-Orpah.jpg">

                                    Both depict what Blake, in his <title level="m">Descriptive
                                    Catalogue</title>, deemed “the most pathetic passage in the
                                    Book of Ruth, where Naomi having taken leave of her daughters in
                                    law, with intent to return to her own country; Ruth cannot leave
                                    her, but says, ‘Whither thou goest [. . .]’” (549). Blake translates
                                    this passage into a tableau of three figures at the moment of
                                    decision, Ruth clinging to Naomi on the left and Orpah turning
                                    away on the right. “Naomi entreating . . .” offers a sadder, gloomier
                                    take on the scene, with Naomi’s expression pained and Orpah bent
                                    in grief. Blake’s second version of this scene, still somber, is
                                    more uplifting. Naomi’s arms are literally raised up, Ruth no
                                    longer crouching. They embrace more naturally, eye-to-eye, as if
                                    the image endorses their union. In both compositions, Ruth and
                                    Naomi are offset by Orpah. She functions as Ruth’s mirror image,
                                    her body echoing Ruth’s but traveling in the opposite direction,
                                    back towards Moab, towards the familiar past, to accentuate
                                    Ruth’s movement towards the future. </p>
                  <p>While Blake’s complex engagement with the Bible is well-covered,
                                    these images have received scant critical attention. In this,
                                    they are typical of Romantic representations of Ruth. Blake’s
                                    images are also typical—if anything in Blake’s idiosyncratic
                                    work can be deemed typical—in emphasizing Ruth’s relationship
                                    with Naomi and the moment of conversion and connection.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Among other artists to do

                                    What stands out about visual representations of Ruth from this period is their
                                    <emph>relationality</emph>. Whether they envision her refusal to leave Naomi, her first conversation with Boaz
                                    in his fields, their first night together on the threshing floor, or her holding Obed, they see Ruth as a social
                                    being, reinforcing her official roles of daughter-in-law, wife, mother, and/or ancestress of the Jewish and
                                    Christian people. Blake’s images are certainly not “cheerful.” But their sorrow stems from Ruth’s fear of division
                                    from Naomi; for nineteenth-century viewers who, raised
                                    on the King James Bible, all knew what was
                                    coming, they contain the promise of Ruth’s future happiness in her soon-to-be-home of Bethlehem.</p>
                  <p>With these iterations of Ruth in mind, I want to return to Keats,
                                    whose reference to Ruth is likely the most famous in
                                    nineteenth-century literature. <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> is one of
                                    six odes now located at the heart of the Keats canon and the
                                    Romantic tradition. Keats was twenty-four, two years before his
                                    death from tuberculosis, when he composed the poem in the spring
                                    of 1819. <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> has been read as a meditation on
                                    poetry’s power and limitations, as well as its relationship to
                                    music, represented by the nightingale’s “immortal” song (1ine
                                    61). Also notable is the poem’s attraction to erasure and
                                    escape, what Helen Vendler has termed “imaginative
                                    self-annihilation,” all familiar Romantic concerns
                                    (102). In the stanza preceding Ruth’s appearance, for example, Keats’s
                                    confides in the nightingale that

                                By the seventh stanza, Keats follows the nightingale’s song back
                                    in time:

                              Of all the religious and literary figures to select, why Ruth?
                                    Why “alien,” why the tears? Scholars have tried to account for Keats’s decision in various
                                    ways. Barry Gradman, for example, theorizes that, “while Keats
                                    here is speaking consciously of Ruth, he may be thinking,
                                    unconsciously, of Cordelia in <title level="m">King Lear</title>,”
                                    a link traced in part to their shared “filial piety” (16,
                                    22)—despite the very different sources, natures, and endings of
                                    their filial affection. Victor Lams hears echoes of Milton’s
                                    <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>. Most persuasive is Jeffrey
                                    Baker’s connection to Wordsworth’s <title level="a">Solitary Reaper</title> from 1807
                                    (152). There are some notable resemblances that suggest Keats
                                    may have been influenced in part by Wordsworth’s poem; in
                                    addition to referencing a nightingale, <title level="a">Solitary Reaper</title>
                                    features a woman “single in the field,” singing by herself a
                                    tune that haunts the speaker in ways that foreshadow the
                                    melancholy music of Keats’s nightingale. However, Wordsworth’s
                                    reaper is a generic “Highland lass,” a rural type rather than a
                                    specific individual or character, let alone one as well-known as
                                    a popular biblical figure.</p>
                  <p>Keats himself provided no explanation for his incorporation of
                                    Ruth. His letters contain only one reference to Ruth, but
                                    unrelated to the composition of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title>; he deems
                                    her a “deep one,” presumably due to her strategic enticement, at
                                    Naomi’s urging, of the sleeping Boaz on the threshing floor
                                    (<title level="a">Complete Works</title> 124–25). This letter only
                                    adds to the uncertainty of Keats’s poetic adaptation of Ruth,
                                    since in the poem she seems neither sensual nor sly, neither
                                    marriageable nor manipulative. To the extent that Keats would
                                    have viewed Ruth in relation to the Hebrew Bible, Judaism,
                                    and/or Jews, we can examine his letters on these topics; they
                                    include a few references to connections with and a few
                                    disparaging jibes at Anglo-Jews. For instance, in a letter from
                                    the same year as <title level="a">Ode,</title> he remarked, “I hope I have learned a
                                    little better and . . . am confident to cheat as well as any literary
                                    Jew of the Market and shine up an article on any thing without
                                    much knowledge of the subject” (95).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For
                                                  further comments on Anglo-Jews, see
                                                  Keats’s letter of Feb. 24th, 1819 to George and Georgiana, in which he
                                                  describes going to a chapel built by “a great Jew converter” who has
                                                  spent lots of money on “a great number of poor Jews.” Keats adds that
                                                  “of course his communion plate was stolen” and that the “converter”
                                                  spoke to his [presumably Jewish] clerk, who
                                                  apologized and said, “‘I dare shay, your honor,
                                                  it’s among ush’” (26). According to Andrew Motion, Keats’s mother may
                                                  have lived with a Jewish man named Abraham after his father’s death,
                                                  while Fanny Brawn married a Sephardic Jew after Keats’s death (32, 568).</note>
                                    This casual, depressingly familiar type of comment suggests
                                    Keats’s skepticism about the sincerity of Anglo-Jewish writers
                                    (note the way Jewish writers are figures of “the Market” rather
                                    than of the mind) but does little to illuminate his overarching
                                    opinions about Anglo-Jews, immigrants, or the Book of Ruth in
                                    this context. Thus, it is impossible to ascertain definitively what Keats was
                                    thinking when he selected Ruth for <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the poem’s language, imbued with its historical context, can
                                    help us arrive at a better understanding of how Keats’s Ruth
                                    functions in the poem and might have resonated with his readers
                                    as an outcast, a psychological other. To fully understand
                                    Keats’s startling revision of Ruth, we must recognize the way
                                    the poem links her not <emph>just</emph> to a
                                    universal, ahistorical sadness but <emph>also</emph>
                                    to contemporaneous socio-political discussions about territory,
                                    immigration, and national belonging. Particularly revealing are
                                    the phrases “sick for home” and “alien corn,” the latter of
                                    which presents an especially original, memorable juxtaposition.
                                    These phrases evoke early nineteenth-century debates about
                                    whether foreigners, and Jews specifically, could join an
                                    Englishness that sometimes saw them as—and sometimes itself
                                    seemed— “alien.” Assessing the place of representations of Jews
                                    and Judaism in Romantic culture, Judith Page maintains that they
                                    “test the Romantic faith in the efficacy of sympathetic
                                    imagination and its implied ideal of an inclusive community”
                                    (xii). Keats’s Ruth, who calls forth the readers’ sympathies
                                    precisely because of her marginality, her sense of being cut off
                                    from her homeland, reinforces this analysis. Keats extends his
                                    sympathetic imagination to Ruth by contemplating what it might
                                    feel like to be a foreigner away from one’s original home, and
                                    does so in part by granting <emph>her</emph> a
                                    sympathetic imagination, one capable of memory and desire. </p>
                  <p>Fittingly, the stanza featuring Ruth illustrates how the
                                    nightingale’s song can transcend the categories of time, nation,
                                    and class that structured early nineteenth-century English
                                    society. The poem tracks the song “[t]hrough . . . winding mossy
                                    ways,” back to the “ancient days” when it might have been heard
                                    by “emperor and clown.” The generality of these terms makes the
                                    arrival in the next lines of Ruth (the only specific character
                                    mentioned in the poem) all the more striking. Keats may have
                                    heard the same song as emperor and clown, but it is with Ruth
                                    that he feels a special kinship. From the ode’s opening
                                    confessional declaration—“My heart aches” (1) —Keats lays the
                                    groundwork for the parallel between Ruth’s “sad heart” and his
                                    own, transforming her into a figure of emotional struggle and
                                    estrangement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="m">Imagination

                                            Karla Alwes briefly
                                                  analyzes Ruth in similar, ahistorical terms as “a
                                                  wanderer and stranger” for whom “earth holds no
                                                  solace” but does not note the significant
                                                  departure this constitutes from the biblical
                                                  account of Ruth, whose solace arguably derives in
                                                  part through her gleaning from the earth’s bounty
                                                  (125).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But again, if Keats was looking for a literary or biblical figure
                                    symbolizing sorrow, surely there are more obvious choices. In
                                    the Bible, by the time she is gleaning, Ruth has already
                                    <emph>voluntarily</emph> pledged herself to this new
                                    land and people; while not yet married to Boaz, she is taking
                                    the first steps towards securing the happy ending: a successful
                                    marriage plot, to put it in nineteenth-century terms. The
                                    contrast between a more typical rendering of Ruth and Keats’s
                                    version can be illustrated by returning briefly to Tennant’s
                                    poem (published a few years after Keats’s but characteristic in
                                    its depiction of Ruth). Tennant’s version opens with Naomi
                                    telling her daughters-in-law to return home. <emph>Naomi</emph>,
                                    not Ruth, is the one who is “broken and
                                    forlorn” and “sick of heart” (6, 8); the phrase “lorn and sick
                                    of heart” becomes a kind of refrain, Naomi’s epithet. Following
                                    the biblical verses, Ruth and Orpah shed tears with Naomi at the
                                    thought of parting, but Orpah returns to Moab while Ruth vows to
                                    join Naomi as her comforter, preparing “sweet solace” (42) for
                                    her as they take their way to Bethlehem. As I noted at the
                                    start, this trajectory is presented in muted but optimistic
                                    tones, rising literally and figuratively with the poem’s final
                                    phrase: “green ascent.” </p>
                  <p>In contrast, there is no green ascent, no hopeful progress or
                                    welcomed familial inclusion for Ruth in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title>
                                    By the next stanza, the poem’s last, Ruth has also been cut off
                                    from Keats, or rather Keats has been cut off from her. The
                                    “forlorn” at the end of the Ruth stanza is repeated at the next
                                    stanza’s start. Keats is left with his “sole self” (72), a
                                    phrase underlining his aloneness, since by definition the self
                                    is one’s own. We might say he has been alienated from his fellow
                                    aliens. In fact, Keats excises all the other figures from the
                                    biblical story: his Ruth is neither daughter-in-law, wife/widow,
                                    vulnerable supplicant/youthful seductress, nor new wife/mother.
                                    Instead, she floats free from the Book of Ruth’s plot, almost as
                                    if she has been dropped into the poem’s dreamscape of “alien
                                    corn,” emphasizing the disconnect between Ruth and the land. </p>
                  <p>The only part of the Bible story that remains is her status as “a
                                    stranger,” though her attitude towards that status is quite
                                    different. Moab is unnamed, but presumably it is the “home” for
                                    which she longs. It’s as if Keats’s Ruth has a touch of Orpah in
                                    her, a reluctance to leave what Keats implies was her true
                                    country. The description of Ruth raises the question: can one
                                    actually be “sick” for home? The concept of homesickness or
                                    nostalgia was comparatively new, emerging in the mid-1700s among
                                    soldiers, travelers, and immigrants in an increasingly mobile
                                    European society; starting with Swiss doctor Johannes Hofer in
                                    the late 1680s, it was thought to be an actual, physiological
                                    disease—meaning one could literally be “sick for home.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> The OED cites 1748 as the first use of “homesick.” On the

                                    Perhaps Keats, who trained as a surgeon, would have been
                                    familiar with this diagnosis. In any case, Keats creates a Ruth
                                    who is out of place, nostalgic for her lost country. He
                                    implicitly adopts the immigrant condition as a symbol of his own
                                    dislocation and emotional exile. In doing so, he modifies the
                                    pattern of Shelley, Coleridge, and Wordsworth, all of whom at
                                    some point appropriated the figure of the Wandering Jew to
                                    embody a broader or more personal sense of restless estrangement

                  <p>The Book of Ruth, Adele Berlin asserts, is about “the continuity
                                    of the people and its land” (260), from exile and return, to
                                    customs governing harvest and land inheritance. Similarly, J.
                                    Hillis Miller sees the Book as a “story . . . organized around the
                                    crossing of borders and the establishment of territorial rights”
                                    (217). In <title level="a">The Politics of Gleaning in Keats,</title> Andrew Bennett
                                    elucidates an aspect of these territorial rights relevant to
                                    Keats’s cultural moment. Bennett explains that in 1818, due to
                                    new laws governing enclosures that restricted access to land
                                    previously available for harvest, the “the very concept of the
                                    gleaner underwent a sea-change—from the archetypal beneficiary
                                    of charity to a criminal . . .” (34–38). Building on Bennett’s
                                    analysis of those excluded from the bounty of English land, I
                                    want to add another implication of “alien corn.” </p>
                  <p>In early nineteenth-century culture, the term “alien” was one
                                    with dual registers. There is the <emph>emotional</emph> alienation associated with Romantic poets
                                    and that we have already seen at work in Keats’s poem (“do I
                                    wake or sleep?”). But there is also a <emph>national</emph> meaning of “alien”: an immigrant or outsider
                                    from Englishness. “Alien” did not refer to Jews only, yet the
                                    term was regularly used to describe them and surfaced often in
                                    deliberations over their legal and cultural status. From the
                                    so-called “Jew Bill” of 1753 to the Aliens Act and creation of
                                    the Aliens Office in 1793, and early efforts at Jewish
                                    emancipation, Keats was writing during a period in which there
                                    was a proliferation of parliamentary speeches, sermons, novels,
                                    and articles about whether Jews belonged in England (which had
                                    only allowed them back under Cromwell in 1656), whether they
                                    could or must convert to Protestantism, and whether they
                                    deserved “alien” status. Examples range from texts as different

                                    but to remain perpetual Aliens” [Lemoine
                                    18]). Within a decade after the publication of <title level="a">Ode

                                    Jewish Disabilities, Robert Peel would endorse the view that
                                    “The Jew . . . is regarded in the light of an alien—he is excluded
                                    because he will not amalgamate with us in any of his usages or
                                    habits.” In contrast, Thomas Macaulay would reject the logic that Jews
                                    “cannot be made Englishmen altogether. The statesman who treats
                                    them as aliens, and then abuses them for not entertaining all
                                    the feelings of natives, is as unreasonable as the tyrant who
                                    punished their fathers for not making bricks without straw”
                                        (150).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Thomas Babbington
                                            Macaulay, <title level="a">Jewish Civil Disabilities</title> (1829).
                                            The Aliens Act of 1793 also continued to have implications for Jews,
                                            occasionally being used to deport “suspicious” Jewish peddlers
                                            (Endelman 276). Although they do not address Ruth in Keats, Hemans,
                                            or Aguilar, Sheila Spector’s two edited collections of work on British
                                            Romanticism and Jews offer helpful overviews of the way Jews informed
                                            and were informed by Romanticism and English politics between the defeat
                                            of the “Jew Bill” and Emancipation.</note>
                                    This kind of public discourse, I suggest, informed the way
                                    Keats’s readers encountered his Ruth, a Jew who is also not a
                                    Jew and an alien who is also not an alien, when they found her
                                    “amidst the alien corn.” She can be read as a woman gleaning
                                    simultaneously in the fields of ancient Bethlehem and early
                                    nineteenth-century England, a convert to (proto) Judaism in the
                                    Bible and as a Jewish immigrant to modern England.</p>

                                    But Adams-Acton’s Ruth is directly mediated by Keats’s poem; the
                                    line “Ruth, when, sick for home, she stood in tears amid the
                                    alien corn” is engraved at the bottom of the pedestal upon which
                                    she stands. Even without the quotation, this Ruth captures a
                                    Keatsian sorrow and isolation in marble. She stands, leaning on
                                    one hip, knee slightly bent, head down. She looks as if she has
                                    fallen into an unhappy memory, having ceased the gleaning
                                    indicated by the sheaves of wheat at her side. Her youthful face
                                    and despondent pose radiate homesickness, while her unclothed
                                    torso adds an element of eroticism, making her a figure of
                                    sympathy and sexual appeal.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Adams-Acton was thinking, too, of Thomas Hood’s poem
                                    <title level="a">Ruth</title> (1827), which eyes Ruth through the desirous gaze of
                                    Boaz, the poem’s speaker. Hood moved in similar circles to and
                                    was deeply influenced by Keats in his serious verse, including
                                    his <title level="a">Ruth,</title> published eight years after Keats’s <title level="a">Ode</title>
                                    (Whitley 39). Like Keats, Hood
                                    envisions Ruth not with Naomi, but in the fields: “Thus she
                                    stood amid the stooks . . .” (15). Yet the similarities end here.
                                    Boaz paints Ruth as both sexually fertile (“she stood breast
                                    high amid the corn” [l.1], her skin is “ripened” and has the
                                    “glowing kiss” of the sun [6, 4]), and domestically devoted
                                    (“Praising God with sweetest looks” [16]). The poem concludes by
                                    offering an implicit alternative to Keats’s “homesick,”
                                    alienated Ruth. Boaz’s final line offers to “share my harvest
                                    and my home” (20). The alliterative linkage between “harvest”
                                    and “home” underscores the biblical narrative of Ruth’s
                                    integration into a new “home” through immigration and
                                    intermarriage. Her gleaning—and Boaz’s willingness to
                                    share—analogizes the view of immigrants as welcomed to the
                                    fruits of the land.</p>
                  <p>The most interesting, in my view, of the texts resembling Keats’s
                                    <title level="a">Ode</title> is Felicia Hemans’s sonnet <title level="a">Ruth</title> from her late collection
                                    <title level="m">Female Characters of Scripture: A Series
                                    of Sonnets</title> (1833, 1834). The most famous poet of the
                                    era, Hemans was “met with immediate and extensive popularity,”
                                    according to one Victorian critic (qtd. in Wolfson 602–3); her
                                    best-known poems became “virtual national anthems” (Wolfson
                                    xiii). Over the past two decades, scholars have reassessed
                                    Hemans’s ambiguous place within the (traditionally masculine)
                                    Romantic literary landscape—including whether she should be seen
                                    as Romantic at all or rather as an early Victorian—and debated
                                    her constructions of gender, nationalism, and empire (Leighton
                                    2, Cronin 67–109). Throughout her poetry, themes of motherhood,
                                    faith, “feminine” subservience and yet also female
                                    self-expression predominate. Her work might be said, drawing on
                                    titles to two of her collections, to offer
                                    <title level="m">Records of Woman</title> with a particular, if not untroubled,
                                    focus on championing <title level="m">Domestic
                                    Affections</title>.</p>
                  <p>Despite such engagement with domesticity and gendered
                                    spirituality, Hemans’s late work on biblical women has garnered
                                    relatively little attention, her portrayal of <title level="a">Ruth</title> even less.
                                    (For instance, accomplished recent readings of Hemans’s work by
                                    Wolfson, Angela Leighton, Jason Rudy and others do not discuss
                                    these sonnets at all.) There are a few helpful exceptions. In
                                    <title level="a">Glorification of the Lowly in Felicia Hemans’ Sonnets ‘Female
                                    Characters of Scripture’,</title> Anne Nichols laments the overlooking
                                    of Hemans’s late religious works in part because they capture
                                    “the ambivalence [Hemans] and many of her contemporaries held
                                    towards the position of women,” ultimately employing biblical
                                    figures to “broad[en] standard definitions of acceptable
                                    femininity” (559, 574). Others have noted the sonnets’
                                    “contradictory combination of the emancipatory and the
                                    conservative,” concluding that the collection is more
                                    gender-flexible than readers might expect (Mason and Roberts
                                        73).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See <title level="a">Glorification of the

                                                  emphasizes her domesticity and her progress from
                                                  “lowly” to “exalted” in ways that typologically
                                                  align with Hemans’s representations of New

                                    offers a test case for Hemans’s emphasis on women’s power, one
                                    that hinges on the now-familiar, if frequently contested, “sense
                                    of home” in early nineteenth-century culture and Romantic

                     <title level="a">Ruth</title> is one of fifteen sonnets in <title level="m">Female
                                    Characters of Scripture</title>, first published in
                                    <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> in 1833. The collection was
                                    initially divided into two sections: one featured Old Testament
                                    <title level="a">Daughters of Judah,</title> from Miriam and Ruth to Rizpah and the
                                    Shunamite woman; the other focused on New Testament figures such
                                    as Mary, Mary Magdalene, and the <title level="a">Penitent Anointing Christ’s
                                    Feet.</title> That Hemans (who earlier published <title level="a">The Hebrew Mother</title>)
                                    frames Ruth with the Hebrew Bible suggests she views Ruth in a
                                    specifically Jewish but also a typologically-driven
                                    “Judeo-Christian” context.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Cynthia Scheinberg notes
                                    that the rise of the female poet (as cultural image and economic figure) parallels
                                    the rise of discussions of Jewish identity and nationality (35).</note>
                                    The collection opens with a bifurcated invocation. The first
                                    part summons “the gracious Forms” of Old Testament women, with
                                    their “dark prophetic Eastern eyes,” to return and “renew”
                                    contemporary England (597)—a figurative, poetic immigration of
                                    sorts. The second part shifts to New Testament women, who are
                                    praised not for their “prophetic” power but for their “heart
                                    subdued” (597). The first sonnet, a tribute to Miriam, provides
                                    the clearest championing of female poetic skill (Melnyk
                                    74). However,
                                    <title level="a">Ruth,</title> the second sonnet, retreats from that “prophetic”
                                    vision, resting Ruth’s appeal on her “calm heart” and “gentle
                                    eye.” I cite the sonnet in full:

                              Compared to Keats, Hemans draws more overtly on the Biblical
                                    account. As in the Bible, Ruth’s gentleness and devotion are
                                    prominent, particularly her devotion to God. Hemans repurposes
                                    the best-known part of Ruth’s pledge as the sonnet’s final line,
                                    emphasizing its import with the couplet’s rhyme (“tone”/“own”).
                                    (Weaving the language of the Bible directly into verse was a
                                    common strategy in poetic representations of biblical figures at
                                    this time.) </p>
                  <p>Yet the “image” of Ruth that is “brought back” to Hemans, I
                                    argue, derives more from Keats than the King James.<note place="foot" resp="author"> There
                                        is, to my knowledge, no direct documentary evidence that Hemans modeled her sonnet on
                                        Keats, but she read widely in the literature of the period, was personally friendly with
                                        Wordsworth, Shelley, and other Romantic poets, and also seems to echo Keats in other poems;
                                        Gary Kelly, for instance, notes the resemblance between a passage in Keats’s <title level="a">Ode
                                        on a Grecian Urn</title> and one of Hemans’s in <title level="m">Forest
                                                  Sanctuary</title> (<title level="m">Felicia Hemans</title> 233n1).
                                                  Ultimately, I think the similarities of language
                                                  and approach in the texts themselves constitute
                                                  sufficient evidence to support this reading. Even
                                                  if Hemans did not know <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> her
                                                  sonnet would still buttress my thesis that there
                                                  was a cultural shift towards representing Ruth as
                                                  alienated and homesick.</note> There
                                    are many echoes of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> here: corn, bird,
                                    tears, weariness, the Romantic atmospherics of “dreamy motion
                                    fann’d.” Both poets approach Ruth from the perspective of the
                                    lyric <emph>I</emph> rather than a detached
                                    third-person observer or Ruth herself. Nor do they write from
                                    the position of another figure from the story, as Hood does with
                                    Boaz. In fact, Boaz and Naomi are notably absent from Hemans’s
                                    adaptation just as they are from Keats’s (technically Naomi is
                                    implied by “thy,” but the referent is never made explicit). In
                                    Hemans, the speaker seems almost to be re-living an experience
                                    of witnessing Ruth in the fields at harvest time: “I see thee
                                    stand / Lone, midst the gladness of the harvest-band,” the
                                    speaker recounts. Whether this “I” is part of the
                                    “harvest-band,” a detached observer, or perhaps Hemans herself
                                    is unclear. But it is the Romantic affiliation with Ruth’s
                                    marginalized condition and the implicit testament to the power
                                    of imagination to call it forth from personal or cultural memory
                                    that is central. </p>
                  <p>As this reference to Ruth’s loneliness indicates, the resemblance
                                    to Keats is most significant in the way Hemans, too, fashions a
                                    sympathetically isolated Ruth. The poem ostensibly argues for
                                    the <emph>lack</emph> of regret Ruth feels having
                                    chosen her new family and faith in Bethlehem:

                     </quote>
                                In other words, Hemans implies that Ruth’s nostalgic sorrow for
                                    her people and her nation (“fatherland”) is exceeded by her
                                    religious faith. </p>
                  <p>Yet the poem’s muted tone and repetition of Ruth’s solitude run
                                    counter to this argument. There is something insistent and
                                    almost monitory in “’tis not to rue,” as if the speaker is
                                    trying to convince Ruth, readers, and herself that Ruth has no
                                    second thoughts. The “forlornness” of the epithet “O forlorn /
                                    Yet not forsaken Ruth!” lingers on. In fact, “forlorn” lingers
                                    from Keats, who uses the word twice in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title>
                                    Hemans paints Ruth “lone, as a wood-bird” allied with nature
                                    rather than the surrounding people. Even within nature, Hemans
                                    describes Ruth as a bird in the wrong natural space—a wood-bird
                                    stranded, fatally, over the ocean. (The brutality of “fall’n in
                                    its weariness” can be missed upon first reading—“perilous seas”
                                    indeed.) Hemans further isolates Ruth “lone, midst the gladness
                                    of the harvest-band.” She is cut off from the comfort of both
                                    nature <emph>and</emph> culture; the “harvest-band” in
                                    Bethlehem is rejoicing without her and Moab is “smil[ing] far
                                    away!” Again, it is worth noting this puzzling departure from
                                    the Book of Ruth, in which Moab is not depicted sentimentally.
                                    No substantive details about the land are provided, aside from
                                    the fact that this is where Naomi’s husband and two sons die.
                                    Ruth herself never looks homeward or signals any doubts about
                                    her decision. Instead, she repeatedly expresses gratitude for
                                    the kindness shown to her as “a Moabitish damsel” in this new
                                    land of promise and plenty (Ruth 2.6). </p>
                  <p>The alienation of Hemans’s Ruth is mitigated by the poem’s
                                    reliance on the gendered trope of home. Hemans’s investment in
                                    home, Deborah Kennedy argues, should not be read as merely a
                                    sign of “conventional domesticity. If we only view the word
                                    ‘home’ as an encoded term for the oppression of women, then we
                                    deprive it of a complex of significations” (281–2). (Kennedy
                                    does not address <title level="a">Ruth</title> but her analysis of home in Hemans’s
                                    oeuvre can apply to <title level="m">Female Characters of
                                    Scripture</title>.) <title level="a">Ruth</title> implies that its protagonist,
                                    despite mourning her homeland, has forged a more valuable,
                                    transportable version of home. “Home” is contained in the
                                    feminine “affectionate . . . glance” rather than a physical space.
                                    This notion of “home” embodied, literally, in women’s bodies
                                    offers some measure of control and “calm” in an unpredictable
                                    world. </p>
                  <p>But the notion that home can be constructed out of woman’s love
                                    and embodied affection is undercut by the ultimate aloneness and
                                    loneliness of Hemans’s Ruth. If “home” resides in a woman’s
                                    glance, who will actually look into Ruth’s “gleam[ing]” eyes?
                                    Who will “recognise” Ruth’s “pure” love? Emma Mason and Jonathan
                                    Roberts read the absence of male biblical figures in the sonnet
                                    collection as a strategy Hemans employs to redistribute
                                    narrative power to women (72). This rings true for Hemans’s
                                    account of Miriam, and might make sense in terms of leaving out
                                    Boaz, or even Obed. But what about Naomi? Would not the poem’s
                                    articulation of female influence through shared affection be
                                    more powerful if Ruth had someone with whom she could share it?
                                    The biblical text as well as the many visual representations of
                                    Ruth provided a range of representational strategies embodying
                                    Ruth’s inclusion. By choosing to focus on Ruth weeping rather
                                    than entwined with Naomi, Boaz, or Obed, Keats and Hemans
                                    rewrite Ruth’s defining characteristics as loneliness,
                                    alienation, and nostalgia. </p>

                                    Aguilar’s <title level="a">Women of Israel</title> (1844). Aguilar
                                    is a fitting writer with whom to conclude because she was
                                    indebted to Romanticism’s language of feeling, particularly
                                    Hemans’s narratives of domesticity and spirituality (Galchinsky
                                    373); like Keats, Hood, and Hemans, her understanding of Ruth
                                    pivoted on conceptions of home as domestic and national space.
                                    Yet she offers a distinctive Anglo-Jewish rebuttal to the
                                    construction of an alienated Ruth. “No Jewish female author has
                                    attained the . . . well-deserved popularity achieved by Grace
                                    Aguilar,” <title level="j">The Jewish Chronicle</title> declared:
                                    “Her numerous literary productions have been read and
                                    appreciated in England, America, Germany, and France. Her
                                    <title level="m">Women of Israel</title> . . . is a book teeming with
                                    powerful lessons to her own sex and eloquent exhortation to the
                                    opposite sex” (qtd. in <title level="m">Cyclopædia</title> 69).
                                    The foundational lesson Aguilar imparts is not just the value of
                                    Jewish women in biblical history, something she thinks has been
                                    overlooked both in the patriarchal Jewish exegetical tradition
                                    and the Protestant mythologizing of Jewish women, but their
                                    striking relevance. She follows Hemans’s lead to consider how
                                    “female characters of scripture” might serve as “warning” and
                                    “example” for nineteenth-century women, Anglo-Jewish women in
                                    particular (7). As “mirrors of ourselves” (14), the Women of
                                    Israel refract nineteenth-century concerns about the
                                    compatibility of Englishness and
                                    Jewishness. This

                                    We now come to a portion of our history as women of Israel which
                                    from the loveliness of female character that it displays, has in
                                    neither history nor romance been equaled. In the Bible it is
                                    termed the book of Ruth; but as Ruth does not properly belong by
                                    birth and ancestry to the women of Israel, Naomi must be the
                                    subject of our consideration. With her history, however, Ruth is
                                    so entwined that we cannot reflect on the one without also
                                    pausing on the touching beauty of the other. (223)
                                    </quote>
                                This seemingly perfunctory introduction, with its familiar
                                    gendered praise, perfectly captures the paradox of Ruth’s
                                    belonging: on the one hand, Aguilar claims that she “does not
                                    properly belong,” a belonging predicated on lineage and
                                    ethnicity that cannot be erased even after conversion, marriage,
                                    or immigration. With its vaguely coercive “must,” the passage
                                    redirects our attention to Naomi. On the other hand, Aguilar
                                    recognizes that Ruth is “so entwined” with Jews, that it’s
                                    impossible to ignore her. Nor, it seems as the chapter
                                    progresses, does Aguilar want to. </p>
                  <p>In fact, what makes Aguilar’s interpretation of Ruth so
                                    interesting—on its own terms and in light of the trajectory of
                                    Ruths previously surveyed—is how it subtly inverts the original
                                    story, aligning the non-Jewish Ruth with Victorian Jews and the
                                    Jewish Naomi with Protestant England. This inversion is evident
                                    in Aguilar’s repeated emphasis on Ruth’s <emph>choosing</emph>
                                    to become a Jew, which makes her “as worthy
                                    if not even more so to be the ancestress of David than the
                                    lineal descendants of Abraham” (236). Aguilar writes:
                                    <quote>
                                    When Ruth resigned alike home, parents, and the gods of her
                                    youth, she voluntarily engrafted herself upon the children of
                                    God . . . her acceptance of, and obedience to, the Law were entirely
                                    <emph>voluntary</emph> not merely received from
                                    education and as heritage. (235)

                                    In this reading, Anglo-Jews are like Ruth in that they (or their
                                    ancestors) voluntarily chose to move to England and accept
                                    English laws and habits; thus they could be viewed as not only
                                    equal but more worthy of Englishness than those who have
                                    “merely” inherited it. </p>
                  <p>To a writer who articulated her frustration that in England “Jews
                                    are still considered aliens and foreigners” and thus
                                    “separated . . . from sympathy and fellowship” (Aguilar, <title level="a">History</title>
                                    332), Keats’s version of Ruth in the “alien corn” might have
                                    struck a discordant note. Yet Aguilar’s reading of Ruth likewise
                                    meditates upon what Ruth might have remembered about her past
                                    and whether true belonging in a new land is possible. Aguilar is
                                    clear that Ruth has not forgotten—“We never find Ruth forgetting
                                    her origin” (244), we are reassured—but she differentiates
                                    between forgetting and nostalgizing. By privileging choice and
                                    faith over blood and race, Aguilar attempts to transform the
                                    potentially unsettling fact that Ruth continues to be seen as
                                    simultaneously Israelite and Moabite into a model for Anglo-Jews
                                    to be both English and Jewish. Her Ruth preserves a degree of
                                    difference, yet is emphatically part of the national family. In
                                    Bethlehem/England, she is not “sick for home”: she <emph>is</emph> home.</p>
                  <p>In situating Aguilar in an artistic lineage—a “maternal line”?—of
                                    Ruths, my aim has been to demonstrate that such Romantic
                                    adaptations of Ruth were in conversation with each other,
                                    conversations that crossed medium and genre. Moreover, I hope to
                                    have demonstrated that such works were also in conversation with
                                    fundamental nineteenth-century cultural concerns not often seen
                                    as relevant to the seemingly “cheerful,” pastoral idyll of the
                                    Book of Ruth. Without registering the backdrop of British
                                    desires and anxieties about forms of alienation, belonging, and
                                    belief, we risk missing what made Ruth both so popular and so
                                    meaningful. For it is not despite but precisely
                                    <emph>because</emph> there is a debate about whether
                                    Ruth “does not properly belong” that she is so “entwined”
                                    with—indeed, so at home in—the nineteenth-century cultural
                                    imagination.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">Israel Zangwill (1864-1926) was a literary celebrity, a Zionist,
                    and a suffrage activist, and, in his time, possibly the best-known Jewish writer
                    in the Anglophone world. His 1892 novel <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> became a British
                    and American bestseller; in 1908 his play <title level="m">The Melting-Pot</title> argued for the value
                    of immigration and provided future studies of ethnicity with a much-debated
                    metaphor. By the middle of the twentieth century, however, Zangwill’s fame had
                    declined, and his best-known work of fiction was likely <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>
                    (1894), a short novel that solidified his fame as a Jewish humorist. In fact,
                    however, this comedic work that Zangwill published in a volume of “grotesques
                    and fantasies” embeds some of his most trenchant social criticism and satire.
                    Indeed, <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> presents in a subtle and palatable form radical
                    ideas of economic justice that Zangwill always saw as Jewish.</p>

               <p> At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Israel
                Zangwill (1864–1926) was a literary celebrity, a political activist, and possibly
                the best-known Jew in the Anglophone world. He was the author of
                <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> (1892), a novel about the Jews of London that
                became a British and American bestseller and was widely translated. In 1908 he wrote
                the play <title level="m">The Melting-Pot</title>, which argued for the value of
                immigration to American culture and provided future studies of ethnicity with a
                much-debated metaphor. Having started his career as a journalist, Zangwill wrote a
                number of novels and plays, as well as short stories, and not only on Jewish
                subjects. He advocated for British women’s suffrage and was a leader in, first,
                Theodor Herzl’s Zionist movement and, later, the Jewish Territorial Organization,
                which he founded. Zangwill’s writings as well as his activism attest to a strong
                sense of social justice, while his literary work often nested serious questions in a
                web of humorous characterization and wordplay. Such an apparently mixed modality
                often led to mixed reviews; while some critics might have found the humor jarring,
                others wished Zangwill would stick only to humor. By the middle of the twentieth
                century, when it was excerpted by Nathan Ausubel in
                <title level="m">A Treasury of Jewish Folklore</title> and
                reissued in the United States by Shoe String Press, Zangwill’s best-known work of
                fiction was probably <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> (1894), a work
                which solidified Zangwill’s fame as a Jewish humorist. Now that more of Israel
                Zangwill’s work has been republished, and Zangwill himself has come under more
                serious study,<note place="foot" resp="author"> For recent full-length studies of Zangwill,
                                see works by Adams, Rochelson, Udelson, Winehouse, and
                                Wohlgelernter. The bibliographies in those books should lead to
                                article-length critical essays.</note> it is worth looking at how that masterpiece of humor also
                embeds some of Israel Zangwill’s most biting social criticism.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was first published in six monthly
                parts in the <title level="j">Idler</title>, a new literary magazine edited by Jerome
                K. Jerome and Robert Barr. Zangwill became associated with Jerome after publishing
                short stories and satirical columns in Jewish periodicals, and, in 1890, becoming
                editor of the comic newspaper <title level="j">Puck</title>, which he renamed
                <title level="j">Ariel</title>. For the <title level="m">Idler</title>, Zangwill wrote
                several short stories and an essay for the series <title level="m">My First
                Book</title> before serializing <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in Volume Four,
                from August 1893 to January 1894.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Afterward, Zangwill
                    became a regular contributor to the <title level="j">Idler’s Club</title>, a forum featuring
                    <title level="j">Idler</title> writers on aspects of current
                            culture.</note> The
                <title level="j">Idler</title> was, in general, a magazine for
                light reading by intelligent readers, but with diverse kinds of contributions. Anne
                Humpherys describes its tone as “liberal, irreverent, and sentimental,”<note place="foot" resp="author"> This phrase appears in quotation marks in Humpherys’s essay, possibly
                    quoted from the entry on Robert Barr—Jerome’s co-editor—by Alison Janice Minoff Cox in
                    the <title level="m">Dictionary of Literary Biography</title>, vol. 70, Gale, 1988,
                    cited earlier in the same paragraph.</note> but makes clear that it did not have any narrow political
                or moral agenda:
                <quote>
                Fiction of course was prominent, but there were also articles on the theatre, books,
                and exhibitions. There were interviews with celebrities of various sorts, and
                educational essays on natural history, foreign countries and alien cultural
                practices as well as tours of historical buildings. The fiction from the beginning
                included detective and adventure stories, but also a good number of more or less
                sentimental stories of love and romance. (2)

            Serialization of <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> helped Zangwill to naturalize Jewish life in British,
                American, and modern European culture at the same time as it placed him in the
                center of English letters. Jerome and Barr sought diversity in content and
                authorship, and thus the magazine featured most of the 1890s’ best known literary
                writers, with the possible significant exception of writers in the aesthetic
                movement. <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>’ serialized chapters
                followed Part II of <title level="m">Royal Pets</title>, by Ernest M. Jessop; an
                episode of the <title level="j">Idler’s Club</title> (a forum of writers’ opinions on
                current topics); <title level="a">My First Book</title> essays by Marie Corelli, 
                <title level="a">John Strange Winter</title>
                (Henrietta Stannard), and Jerome K. Jerome; and Part II of the story <title level="a">Exchange
                <emph>is</emph> Robbery,</title> by Richard Marsh, best known today, perhaps, as
                author of <title level="m">The Beetle</title> (1897). Other works in the volume
                included a story by Arthur Conan Doyle and a profile of George Meredith. Zangwill
                would have been pleased by his serial’s placement, and he was an
                <title level="j">Idler</title> “regular.” </p>
               <p> The appearance of the entire first chapter of <title level="m">The King</title> in
                Ausubel’s <title level="m">Treasury of Jewish Folklore</title> suggests that the story
                was taken from traditional materials and has become part of folklore itself, and,
                indeed, there is a chicken/egg question surrounding this short novel. Which came
                first: <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> or the widespread understanding
                among Ashkenazi Jews of the humor inherent in the Yiddish term of its title?
                Zangwill acknowledged his debt to tradition in his foreword to the 1894 volume
                reprint: “I have merely amused myself and attempted to amuse idlers by incarnating
                the floating tradition of the Jewish <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Schnorrer</hi>, who is as
                unique among beggars as Israel among nations” (v). Ausubel ascribes this uniqueness
                to the wit with which the schnorrer<note place="foot" resp="author"> I have chosen
                    not to italicize this term unless it appears italicized in quoted matter, since
                    both Merriam-Webster and the OED present it as an English word, as I will explain.</note>
                cajoles funds from donors, and the wealth of Judaic
                learning with which this particular type of beggar abashes the materially wealthy,
                and Zangwill’s “King”—Manasseh Bueno Barzillai Azevedo da Costa—has wit and Jewish
                learning in abundance. Bernard Winehouse and Edna Nahshon both credit Zangwill’s
                novella with promoting the image of this wily character, but acknowledge, as well,
                that Zangwill was well-versed in the history of the schnorrer figure long before he
                created Manasseh, and had included schnorrers in earlier writings. Yet Zangwill’s
                memorable <title level="m">King of Schnorrers</title>—the novella and the
                character—certainly helped popularize the term, which was, according to the OED, an
                un-italicized English word as early as 1899. One might well ask whether, when Freud
                related a “salmon mayonnaise” story in <title level="m">Jokes and their Relation to
                    the Unconscious</title>, he was thinking of a traditional folkloric example or of
                Zangwill’s Manasseh justifying his purchase of salmon after receiving the wealthy
                Grobstock’s charity: “If I do not buy salmon when I have two guineas, . . . when
                shall I buy salmon?” (<title level="m">King</title> 16).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As
                    Freud retells this “Jewish joke,” “An impoverished individual borrowed 25 florins from a
                    prosperous acquaintance, with many asseverations of his necessitous circumstances. The very
                    same day his benefactor met him again in a restaurant with a plate of salmon mayonnaise in
                    front of him. The benefactor reproached him. . . .‘I don’t understand,’ replied the object
                    of the attack; ‘if I haven’t any money I <emph>can’t</emph> eat salmon mayonnaise, and if I
                    have some money I <emph>mustn’t</emph> eat salmon mayonnaise. Well, then, when
                    <emph>am</emph> I to eat salmon mayonnaise?’” (49–50).</note> Freud had written to a friend, in 1897,
                that “for some time past I have been putting together a collection of Jewish
                anecdotes” (4), and one may speculate on whether his sources included Zangwill’s
                work. However, given the length to which Zangwill spins out the episode beyond the
                initial joke—at the end of Chapter One having the embarrassed Grobstock appear to
                his servant as Manasseh’s food carrier—it is possible that Freud and Zangwill both
                used traditional sources, with the fiction writer expanding rather than explaining.
                When, in the film <title level="m">Animal Crackers</title> (1930), Groucho Marx
                responded to the crowd’s “Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer,” with,
                “Did someone call me schnorrer?” he assumed that audiences would understand the
                word—or that, if they didn’t, they should. The OED defines a schnorrer as,
                originally, a beggar (its basic and least evocative definition), but adds that now
                it has the connotations of “a scrounger, a freeloader; a layabout, a
                good-for-nothing.” Merriam-Webster’s more positive definition is closer to
                Zangwill’s and to Groucho’s: “one who wheedles others into supplying his or her
                wants.” It is the wheedling that characterizes Zangwill’s schnorrer and that gives
                the word a taste of bittersweet humor in the mouths of Jews today. </p>
               <p> In keeping with his desire to maintain a dual persona, when Zangwill published
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in volume form he added to it a
                collection of shorter stories, from the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> and from other periodicals, only a
                few of which had Jewish content. All were labeled together in a subtitle,
                <title level="m">Grotesques and Fantasies</title>, which itself suggests a certain
                ambivalence by Zangwill toward his subject matter. Zangwill’s friend Joseph Leftwich
                reported (from hearsay) that Zangwill had considered ending the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> serial halfway through, but Jerome
                persuaded him to continue (250). However, Leftwich goes on to quote Zangwill as,
                throughout his life, being gleeful at the success of his unusual protagonist and
                story. <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was
                Zangwill’s next extended work after his bestselling realist novel of Jewish life,
                <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> (1892),<note place="foot" resp="author"> His Jewish short story collection <title level="m">Ghetto
                        Tragedies</title> also appeared in 1893.</note>
                and he likely enjoyed the freedom of comedy unmixed with sorrow, and romance only
                barely mixed with realism. </p>
               <p> The concept of Romanticism in late Victorian literature is not new. In 2013, the
                Birkbeck Centre for Nineteenth-Century Studies and the English Faculty of Oxford
                University held a conference titled <title level="a">Romanticism at the Fin de Siècle,</title> which
                “place[d] Romanticism at the core” of that later cultural era (Announcement). One
                finds echoes of Romanticism in aestheticist theory and Romantic-seeming evocations
                of past eras in aesthetic poetry, prose, and visual art. For Zangwill, who was not
                in the aestheticist camp,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Although not a supporter
                    of “art for art’s sake,” Zangwill expressed sympathy with Oscar Wilde during his
                    trials and imprisonment; see Rochelson, pp. 80–81.</note>
                romance was a contrast to realism that helped contextualize bitter truths that he
                often took as his subject matter. The “Proem” to <title level="m">Children of the
                Ghetto</title>, a novel whose first full chapter is set in a late Victorian soup
                kitchen, takes place in early nineteenth-century London, its reminiscences of an
                earlier generation of Jews softened, as at its end, by a veil of nostalgia:
                <quote>
                Perhaps, here and there, some decrepit centenarian rubs his purblind eyes with the
                ointment of memory, and sees these pictures of the past, hallowed by the
                concentration of time, and finds his shriveled cheek wet with the pathos sanctifying
                the joys that have been. (69)
                </quote>
                In contrast,
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> announces its
                satiric mode from the start, but it, too, is set in the Romantic era, in this case,
                the late eighteenth century, “in the days when Lord George Gordon became a Jew, and
                was suspected of insanity; when, out of respect for the prophecies, England denied
                her Jews every civic right except that of paying taxes; . . .” (1). By the end of
                this first paragraph, however, the reader is immersed in the details of the story at
                hand. The outlandish costumes of its picaresque hero and outmoded eighteenth-century
                dress and furnishings of surrounding characters provide a distanced (and thus
                effectively dissonant) backdrop for 1894 social satire.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> begins by
                lampooning the rivalries between rich and poor, Sephardi and Ashkenazi, reversing
                expectations by making the wealthy man of German Jewish descent while the
                pauper/beggar is Iberian. The interethnic rivalry played upon here was part of a
                “myth of Sephardi superiority,”
                <quote>
                the belief that Jews from the Iberian peninsula were different in kind from other
                Jews, that they were superior by virtue of their culture, learning, wealth, descent,
                manners, or indeed even blood. (Endelman 226)
                </quote>
                The myth had its roots in medieval Spain. When the Jews were expelled from Spain and
                Portugal during the Inquisitions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it spread
                to other parts of Europe. As Todd Endelman has shown, however, by the late
                nineteenth century—and even the late eighteenth—Ashkenazi Jews outnumbered Sephardim
                in London, and by the mid-1800s “most of the important Jewish banking houses—the
                Rothschilds chief among them—traced their origins to the Frankfurt ghetto, not the
                courts and estates of Castile and Aragon” (228). Thus when suave, brilliant, and
                devout Manasseh outsmarts the rich but “coarse”<note place="foot" resp="author"> In Yiddish, <emph>grob</emph> means thick, fat, or
                    coarse; <emph>stock</emph>, in its most likely meaning here, is an
                                intensifier for darkness, as the adjective in such English
                                expressions as pitch dark or stone blind, suggesting Grobstock’s
                                ignorance despite his materialism (Weinreich <title level="m">Dictionary</title>).
                                However, Zangwill may also be suggesting
                                the English meaning, implying that the wealthy Jew comes from a
                                “coarse stock.”</note> Joseph Grobstock, Zangwill evokes laughter through the
                complex inversion of a stereotype—which, as Endelman also points out, was kept in
                public view by writer and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. However, by the end of
                    <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>, even the Sephardi elite falls
                against the power of Manasseh’s Jewish learning as well as his financial acumen.
                Edna Nahshon relates that the story’s final conflict has its root in an actual event
                of 1745, when a Sephardi synagogue warden petitioned the Mahamad (the Sephardic
                religious governing body) to marry an Ashkenazic woman (392–93), an event that is
                obliquely referred to in the novella. However, the fascinating but over-the-top
                Manasseh and the elaborate eighteenth-century costumes and settings that in George
                Hutchinson’s illustrations<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hutchinson frequently worked
                    with Zangwill, and his illustrations for <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>
                    appear in most editions of the book, even the
                                1953 reissue edited by Schilling. An exception is the 1960 Yoseloff
                                edition, with woodcut-like modernistic drawings by Henk
                                Krijger.</note> seem integral to the story may distract the reader from
                what is perhaps the most subversive satire in the plot. As Zangwill in
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> reverses easy expectations and
                prejudices, he also suggests new ways of looking at such terms as work, profession,
                investment, and wealth. Groucho is not the only Marx relevant to
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>.</p>
               <p> The language of commerce pervades this novella. Yes, there are comic reversals as
                the poorly yet fancifully attired schnorrer reminds the wealthy Grobstock and others
                that by schnorring he allows them to fulfill the commandment of helping the needy.
                Yes, Manasseh asserts a nobility of learning and religious devotion that places him
                above the shallow pomposities of Grobstock and the Sephardic Mahamad. But throughout
                the work a pattern of references makes clear that both rich and poor operate
                according to the same laws of exchange. When the dim but basically good-natured
                Grobstock realizes he owes Manasseh an apology, the narrator reports that he
                “proceeded honestly to pay it, but with a maladroit manner, as one unaccustomed to
                the currency” (8). When Grobstock offers three guineas for the salmon, while
                Manasseh has bargained for two, Manasseh reminds him that “this is not an auction”
                (14). Grobstock accuses Manasseh of theft because “a pauper—a beggar—with a wife and
                children” should not spend all he has—his charity from Grobstock—“on a mere luxury
                like salmon” (15–16). From here proceeds Zangwill’s version of the salmon joke,
                because once the money leaves Grobstock’s hand the salmon is no longer his. It is
                Manasseh’s property, and he has every right to do with it as he pleases. Similarly,
                when Grobstock gives Manasseh a trove of his used clothing, expecting Manasseh to
                wear it to dinner at his home and thus spare him shame before his servants, he is
                outraged to learn that Manasseh has immediately sold the items to a wealthy
                used-clothing dealer. When Manasseh replies that he can’t wear such clothes because
                “I know my station” (48), we suspect a multiple meaning. He knows the value of the
                clothing and he knows his own worth as a man, as well as a man of business. Once
                Grobstock gives him the clothes, again, they are Manasseh’s to use as he pleases. If
                Grobstock chooses to be embarrassed by Manasseh’s usual garb, that is none of
                Manasseh’s concern. However, since Manasseh will receive Grobstock’s clothing in
                perpetuity, he reminds the financier not to spill snuff on it or do anything else
                that might decrease its value. Similarly, when he agrees to sell the salmon back to
                Grobstock, he insists on three guineas, not two, the larger figure being the value
                Grobstock had originally assigned to it, along with profit for having been made into
                a middleman and “compensation for being degraded to fishmongering” as well as for
                losing the salmon itself (28–29)—even though he had already rebuked the financier
                for interrupting <emph>his</emph> original negotiations, saying he could
                have gotten the salmon for twenty-five shillings had Grobstock not offered the much
                higher price (18). Manasseh knows that value is equal only to the most that someone
                will pay for something and does not correspond to any so-called intrinsic worth. </p>
               <p> Before Manasseh agrees to take Grobstock’s clothing, he makes sure that Grobstock
                does not already have a “clothes-receiver” (22). Schnorring is a business, like
                Grobstock’s directorship in the East India Company, and it has its rules and ethics.
                One does not trespass on a competitor’s territory. Manasseh also insists that the
                position be permanent, because “it hurts one’s reputation to lose a client” (22).
                Similarly, one can present part of one’s own schnorring-ground as dowry to a
                prospective son-in-law (103–04). Yankelé, the Ashkenazi schnorrer to whom Manasseh
                will marry his daughter, enumerates to his prospective father-in-law what he will
                bring to the marriage through a combination of schnorring, selling old clothes, and
                carrying out synagogue and communal duties. Their conversation is filled with
                Wildean paradox:
                <quote>
                Manasseh shook his head. “<emph>Schnorring</emph> is the only occupation
                that is regular all the year round,” he said. “Everything else may fail—the greatest
                commercial houses may totter to the ground; as it is written, ‘He humbleth the
                proud.’ But the <emph>Schnorrer</emph> is always
                secure. Whoever falls, there are always enough left to look after <emph>him</emph>.
                If you were a father, Yankelé, you would understand my feelings. How
                can a man allow his daughter’s future happiness to repose on a basis so uncertain as
                work? (71)

                One can almost hear Lady Bracknell interrogating Jack Worthing, although
                <title level="m">The Importance of Being Earnest</title> had its
                first performance the year after <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was
                published.</p>
               <p> Writing about the short novel in 1953, less than a decade after the Holocaust ended,
                Bernard Schilling reminded readers of “the background of sorrow and evil” against
                which Jewish humor has flourished throughout Jewish history (vii), a context that
                later critics have not especially emphasized, while all who have written on
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> acknowledge its consonance with
                Zangwill’s lifelong concern for the poor. Indeed, as his reputation rose and fell in
                loftier circles even during his lifetime, he remained a hero to the immigrant Jews
                of the East End. But, as even Schilling points out, “the materials before us are
                much too funny for inquiry into their sadder implications” (xiv). Manasseh indeed
                has two professions, schnorrer and Talmud scholar, an explicator of Jewish law for
                those whose pursuits are wholly material. As he quotes from scripture and rabbinic
                texts to prevent potential almsgivers from falling into sin (since charity is an
                essential commandment), his learned conning provides a great deal of the novella’s
                comedy. Having already taken ownership of the packets of coins in the bag he has
                taken from Grobstock to carry the salmon, he further asks the financier if he might
                have left anything in the pockets of his clothes; if so, Manasseh will return to him
                anything “of no value to anybody but you” (33). He reminds the astounded financier
                of the biblical laws relating to gleaners:
                <quote>
                ‘When thou reapest thine harvest in thine field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the
                field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the
                fatherless, and for the widow.’ . . . You will admit that Moses would have added a
                prohibition against searching minutely the pockets of cast-off garments, were it not
                that for forty years our ancestors had to wander in the wilderness in the same
                clothes, which miraculously waxed with their growth. (34)
                </quote>
                At this point one assumes that Grobstock, concerned about appearances and not wanting
                to seem ignorant of Jewish law, would readily capitulate to Manasseh’s assumption of
                what is his due. He does so, but Zangwill goes further, noting that “Grobstock’s
                magnanimity responded to the appeal.” Additional descriptions of this sort affirm
                that Grobstock’s magnanimity is genuine; after all, he first appears in the novella
                giving alms to a crowd of beggars outside the synagogue. In a novella that ends with
                Manasseh carrying out the greatest schnorr of all—getting the Sephardic leadership
                to agree to the marriage of Sephardic Deborah and Ashkenazic Yankelé <emph>and</emph>
                granting the King of Schnorrers an income for
                life—Zangwill calls upon the forces of law and business to bring this about. </p>
               <p> The middle chapters of
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> examine how
                Yankelé is able to demonstrate his professional prowess to Manasseh by schnorring
                dinner at the home of a notoriously stingy rabbi. The last two chapters of the six,
                however, reveal Manasseh appearing before the court of the Mahamad, using his verbal
                wit to show that Sephardi officialdom is as pompous as any <emph>grob</emph> German.
                Manasseh knows the <title level="m">Ascamot</title> (or <title level="m">Laws and Regulations</title>) better
                than the authorities do, and he
                knows that nowhere in this document is the marriage between a Sephardi and an
                Ashkenazi Jew prohibited (117).<note place="foot" resp="author"> The <title level="m">Ascamot</title>,
                    known in English as <title level="m">The Laws and Regulations of the

                    or Gate of Heaven, as Zangwill refers to it in the text. (The correct name

                    it appears as Gates of Heaven in the 1894 volume.) We may assume that Zangwill

                defends on the ground that “she is not a male . . . ; she is not an active agent,
                she has not gone out of her way to choose a Tedesco<note place="foot" resp="author"> The somewhat pejorative term for an Ashkenazi Jew in

                has been chosen” (119).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As I will discuss,
                    the nearly all-male cast of characters in this novella, and the way in
                    which Manasseh’s daughter is objectified, may be yet another reason why
                    Zangwill, an active feminist, chose to set the story in the eighteenth century.</note>
                Finally, after the President has threatened him with excommunication, Manasseh
                threatens to spread word of the Mahamad’s small-minded contumely not only to the
                Sephardic <foreign xml:lang="yi">Yahidim</foreign> from whom he schnorrs, but also to “that
                very Ashkenazic community you contemn— . . . a community that waxes daily in wealth
                and greatness while you sleep in your sloth” (124–25). In the course of this speech
                Manasseh has managed to occupy the President’s chair, and the effect of the speech
                and the action leave the President “gasping like a landed cod” (125–26), reminiscent
                of the bagged salmon in chapter one, and finally having a stroke on the spot. He
                recovers, but in his absence “Manasseh found scant difficulty in imposing his will
                on the minor officers” (128) and the wedding between Yankelé and Deborah takes
                place. </p>
               <p> However, this is not the King of Schnorrers’ ultimate success. Just as a glassy-eyed
                fish returns to the narrative, so does Joseph Grobstock. As a new father-in-law,
                Manasseh takes on the honor of making monetary donations to the congregation, even
                though his major source of income is schnorring (or more generally taking alms) from
                the same congregation’s leaders. His logic is impossible to summarize or concisely
                record, but “every man who yielded to Manasseh’s eloquence was a step to reach the
                next” and he soon collects a kingly sum for the synagogue’s coffers (140). Deciding
                to make the gift even greater, he asks Grobstock to invest the money for him. When
                the East India director suggests that Manasseh go to someone else this time,
                Manasseh closes the circle of the economic plot:
                <quote>
                Sir! . . . You are a skilful—nay a famous, financier. You know what stocks to buy,
                what stocks to sell, when to follow a rise, and when a fall. . . . What would you
                say if <emph>I</emph> presumed to interfere in your
                financial affairs—if I told you to issue these shares or to call in those? You would
                tell me to mind my own business; and you would be perfectly right. Now <emph>Schnorring</emph> is
                <emph>my</emph> business. Trust me, I know best whom to come to. (150)
                </quote>
                In Grobstock’s hands the sixty pounds grow to six hundred, and Manasseh donates the
                balance to the congregation “to purchase a life-annuity (styled the Da Costa Fund)
                for a poor and deserving member of the congregation, in whose selection he, as
                donor, should have the ruling voice” (156). Of course, he chooses himself, earning
                in perpetuity the title of <title level="m">King of Schnorrers</title>. In the end,
                although <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>’ satire
                targets intracommunal and class rivalries, it concludes, as Nahshon points out, “not
                with chaos and revolution, but with orderly power-sharing and acceptance” (393).
                Zangwill’s comic novella reveals how to create a civil society despite social,
                cultural, and economic differences. This, of course, is a major theme of Torah and
                Jewish ethics.</p>
               <p> The critique of capitalism in this novella is not strictly Marxian. The financier,
                after all, is key to the schnorrer’s financial success, and money produced for the
                most part by commerce and investment is what keeps the religious communities afloat.
                But so do the machinations of schnorrers, who also have to live, and who use
                spiritual persuasion while heeding the laws of capitalism. Schnorring may be
                considered labor in that it takes the place of more conventional kinds of work, but
                the schnorrer is more accurately an entrepreneur. Work and schnorring are mutually
                exclusive, as Manasseh makes clear. Audrey Jaffe’s analysis of Conan Doyle’s 
                <title level="a">The Man with the Twisted Lip</title> is thus in many ways relevant to
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>. Finding that he can earn more by disguising himself as
                a disfigured beggar, Doyle’s Neville St. Clair keeps up the pretense of managing
                financial interests in the City, while actually conducting a very different
                enterprise. Jaffe points out that “the scenario wherein a beggar is revealed to be a
                gentleman or nobleman in disguise is a familiar one” in nineteenth-century
                literature, and in the parallels I have noted between schnorrer and financier,
                Zangwill’s novella is part of that pattern. For a moment, even Grobstock wonders
                whether Manasseh might really be a Spanish nobleman playing a role, and questions
                whether he, himself, has been the “victim of a practical joke, a prank? Did not a
                natural aristocracy ooze from every pore of this mysterious visitor? Was not every
                tone, every gesture, that of a man born to rule?” (41). If there is no sure way to
                distinguish among the aristocrat, the financier, and the beggar, then how can one be
                reassured by social hierarchies? Moreover, as Jaffe points out, “the figure of the
                finance capitalist [such as Grobstock in <title level="m">The King of
                Schnorrers</title>] confounds the attempt . . . to define identity in relation to
                work” (49), the principle upon which condemnation of the beggar (or schnorrer)
                rests. Noting that even St. Clair’s wife had no idea of what his business in the
                City was—not even the business he purported to conduct—Jaffe writes that “the ‘man
                who does something in the City’ exemplifies the kind of fungible identity that, his
                contemporaries feared, inhabited a realm of exchange divorced from production” (51).
                In other words, does it essentially matter whether one deals at the exchange or on
                the street, so long as the money comes home? To what is considered respectable
                society it certainly does, and so St. Clair is ordered to abandon his alter-ego, to
                the extent of not even revealing “Hugh Boone” or his longterm begging to his wife.
                Yet by revealing the instability of economic and class identities, <title level="a">The Man with the
                Twisted Lip</title> lifts a veil on the unstable underpinnings of nineteenth-century
                bourgeois society. Writing in a similarly moralistic mid-twentieth-century context,
                Bernard Schilling anticipates Jaffe’s conclusions, with only slight hesitation:
                <quote>
                The whole seems an ironic comment upon the absurdity of all human arrangements; one
                becomes <emph>almost</emph> persuaded that Manasseh
                is right, that his parasitical impudence and refusal to work for what he extorts
                from the sober, reasonable, and industrious pedestrians who run the world—that this
                is in fact justified and is no more ludicrous than the actual nature of things
                anyway. (xxxiii; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                I would propose that Zangwill in
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> makes precisely
                the case that Schilling suggests. Condemned by what is thought of as respectable
                society, schnorring requires both effort and intelligence; it is in a category of
                its own, as essential perhaps to the larger world as it is to the Jewish community
                in the ways it brings wit, performance, creativity, and, indeed instability to more
                sober and less open societal constructs.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Edna Nahshon’s comment on
                    “the vagabond con man . . . as a fellow artist whose performance
                    merits compensation for its careful crafting, just like a stage actor” (390).</note>
               </p>
               <p> Here is where
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> diverges from
                <title level="a">The Man with the Twisted Lip,</title> and also goes beyond the play that Zangwill created
                from the novella in 1925. Ausubel distinguishes the schnorrer from ordinary Jewish
                beggars who survived not through wit but through feigning disability (267), much as
                Hugh Boone sports a cosmetic scar across his lower face. Zangwill goes even further.
                The crowd of beggars at the synagogue door when the story opens are all described as
                schnorrers, and the few who present physical afflictions are sincere and
                discreet:
                <quote>
                A green shade might denote weakness of sight, but the stone-blind man bore no
                braggart placard—his infirmity was an old established concern well known to the
                public, and conferring upon the proprietor a definite status in the community. . . .
                Rarest of all sights in this pageantry of Jewish pauperdom was the hollow
                trouser-leg or the empty sleeve, or the wooden limb fulfilling either and pushing
                out a proclamatory peg. (2)
                </quote>
                The veracity of this statement is confirmed a few pages later, as the mendicants
                receive “prize-packets” from Grobstock: “One of the few pieces of gold in the
                lucky-bag fell to the solitary lame man, who danced in his joy on his sound leg”—an
                image confirmed in Hutchinson’s lively illustration—“while the poor blind man
                pocketed his half-penny, unconscious of ill-fortune, and merely wondering why the
                coin came swathed in paper” (5). Although they may be less clever, witty, or learned
                than their king, these schnorrers apparently share his sense of ethics. The 1925
                    play,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Reprinted in Nahshon’s edition, to
                        which page numbers refer.</note>
                however, opens with a crew of Jewish beggars who soon reveal that “Stumpy Sol has
                two legs, Armless Isaac two arms, and Blind Jonathan two good eyes” (stage
                direction, Nahshon 407). Deceit rather than wit becomes their overriding
                characteristic, and the pathos of the early scene in the novella is gone. Also
                introduced right away is Deborah, Manasseh da Costa’s daughter, now a hard-bitten
                schnorrer herself. When the others tell her to go home, a “woman’s place,” she
                complains that she needs the money for her dowry and that her father takes all that
                she schnorrs, anyway (409). This may be marginally more suitable to the post-women’s
                suffrage audience than a Deborah who is talked about and bargained over but who
                never appears, as in the novel, but it detracts from Manasseh’s uniqueness, at least
                in his family. Further drifting from its source, the 1925 play adds a subplot
                depicting the desired marriage between Grobstock’s daughter and a Sephardi dandy.
                This subplot, again, adds a significant woman to the cast, and presents dramatically
                what Manasseh only alludes to in the novella: that when it comes to a Sephardi of
                the upper class, he will be allowed to marry whomever he wants. All of these changes
                may have been made to heighten dramatic interest and popularity. In 1925 Zangwill
                was struggling financially while self-producing his more overtly didactic political
                plays. He was also sixty-one years of age at the time of these serious professional
                reverses, not the up-and-coming twenty-nine-year-old who saw the short novel through
                its appearance in the <title level="j">Idler</title>. He would
                die the following year. According to Nahshon, the first run of <title level="m">The
                King of Schnorrers</title> in London was intentionally short, and the reviews were
                mixed; revivals in 1930 had a total of ten performances, and in 1950 twenty-one
                (395–97). But Zangwill’s own opening-out of the story to fit expected conventions,
                both of theater and of how a beggar is to be perceived, may have diluted the story’s
                wit and its point, to its detriment.</p>
               <p> The novella, in its focus on the men of the story, with only a few brief appearances
                by Grobstock’s and Manasseh’s wives, is in fact uncharacteristic of Zangwill, who
                throughout his fiction and drama explored the lives and thoughts of female
                characters both as protagonists and secondary figures. In this novella, however, the
                nearly all-male cast of characters is effective, as it underscores the
                interconnectedness of schnorrers and financiers, as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardi
                pomposities, in what was a male-dominated commercial system. Turning the dandy Beau
                Belasco (who appears just briefly in the middle of the novella) into, in the play, a
                full-fledged character seeking the hand of Grobstock’s daughter detracts from the
                focus on Manasseh and his schemes. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> as a play—not
                necessarily a play by Zangwill—seems to have had more success in the United States.
                Jacob Adler adapted a Yiddish version in 1905 (Nahshon 394), and Judd Woldin’s
                musical version, first performed in 1979 as <title level="m">Petticoat Lane</title>,
                has been produced well into the twenty-first century in various adaptations of its
                own. <title level="m">Petticoat Lane</title> is an effective adaptation in that it
                focuses closely on a few distinct instances of schnorring, each following logically
                from the one preceding and staying close to Zangwill’s own witty dialogue. Deborah’s
                suitor is in this case a cabinet-maker, which allows Manasseh once again to
                deprecate work as a suitable means for providing for a wife. The setting, however,
                seems more late-nineteenth century than eighteenth, with Deborah Da Costa a
                proto-suffragette. The streamlined plot, as well, becomes too streamlined when the
                central conflict revolves around Manasseh’s disdain for the Ashkenazim, something
                treated lightly and only briefly at the start of Zangwill’s novella.</p>
               <p> The title of Woldin’s play when I saw it in 1997 was not <title level="m">Petticoat
                Lane</title>, but <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>. That restored
                title alone may account for some of the success of recent productions, as children
                and grandchildren of Jewish immigrants—not fluent in Yiddish themselves—have seen
                the word <emph>schnorrer</emph> and laughed, aware of its only semi-secret
                (and as we have seen, now English) meaning. Today there is a resurgence of interest
                in the serious study of Yiddish, a recognition that this was a language in which
                Jews of Europe wrote poetry, prose, and drama; did business; made love; argued;
                mourned; bought groceries; and did everything else one uses a language for. But in
                the middle of the twentieth-century, and even later, a Jewish comedian had only to
                say a word in Yiddish to get a laugh. In 2015, when Robert Brustein’s
                <title level="m">The King of Second Avenue</title> (based on
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>) was performed in Boston, the reviewer
                for the <title level="j">Globe</title> called it, affectionately, “a serving of
                borscht,” alluding to the comic borscht belt of the Catskills that had its heyday in
                the 1950s and ‘60s. Brustein—whose high-culture credentials as founder of the Yale
                and American Repertory Theaters and adapter of classic plays are duly noted—is said
                to have “the soul of a borscht belt comedian.” Brustein himself agrees: “I’m a
                burlesque artist at heart” (Brown). But for all its humor and even sight gags (the
                President of the Mahamad’s apoplexy, for instance), the novella does not seem to fit
                those pop-culture descriptions, even though Israel Zangwill himself linked it with
                “grotesques and fantasies.” </p>
               <p> I saw the retitled Woldin musical at the Florida Jewish Theatre, where it was
                directed by Russell Kaplan. In his Director’s Note in the program, Kaplan referred
                to Zangwill as “one of the greatest writers of Yiddish fiction of the 19th century,”
                repeating an error that would have
                exasperated Zangwill, who wrote in English, not Yiddish, and who saw himself as
                working within both British and Jewish cultures, connecting the two. Perhaps Kaplan
                assumed that a play about a schnorrer—using that “funny” word—must be entirely
                frivolous and originally Yiddish. Manasseh has schnorred in many languages; on a
                trip to France in the 1990s I saw a placard listing plays to be performed that
                summer, including <title level="m">Le Roi Des Schnorrers</title>, <emph>par</emph>
                Israel Zangwill.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Winehouse, in his dissertation, notes that
                                Zangwill gave permission for a French musical version in 1923
                                (178–79). Whether or not that was the play I saw advertised, I do
                                not know.</note> And although Zangwill objected to
                the “low comedy” of Jacob Adler’s operetta (Nahshon 394), one might expect to find
                other Yiddish adaptations. However, after searching a number of comprehensive
                databases, the closest I could come was a Hebrew edition, published in 1900.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Listed in WorldCat. I also searched, without success, the catalogs
                    of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, and the Yiddish Book Center,
                    although some of those did include translations to other European languages.</note>
                  <title level="m">Dreamers of the Ghetto</title> (1898)—one of Zangwill’s more serious
                and historically-based works—seems to be the only work of his that can readily be
                found today in a Yiddish edition. Perhaps Zangwill’s ambivalence about the language
                left him ambivalent about authorizing translations, or perhaps they had only limited
                circulation. The Hebrew translation, in fact, at a time when modern Hebrew was being
                developed and encouraged, used a Hebrew word in place of schnorrer in its title,
                even though that word—<foreign xml:lang="yi">kabtsn</foreign> or
                <foreign xml:lang="yi">kamtsn</foreign>—has the significantly different meaning of cheapskate or stingy

                failed idealists, the German-Jewish socialist Ferdinand Lassalle receives a chapter.
                Zangwill often, too, contributed to causes promoted by trade unionists and
                socialists.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See, for example, Rochelson,

                  <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>
                    presents in a subtle and palatable form radical ideas of economic justice that Zangwill always saw
                as Jewish. Indeed, <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> may have yet
                appeared in Yiddish, even if only through informal publication. One would think that
                the Yiddish-literate workers of his day, despite Manasseh Da Costa’s disparagement
                of labor, would have cheered Zangwill’s clever and effective means of upholding
                their rights and sticking it to the bosses. </p>
