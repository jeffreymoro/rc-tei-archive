                <p rend="noCount">Israel Zangwill (1864-1926) was a literary celebrity, a Zionist,
                    and a suffrage activist, and, in his time, possibly the best-known Jewish writer
                    in the Anglophone world. His 1892 novel <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> became a British
                    and American bestseller; in 1908 his play <title level="m">The Melting-Pot</title> argued for the value
                    of immigration and provided future studies of ethnicity with a much-debated
                    metaphor. By the middle of the twentieth century, however, Zangwill’s fame had
                    declined, and his best-known work of fiction was likely <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>
                    (1894), a short novel that solidified his fame as a Jewish humorist. In fact,
                    however, this comedic work that Zangwill published in a volume of “grotesques
                    and fantasies” embeds some of his most trenchant social criticism and satire.
                    Indeed, <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> presents in a subtle and palatable form radical
                    ideas of economic justice that Zangwill always saw as Jewish.</p>

            <p> At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Israel
                Zangwill (1864–1926) was a literary celebrity, a political activist, and possibly
                the best-known Jew in the Anglophone world. He was the author of
                <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> (1892), a novel about the Jews of London that
                became a British and American bestseller and was widely translated. In 1908 he wrote
                the play <title level="m">The Melting-Pot</title>, which argued for the value of
                immigration to American culture and provided future studies of ethnicity with a
                much-debated metaphor. Having started his career as a journalist, Zangwill wrote a
                number of novels and plays, as well as short stories, and not only on Jewish
                subjects. He advocated for British women’s suffrage and was a leader in, first,
                Theodor Herzl’s Zionist movement and, later, the Jewish Territorial Organization,
                which he founded. Zangwill’s writings as well as his activism attest to a strong
                sense of social justice, while his literary work often nested serious questions in a
                web of humorous characterization and wordplay. Such an apparently mixed modality
                often led to mixed reviews; while some critics might have found the humor jarring,
                others wished Zangwill would stick only to humor. By the middle of the twentieth
                century, when it was excerpted by Nathan Ausubel in
                <title level="m">A Treasury of Jewish Folklore</title> and
                reissued in the United States by Shoe String Press, Zangwill’s best-known work of
                fiction was probably <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> (1894), a work
                which solidified Zangwill’s fame as a Jewish humorist. Now that more of Israel
                Zangwill’s work has been republished, and Zangwill himself has come under more
                serious study,<note place="foot" resp="author"> For recent full-length studies of Zangwill,
                                see works by Adams, Rochelson, Udelson, Winehouse, and
                                Wohlgelernter. The bibliographies in those books should lead to
                                article-length critical essays.</note> it is worth looking at how that masterpiece of humor also
                embeds some of Israel Zangwill’s most biting social criticism.</p>
            <p><title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was first published in six monthly
                parts in the <title level="j">Idler</title>, a new literary magazine edited by Jerome
                K. Jerome and Robert Barr. Zangwill became associated with Jerome after publishing
                short stories and satirical columns in Jewish periodicals, and, in 1890, becoming
                editor of the comic newspaper <title level="j">Puck</title>, which he renamed
                <title level="j">Ariel</title>. For the <title level="m">Idler</title>, Zangwill wrote
                several short stories and an essay for the series <title level="m">My First
                Book</title> before serializing <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in Volume Four,
                from August 1893 to January 1894.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Afterward, Zangwill
                    became a regular contributor to the <title level="j">Idler’s Club</title>, a forum featuring
                    <title level="j">Idler</title> writers on aspects of current
                            culture.</note> The
                <title level="j">Idler</title> was, in general, a magazine for
                light reading by intelligent readers, but with diverse kinds of contributions. Anne
                Humpherys describes its tone as “liberal, irreverent, and sentimental,”<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> This phrase appears in quotation marks in Humpherys’s essay, possibly
                    quoted from the entry on Robert Barr&#8212;Jerome’s co-editor&#8212;by Alison Janice Minoff Cox in
                    the <title level="m">Dictionary of Literary Biography</title>, vol. 70, Gale, 1988,
                    cited earlier in the same paragraph.</note> but makes clear that it did not have any narrow political
                or moral agenda:
                <quote>
                Fiction of course was prominent, but there were also articles on the theatre, books,
                and exhibitions. There were interviews with celebrities of various sorts, and
                educational essays on natural history, foreign countries and alien cultural
                practices as well as tours of historical buildings. The fiction from the beginning
                included detective and adventure stories, but also a good number of more or less
                sentimental stories of love and romance. (2)

            Serialization of <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> helped Zangwill to naturalize Jewish life in British,
                American, and modern European culture at the same time as it placed him in the
                center of English letters. Jerome and Barr sought diversity in content and
                authorship, and thus the magazine featured most of the 1890s’ best known literary
                writers, with the possible significant exception of writers in the aesthetic
                movement. <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>’ serialized chapters
                followed Part II of <title level="m">Royal Pets</title>, by Ernest M. Jessop; an
                episode of the <title level="j">Idler’s Club</title> (a forum of writers’ opinions on
                current topics); <title level="a">My First Book</title> essays by Marie Corelli, 
                <title level="a">John Strange Winter</title>
                (Henrietta Stannard), and Jerome K. Jerome; and Part II of the story <title level="a">Exchange
                <emph>is</emph> Robbery,</title> by Richard Marsh, best known today, perhaps, as
                author of <title level="m">The Beetle</title> (1897). Other works in the volume
                included a story by Arthur Conan Doyle and a profile of George Meredith. Zangwill
                would have been pleased by his serial’s placement, and he was an
                <title level="j">Idler</title> “regular.” </p>
            <p> The appearance of the entire first chapter of <title level="m">The King</title> in
                Ausubel’s <title level="m">Treasury of Jewish Folklore</title> suggests that the story
                was taken from traditional materials and has become part of folklore itself, and,
                indeed, there is a chicken/egg question surrounding this short novel. Which came
                first: <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> or the widespread understanding
                among Ashkenazi Jews of the humor inherent in the Yiddish term of its title?
                Zangwill acknowledged his debt to tradition in his foreword to the 1894 volume
                reprint: “I have merely amused myself and attempted to amuse idlers by incarnating
                the floating tradition of the Jewish <hi rendition="#smallcaps">Schnorrer</hi>, who is as
                unique among beggars as Israel among nations” (v). Ausubel ascribes this uniqueness
                to the wit with which the schnorrer<note place="foot" resp="author"> I have chosen
                    not to italicize this term unless it appears italicized in quoted matter, since
                    both Merriam-Webster and the OED present it as an English word, as I will explain.</note>
                cajoles funds from donors, and the wealth of Judaic
                learning with which this particular type of beggar abashes the materially wealthy,
                and Zangwill’s “King”&#8212;Manasseh Bueno Barzillai Azevedo da Costa&#8212;has wit and Jewish
                learning in abundance. Bernard Winehouse and Edna Nahshon both credit Zangwill’s
                novella with promoting the image of this wily character, but acknowledge, as well,
                that Zangwill was well-versed in the history of the schnorrer figure long before he
                created Manasseh, and had included schnorrers in earlier writings. Yet Zangwill’s
                memorable <title level="m">King of Schnorrers</title>&#8212;the novella and the
                character&#8212;certainly helped popularize the term, which was, according to the OED, an
                un-italicized English word as early as 1899. One might well ask whether, when Freud
                related a “salmon mayonnaise” story in <title level="m">Jokes and their Relation to
                    the Unconscious</title>, he was thinking of a traditional folkloric example or of
                Zangwill’s Manasseh justifying his purchase of salmon after receiving the wealthy
                Grobstock’s charity: “If I do not buy salmon when I have two guineas, . . . when
                shall I buy salmon?” (<title level="m">King</title> 16).<note place="foot" resp="author"> As
                    Freud retells this “Jewish joke,” “An impoverished individual borrowed 25 florins from a
                    prosperous acquaintance, with many asseverations of his necessitous circumstances. The very
                    same day his benefactor met him again in a restaurant with a plate of salmon mayonnaise in
                    front of him. The benefactor reproached him. . . .‘I don’t understand,’ replied the object
                    of the attack; ‘if I haven’t any money I <emph>can’t</emph> eat salmon mayonnaise, and if I
                    have some money I <emph>mustn’t</emph> eat salmon mayonnaise. Well, then, when
                    <emph>am</emph> I to eat salmon mayonnaise?’” (49–50).</note> Freud had written to a friend, in 1897,
                that “for some time past I have been putting together a collection of Jewish
                anecdotes” (4), and one may speculate on whether his sources included Zangwill’s
                work. However, given the length to which Zangwill spins out the episode beyond the
                initial joke&#8212;at the end of Chapter One having the embarrassed Grobstock appear to
                his servant as Manasseh’s food carrier&#8212;it is possible that Freud and Zangwill both
                used traditional sources, with the fiction writer expanding rather than explaining.
                When, in the film <title level="m">Animal Crackers</title> (1930), Groucho Marx
                responded to the crowd’s “Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer,” with,
                “Did someone call me schnorrer?” he assumed that audiences would understand the
                word&#8212;or that, if they didn’t, they should. The OED defines a schnorrer as,
                originally, a beggar (its basic and least evocative definition), but adds that now
                it has the connotations of “a scrounger, a freeloader; a layabout, a
                good-for-nothing.” Merriam-Webster’s more positive definition is closer to
                Zangwill’s and to Groucho’s: “one who wheedles others into supplying his or her
                wants.” It is the wheedling that characterizes Zangwill’s schnorrer and that gives
                the word a taste of bittersweet humor in the mouths of Jews today. </p>
            <p> In keeping with his desire to maintain a dual persona, when Zangwill published
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> in volume form he added to it a
                collection of shorter stories, from the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> and from other periodicals, only a
                few of which had Jewish content. All were labeled together in a subtitle,
                <title level="m">Grotesques and Fantasies</title>, which itself suggests a certain
                ambivalence by Zangwill toward his subject matter. Zangwill’s friend Joseph Leftwich
                reported (from hearsay) that Zangwill had considered ending the
                <title level="j">Idler</title> serial halfway through, but Jerome
                persuaded him to continue (250). However, Leftwich goes on to quote Zangwill as,
                throughout his life, being gleeful at the success of his unusual protagonist and
                story. <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was
                Zangwill’s next extended work after his bestselling realist novel of Jewish life,
                <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> (1892),<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> His Jewish short story collection <title level="m">Ghetto
                        Tragedies</title> also appeared in 1893.</note>
                and he likely enjoyed the freedom of comedy unmixed with sorrow, and romance only
                barely mixed with realism. </p>
            <p> The concept of Romanticism in late Victorian literature is not new. In 2013, the
                Birkbeck Centre for Nineteenth-Century Studies and the English Faculty of Oxford
                University held a conference titled <title level="a">Romanticism at the Fin de Siècle,</title> which
                “place[d] Romanticism at the core” of that later cultural era (Announcement). One
                finds echoes of Romanticism in aestheticist theory and Romantic-seeming evocations
                of past eras in aesthetic poetry, prose, and visual art. For Zangwill, who was not
                in the aestheticist camp,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Although not a supporter
                    of “art for art’s sake,” Zangwill expressed sympathy with Oscar Wilde during his
                    trials and imprisonment; see Rochelson, pp. 80–81.</note>
                romance was a contrast to realism that helped contextualize bitter truths that he
                often took as his subject matter. The “Proem” to <title level="m">Children of the
                Ghetto</title>, a novel whose first full chapter is set in a late Victorian soup
                kitchen, takes place in early nineteenth-century London, its reminiscences of an
                earlier generation of Jews softened, as at its end, by a veil of nostalgia:
                <quote>
                Perhaps, here and there, some decrepit centenarian rubs his purblind eyes with the
                ointment of memory, and sees these pictures of the past, hallowed by the
                concentration of time, and finds his shriveled cheek wet with the pathos sanctifying
                the joys that have been. (69)
                </quote>
                In contrast,
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> announces its
                satiric mode from the start, but it, too, is set in the Romantic era, in this case,
                the late eighteenth century, “in the days when Lord George Gordon became a Jew, and
                was suspected of insanity; when, out of respect for the prophecies, England denied
                her Jews every civic right except that of paying taxes; . . .” (1). By the end of
                this first paragraph, however, the reader is immersed in the details of the story at
                hand. The outlandish costumes of its picaresque hero and outmoded eighteenth-century
                dress and furnishings of surrounding characters provide a distanced (and thus
                effectively dissonant) backdrop for 1894 social satire.</p>
            <p><title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> begins by
                lampooning the rivalries between rich and poor, Sephardi and Ashkenazi, reversing
                expectations by making the wealthy man of German Jewish descent while the
                pauper/beggar is Iberian. The interethnic rivalry played upon here was part of a
                “myth of Sephardi superiority,”
                <quote>
                the belief that Jews from the Iberian peninsula were different in kind from other
                Jews, that they were superior by virtue of their culture, learning, wealth, descent,
                manners, or indeed even blood. (Endelman 226)
                </quote>
                The myth had its roots in medieval Spain. When the Jews were expelled from Spain and
                Portugal during the Inquisitions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it spread
                to other parts of Europe. As Todd Endelman has shown, however, by the late
                nineteenth century&#8212;and even the late eighteenth&#8212;Ashkenazi Jews outnumbered Sephardim
                in London, and by the mid-1800s “most of the important Jewish banking houses&#8212;the
                Rothschilds chief among them&#8212;traced their origins to the Frankfurt ghetto, not the
                courts and estates of Castile and Aragon” (228). Thus when suave, brilliant, and
                devout Manasseh outsmarts the rich but “coarse”<note
                        place="foot" resp="author"> In Yiddish, <emph>grob</emph> means thick, fat, or
                    coarse; <emph>stock</emph>, in its most likely meaning here, is an
                                intensifier for darkness, as the adjective in such English
                                expressions as pitch dark or stone blind, suggesting Grobstock’s
                                ignorance despite his materialism (Weinreich <title level="m">Dictionary</title>).
                                However, Zangwill may also be suggesting
                                the English meaning, implying that the wealthy Jew comes from a
                                “coarse stock.”</note> Joseph Grobstock, Zangwill evokes laughter through the
                complex inversion of a stereotype&#8212;which, as Endelman also points out, was kept in
                public view by writer and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. However, by the end of
                    <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>, even the Sephardi elite falls
                against the power of Manasseh’s Jewish learning as well as his financial acumen.
                Edna Nahshon relates that the story’s final conflict has its root in an actual event
                of 1745, when a Sephardi synagogue warden petitioned the Mahamad (the Sephardic
                religious governing body) to marry an Ashkenazic woman (392–93), an event that is
                obliquely referred to in the novella. However, the fascinating but over-the-top
                Manasseh and the elaborate eighteenth-century costumes and settings that in George
                Hutchinson’s illustrations<note place="foot" resp="author"> Hutchinson frequently worked
                    with Zangwill, and his illustrations for <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>

                                1953 reissue edited by Schilling. An exception is the 1960 Yoseloff
                                edition, with woodcut-like modernistic drawings by Henk
                                Krijger.</note> seem integral to the story may distract the reader from
                what is perhaps the most subversive satire in the plot. As Zangwill in
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> reverses easy expectations and
                prejudices, he also suggests new ways of looking at such terms as work, profession,
                investment, and wealth. Groucho is not the only Marx relevant to
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>.</p>
            <p> The language of commerce pervades this novella. Yes, there are comic reversals as
                the poorly yet fancifully attired schnorrer reminds the wealthy Grobstock and others
                that by schnorring he allows them to fulfill the commandment of helping the needy.
                Yes, Manasseh asserts a nobility of learning and religious devotion that places him
                above the shallow pomposities of Grobstock and the Sephardic Mahamad. But throughout
                the work a pattern of references makes clear that both rich and poor operate
                according to the same laws of exchange. When the dim but basically good-natured
                Grobstock realizes he owes Manasseh an apology, the narrator reports that he
                “proceeded honestly to pay it, but with a maladroit manner, as one unaccustomed to
                the currency” (8). When Grobstock offers three guineas for the salmon, while
                Manasseh has bargained for two, Manasseh reminds him that “this is not an auction”
                (14). Grobstock accuses Manasseh of theft because “a pauper&#8212;a beggar&#8212;with a wife and
                children” should not spend all he has&#8212;his charity from Grobstock&#8212;“on a mere luxury
                like salmon” (15–16). From here proceeds Zangwill’s version of the salmon joke,
                because once the money leaves Grobstock’s hand the salmon is no longer his. It is
                Manasseh’s property, and he has every right to do with it as he pleases. Similarly,
                when Grobstock gives Manasseh a trove of his used clothing, expecting Manasseh to
                wear it to dinner at his home and thus spare him shame before his servants, he is
                outraged to learn that Manasseh has immediately sold the items to a wealthy
                used-clothing dealer. When Manasseh replies that he can’t wear such clothes because
                “I know my station” (48), we suspect a multiple meaning. He knows the value of the
                clothing and he knows his own worth as a man, as well as a man of business. Once
                Grobstock gives him the clothes, again, they are Manasseh’s to use as he pleases. If
                Grobstock chooses to be embarrassed by Manasseh’s usual garb, that is none of
                Manasseh’s concern. However, since Manasseh will receive Grobstock’s clothing in
                perpetuity, he reminds the financier not to spill snuff on it or do anything else
                that might decrease its value. Similarly, when he agrees to sell the salmon back to
                Grobstock, he insists on three guineas, not two, the larger figure being the value
                Grobstock had originally assigned to it, along with profit for having been made into
                a middleman and “compensation for being degraded to fishmongering” as well as for
                losing the salmon itself (28–29)&#8212;even though he had already rebuked the financier
                for interrupting <emph>his</emph> original negotiations, saying he could
                have gotten the salmon for twenty-five shillings had Grobstock not offered the much
                higher price (18). Manasseh knows that value is equal only to the most that someone
                will pay for something and does not correspond to any so-called intrinsic worth. </p>
            <p> Before Manasseh agrees to take Grobstock’s clothing, he makes sure that Grobstock
                does not already have a “clothes-receiver” (22). Schnorring is a business, like
                Grobstock’s directorship in the East India Company, and it has its rules and ethics.
                One does not trespass on a competitor’s territory. Manasseh also insists that the
                position be permanent, because “it hurts one’s reputation to lose a client” (22).
                Similarly, one can present part of one’s own schnorring-ground as dowry to a
                prospective son-in-law (103–04). Yankelé, the Ashkenazi schnorrer to whom Manasseh
                will marry his daughter, enumerates to his prospective father-in-law what he will
                bring to the marriage through a combination of schnorring, selling old clothes, and
                carrying out synagogue and communal duties. Their conversation is filled with
                Wildean paradox:
                <quote>
                Manasseh shook his head. “<emph>Schnorring</emph> is the only occupation
                that is regular all the year round,” he said. “Everything else may fail&#8212;the greatest
                commercial houses may totter to the ground; as it is written, ‘He humbleth the
                proud.’ But the <emph>Schnorrer</emph> is always
                secure. Whoever falls, there are always enough left to look after <emph>him</emph>.
                If you were a father, Yankelé, you would understand my feelings. How
                can a man allow his daughter’s future happiness to repose on a basis so uncertain as
                work? (71)

                One can almost hear Lady Bracknell interrogating Jack Worthing, although
                <title level="m">The Importance of Being Earnest</title> had its
                first performance the year after <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was
                published.</p>
            <p> Writing about the short novel in 1953, less than a decade after the Holocaust ended,
                Bernard Schilling reminded readers of “the background of sorrow and evil” against
                which Jewish humor has flourished throughout Jewish history (vii), a context that
                later critics have not especially emphasized, while all who have written on
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> acknowledge its consonance with
                Zangwill’s lifelong concern for the poor. Indeed, as his reputation rose and fell in
                loftier circles even during his lifetime, he remained a hero to the immigrant Jews
                of the East End. But, as even Schilling points out, “the materials before us are
                much too funny for inquiry into their sadder implications” (xiv). Manasseh indeed
                has two professions, schnorrer and Talmud scholar, an explicator of Jewish law for
                those whose pursuits are wholly material. As he quotes from scripture and rabbinic
                texts to prevent potential almsgivers from falling into sin (since charity is an
                essential commandment), his learned conning provides a great deal of the novella’s
                comedy. Having already taken ownership of the packets of coins in the bag he has
                taken from Grobstock to carry the salmon, he further asks the financier if he might
                have left anything in the pockets of his clothes; if so, Manasseh will return to him
                anything “of no value to anybody but you” (33). He reminds the astounded financier
                of the biblical laws relating to gleaners:
                <quote>
                ‘When thou reapest thine harvest in thine field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the
                field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the
                fatherless, and for the widow.’ . . . You will admit that Moses would have added a
                prohibition against searching minutely the pockets of cast-off garments, were it not
                that for forty years our ancestors had to wander in the wilderness in the same
                clothes, which miraculously waxed with their growth. (34)
                </quote>
                At this point one assumes that Grobstock, concerned about appearances and not wanting
                to seem ignorant of Jewish law, would readily capitulate to Manasseh’s assumption of
                what is his due. He does so, but Zangwill goes further, noting that “Grobstock’s
                magnanimity responded to the appeal.” Additional descriptions of this sort affirm
                that Grobstock’s magnanimity is genuine; after all, he first appears in the novella
                giving alms to a crowd of beggars outside the synagogue. In a novella that ends with
                Manasseh carrying out the greatest schnorr of all&#8212;getting the Sephardic leadership
                to agree to the marriage of Sephardic Deborah and Ashkenazic Yankelé <emph>and</emph>
                granting the King of Schnorrers an income for
                life&#8212;Zangwill calls upon the forces of law and business to bring this about. </p>
            <p> The middle chapters of
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> examine how
                Yankelé is able to demonstrate his professional prowess to Manasseh by schnorring
                dinner at the home of a notoriously stingy rabbi. The last two chapters of the six,
                however, reveal Manasseh appearing before the court of the Mahamad, using his verbal
                wit to show that Sephardi officialdom is as pompous as any <emph>grob</emph> German.
                Manasseh knows the <title level="m">Ascamot</title> (or <title level="m">Laws and Regulations</title>) better
                than the authorities do, and he
                knows that nowhere in this document is the marriage between a Sephardi and an
                Ashkenazi Jew prohibited (117).<note place="foot" resp="author"> The <title level="m">Ascamot</title>,
                    known in English as <title level="m">The Laws and Regulations of the

                    published in a “revised and amended” version in London in
                    1850, which is the earliest copy available on the Hathitrust

                    or Gate of Heaven, as Zangwill refers to it in the text. (The correct name
                    appears at the start of Chapter Six in the <title level="j">Idler</title>;
                    it appears as Gates of Heaven in the 1894 volume.) We may assume that Zangwill
                    consulted an eighteenth-century edition.</note> They continue to debate on points of tradition versus law,

                schnorrers, and even the position of Deborah, whose marriage to Yankelé her father
                defends on the ground that “she is not a male . . . ; she is not an active agent,
                she has not gone out of her way to choose a Tedesco<note place="foot"

                    Zangwill, an active feminist, chose to set the story in the eighteenth century.</note>
                Finally, after the President has threatened him with excommunication, Manasseh
                threatens to spread word of the Mahamad’s small-minded contumely not only to the

                very Ashkenazic community you contemn&#8212; . . . a community that waxes daily in wealth
                and greatness while you sleep in your sloth” (124–25). In the course of this speech
                Manasseh has managed to occupy the President’s chair, and the effect of the speech
                and the action leave the President “gasping like a landed cod” (125–26), reminiscent
                of the bagged salmon in chapter one, and finally having a stroke on the spot. He
                recovers, but in his absence “Manasseh found scant difficulty in imposing his will
                on the minor officers” (128) and the wedding between Yankelé and Deborah takes
                place. </p>
            <p> However, this is not the King of Schnorrers’ ultimate success. Just as a glassy-eyed
                fish returns to the narrative, so does Joseph Grobstock. As a new father-in-law,
                Manasseh takes on the honor of making monetary donations to the congregation, even
                though his major source of income is schnorring (or more generally taking alms) from
                the same congregation’s leaders. His logic is impossible to summarize or concisely
                record, but “every man who yielded to Manasseh’s eloquence was a step to reach the
                next” and he soon collects a kingly sum for the synagogue’s coffers (140). Deciding
                to make the gift even greater, he asks Grobstock to invest the money for him. When
                the East India director suggests that Manasseh go to someone else this time,
                Manasseh closes the circle of the economic plot:
                <quote>
                Sir! . . . You are a skilful&#8212;nay a famous, financier. You know what stocks to buy,
                what stocks to sell, when to follow a rise, and when a fall. . . . What would you
                say if <emph>I</emph> presumed to interfere in your
                financial affairs&#8212;if I told you to issue these shares or to call in those? You would
                tell me to mind my own business; and you would be perfectly right. Now <emph>Schnorring</emph> is
                <emph>my</emph> business. Trust me, I know best whom to come to. (150)
                </quote>
                In Grobstock’s hands the sixty pounds grow to six hundred, and Manasseh donates the
                balance to the congregation “to purchase a life-annuity (styled the Da Costa Fund)
                for a poor and deserving member of the congregation, in whose selection he, as
                donor, should have the ruling voice” (156). Of course, he chooses himself, earning
                in perpetuity the title of <title level="m">King of Schnorrers</title>. In the end,
                although <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>’ satire
                targets intracommunal and class rivalries, it concludes, as Nahshon points out, “not
                with chaos and revolution, but with orderly power-sharing and acceptance” (393).
                Zangwill’s comic novella reveals how to create a civil society despite social,
                cultural, and economic differences. This, of course, is a major theme of Torah and
                Jewish ethics.</p>
            <p> The critique of capitalism in this novella is not strictly Marxian. The financier,
                after all, is key to the schnorrer’s financial success, and money produced for the
                most part by commerce and investment is what keeps the religious communities afloat.
                But so do the machinations of schnorrers, who also have to live, and who use
                spiritual persuasion while heeding the laws of capitalism. Schnorring may be
                considered labor in that it takes the place of more conventional kinds of work, but
                the schnorrer is more accurately an entrepreneur. Work and schnorring are mutually
                exclusive, as Manasseh makes clear. Audrey Jaffe’s analysis of Conan Doyle’s 
                <title level="a">The Man with the Twisted Lip</title> is thus in many ways relevant to
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>. Finding that he can earn more by disguising himself as
                a disfigured beggar, Doyle’s Neville St. Clair keeps up the pretense of managing
                financial interests in the City, while actually conducting a very different
                enterprise. Jaffe points out that “the scenario wherein a beggar is revealed to be a
                gentleman or nobleman in disguise is a familiar one” in nineteenth-century
                literature, and in the parallels I have noted between schnorrer and financier,
                Zangwill’s novella is part of that pattern. For a moment, even Grobstock wonders
                whether Manasseh might really be a Spanish nobleman playing a role, and questions
                whether he, himself, has been the “victim of a practical joke, a prank? Did not a
                natural aristocracy ooze from every pore of this mysterious visitor? Was not every
                tone, every gesture, that of a man born to rule?” (41). If there is no sure way to
                distinguish among the aristocrat, the financier, and the beggar, then how can one be
                reassured by social hierarchies? Moreover, as Jaffe points out, “the figure of the
                finance capitalist [such as Grobstock in <title level="m">The King of
                Schnorrers</title>] confounds the attempt . . . to define identity in relation to
                work” (49), the principle upon which condemnation of the beggar (or schnorrer)
                rests. Noting that even St. Clair’s wife had no idea of what his business in the
                City was&#8212;not even the business he purported to conduct&#8212;Jaffe writes that “the ‘man
                who does something in the City’ exemplifies the kind of fungible identity that, his
                contemporaries feared, inhabited a realm of exchange divorced from production” (51).
                In other words, does it essentially matter whether one deals at the exchange or on
                the street, so long as the money comes home? To what is considered respectable
                society it certainly does, and so St. Clair is ordered to abandon his alter-ego, to
                the extent of not even revealing “Hugh Boone” or his longterm begging to his wife.
                Yet by revealing the instability of economic and class identities, <title level="a">The Man with the
                Twisted Lip</title> lifts a veil on the unstable underpinnings of nineteenth-century
                bourgeois society. Writing in a similarly moralistic mid-twentieth-century context,
                Bernard Schilling anticipates Jaffe’s conclusions, with only slight hesitation:
                <quote>
                The whole seems an ironic comment upon the absurdity of all human arrangements; one
                becomes <emph>almost</emph> persuaded that Manasseh
                is right, that his parasitical impudence and refusal to work for what he extorts
                from the sober, reasonable, and industrious pedestrians who run the world&#8212;that this
                is in fact justified and is no more ludicrous than the actual nature of things
                anyway. (xxxiii; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                I would propose that Zangwill in
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> makes precisely
                the case that Schilling suggests. Condemned by what is thought of as respectable
                society, schnorring requires both effort and intelligence; it is in a category of
                its own, as essential perhaps to the larger world as it is to the Jewish community
                in the ways it brings wit, performance, creativity, and, indeed instability to more
                sober and less open societal constructs.<note

            <p> Here is where
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> diverges from
                <title level="a">The Man with the Twisted Lip,</title> and also goes beyond the play that Zangwill created
                from the novella in 1925. Ausubel distinguishes the schnorrer from ordinary Jewish
                beggars who survived not through wit but through feigning disability (267), much as
                Hugh Boone sports a cosmetic scar across his lower face. Zangwill goes even further.
                The crowd of beggars at the synagogue door when the story opens are all described as
                schnorrers, and the few who present physical afflictions are sincere and
                discreet:
                <quote>
                A green shade might denote weakness of sight, but the stone-blind man bore no
                braggart placard&#8212;his infirmity was an old established concern well known to the
                public, and conferring upon the proprietor a definite status in the community. . . .
                Rarest of all sights in this pageantry of Jewish pauperdom was the hollow
                trouser-leg or the empty sleeve, or the wooden limb fulfilling either and pushing
                out a proclamatory peg. (2)
                </quote>
                The veracity of this statement is confirmed a few pages later, as the mendicants
                receive “prize-packets” from Grobstock: “One of the few pieces of gold in the
                lucky-bag fell to the solitary lame man, who danced in his joy on his sound leg”&#8212;an
                image confirmed in Hutchinson’s lively illustration&#8212;“while the poor blind man
                pocketed his half-penny, unconscious of ill-fortune, and merely wondering why the
                coin came swathed in paper” (5). Although they may be less clever, witty, or learned
                than their king, these schnorrers apparently share his sense of ethics. The 1925
                    play,<note place="foot" resp="author"> Reprinted in Nahshon’s edition, to
                        which page numbers refer.</note>
                however, opens with a crew of Jewish beggars who soon reveal that “Stumpy Sol has
                two legs, Armless Isaac two arms, and Blind Jonathan two good eyes” (stage
                direction, Nahshon 407). Deceit rather than wit becomes their overriding
                characteristic, and the pathos of the early scene in the novella is gone. Also
                introduced right away is Deborah, Manasseh da Costa’s daughter, now a hard-bitten
                schnorrer herself. When the others tell her to go home, a “woman’s place,” she
                complains that she needs the money for her dowry and that her father takes all that
                she schnorrs, anyway (409). This may be marginally more suitable to the post-women’s
                suffrage audience than a Deborah who is talked about and bargained over but who
                never appears, as in the novel, but it detracts from Manasseh’s uniqueness, at least
                in his family. Further drifting from its source, the 1925 play adds a subplot
                depicting the desired marriage between Grobstock’s daughter and a Sephardi dandy.
                This subplot, again, adds a significant woman to the cast, and presents dramatically
                what Manasseh only alludes to in the novella: that when it comes to a Sephardi of
                the upper class, he will be allowed to marry whomever he wants. All of these changes
                may have been made to heighten dramatic interest and popularity. In 1925 Zangwill
                was struggling financially while self-producing his more overtly didactic political
                plays. He was also sixty-one years of age at the time of these serious professional
                reverses, not the up-and-coming twenty-nine-year-old who saw the short novel through
                its appearance in the <title level="j">Idler</title>. He would
                die the following year. According to Nahshon, the first run of <title level="m">The
                King of Schnorrers</title> in London was intentionally short, and the reviews were
                mixed; revivals in 1930 had a total of ten performances, and in 1950 twenty-one
                (395–97). But Zangwill’s own opening-out of the story to fit expected conventions,
                both of theater and of how a beggar is to be perceived, may have diluted the story’s
                wit and its point, to its detriment.</p>
            <p> The novella, in its focus on the men of the story, with only a few brief appearances
                by Grobstock’s and Manasseh’s wives, is in fact uncharacteristic of Zangwill, who
                throughout his fiction and drama explored the lives and thoughts of female
                characters both as protagonists and secondary figures. In this novella, however, the
                nearly all-male cast of characters is effective, as it underscores the
                interconnectedness of schnorrers and financiers, as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardi
                pomposities, in what was a male-dominated commercial system. Turning the dandy Beau
                Belasco (who appears just briefly in the middle of the novella) into, in the play, a
                full-fledged character seeking the hand of Grobstock’s daughter detracts from the
                focus on Manasseh and his schemes. </p>
            <p><title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> as a play&#8212;not
                necessarily a play by Zangwill&#8212;seems to have had more success in the United States.
                Jacob Adler adapted a Yiddish version in 1905 (Nahshon 394), and Judd Woldin’s
                musical version, first performed in 1979 as <title level="m">Petticoat Lane</title>,
                has been produced well into the twenty-first century in various adaptations of its
                own. <title level="m">Petticoat Lane</title> is an effective adaptation in that it
                focuses closely on a few distinct instances of schnorring, each following logically
                from the one preceding and staying close to Zangwill’s own witty dialogue. Deborah’s
                suitor is in this case a cabinet-maker, which allows Manasseh once again to
                deprecate work as a suitable means for providing for a wife. The setting, however,
                seems more late-nineteenth century than eighteenth, with Deborah Da Costa a
                proto-suffragette. The streamlined plot, as well, becomes too streamlined when the
                central conflict revolves around Manasseh’s disdain for the Ashkenazim, something
                treated lightly and only briefly at the start of Zangwill’s novella.</p>
            <p> The title of Woldin’s play when I saw it in 1997 was not <title level="m">Petticoat
                Lane</title>, but <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>. That restored
                title alone may account for some of the success of recent productions, as children
                and grandchildren of Jewish immigrants&#8212;not fluent in Yiddish themselves&#8212;have seen
                the word <emph>schnorrer</emph> and laughed, aware of its only semi-secret
                (and as we have seen, now English) meaning. Today there is a resurgence of interest
                in the serious study of Yiddish, a recognition that this was a language in which
                Jews of Europe wrote poetry, prose, and drama; did business; made love; argued;
                mourned; bought groceries; and did everything else one uses a language for. But in
                the middle of the twentieth-century, and even later, a Jewish comedian had only to
                say a word in Yiddish to get a laugh. In 2015, when Robert Brustein’s
                <title level="m">The King of Second Avenue</title> (based on
                <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>) was performed in Boston, the reviewer
                for the <title level="j">Globe</title> called it, affectionately, “a serving of
                borscht,” alluding to the comic borscht belt of the Catskills that had its heyday in
                the 1950s and ‘60s. Brustein&#8212;whose high-culture credentials as founder of the Yale
                and American Repertory Theaters and adapter of classic plays are duly noted&#8212;is said
                to have “the soul of a borscht belt comedian.” Brustein himself agrees: “I’m a
                burlesque artist at heart” (Brown). But for all its humor and even sight gags (the
                President of the Mahamad’s apoplexy, for instance), the novella does not seem to fit
                those pop-culture descriptions, even though Israel Zangwill himself linked it with
                “grotesques and fantasies.” </p>
            <p> I saw the retitled Woldin musical at the Florida Jewish Theatre, where it was
                directed by Russell Kaplan. In his Director’s Note in the program, Kaplan referred
                to Zangwill as “one of the greatest writers of Yiddish fiction of the 19th century,”
                repeating an error that would have
                exasperated Zangwill, who wrote in English, not Yiddish, and who saw himself as
                working within both British and Jewish cultures, connecting the two. Perhaps Kaplan
                assumed that a play about a schnorrer&#8212;using that “funny” word&#8212;must be entirely
                frivolous and originally Yiddish. Manasseh has schnorred in many languages; on a
                trip to France in the 1990s I saw a placard listing plays to be performed that
                summer, including <title level="m">Le Roi Des Schnorrers</title>, <emph>par</emph>
                Israel Zangwill.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Winehouse, in his dissertation, notes that
                                Zangwill gave permission for a French musical version in 1923
                                (178–79). Whether or not that was the play I saw advertised, I do
                                not know.</note> And although Zangwill objected to
                the “low comedy” of Jacob Adler’s operetta (Nahshon 394), one might expect to find
                other Yiddish adaptations. However, after searching a number of comprehensive
                databases, the closest I could come was a Hebrew edition, published in 1900.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author"> Listed in WorldCat. I also searched, without success, the catalogs
                    of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, and the Yiddish Book Center,
                    although some of those did include translations to other European languages.</note>
                <title level="m">Dreamers of the Ghetto</title> (1898)&#8212;one of Zangwill’s more serious
                and historically-based works&#8212;seems to be the only work of his that can readily be
                found today in a Yiddish edition. Perhaps Zangwill’s ambivalence about the language
                left him ambivalent about authorizing translations, or perhaps they had only limited
                circulation. The Hebrew translation, in fact, at a time when modern Hebrew was being
                developed and encouraged, used a Hebrew word in place of schnorrer in its title,
                even though that word&#8212;<foreign xml:lang="yi">kabtsn</foreign> or
                <foreign xml:lang="yi">kamtsn</foreign>&#8212;has the significantly different meaning of cheapskate or stingy

                        are used in Yiddish, but the origin of <foreign xml:lang="yi">schnorrer</foreign>
                            is German, not Hebrew. See, for example, Rochelson, pp. 172–73, 223,
                                and elsewhere.</note>
            </p>
            <p><title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> was neither
                Zangwill’s first nor his last treatment of economic justice in fiction. For example,
                in <title level="m">Children of the Ghetto</title> an admired and idealistic character
                asserts that Moses “was the first Socialist” (265), citing the laws of the Torah to
                which Manasseh, also, would refer. In the widely reprinted
                <title level="m">Dreamers of the Ghetto</title>, which compiles slightly fictionalized stories of
                failed idealists, the German-Jewish socialist Ferdinand Lassalle receives a chapter.
                Zangwill often, too, contributed to causes promoted by trade unionists and
                socialists.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See, for example, Rochelson,
                    pp. 172–73, 223, and elsewhere.</note> <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title>
                    presents in a subtle and palatable form radical ideas of economic justice that Zangwill always saw
                as Jewish. Indeed, <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> may have yet
                appeared in Yiddish, even if only through informal publication. One would think that
                the Yiddish-literate workers of his day, despite Manasseh Da Costa’s disparagement
                of labor, would have cheered Zangwill’s clever and effective means of upholding
                their rights and sticking it to the bosses. </p>
