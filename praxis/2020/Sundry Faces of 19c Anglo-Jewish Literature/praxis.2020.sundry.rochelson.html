            <p class="noCount">Israel Zangwill (1864-1926) was a literary celebrity, a Zionist, and a suffrage activist,
               and, in his time, possibly the best-known Jewish writer in the Anglophone world. His
               1892 novel <em>Children of the Ghetto</em> became a British and American bestseller; in 1908 his play <em>The Melting-Pot</em> argued for the value of immigration and provided future studies of ethnicity with
               a much-debated metaphor. By the middle of the twentieth century, however, Zangwill’s
               fame had declined, and his best-known work of fiction was likely <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> (1894), a short novel that solidified his fame as a Jewish humorist. In fact, however,
               this comedic work that Zangwill published in a volume of “grotesques and fantasies”
               embeds some of his most trenchant social criticism and satire. Indeed, <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> presents in a subtle and palatable form radical ideas of economic justice that Zangwill
               always saw as Jewish.</p>

               <p>At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Israel Zangwill
                  (1864–1926) was a literary celebrity, a political activist, and possibly the best-known
                  Jew in the Anglophone world. He was the author of <em>Children of the Ghetto</em> (1892), a novel about the Jews of London that became a British and American bestseller
                  and was widely translated. In 1908 he wrote the play <em>The Melting-Pot</em>, which argued for the value of immigration to American culture and provided future
                  studies of ethnicity with a much-debated metaphor. Having started his career as a
                  journalist, Zangwill wrote a number of novels and plays, as well as short stories,
                  and not only on Jewish subjects. He advocated for British women’s suffrage and was
                  a leader in, first, Theodor Herzl’s Zionist movement and, later, the Jewish Territorial
                  Organization, which he founded. Zangwill’s writings as well as his activism attest
                  to a strong sense of social justice, while his literary work often nested serious
                  questions in a web of humorous characterization and wordplay. Such an apparently mixed
                  modality often led to mixed reviews; while some critics might have found the humor
                  jarring, others wished Zangwill would stick only to humor. By the middle of the twentieth
                  century, when it was excerpted by Nathan Ausubel in <em>A Treasury of Jewish Folklore</em> and reissued in the United States by Shoe String Press, Zangwill’s best-known work
                  of fiction was probably <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> (1894), a work which solidified Zangwill’s fame as a Jewish humorist. Now that more
                  of Israel Zangwill’s work has been republished, and Zangwill himself has come under
                  more serious study,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           Winehouse, and Wohlgelernter. The bibliographies in those books should lead to article-length
                           critical essays.</span></div>
                  </div> it is worth looking at how that masterpiece of humor also embeds some of Israel Zangwill’s
                  most biting social criticism.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>The King of Schnorrers</em> was first published in six monthly parts in the <em>Idler</em>, a new literary magazine edited by Jerome K. Jerome and Robert Barr. Zangwill became
                  associated with Jerome after publishing short stories and satirical columns in Jewish
                  periodicals, and, in 1890, becoming editor of the comic newspaper <em>Puck</em>, which he renamed <em>Ariel</em>. For the <em>Idler</em>, Zangwill wrote several short stories and an essay for the series <em>My First Book</em> before serializing <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> in Volume Four, from August 1893 to January 1894.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Afterward, Zangwill became a regular contributor to the Idler’s Club, a forum featuring
                           Idler writers on aspects of current culture.</span></div>
                  </div> The <em>Idler</em> was, in general, a magazine for light reading by intelligent readers, but with diverse
                  kinds of contributions. Anne Humpherys describes its tone as “liberal, irreverent,
                  and sentimental,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                           the entry on Robert Barr—Jerome’s co-editor—by Alison Janice Minoff Cox in the Dictionary
                           of Literary Biography, vol. 70, Gale, 1988, cited earlier in the same paragraph.</span></div>
                  </div> but makes clear that it did not have any narrow political or moral agenda: <span class="quote">‘Fiction of course was prominent, but there were also articles on the theatre, books,
                     and exhibitions. There were interviews with celebrities of various sorts, and educational
                     essays on natural history, foreign countries and alien cultural practices as well
                     as tours of historical buildings. The fiction from the beginning included detective
                     and adventure stories, but also a good number of more or less sentimental stories
                     of love and romance. (2) ’</span> Serialization of <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> in the <em>Idler</em> helped Zangwill to naturalize Jewish life in British, American, and modern European
                  culture at the same time as it placed him in the center of English letters. Jerome
                  and Barr sought diversity in content and authorship, and thus the magazine featured
                  most of the 1890s’ best known literary writers, with the possible significant exception
                  of writers in the aesthetic movement. <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>’ serialized chapters followed Part II of <em>Royal Pets</em>, by Ernest M. Jessop; an episode of the <em>Idler’s Club</em> (a forum of writers’ opinions on current topics); 
                  “My First Book”
                   essays by Marie Corelli, 
                  “John Strange Winter”
                   (Henrietta Stannard), and Jerome K. Jerome; and Part II of the story 
                  “Exchange <em>is</em> Robbery,”
                   by Richard Marsh, best known today, perhaps, as author of <em>The Beetle</em> (1897). Other works in the volume included a story by Arthur Conan Doyle and a profile
                  of George Meredith. Zangwill would have been pleased by his serial’s placement, and
                  he was an <em>Idler</em> “regular.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The appearance of the entire first chapter of <em>The King</em> in Ausubel’s <em>Treasury of Jewish Folklore</em> suggests that the story was taken from traditional materials and has become part of
                  folklore itself, and, indeed, there is a chicken/egg question surrounding this short
                  novel. Which came first: <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> or the widespread understanding among Ashkenazi Jews of the humor inherent in the
                  Yiddish term of its title? Zangwill acknowledged his debt to tradition in his foreword
                  to the 1894 volume reprint: “I have merely amused myself and attempted to amuse idlers
                  by incarnating the floating tradition of the Jewish <span class="smallcaps">Schnorrer</span>, who is as unique among beggars as Israel among nations” (v). Ausubel ascribes this
                  uniqueness to the wit with which the schnorrer
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)

                           since both Merriam-Webster and the OED present it as an English word, as I will explain.</span></div>
                  </div> cajoles funds from donors, and the wealth of Judaic learning with which this particular
                  type of beggar abashes the materially wealthy, and Zangwill’s “King”—Manasseh Bueno
                  Barzillai Azevedo da Costa—has wit and Jewish learning in abundance. Bernard Winehouse
                  and Edna Nahshon both credit Zangwill’s novella with promoting the image of this wily
                  character, but acknowledge, as well, that Zangwill was well-versed in the history
                  of the schnorrer figure long before he created Manasseh, and had included schnorrers
                  in earlier writings. Yet Zangwill’s memorable <em>King of Schnorrers</em>—the novella and the character—certainly helped popularize the term, which was, according
                  to the OED, an un-italicized English word as early as 1899. One might well ask whether,
                  when Freud related a “salmon mayonnaise” story in <em>Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious</em>, he was thinking of a traditional folkloric example or of Zangwill’s Manasseh justifying
                  his purchase of salmon after receiving the wealthy Grobstock’s charity: “If I do not
                  buy salmon when I have two guineas, . . . when shall I buy salmon?” (<em>King</em> 16).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Freud retells this “Jewish joke,” “An impoverished individual borrowed 25 florins
                           from a prosperous acquaintance, with many asseverations of his necessitous circumstances.
                           The very same day his benefactor met him again in a restaurant with a plate of salmon
                           mayonnaise in front of him. The benefactor reproached him. . . .‘I don’t understand,’
                           replied the object of the attack; ‘if I haven’t any money I can’t eat salmon mayonnaise,
                           and if I have some money I mustn’t eat salmon mayonnaise. Well, then, when am I to
                           eat salmon mayonnaise?’” (49–50).</span></div>
                  </div> Freud had written to a friend, in 1897, that “for some time past I have been putting
                  together a collection of Jewish anecdotes” (4), and one may speculate on whether his
                  sources included Zangwill’s work. However, given the length to which Zangwill spins
                  out the episode beyond the initial joke—at the end of Chapter One having the embarrassed
                  Grobstock appear to his servant as Manasseh’s food carrier—it is possible that Freud
                  and Zangwill both used traditional sources, with the fiction writer expanding rather
                  than explaining. When, in the film <em>Animal Crackers</em> (1930), Groucho Marx responded to the crowd’s “Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African
                  explorer,” with, “Did someone call me schnorrer?” he assumed that audiences would
                  understand the word—or that, if they didn’t, they should. The OED defines a schnorrer
                  as, originally, a beggar (its basic and least evocative definition), but adds that
                  now it has the connotations of “a scrounger, a freeloader; a layabout, a good-for-nothing.”
                  Merriam-Webster’s more positive definition is closer to Zangwill’s and to Groucho’s:
                  “one who wheedles others into supplying his or her wants.” It is the wheedling that
                  characterizes Zangwill’s schnorrer and that gives the word a taste of bittersweet
                  humor in the mouths of Jews today.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In keeping with his desire to maintain a dual persona, when Zangwill published <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> in volume form he added to it a collection of shorter stories, from the <em>Idler</em> and from other periodicals, only a few of which had Jewish content. All were labeled
                  together in a subtitle, <em>Grotesques and Fantasies</em>, which itself suggests a certain ambivalence by Zangwill toward his subject matter.
                  Zangwill’s friend Joseph Leftwich reported (from hearsay) that Zangwill had considered
                  ending the <em>Idler</em> serial halfway through, but Jerome persuaded him to continue (250). However, Leftwich
                  goes on to quote Zangwill as, throughout his life, being gleeful at the success of
                  his unusual protagonist and story. <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> was Zangwill’s next extended work after his bestselling realist novel of Jewish life, <em>Children of the Ghetto</em> (1892),

                  </div> and he likely enjoyed the freedom of comedy unmixed with sorrow, and romance only
                  barely mixed with realism.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The concept of Romanticism in late Victorian literature is not new. In 2013, the Birkbeck
                  Centre for Nineteenth-Century Studies and the English Faculty of Oxford University
                  held a conference titled 
                  “Romanticism at the Fin de Siècle,”
                   which “place[d] Romanticism at the core” of that later cultural era (Announcement).
                  One finds echoes of Romanticism in aestheticist theory and Romantic-seeming evocations
                  of past eras in aesthetic poetry, prose, and visual art. For Zangwill, who was not
                  in the aestheticist camp,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                           Oscar Wilde during his trials and imprisonment; see Rochelson, pp. 80–81.</span></div>
                  </div> romance was a contrast to realism that helped contextualize bitter truths that he
                  often took as his subject matter. The “Proem” to <em>Children of the Ghetto</em>, a novel whose first full chapter is set in a late Victorian soup kitchen, takes
                  place in early nineteenth-century London, its reminiscences of an earlier generation
                  of Jews softened, as at its end, by a veil of nostalgia: <span class="quote">‘Perhaps, here and there, some decrepit centenarian rubs his purblind eyes with the
                     ointment of memory, and sees these pictures of the past, hallowed by the concentration
                     of time, and finds his shriveled cheek wet with the pathos sanctifying the joys that
                     have been. (69) ’</span> In contrast, <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> announces its satiric mode from the start, but it, too, is set in the Romantic era,
                  in this case, the late eighteenth century, “in the days when Lord George Gordon became
                  a Jew, and was suspected of insanity; when, out of respect for the prophecies, England
                  denied her Jews every civic right except that of paying taxes; . . .” (1). By the
                  end of this first paragraph, however, the reader is immersed in the details of the
                  story at hand. The outlandish costumes of its picaresque hero and outmoded eighteenth-century
                  dress and furnishings of surrounding characters provide a distanced (and thus effectively
                  dissonant) backdrop for 1894 social satire.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><em>The King of Schnorrers</em> begins by lampooning the rivalries between rich and poor, Sephardi and Ashkenazi,
                  reversing expectations by making the wealthy man of German Jewish descent while the
                  pauper/beggar is Iberian. The interethnic rivalry played upon here was part of a “myth
                  of Sephardi superiority,” <span class="quote">‘the belief that Jews from the Iberian peninsula were different in kind from other
                     Jews, that they were superior by virtue of their culture, learning, wealth, descent,
                     manners, or indeed even blood. (Endelman 226) ’</span> The myth had its roots in medieval Spain. When the Jews were expelled from Spain and
                  Portugal during the Inquisitions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it spread
                  to other parts of Europe. As Todd Endelman has shown, however, by the late nineteenth
                  century—and even the late eighteenth—Ashkenazi Jews outnumbered Sephardim in London,
                  and by the mid-1800s “most of the important Jewish banking houses—the Rothschilds
                  chief among them—traced their origins to the Frankfurt ghetto, not the courts and
                  estates of Castile and Aragon” (228). Thus when suave, brilliant, and devout Manasseh
                  outsmarts the rich but “coarse”

                  well as his financial acumen. Edna Nahshon relates that the story’s final conflict
                  has its root in an actual event of 1745, when a Sephardi synagogue warden petitioned
                  the Mahamad (the Sephardic religious governing body) to marry an Ashkenazic woman
                  (392–93), an event that is obliquely referred to in the novella. However, the fascinating

                  satire in the plot. As Zangwill in <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> reverses easy expectations and prejudices, he also suggests new ways of looking at
                  such terms as work, profession, investment, and wealth. Groucho is not the only Marx
                  relevant to <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The language of commerce pervades this novella. Yes, there are comic reversals as
               the poorly yet fancifully attired schnorrer reminds the wealthy Grobstock and others
               that by schnorring he allows them to fulfill the commandment of helping the needy.
               Yes, Manasseh asserts a nobility of learning and religious devotion that places him
               above the shallow pomposities of Grobstock and the Sephardic Mahamad. But throughout
               the work a pattern of references makes clear that both rich and poor operate according
               to the same laws of exchange. When the dim but basically good-natured Grobstock realizes
               he owes Manasseh an apology, the narrator reports that he “proceeded honestly to pay
               it, but with a maladroit manner, as one unaccustomed to the currency” (8). When Grobstock
               offers three guineas for the salmon, while Manasseh has bargained for two, Manasseh
               reminds him that “this is not an auction” (14). Grobstock accuses Manasseh of theft
               because “a pauper—a beggar—with a wife and children” should not spend all he has—his
               charity from Grobstock—“on a mere luxury like salmon” (15–16). From here proceeds
               Zangwill’s version of the salmon joke, because once the money leaves Grobstock’s hand
               the salmon is no longer his. It is Manasseh’s property, and he has every right to
               do with it as he pleases. Similarly, when Grobstock gives Manasseh a trove of his
               used clothing, expecting Manasseh to wear it to dinner at his home and thus spare
               him shame before his servants, he is outraged to learn that Manasseh has immediately
               sold the items to a wealthy used-clothing dealer. When Manasseh replies that he can’t
               wear such clothes because “I know my station” (48), we suspect a multiple meaning.
               He knows the value of the clothing and he knows his own worth as a man, as well as
               a man of business. Once Grobstock gives him the clothes, again, they are Manasseh’s
               to use as he pleases. If Grobstock chooses to be embarrassed by Manasseh’s usual garb,
               that is none of Manasseh’s concern. However, since Manasseh will receive Grobstock’s
               clothing in perpetuity, he reminds the financier not to spill snuff on it or do anything
               else that might decrease its value. Similarly, when he agrees to sell the salmon back
               to Grobstock, he insists on three guineas, not two, the larger figure being the value
               Grobstock had originally assigned to it, along with profit for having been made into
               a middleman and “compensation for being degraded to fishmongering” as well as for
               losing the salmon itself (28–29)—even though he had already rebuked the financier
               for interrupting <em>his</em> original negotiations, saying he could have gotten the salmon for twenty-five shillings
               had Grobstock not offered the much higher price (18). Manasseh knows that value is
               equal only to the most that someone will pay for something and does not correspond
               to any so-called intrinsic worth.</p>
            <p>Before Manasseh agrees to take Grobstock’s clothing, he makes sure that Grobstock
               does not already have a “clothes-receiver” (22). Schnorring is a business, like Grobstock’s
               directorship in the East India Company, and it has its rules and ethics. One does
               not trespass on a competitor’s territory. Manasseh also insists that the position
               be permanent, because “it hurts one’s reputation to lose a client” (22). Similarly,
               one can present part of one’s own schnorring-ground as dowry to a prospective son-in-law
               (103–04). Yankelé, the Ashkenazi schnorrer to whom Manasseh will marry his daughter,
               enumerates to his prospective father-in-law what he will bring to the marriage through
               a combination of schnorring, selling old clothes, and carrying out synagogue and communal
               duties. Their conversation is filled with Wildean paradox: <span class="quote">‘Manasseh shook his head. “<em>Schnorring</em> is the only occupation that is regular all the year round,” he said. “Everything
                  else may fail—the greatest commercial houses may totter to the ground; as it is written,
                  ‘He humbleth the proud.’ But the <em>Schnorrer</em> is always secure. Whoever falls, there are always enough left to look after <em>him</em>. If you were a father, Yankelé, you would understand my feelings. How can a man allow
                  his daughter’s future happiness to repose on a basis so uncertain as work? (71)’</span> One can almost hear Lady Bracknell interrogating Jack Worthing, although <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> had its first performance the year after <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> was published.</p>
            <p>Writing about the short novel in 1953, less than a decade after the Holocaust ended,
               Bernard Schilling reminded readers of “the background of sorrow and evil” against
               which Jewish humor has flourished throughout Jewish history (vii), a context that
               later critics have not especially emphasized, while all who have written on <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> acknowledge its consonance with Zangwill’s lifelong concern for the poor. Indeed,
               as his reputation rose and fell in loftier circles even during his lifetime, he remained
               a hero to the immigrant Jews of the East End. But, as even Schilling points out, “the
               materials before us are much too funny for inquiry into their sadder implications”
               (xiv). Manasseh indeed has two professions, schnorrer and Talmud scholar, an explicator
               of Jewish law for those whose pursuits are wholly material. As he quotes from scripture
               and rabbinic texts to prevent potential almsgivers from falling into sin (since charity
               is an essential commandment), his learned conning provides a great deal of the novella’s
               comedy. Having already taken ownership of the packets of coins in the bag he has taken
               from Grobstock to carry the salmon, he further asks the financier if he might have
               left anything in the pockets of his clothes; if so, Manasseh will return to him anything
               “of no value to anybody but you” (33). He reminds the astounded financier of the biblical
               laws relating to gleaners: <span class="quote">‘‘When thou reapest thine harvest in thine field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field,
                  thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless,
                  and for the widow.’ . . . You will admit that Moses would have added a prohibition
                  against searching minutely the pockets of cast-off garments, were it not that for
                  forty years our ancestors had to wander in the wilderness in the same clothes, which
                  miraculously waxed with their growth. (34) ’</span> At this point one assumes that Grobstock, concerned about appearances and not wanting
               to seem ignorant of Jewish law, would readily capitulate to Manasseh’s assumption
               of what is his due. He does so, but Zangwill goes further, noting that “Grobstock’s
               magnanimity responded to the appeal.” Additional descriptions of this sort affirm
               that Grobstock’s magnanimity is genuine; after all, he first appears in the novella
               giving alms to a crowd of beggars outside the synagogue. In a novella that ends with
               Manasseh carrying out the greatest schnorr of all—getting the Sephardic leadership
               to agree to the marriage of Sephardic Deborah and Ashkenazic Yankelé <em>and</em> granting the King of Schnorrers an income for life—Zangwill calls upon the forces
               of law and business to bring this about.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The middle chapters of <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> examine how Yankelé is able to demonstrate his professional prowess to Manasseh by
                  schnorring dinner at the home of a notoriously stingy rabbi. The last two chapters
                  of the six, however, reveal Manasseh appearing before the court of the Mahamad, using
                  his verbal wit to show that Sephardi officialdom is as pompous as any <em>grob</em> German. Manasseh knows the <em>Ascamot</em> (or <em>Laws and Regulations</em>) better than the authorities do, and he knows that nowhere in this document is the
                  marriage between a Sephardi and an Ashkenazi Jew prohibited (117).

                  </div> Finally, after the President has threatened him with excommunication, Manasseh threatens
                  to spread word of the Mahamad’s small-minded contumely not only to the Sephardic <span xml:lang="yi" lang="yi" class="foreign">Yahidim</span> from whom he schnorrs, but also to “that very Ashkenazic community you contemn— .
                  . . a community that waxes daily in wealth and greatness while you sleep in your sloth”
                  (124–25). In the course of this speech Manasseh has managed to occupy the President’s
                  chair, and the effect of the speech and the action leave the President “gasping like
                  a landed cod” (125–26), reminiscent of the bagged salmon in chapter one, and finally
                  having a stroke on the spot. He recovers, but in his absence “Manasseh found scant
                  difficulty in imposing his will on the minor officers” (128) and the wedding between
                  Yankelé and Deborah takes place.</p>
            </div>
            <p>However, this is not the King of Schnorrers’ ultimate success. Just as a glassy-eyed
               fish returns to the narrative, so does Joseph Grobstock. As a new father-in-law, Manasseh
               takes on the honor of making monetary donations to the congregation, even though his
               major source of income is schnorring (or more generally taking alms) from the same
               congregation’s leaders. His logic is impossible to summarize or concisely record,
               but “every man who yielded to Manasseh’s eloquence was a step to reach the next” and
               he soon collects a kingly sum for the synagogue’s coffers (140). Deciding to make
               the gift even greater, he asks Grobstock to invest the money for him. When the East
               India director suggests that Manasseh go to someone else this time, Manasseh closes
               the circle of the economic plot: <span class="quote">‘Sir! . . . You are a skilful—nay a famous, financier. You know what stocks to buy,
                  what stocks to sell, when to follow a rise, and when a fall. . . . What would you
                  say if <em>I</em> presumed to interfere in your financial affairs—if I told you to issue these shares
                  or to call in those? You would tell me to mind my own business; and you would be perfectly
                  right. Now <em>Schnorring</em> is <em>my</em> business. Trust me, I know best whom to come to. (150)’</span> In Grobstock’s hands the sixty pounds grow to six hundred, and Manasseh donates the
               balance to the congregation “to purchase a life-annuity (styled the Da Costa Fund)
               for a poor and deserving member of the congregation, in whose selection he, as donor,
               should have the ruling voice” (156). Of course, he chooses himself, earning in perpetuity
               the title of <em>King of Schnorrers</em>. In the end, although <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>’ satire targets intracommunal and class rivalries, it concludes, as Nahshon points
               out, “not with chaos and revolution, but with orderly power-sharing and acceptance”
               (393). Zangwill’s comic novella reveals how to create a civil society despite social,
               cultural, and economic differences. This, of course, is a major theme of Torah and
               Jewish ethics.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The critique of capitalism in this novella is not strictly Marxian. The financier,
                  after all, is key to the schnorrer’s financial success, and money produced for the
                  most part by commerce and investment is what keeps the religious communities afloat.
                  But so do the machinations of schnorrers, who also have to live, and who use spiritual
                  persuasion while heeding the laws of capitalism. Schnorring may be considered labor
                  in that it takes the place of more conventional kinds of work, but the schnorrer is
                  more accurately an entrepreneur. Work and schnorring are mutually exclusive, as Manasseh
                  makes clear. Audrey Jaffe’s analysis of Conan Doyle’s 
                  “The Man with the Twisted Lip”
                   is thus in many ways relevant to <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>. Finding that he can earn more by disguising himself as a disfigured beggar, Doyle’s
                  Neville St. Clair keeps up the pretense of managing financial interests in the City,
                  while actually conducting a very different enterprise. Jaffe points out that “the
                  scenario wherein a beggar is revealed to be a gentleman or nobleman in disguise is
                  a familiar one” in nineteenth-century literature, and in the parallels I have noted
                  between schnorrer and financier, Zangwill’s novella is part of that pattern. For a
                  moment, even Grobstock wonders whether Manasseh might really be a Spanish nobleman
                  playing a role, and questions whether he, himself, has been the “victim of a practical
                  joke, a prank? Did not a natural aristocracy ooze from every pore of this mysterious
                  visitor? Was not every tone, every gesture, that of a man born to rule?” (41). If
                  there is no sure way to distinguish among the aristocrat, the financier, and the beggar,
                  then how can one be reassured by social hierarchies? Moreover, as Jaffe points out,
                  “the figure of the finance capitalist [such as Grobstock in <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>] confounds the attempt . . . to define identity in relation to work” (49), the principle
                  upon which condemnation of the beggar (or schnorrer) rests. Noting that even St. Clair’s
                  wife had no idea of what his business in the City was—not even the business he purported
                  to conduct—Jaffe writes that “the ‘man who does something in the City’ exemplifies
                  the kind of fungible identity that, his contemporaries feared, inhabited a realm of
                  exchange divorced from production” (51). In other words, does it essentially matter
                  whether one deals at the exchange or on the street, so long as the money comes home?
                  To what is considered respectable society it certainly does, and so St. Clair is ordered
                  to abandon his alter-ego, to the extent of not even revealing “Hugh Boone” or his
                  longterm begging to his wife. Yet by revealing the instability of economic and class
                  identities, 
                  “The Man with the Twisted Lip”
                   lifts a veil on the unstable underpinnings of nineteenth-century bourgeois society.
                  Writing in a similarly moralistic mid-twentieth-century context, Bernard Schilling
                  anticipates Jaffe’s conclusions, with only slight hesitation: <span class="quote">‘The whole seems an ironic comment upon the absurdity of all human arrangements; one
                     becomes <em>almost</em> persuaded that Manasseh is right, that his parasitical impudence and refusal to work
                     for what he extorts from the sober, reasonable, and industrious pedestrians who run
                     the world—that this is in fact justified and is no more ludicrous than the actual
                     nature of things anyway. (xxxiii; emphasis added)’</span> I would propose that Zangwill in <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> makes precisely the case that Schilling suggests. Condemned by what is thought of
                  as respectable society, schnorring requires both effort and intelligence; it is in
                  a category of its own, as essential perhaps to the larger world as it is to the Jewish
                  community in the ways it brings wit, performance, creativity, and, indeed instability
                  to more sober and less open societal constructs.

               <p>Here is where <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> diverges from 
                  “The Man with the Twisted Lip,”
                   and also goes beyond the play that Zangwill created from the novella in 1925. Ausubel
                  distinguishes the schnorrer from ordinary Jewish beggars who survived not through
                  wit but through feigning disability (267), much as Hugh Boone sports a cosmetic scar
                  across his lower face. Zangwill goes even further. The crowd of beggars at the synagogue
                  door when the story opens are all described as schnorrers, and the few who present
                  physical afflictions are sincere and discreet: <span class="quote">‘A green shade might denote weakness of sight, but the stone-blind man bore no braggart
                     placard—his infirmity was an old established concern well known to the public, and
                     conferring upon the proprietor a definite status in the community. . . . Rarest of
                     all sights in this pageantry of Jewish pauperdom was the hollow trouser-leg or the
                     empty sleeve, or the wooden limb fulfilling either and pushing out a proclamatory
                     peg. (2) ’</span> The veracity of this statement is confirmed a few pages later, as the mendicants receive
                  “prize-packets” from Grobstock: “One of the few pieces of gold in the lucky-bag fell
                  to the solitary lame man, who danced in his joy on his sound leg”—an image confirmed
                  in Hutchinson’s lively illustration—“while the poor blind man pocketed his half-penny,
                  unconscious of ill-fortune, and merely wondering why the coin came swathed in paper”
                  (5). Although they may be less clever, witty, or learned than their king, these schnorrers
                  apparently share his sense of ethics. The 1925 play,

                  </div> however, opens with a crew of Jewish beggars who soon reveal that “Stumpy Sol has
                  two legs, Armless Isaac two arms, and Blind Jonathan two good eyes” (stage direction,
                  Nahshon 407). Deceit rather than wit becomes their overriding characteristic, and
                  the pathos of the early scene in the novella is gone. Also introduced right away is
                  Deborah, Manasseh da Costa’s daughter, now a hard-bitten schnorrer herself. When the
                  others tell her to go home, a “woman’s place,” she complains that she needs the money
                  for her dowry and that her father takes all that she schnorrs, anyway (409). This
                  may be marginally more suitable to the post-women’s suffrage audience than a Deborah
                  who is talked about and bargained over but who never appears, as in the novel, but
                  it detracts from Manasseh’s uniqueness, at least in his family. Further drifting from
                  its source, the 1925 play adds a subplot depicting the desired marriage between Grobstock’s
                  daughter and a Sephardi dandy. This subplot, again, adds a significant woman to the
                  cast, and presents dramatically what Manasseh only alludes to in the novella: that
                  when it comes to a Sephardi of the upper class, he will be allowed to marry whomever
                  he wants. All of these changes may have been made to heighten dramatic interest and
                  popularity. In 1925 Zangwill was struggling financially while self-producing his more
                  overtly didactic political plays. He was also sixty-one years of age at the time of
                  these serious professional reverses, not the up-and-coming twenty-nine-year-old who
                  saw the short novel through its appearance in the <em>Idler</em>. He would die the following year. According to Nahshon, the first run of <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> in London was intentionally short, and the reviews were mixed; revivals in 1930 had
                  a total of ten performances, and in 1950 twenty-one (395–97). But Zangwill’s own opening-out
                  of the story to fit expected conventions, both of theater and of how a beggar is to
                  be perceived, may have diluted the story’s wit and its point, to its detriment.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The novella, in its focus on the men of the story, with only a few brief appearances
               by Grobstock’s and Manasseh’s wives, is in fact uncharacteristic of Zangwill, who
               throughout his fiction and drama explored the lives and thoughts of female characters
               both as protagonists and secondary figures. In this novella, however, the nearly all-male
               cast of characters is effective, as it underscores the interconnectedness of schnorrers
               and financiers, as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardi pomposities, in what was a male-dominated
               commercial system. Turning the dandy Beau Belasco (who appears just briefly in the
               middle of the novella) into, in the play, a full-fledged character seeking the hand
               of Grobstock’s daughter detracts from the focus on Manasseh and his schemes. </p>
            <p><em>The King of Schnorrers</em> as a play—not necessarily a play by Zangwill—seems to have had more success in the
               United States. Jacob Adler adapted a Yiddish version in 1905 (Nahshon 394), and Judd
               Woldin’s musical version, first performed in 1979 as <em>Petticoat Lane</em>, has been produced well into the twenty-first century in various adaptations of its
               own. <em>Petticoat Lane</em> is an effective adaptation in that it focuses closely on a few distinct instances
               of schnorring, each following logically from the one preceding and staying close to
               Zangwill’s own witty dialogue. Deborah’s suitor is in this case a cabinet-maker, which
               allows Manasseh once again to deprecate work as a suitable means for providing for
               a wife. The setting, however, seems more late-nineteenth century than eighteenth,
               with Deborah Da Costa a proto-suffragette. The streamlined plot, as well, becomes
               too streamlined when the central conflict revolves around Manasseh’s disdain for the
               Ashkenazim, something treated lightly and only briefly at the start of Zangwill’s
               novella.</p>
            <p>The title of Woldin’s play when I saw it in 1997 was not <em>Petticoat Lane</em>, but <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>. That restored title alone may account for some of the success of recent productions,
               as children and grandchildren of Jewish immigrants—not fluent in Yiddish themselves—have
               seen the word <em>schnorrer</em> and laughed, aware of its only semi-secret (and as we have seen, now English) meaning.
               Today there is a resurgence of interest in the serious study of Yiddish, a recognition
               that this was a language in which Jews of Europe wrote poetry, prose, and drama; did
               business; made love; argued; mourned; bought groceries; and did everything else one
               uses a language for. But in the middle of the twentieth-century, and even later, a
               Jewish comedian had only to say a word in Yiddish to get a laugh. In 2015, when Robert
               Brustein’s <em>The King of Second Avenue</em> (based on <em>The King of Schnorrers</em>) was performed in Boston, the reviewer for the <em>Globe</em> called it, affectionately, “a serving of borscht,” alluding to the comic borscht
               belt of the Catskills that had its heyday in the 1950s and ‘60s. Brustein—whose high-culture
               credentials as founder of the Yale and American Repertory Theaters and adapter of
               classic plays are duly noted—is said to have “the soul of a borscht belt comedian.”
               Brustein himself agrees: “I’m a burlesque artist at heart” (Brown). But for all its
               humor and even sight gags (the President of the Mahamad’s apoplexy, for instance),
               the novella does not seem to fit those pop-culture descriptions, even though Israel
               Zangwill himself linked it with “grotesques and fantasies.”</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I saw the retitled Woldin musical at the Florida Jewish Theatre, where it was directed
                  by Russell Kaplan. In his Director’s Note in the program, Kaplan referred to Zangwill
                  as “one of the greatest writers of Yiddish fiction of the 19th century,” repeating
                  an error that would have exasperated Zangwill, who wrote in English, not Yiddish,
                  and who saw himself as working within both British and Jewish cultures, connecting
                  the two. Perhaps Kaplan assumed that a play about a schnorrer—using that “funny” word—must
                  be entirely frivolous and originally Yiddish. Manasseh has schnorred in many languages;
                  on a trip to France in the 1990s I saw a placard listing plays to be performed that
                  summer, including <em>Le Roi Des Schnorrers</em>, <em>par</em> Israel Zangwill.

                  </div> And although Zangwill objected to the “low comedy” of Jacob Adler’s operetta (Nahshon
                  394), one might expect to find other Yiddish adaptations. However, after searching
                  a number of comprehensive databases, the closest I could come was a Hebrew edition,
                  published in 1900.

                  </div> <em>Dreamers of the Ghetto</em> (1898)—one of Zangwill’s more serious and historically-based works—seems to be the
                  only work of his that can readily be found today in a Yiddish edition. Perhaps Zangwill’s
                  ambivalence about the language left him ambivalent about authorizing translations,
                  or perhaps they had only limited circulation. The Hebrew translation, in fact, at
                  a time when modern Hebrew was being developed and encouraged, used a Hebrew word in
                  place of schnorrer in its title, even though that word—<span xml:lang="yi" lang="yi" class="foreign">kabtsn</span> or <span xml:lang="yi" lang="yi" class="foreign">kamtsn</span>—has the significantly different meaning of cheapskate or stingy person.

                  For example, in <em>Children of the Ghetto</em> an admired and idealistic character asserts that Moses “was the first Socialist” (265),
                  citing the laws of the Torah to which Manasseh, also, would refer. In the widely reprinted <em>Dreamers of the Ghetto</em>, which compiles slightly fictionalized stories of failed idealists, the German-Jewish
                  socialist Ferdinand Lassalle receives a chapter. Zangwill often, too, contributed

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Afterward, Zangwill became a regular contributor to the <em>Idler’s Club</em>, a forum featuring <em>Idler</em> writers on aspects of current culture.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">As Freud retells this “Jewish joke,” “An impoverished individual borrowed 25 florins
               from a prosperous acquaintance, with many asseverations of his necessitous circumstances.
               The very same day his benefactor met him again in a restaurant with a plate of salmon
               mayonnaise in front of him. The benefactor reproached him. . . .‘I don’t understand,’
               replied the object of the attack; ‘if I haven’t any money I <em>can’t</em> eat salmon mayonnaise, and if I have some money I <em>mustn’t</em> eat salmon mayonnaise. Well, then, when <em>am</em> I to eat salmon mayonnaise?’” (49–50).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Although not a supporter of “art for art’s sake,” Zangwill expressed sympathy with
               Oscar Wilde during his trials and imprisonment; see Rochelson, pp. 80–81.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">In Yiddish, <em>grob</em> means thick, fat, or coarse; <em>stock</em>, in its most likely meaning here, is an intensifier for darkness, as the adjective
               in such English expressions as pitch dark or stone blind, suggesting Grobstock’s ignorance
               despite his materialism (Weinreich <em>Dictionary</em>). However, Zangwill may also be suggesting the English meaning, implying that the
               wealthy Jew comes from a “coarse stock.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Hutchinson frequently worked with Zangwill, and his illustrations for <em>The King of Schnorrers</em> appear in most editions of the book, even the 1953 reissue edited by Schilling. An
               exception is the 1960 Yoseloff edition, with woodcut-like modernistic drawings by
               Henk Krijger.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">The <em>Ascamot</em>, known in English as <em>The Laws and Regulations of the Congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews</em>, was published in a “revised and amended” version in London in 1850, which is the
               earliest copy available on the Hathitrust site. The congregation is referred to as
               <em>shaar ha-shamayim</em>, or Gate of Heaven, as Zangwill refers to it in the text. (The correct name appears
               at the start of Chapter Six in the <em>Idler</em>; it appears as Gates of Heaven in the 1894 volume.) We may assume that Zangwill consulted
               an eighteenth-century edition.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">As I will discuss, the nearly all-male cast of characters in this novella, and the
               way in which Manasseh’s daughter is objectified, may be yet another reason why Zangwill,
               an active feminist, chose to set the story in the eighteenth century.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               version in 1923 (178–79). Whether or not that was the play I saw advertised, I do
               not know.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
