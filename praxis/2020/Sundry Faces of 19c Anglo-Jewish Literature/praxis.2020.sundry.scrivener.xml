                <p rend="noCount">Although critics have studied extensively the Gothic writings of
                    Charlotte Dacre (Rey, King, Rosa Matilda), they have rarely discussed her work
                    as Jewish writing, and they have largely ignored the poetry and fiction of her
                    younger sister Sophia King (Fortnum). In fact, both sisters, daughters of
                    perhaps the most well-known Jew in England at the time, John King (Rey), never
                    severed connections with their father and wrote both directly and obliquely as
                    Jewish women; moreover, they were read as Jewish women. The historical trauma of
                    the Jewish expulsion from Iberia and the persecution by the Inquisition is
                    reflected in the writings of these Sephardic women. Fearlessly innovating within
                    the Gothic, sentimental, and philosophical traditions of writing, they also
                    subversively played against sexual stereotypes, linking their work to women like
                    Aphra Behn and Eliza Haywood, and anticipating the sexually explicit work of
                    Philip Roth and I. B. Singer. Moreover, their use of the supernatural draws upon
                    Jewish traditions of dybbuks and demons in the past and in the future. Reading
                    the work of Charlotte Dacre and Sophia King re-inscribes the importance of
                    Jewish contexts within Romantic aesthetics.</p>

            <p>Although accomplished literary scholars have written about the fiction and poetry of
                Charlotte (1781/82–1826) and Sophia King (1782–after 1805), the daughters of John
                “Jew” King (1753–1823; see Endelman), they rarely have read the King sisters in
                terms of a Jewish tradition of writing. Adriana Craciun, Diane Hoeveler, Lisa
                Wilson, Ann Jones, and others have written perceptively about Charlotte’s work, only
                rarely about Sophia, so that at least Charlotte is fairly well known, at least to
                scholars of the Gothic. The sisters’ work, however, is part of Jewish literature,
                even though the most obvious and immediate influences of the sisters, especially
                Charlotte, were on Byron and P. B. Shelley. I will show a circuitous route of
                connection between the sisters and modern Jewish literature, and I will illustrate
                the ways their work is meaningfully Jewish. </p>
            <p>Philip Roth’s postmodernist playing with his own identity in his fiction with the
                Zuckerman series and other novels harkens back to Lord Byron’s similar but Romantic
                playing with his own identity in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, and other poems.
                Some critics such as the British-American novelist Benjamin Markovits (2011, 2018)
                have drawn the connection between Roth (1933–2018) and Byron (1788–1824), and
                between Byron and the protagonist David Lurie, a secular Jew, in John Coetzee’s
                <title level="m">Disgrace</title> (1999), a novel that evokes both Roth and Byron. The
                daughters of John “Jew” King had a deep if rarely acknowledged influence on the
                noble poet. Charlotte’s
                <title level="m">Hours of Solitude</title> (1805) led to Byron’s
                <title level="m">Hours of Idleness</title> (1807), not just in the similarity of
                titles but in the sentimental and Della Cruscan style of both volumes. Also, the
                connection between Byron and modern writers like Roth and Coetzee entails a thematic
                preoccupation with sex that is a primary focus in their work. Roth acquired a
                notoriety not just for satirizing aspects of contemporary Jewish life, but
                especially for his representations of sex. While it might seem to some that Roth’s
                focus on sex is radically new, in fact there is a tradition of Jewish writers
                preoccupied in similar ways. The King sisters were pioneers in this area. They drew
                upon not just Mary Robinson (1758–1800) and her theatrical display of her beauty and
                her use of various pseudonyms, but also the Restoration/early eighteenth-century
                writing by women like Aphra Behn (1640–89) and Eliza Haywood (1693–1756). Haywood’s
                <title level="m">Fantomina</title> (1725), whose heroine displays inventive sexual
                initiative in her pursuit of the man she wants, seems like a precursor of
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title> (1806) and Charlotte’s other novels. The King
                sisters’ poetry and fiction are filled with illicit desires and transgressive sexual
                activity, often by women and from a woman’s perspective. One thinks of Virgina
                Woolf’s essay <title level="a">Professions for Women</title> (1931), where she
                acknowledges the taboo area
                of women writing about their authentic desires. Both Charlotte and Sophia wrote
                extensively about women characters struggling with desires that violated social
                norms. The young Jewish women deepened a sexual focus in their work rather than
                disguised it, and they resisted the ascendant prudish norm (for the norm, see
                Poovey), perhaps because, as socially marginal young women, they could be daring,
                especially with the example of their father in mind, a Jew who survived and thrived
                despite hostile public opinion and legal problems. Also they could use the notorious
                precedent of Lewis’s <title level="m">Monk</title> (1796) to expose the hypocrisy of a
                sexual double standard. Unlike Byron’s or Roth’s male characters, the Kings’ female
                characters paid a much heavier price than similar male characters ever paid for
                similar activities. </p>
            <p>Another aspect of Byronism prominent in Roth’s work is theatrical role playing so
                that the author intentionally suggests a connection, whether true or not, between
                him and his characters (on theatricality in late-eighteenth century England, see
                Pascoe). Charlotte was a practiced disguiser and revealer of her own identity and
                autobiography in her poetry and fiction, using pseudonyms such as Rosa Matilda, to
                evoke the associations with Matthew Lewis’s villain Rosario, who appears to be a
                young man, but who is actually a woman named Matilda, who seduces the monk Ambrosio
                and turns him to the dark side. She further obscured her real identity by using
                Charlotte Dacre as her “real” name, to which she attached an engraved image of
                herself on the title page, an image of a pretty dark-haired young woman wearing a
                close-fitting, low-cut dress. It was not usual for women writers to present
                themselves to the reading public with a sexy portrait of themselves (Mary Robinson
                excepted). Byron, in a characteristically High Romantic move, satirizes Charlotte’s
                poetry and fiction dismissively in <title level="m">British Bards and Scottish
                    Reviewers</title> (1809), as though he himself were not a student of her writing. A
                note appended to the second edition of <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch
                    Reviewers</title> where “Rosa Matilda” receives fourteen lines (756–64, 926–30)
                reads as follows: 
                <quote>
                <p rend="noCount">This lovely little Jessica, the daughter of the noted Jew K[ing],
                seems to be a follower of the Della Cruscan School, and has published two volumes of
                very respectable absurdities in rhyme, as times go; besides sundry novels in the
                style of the first edition of the Monk. (Byron <title level="m">Works</title> 1: 413)</p>
                </quote>
                Anyone capable of connecting the dots would realize that Charlotte Dacre, Rosa
                Matilda, and Charlotte King signified the same individual, the same Jewish woman,
                the daughter of a man who socialized frequently with William Godwin and who had
                financial dealings with him as well as Byron and Shelley (Byron <title
                level="m">Letters</title> 1: 89n1; St. Clair 353 ; Reiman vii; Scrivener, <title level="a">Philosopher</title>
                241–60). Moreover, Byron is connecting Charlotte to Shakespeare’s Shylock, the most
                hated Jew in English literature. Also, Byron’s early lyrics so closely resemble
                those of Charlotte that at least one of her poems was sometimes mistaken for his,
                namely <title level="a">The Mountain Violet.</title> To distance himself from and repudiate a style of
                poetry he himself practiced and for which he was criticized, Byron scapegoats Rosa
                Matilda, in what Jerome McGann aptly calls “a typically Romantic act of
                displacement” (<title level="a">‘My brain’</title> 56). </p>
            <p>Charlotte’s first novel is dedicated to Matthew Lewis (1775–1818), author of
                <title level="m">The Monk</title>, a scandalous novel even in 1806 when Charlotte’s
                own novel appears. Lewis was compelled to expurgate the first edition of his novel
                under threat of prosecution for blasphemy and obscenity (Gamer 1046). When Byron
                indicates that it is the first edition of <title level="m">The Monk</title> to which
                Rosa Matilda has affinity, he is linking her with a notorious breach of cultural
                norms. Moreover, Charlotte’s inserting in the title page a print of her attractive
                physical image provoked at least one reviewer to read it as sexual advertising:
                “Whether Miss Rosa has other views than that of having her poetry admired we cannot
                say” (Rev. of <title level="m">Hours</title> 429). With the
                <title level="m">Hours of Solitude</title> dedicated to a rich, powerful, older,
                unmarried man&#8212;John Penn, M. P. (1760–1834)&#8212;and the volume repeatedly reminding the
                reader of the poet’s youth&#8212;twenty-three at the time of publication, and much younger
                for some of the poems&#8212;Charlotte communicates an ambiguous sexualized message. A
                woman author can present herself to the public in one of several roles: a daughter
                helping the family (Emma Lyon, <title level="m">Miscellaneous Poems</title> 1812), a
                mother supporting her children (Charlotte Smith, <title level="m">Elegiac
                    Sonnets</title> 1784), a married woman not writing for money but for the public
                benefit (Anna Barbauld 1790s), a genteel woman writing as a “lady” rather than
                someone needing money (Jane Austen). Although an unmarried woman who cannot claim
                financial necessity can claim the status of a Lady, like Jane Austen, Rosa
                Matilda/Charlotte Dacre is not claiming the Lady status and if she is writing for
                money, the absence of a protecting father or husband or brother suggests sexual
                availability. “John Penn” is a patron figure, but he is also a category of man who
                is neither husband nor family member, hence <title level="m">The British
                    Critic</title>’s reading the book as sexual advertising. Another way to look at
                Charlotte’s self-fashioning is that it was performing a kind of sexual freedom
                without hypocrisy, a way to break down the double standard that allowed men wide
                parameters for pursuing their desires, but prohibited women from doing something
                similar. </p>
            <p> Her younger sister Sophia, who was married by the time she published her second
                volume of poetry in 1804, establishes a literary lineage like that of her older
                sister. In the prefatory section of <title level="m">Poems, Legendary, Pathetic and
                Descriptive</title>, she calls attention to her pseudonym Sappho in the
                newspapers&#8212;thus calling to mind both the Greek poet and Mary Robinson, famous for
                her sonnet series in <title level="m">Sappho and Phaon</title> (1796), an inspiring
                role model for Charlotte (Cross 190–218)&#8212;and aligns her work with Matthew Lewis’s as
                well. She describes her poetry thus:
                <quote>
                Much of this poetry is in the legendary stile. Tales of wonder, and of spectres, have
                been much in vogue since the poems of Mr. Lewis; and it is hoped therefore that now
                to offer such to the public, will not be conceived a dereliction from good taste:
                the fairy world of ghosts, and of magic, offer, without doubt, sublime images in
                poetry. Amid the horrible, and the extraordinary, the fantastic imagination roves
                unshackled, free from the more rigid discipline of reason; and perhaps the
                exuberances of the wildest fancy, may often interest and chain the attention, when
                the cold, and puerile love-sonnets, and invocations which have deluged the public,
                may fail of exciting the least notice. (Fortnum)
                </quote>
                Lewis’s <title level="m">Tales of Wonder</title> (1801), a collection of Gothic verse,
                and a similar volume, <title level="m">Tales of Terror</title> (1801, 1808), have
                gotten far less attention than canonical texts like <title level="m">Lyrical
                Ballads</title> (1798, 1800) because Lewis’s volumes were <emph>exclusively</emph>
                Gothic. While there are points of contact between Sophia’s
                “fantastic imagination” and Wordsworth/Coleridge’s natural supernaturalism, her
                preference for unrestrained wildness undisciplined by reason has little purchase on
                the classical tradition, from which her kind of Romanticism is an uncompromising
                departure. Sophia is using Lewis to authorize a literature repudiating a certain
                masculine lyricism&#8212;the “cold” and “puerile” sonnets. “Cold”
                suggests lack of passion, and “puerile” suggests immature
                sexuality. Sophia’s manifesto-like preface uses an emancipatory rhetoric of being
                liberated from the shackles of “reason” and being able to freely explore the
                imagination. The Gothic and sentimental literature she celebrates share the virtue
                of representing areas of experience ordinarily neglected by the neoclassical
                sensibility shaped by an Oxbridge education. </p>
            <p> Sophia wrote another manifesto-like preface in 1801, this time introducing&#8212;as Sophia
                King, with no attempt to conceal her Jewish identity&#8212;a piece of Gothic fiction,
                <title level="m">The Fatal Secret</title> (1801). In this seven-page statement she
                complains to the public about her undeserved poverty and neglect as a prolific
                writer of now four novels of meritorious quality; she contrasts her own neglect with
                the success of William Godwin and Matthew Lewis, who make use of the Gothic
                conventions associated with Ann Radcliffe and women’s magic; she points to the
                hypocrisy of decrying the Gothic fiction as unrespectable and morally transgressive,
                while at the same time it provides two male authors&#8212;Godwin and Lewis&#8212;an avenue to
                fame and fortune. She had visited Godwin, one of her father’s friends, several
                times, usually with her sister, and her mocking tone in discussing him displays her
                fearless attitude in confronting what she considers a double standard, especially as
                Godwin’s <title level="m">St. Leon</title> (1799) was somewhat influenced by Sophia’s
                own novel, <title level="m">Waldorf</title> (1798). The character Berenza in
                Charlotte’s <title level="m">Zofloya</title> seems to be a satirical attack on Godwin
                or Godwinism.</p>
            <p>She begins the preface comparing herself to Job: “‘May mine enemy write a book,’
                exclaimed Job” (<title level="m">Fatal Secret</title> i). She is referencing the
                section where the tragic biblical hero argues that if he has sinned, then he invites
                the appropriate punishment, but he is not aware of having committed any
                transgressions. “Oh that one would hear me! Behold, my desire <emph>is,
                    that</emph> the Almighty would answer me, and <emph>that</emph> mine
                adversary had written a book” (<title level="m">King James Bible</title>, Job 31.35).
                Sophia is comparing her own suffering from literary neglect&#8212;poverty, ill treatment
                by booksellers and reviewers, isolation, wandering, and the threat of prison&#8212;to one
                of the most well-known victims in the Hebrew Bible. The two sisters in their Gothic
                writing make few Christian references, except ones that are unavoidable in Gothic
                writing. She figures the writer as “prowling in melancholy solitude” wandering like
                Cain, with a hateful “mark” that “entails misery” (ii). She compares reviewers to
                “little animals” who survive by eating remnants in the teeth of crocodiles.
                Contemptuous of the literary world that has victimized her, and confident of her own
                worth, feeling she deserves “the civic crown of glory”, this self-assured
                nineteen-year-old defends the Gothic genre&#8212;coming from the “glorious Radcliffe”
                (iv)&#8212;while at the same time exposing the hypocrisy of a culture that loves to read
                Gothic, which it also abjects as feminine, immoral, and sub-literary. Although men
                of privilege like Godwin and Lewis can shock public opinion with apparent immunity
                and achieve “the acme of fame,” a teenaged woman writer is subject to the double
                standard.</p>
            <p>Although sister Sophia does not appear in Byron’s writing by name, I assume he read
                her work because of her connection with her sister and from his relationship with
                her father, from whom he borrowed money. The King sisters are unacknowledged
                influences on an important aspect of Byron’s work, the so-called Byronic hero.
                Sophia’s 1805 <title level="m">Victor Allen</title>, for example, presents the reader
                with an anti-hero protagonist, the kind of character that became the norm for
                Byron’s equivocal heroes in the Eastern Tales (1813–16), <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (1816–17), and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1819–24). Sophia’s
                Victor Allen, through whom the novel is focalized, is a bastard and a murderer, but
                he also provokes the reader’s sympathy as a victim, by being rejected unjustly by
                his father, long before he had committed any anti-social deeds, and pursued
                relentlessly by false reports that ruin his reputation, in a way to remind the
                reader of Godwin’s tragic hero, Caleb Williams, who is tormented by the aristocratic
                Falkland and his agent Gines (<title level="m">Caleb Williams</title> [1794]). The
                dark-skinned Victor is both Satanic and a victim of prejudice, a pursuer of revenge,
                a sexual adventurer, and a thief, but he is also mocked and humiliated as
                illegitimate, and excluded from any supportive family. He refuses to accept the
                judgment of a society that hates him, much like Frankenstein’s monster. The trope of
                the isolated Satanic hero which Byron employed recurrently appears not just in
                <title level="m">Victor Allen</title>, but explicitly in <title level="m">The Fatal
                Secret</title>, where the Satanic figure is a woman, the married female protagonist
                who has adulterous desire for someone who turns out to be Satan after she has killed
                her sister and tried to kill her husband. Charlotte used this Satanic trope in her
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title>, where the protagonist Victoria murders her
                husband and her rival for the man she desires, only to find out that her accomplice
                and newest object of desire, Zofloya, a dark-skinned Moor, is actually Satan, who
                destroys her at the novel’s end. Anti-heroes who challenge the reader’s sympathies
                are common in Roth’s work, as well as Isaac B. Singer’s (1902–91), and in the work
                of Mendele Moykher Sforim&#8212;Mendele the Bookpeddler, whose birth name was Sholem
                Yankev Abramovitsh (1835–1917).</p>
            <p>Unlike the cases of Roth, Mendele, or Singer, the question of the King sisters’
                Jewishness is not simple because even though both were Sephardic Jews, in their
                writing the sisters only rarely reference things directly Jewish and in their lives
                they married non-Jews, possibly (but not necessarily) converting to the Church of
                England (on the English Sephardim, see Hyamson). Sophia married Charles Fortnum in
                1802 when she was about twenty, needing father John King to grant permission because
                she was a minor, and with sister Charlotte serving as witness. Charlotte married a
                Christian, Nicholas Byrne, in 1815 when she was about thirty-five, having already
                had three children with him out of wedlock. Both sisters could have followed their
                father’s example of marrying a non-Jew without converting (it was difficult but not
                impossible at the time). John divorced his Jewish wife Sara in 1784, and married the
                Irish aristocrat Jane Butler, countess of Lanesborough (1737–1828) in 1790. When
                Charlotte had her three children baptized in 1811, she herself did not get baptized,
                an omission that indicates a reluctance to leave Judaism. A strong sign of their
                Jewishness is that Christianity in their literature almost never has any spiritual
                significance, even in Charlotte’s first novel, <title level="m">Confessions of the
                Nun of St. Omer</title> (1805). After her father’s death in 1823 Charlotte and her
                mother contributed to the Sephardic synagogue Bevis Marks to honor John King’s
                memory, thus indicating her connection with the Jewish community, especially as
                her contribution of fifty pounds is signed Rachel Charlotte Rey, her birth name
                (Scrivener, <title level="m">Jewish Representation</title> 137–58). In sister Sophia’s
                fourth publication, <title level="m">Victim of Friendship</title> (1801), she includes
                a warm dedication to her father, whom she acknowledges as the only patron who has
                ever helped her in a substantial way. She explicitly defends John King from his
                “enemies,” thus publicly aligning herself with an embattled and scandal-ridden
                Jewish father, arguably the most well-known Jew in England. Charlotte, despite
                several pseudonyms, was well known as a Jewish woman, especially after Lord Byron
                outed her in his <title level="m">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title> (1809),
                as “lovely little Jessica” (Byron <title level="m">Works</title> 1: 413). Jews at the
                time, as now, had a wide range of positions on their Jewish identity, and
                intermarrying is at one end of the spectrum. The writing of the King sisters should
                be considered Anglo-Jewish, regardless of the paucity of explicit Jewish references
                in the writing itself. A rare instance of a Jewish reference occurs in
                <title level="m">Victor Allen</title> (1805) where the anti-hero protagonist figures
                himself not just as Satan but, after he has exacted revenge on his enemies, as the
                biblical Samson, having just pulled down the pillars on the Philistines (Fortnum II:
                152). </p>
            <p>The King sisters are not the only Jewish writers who express Jewishness in oblique
                ways. A modern parallel would be Franz Kafka (1883–1924), one of the most important
                Jewish writers according to Ruth Wisse in her great book on the modern Jewish canon
                (20; 66–86). In Wisse’s admirable book there is, however, little on the Gothic and
                the uncanny, but the King sisters’ work in the Gothic genre is in the Jewish
                mainstream. So many Jewish authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries write
                about the uncanny, demons, golems, dybbuks, angels, magic, and Satan: I. L. Peretz
                (1852–1915), S. Ansky (S. Z. Rappoport 1863–1920), Tony Kushner (<title level="m">Angels
                in America</title> 1991, <title level="m">The Dybbuk</title> 1997), Michael
                Chabon (<title level="m">Kavalier and Clay</title> 2000), Isaac Singer (1904–1991),
                and even the secularist Abraham Cahan (1860–1951), whose <title level="m">David
                Levinsky</title> (1917) refers frequently to the temptations of Satan. Freud’s
                great essay on the uncanny (1919) rests on a Jewish tradition of such literature and
                folklore, even though it focuses explicitly on E. T. A. Hoffmann’s tale <title level="a">The
                Sandman</title> (1816). The Gothic permits exploration of psychological depths that usually
                elude the realist tradition. The Gothic is not escapist but designed to articulate
                truths that realism cannot express. The uncanny, according to Freud, is “something
                which ought to have remained hidden but has come to light” as the return of the
                dead, a haunting, a breach in the wall between imagination and reality (142–45).
                Moreover, the uncanny and its Gothic expression illustrate the return of the
                repressed at not just the individual psychological level but also the cultural and
                political levels (Grumberg 1–33).</p>
            <p>There are ways that the King sisters express Jewish themes in their novels and
                poetry, without naming the Jewishness as such. The main trauma for Sephardim was
                their expulsion from Iberia and their constrained lives within Iberia as secret Jews
                who could be exposed and punished at any time by the Inquisition and the political
                authorities. The Inquisition figures in many of the King sisters’ writing, including
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title>. By now there is a large body of writing based on
                years of research on transgenerational trauma experienced by Jews and other victims
                of violence and persecution (Schwab 2010). One should take for granted that the
                sisters absorbed the Iberian trauma while they were growing up. In <title level="m">Zofloya</title>,
                for example, the action of the novel starts in the late fifteenth
                century&#8212;when Iberia’s Jews were expelled&#8212;in Venice, Italy&#8212;where many Sephardim
                escaped to. Venice of course is where the most despised Jew in English literature,
                Shylock, resided. Within the first few pages we learn that the aristocratic rule of
                Venice entails strict authoritarianism, including secret trials, torture, and public
                executions of people suspected of subversive opinion (ch. 1). The Loredani family
                experiences a chain of disasters from outside their community, namely from a German
                Baron who seduces the mother and breaks up the family. (The name Loredani suggests
                Charlotte’s mother’s family, the Laras, as well as Radcliffe’s wicked Signora di
                Laurentini of <title level="m">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> [1794]). Count Ardolf
                acquired his “depravity” in England and France (ch. 2). Long before the reader meets
                a real “demon” in the person of Zofloya, Ardolf is called one (ch. 2), showing the
                reader that the supernatural is an intensification of human qualities, not something
                utterly remote. The adulterous mother Laurina is called an “apostate,” a word
                ordinarily used in a religious context (ch. 4). The unquestionable Gothic villain is
                Ardolf, but Laurina’s moral status is ambiguous, as she is arguably a victim, both
                conflicted and complicitous. Her outward compliance but inner resistance reflect the
                tragic experience of Iberia’s hidden Jews, appearing in public one way, living as
                Jews secretively. Victoria plays the Gothic heroine role in unusual ways, as she is
                a rebellious daughter, independent minded, capable of escaping her Gothic
                imprisonment (as Jews escaped Iberia), and she initiates a sexual affair with an
                older man who thinks he has seduced her, and this man Berenza&#8212;some twenty years her
                senior to the teenager Victoria&#8212;is ultimately killed by Victoria when she tires of
                him and prefers someone else. Victoria is powerful, quite a reversal of the
                Sephardic (woman’s) historical experience, but compelling as wish-fulfillment. </p>
            <p>The other Jewish references are considerable. The slippage between Moor and Jew in
                this context is fairly obvious, as both are “defeated” people hunted down by
                Catholic Iberia. Zofloya’s expertise, passed down from ancestors, in herbs, drugs,
                chemistry and medicine (ch. 18) evokes Jewish stereotypes about magic and sorcery
                (stereotypes Walter Scott will connect with Rebecca in <title level="m">Ivanhoe</title>
                [1819]). Blackness aligned with Jewishness is dramatically
                illustrated with Victoria hating the blonde Lilla, whom Victoria kills with a knife
                with erotic zeal (ch. 29). The relationship between the Moor Zofloya and Victoria is
                complex, especially as he enters her consciousness first in the form of a dream, and
                he later serves as her therapist/analyst/confidant as much as her servant. He seems
                to be a creation of Victoria’s deepest desires rather than some external demon who
                has invaded her life. Much of the novel’s action is in Venice, scene of the most
                famous Jewish representation in English literature. Charlotte herself is a
                “Jessica,” the Jew’s daughter. Victoria’s rage at Berenza for thinking she was not
                good enough to marry because of her adulterous mother (ch. 16) is homologous with
                Jewish anger at anti-Semitic snobbery. The dichotomy of dark Victoria and light
                Lilla represents an ethnic competition on the level of sexual beauty, which is drawn
                to the reader’s attention with the striking image in the title page of a dark-haired
                “Rosa Matilda” who resembles Victoria, but not in any way Lilla. </p>
            <p>The novel intriguingly does not correspond to what Anne Mellor calls a female
                Romanticism accenting women’s self-control and rational restraint to assume
                leadership in guiding the nation toward nonviolent reform (1993, 2000). Although
                <title level="m">Zofloya</title> and Charlotte King’s other novels follow in some
                respects what Mellor calls a masculine Romanticism of unrestrained individualistic
                rebellion linked with an emancipation of the imagination, Charlotte’s fiction does
                not follow the didactic model of Wollstonecraft. As Kim Ian Michasiw points out,
                Charlotte’s writing assumes the stance of neither the “proper lady” nor “didactic
                maternalism,” two major options women writers take in the Romantic era
                (vii-xxx).</p>
            <p>To conclude, I would like to refer back to the paternal grandfather of Charlotte and
                Sophia King, Moses Rey (d. 1764), dressed up like a Turkish “Sultan” and supplied
                coffee-house patrons “from Cornhill to Charing-cross” with “cane-strings, c--d--ms,
                sealing wax, and bawdy books.” As a boy John King doubled the profits of his North
                African-born father by selling candy made by his mother (<title level="m">Authentic
                Memoirs</title> 27–28). I am using this vignette to connect the commercial

                The grandfather’s role-playing to please an audience eager for sweets and sex is not
                unlike what his literary granddaughters did as writers, who from a Sephardic subject
                position fashioned Gothic fiction and lyrical poetry for readers eager for
                sensational literature dealing with sex, violence, magic, the uncanny, and extreme
                emotions. </p>
