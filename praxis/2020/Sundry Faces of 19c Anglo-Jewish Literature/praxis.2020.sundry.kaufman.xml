                    first Anglo-Jewish novelist’s engagement with 1790s debates about romance and
                    realism. In her novel, Fiction Without Romance (1830), Polack does not simply
                    reject romance, but instead suggests a reworking of the form to facilitate
                    female education. By reading a Jewish writer’s work within the context of
                    English, non-Jewish literary contexts, this essay traces the emergence of Jewish
                    literary culture through its investments in literary reform.</p>

            <p>In the Preface to her first and only novel <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance;
                    or, the Locket-Watch</title> (1830) Maria Polack states, “many of the incidents
                alluded to in the tale, may be thought out of date, as it is now some time since it
                was written, having been prevented by illness from publishing it when I first
                intended” (Polack 1: 11).<note place="foot" resp="author"> <title level="m">Fiction
                    Without Romance</title> was published just once in
                    1830 by Effingham Wilson. Quotes in this essay taken from this single
                    edition of the novel contain many typographical errors. I have not corrected
                    these errors, nor have I called attention to them in order to let readers
                    encounter the text as it appeared to readers in 1830.</note> Her
                submissive disclaimer hints at a number of vagaries, including elapsed time between
                the novel’s composition and publication and an unspecified illness. Polack lived
                from 1786–1849 and resided throughout her life in the East End of London. Her name
                appears on records connected with prominent Jewish institutions, including the Jews
                Free School, the Great Synagogue, and Brady Street Cemetery. James Picciotto notes
                that her father, Ephraim Polack, was John Braham’s music teacher and the grandfather
                of the playwright Elizabeth Polack (Picciotto 232).<note place="foot" resp="author"> John Braham (1774–1856) was a famous London
                        tenor. For excellent discussions of his life and work see David Conway.</note> Synagogue
                records indicate that Maria Polack lost her father in 1812 and a child named after
                her father in 1816. And Cecil Roth claims that <title level="m">Fiction Without
                    Romance</title> is the first novel written by an English Jew (Roth 4).<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> Certainly, there were earlier fiction writers
                    who were born Jewish, such as Benjamin Disraeli and the King sisters. I suspect
                    Roth’s claim is based on the notion that at the point when their work was
                    published, these earlier writers did not outwardly identify as Jews. The King
                    sisters married Christians and had nothing to do with the Jewish community or
                    Synagogue life. Disraeli was baptized as a child and remained Anglican
                    throughout his adult life. Hence, Polack is the first known Anglo-Jewish writer
                    to publish a novel while simultaneously identifying outwardly as Jewish. For a
                    rich and important conversation that challenges Roth’s view see Michael
                    Scrivener, especially chapter 5, and Diane Long Hoeveler.</note> Beyond these
                details, Polack’s life and work remain shrouded in mystery.
                Significantly, while extant records connect Polack with institutions in London’s
                Jewish world, the novel’s subject matter ties her to literary debates among English,
                or non-Jewish writers, of the 1790s. It is from this position, straddling English
                and Jewish worlds, where <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> makes some
                of its most controversial and bold arguments. </p>
            <p>In his foundational work on the rise of Anglo-Jewish women’s literary culture in the
                mid-nineteenth century, Michael Galchinsky notes that most Jewish writers from this
                period engaged in some way with the form of the romance. In the years preceding this
                rise of secular Anglo-Jewish literary culture, “Jewish women were specifically
                targeted by ‘tolerant’ conversionist societies . . . They referred to Jewish women’s
                ‘malleability’ and ‘impressionability’, which was assumed to be part of the charm of
                their ‘oriental’ natures” (35). Writing romances offered mid-century Jewish women
                writers a mechanism for reclaiming earlier representations of Jewishness. Galchinsky
                adds, “By adopting or writing against the [romance] genre . . . Jewish women could
                position themselves along a continuum of Jews as traditionalists or reformers” (36).
                Put differently, Galchinsky suggests that this early Victorian generation of Jewish
                women writers used the genre of romance to comment on debates within the Jewish
                community regarding religious traditionalism and reform. </p>
            <p>I’ve argued elsewhere that <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> emerges
                from this juncture where religious leaders and writers were wrestling with the
                demands of becoming modern.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Heidi Kaufman,
                    <title level="a">England’s Jewish Renaissance: Maria Polack’s <title level="m">Fiction Without
                        Romance</title> (1830) in Context.</title></note> Some wondered how to quell the
                seductions of conversion or to block the rise of religious laxity. Others questioned
                whether Jewish modernity was even possible without significant corruptions of
                religious rituals and Jewish identity. Polack’s novel, I argue, offers a response to
                such concerns signaled by its approach of addressing <emph>both</emph> the
                education of English readers on Jewish subjects <emph>and</emph> the
                education of Jewish readers on English subjects. Working from both directions, the
                novel promotes understanding of and respect for religious pluralism. Only then,
                Polack suggests, will the seductions of assimilation and conversion subside.
                Somewhat paradoxically, however, Polack uses a non-Jewish literary form (the novel)
                to lament the demise of Jewish ways of life. Yet in the process, she argues not for
                reason and rationalism and other Enlightenment subjects to overturn traditional
                religious culture, but for the two systems of belief to work together. Polack’s use
                of the term “rational morality” in her novel echoes language used by her Jewish
                contemporaries who argued that reason and religion were mutually constitutive.
                Michael Scrivener has noted that “Although Britain had no conventional
                Haskalah&#8212;modernizing Enlightenment movement of cultural renewal and reform led by an
                intellectual elite&#8212;which the German states did indeed have, Britain had a
                modernizing Jewry nevertheless, as well as reformist writers who tried to play the
                role of maskil, someone who was critical of traditional beliefs and practices and
                who adapted Jewish culture to modernity” (<title level="a">British-Jewish Writing</title> 159). Previously,
                I situated Polack within this framework, as one who sought ways to adapt Jewish
                culture for the modern world and who advocated for cross-cultural understanding. In
                the pages that follow I extend this argument to address another key context in the
                novel: Polack’s interest in non-Jewish, English concerns about the intersections of
                education, morality, and literary culture. </p>
            <p>It is unclear what might have prompted Polack, an urban writer living in a Jewish
                community, to center her novel on the development of a Christian character in a
                rural Christian community. And what are we to make of Polack’s choice of the title,
                    <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>, in a novel where she draws from
                romance conventions? Approaching these questions from the perspective of English
                literary history not only helps to highlight some of Polack’s influences, but
                situates the first self-identified Anglo-Jewish novelist in controversies that cut
                across religious boundaries. Jewish and Catholic subplots enter the narrative,
                certainly, but the novel’s central emphasis remains focused on the Protestant Eliza
                Desbro and her exemplary education in a rural cottage where she is raised by a
                Protestant family. While Galchinsky may see Polack’s turn to romance as a statement
                about Jewish reform, I suggest that it also advances an argument in favor of English
                literary reform, and, in particular, an argument for recouping romance to produce a
                new kind of literary realism&#8212;what writers of the 1790s described as
                <emph>life as it is</emph>.</p>
            <p><title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> tells the story of an infant orphan,
                Eliza Desbro, rescued by her uncle, Edward Frederick Desbro, and brought to a rural
                cottage in Devonshire to be raised and educated by the Reverend George Howard, his
                wife Jane, and his recently widowed sister, Mrs. Wallace, who serves as Eliza’s
                preceptress. Howard, Desbro, and Mrs. Wallace contribute to Eliza’s education,
                discussing educational models and evoking debates from the 1790s about how best to
                teach morality to the young. The novel follows Eliza’s growth from an infant to her
                early adulthood when she marries and establishes a home of her own. Eliza’s
                curriculum is comprised of languages (French and Italian), sacred and religious
                history, music, and geography. The subjects of her studies and exposure to members
                of her rural community help Eliza to cultivate a “rational morality” emphasizing
                charity toward others and a strong moral conviction. Outside of her formal schooling
                Eliza meets a range of people including the Zachariahs, a Jewish family she
                befriends, cottagers struggling to make a living, and wealthy people living in
                self-indulgent, destructive circumstances. Thus, her exposure to a diverse range of
                people, even those lacking respectability, play a central part in Eliza’s education.
                The narrator explains that Mr. Howard’s pedagogy was deliberate:
                <quote>
                First, the basis upon which Eliza’s education was founded, was too solid to be easily
                shaken. Secondly, he wished her to see something <emph>of mankind
                as they are</emph>, for in her uncle, Mrs. Wallace, and (he might
                have added himself,) <emph>she only saw them as
                they ought to be</emph>[.] Third, and lastly, he wished
                her to become acquainted with different characters, in order that she might have
                more scope for forming her opinions, and thus be enabled to judge for herself. (1:
                122; emphasis added)
                </quote>
                The reference in this passage to the distinction between seeing humans “as they are”
                as opposed to ideals, or “as they ought to be,” draws out the novel’s tension
                between the ideal and the real. The best form of education, Polack argues, is that
                which enables young people to judge complex situations for themselves under both
                good and bad circumstances. To develop such consistency and conviction, pupils must
                be exposed to people and circumstances beyond their own social horizons. Yet, they
                also must learn to respect people as they are. In one early section of the
                chapter-less first Volume Mr. Zachariah explains,
                <quote>
                our business is not to fiddle, dance, or game, but it is to be of utility to each
                other; and whether a man be born a prince, or a peasant, he is equally respectable,
                while he acts consistently in that particular sphere of life in which he is placed.

                Here Zachariah promotes a cultural sphere so respectful of religious diversity as to
                make assimilation unnecessary. People are most worthy of respect, he suggests, when
                they are true to their identities, or when they resist the temptation to swerve from
                their distinctiveness. Noteworthy in this passage is Polack’s repeated use of the
                expression “as they are” which resonates directly with literary debates about
                romance’s proclivity for idealism versus fiction’s tendency toward representing life
                as it is&#8212;debates hinted at, as we shall see, in Polack’s choice of title,

            <p> While the novel seems mostly focused on Eliza Desbro’s education, at the center of
                the narrative is a mystery about her deceased parents and her uncle’s hidden past.
                Half-way through the two-volume novel, Eliza receives a written document explaining
                her family history, the effects of which shape the plot of the second volume. In
                that document, Eliza learns that her father, Charles Courtney, engaged in bigamy
                when he married her mother, Eliza Courtney. Upon learning about her would-be
                husband’s wife and child, Eliza Courtney becomes ill and perishes. In a fit of
                murderous rage and in defense of his sister’s honor, Edward Desbro stabs Charles
                Courtney. Believing him dead, Desbro whisks the infant Eliza to rural Devonshire to
                be raised by kinder people. Unbeknownst to all, Charles Courtney survives the
                attack, and lives out his life as a destructive profligate. Multiple plot twists
                later, the teenage Eliza meets Henry Cooper, who changed his surname to avoid
                association with his infamous father, Charles Courtney. Soon after their discovery
                that they are half-siblings, Eliza and Henry meet their dying father who, deeply
                repentant, leaves them his fortune. Along the way, Eliza befriends the Jewish
                Rebecca Zachariah, and learns of Rebecca’s sister, Sarah, who made an unfortunate
                marriage with a non-Jew that leads to her illness and death. Finally, readers learn
                about a Mrs. St. Clair, a Protestant woman whose marriage to a Catholic man results
                in disaster. The pattern of bad marriages suggests that men and women of all
                religions are susceptible to errors in judgement, and that young people need
                guidance navigating their culture’s courtship rituals. The temptation to marry out
                of one’s faith, however, is not exclusively a Jewish problem, nor is it solely a
                response to efforts in this period to convert Jews to Christianity; according to
                <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> the pressure to convert or assimilate
                is a wider, more universal problem that seduces the young, overly influenced by the
                hollow promise of romance, toward deadly missteps.<note place="foot" resp="author"> For

            <p>Polack’s motif of a child raised in rural seclusion is a direct response to earlier
                works&#8212;most famously, perhaps, is Rousseau’s <title level="m">Emile; or On
                Education</title> (1762) made
                even more (in)famous by Mary Wollstonecraft’s critique of that work in
                <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (1792). In his
                educational novel, Rousseau charts a male child’s development into a rational being.
                Wollstonecraft expands and critiques Rousseau’s vision in her articulation of female
                education:
                <quote>
                The most perfect education, in my opinion, is such an exercise of the understanding
                as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words,
                to enable the individual to attain such habits of virtue as will render it
                independent. In fact, it is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not
                result from the exercise of its own reason. This was Rousseau’s opinion respecting
                men: I extend it to women. (52)
                </quote>
                The subjects of female education and reason tie Polack to these earlier debates of the
                1790s by Wollstonecraft and others. Polack’s choice to name the heroine’s mother
                Eliza Courtney would have recalled Mary Hays’s sensational <title level="m">Memoirs
                of Emma Courtney</title> (1795) whose provocative semi-autobiographical subject
                matter&#8212;meant to be a cautionary warning&#8212;nevertheless ruined the author’s
                    reputation.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In her

                            enslaved in passion, liable to the mistakes and weaknesses of our
                            fragile nature. &#8212;Let those readers, who feel inclined to judge with

                from its opening pages Hays insisted that her novel be assessed within the new
                tradition of the Jacobin novel or the “fiction of reform” which developed after
                1789, and which was epitomized by Godwin’s <title level="m">Things as They Are; or, The
                Adventures of Caleb Williams</title>: novels which are predicated on the philosophical
                insistence on the shaping power of circumstances and the tracing of the development
                of the mind and character. (18)
                </quote>
                In these texts we see the foundations of Polack’s interest in linking narratives
                about people “as they are”&#8212;which Zachariah echoed in his promotion of self-respect
                for religious identity&#8212;with questions of character development and reform. And while
                Jacobin advocates of reform may have had something very different in mind than early
                Anglo-Jewish debates over religious reform, Polack weaves them together in her
                depictions of an English girl’s education. Alan Richardson notes that,
                <quote>
                While nearly all women writers of educational treatises and conduct books asserted
                the need for more substantial education and condemned the emphasis on superficial
                ‘accomplishments’ in girls’ boarding schools, they did so with a variety of
                ideological motivations, ranging from Wollstonecraft’s radical egalitarianism to the
                efforts of reactionaries like More and West to buttress the existing political and
                social order through selective reform. (170)

                While <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> wasn’t published until 1830,
                Polack anchors her model of educational reform in literary debates from the 1790s,
                the period of her own youth.</p>
            <p> To situate Polack’s work within the tradition of Jacobin writers might be heavy
                handed, as it would align her with a range of political views and a revolution of
                ideas far broader than <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> explicitly
                indicates. However, 1790s debates about reform clearly resonated with Polack’s
                interest in secular literary culture’s power to address questions of Jewish
                modernity and religious reform. Indeed, it’s difficult to ignore the appearance of
                Jacobin book titles and phrases in <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>,
                such as <title level="m">Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb
                Williams</title>; her references to “Miss Edgeworth’s moral and entertaining
                english [sic] tales,’ or the more beautiful french [sic] ones of ‘Marmontel” (Polack
                1: 96); and her naming of characters that evoke progressive writers from the period
                (Mary Hays’s <title level="m">Emma Courtney</title>, for example) as well as
                anti-Jacobin writers, such as Eliza’s conservative preceptress, Mrs. Howard, who
                evokes Elizabeth Hamilton, author of the more conservative <title level="m">Letters
                on Education</title> (1801). Polack’s Prefatory admission that her novel might be
                thought out of date at the moment of publication&#8212;1830&#8212;makes more sense when
                contextualized by the novel’s interest in debates from the 1790s. How Polack stages
                these debates by including Jewish characters, combined with her method of
                appropriating features of romance, situate her novel within a number of key intersecting
                contexts. As I suggest below,
                her choice of title&#8212;<title level="m">Fiction <hi rend="bold">Without</hi>
                Romance</title>&#8212;in a novel that advocates for “rational morality”
                wants readers to believe reason and romance are separable aesthetic fields. Read
                through the lens of the novel, however, the title seems like a tactical choice aimed
                at questioning romance’s ambit and realism’s rising significance. <title level="m">Fiction
                Without Romance</title>, therefore, signals some of the ways Anglo-Jewish
                writers adapted and contributed to non-Jewish, English literary debates.</p>
            <p> In <title level="m">The English Jacobin Novel</title>, Gary Kelly notes that while
                novels included in the category “Jacobin Novel” engaged with a wide array of views
                and political objectives, what they all had in common was the notion “that reason
                should decide the issue in human affairs and human government, not power based on
                money, age, rank, sex, or physical strength” (8). Jacobin texts sought a more
                democratic society based on equality and respect. As Polack integrates such concerns
                about charity&#8212;particularly for cottagers, members of the working classes, and
                women&#8212;over brutish, selfish assertions of power, she nevertheless remains focused on
                a discourse of reason and rationalism, even in salacious sections of the text
                concerning the “mystery attached to the birth of Eliza” (1: 179). The sympathetic
                Desbro, Eliza’s uncle and teacher, stands as a model for how equality can be both
                exercised individually and taught to the young, thereby insuring its persistence in
                the future. Desbro becomes the spokesperson for female education and rational
                morality. He is described as one who would not marry a woman “unless I truly loved
                her” (1: 42), as he explains:
                <quote>
                Personal admiration alone is not sufficient to ensure a life of happiness, or even
                comfort. While I admire the person, I must be able, also to admire the mind. Perhaps
                I may be rather singular in my opinions on female education, but I am not so foolish
                as to be frightened at what the <emph>vulgar</emph> term “a learned
                woman.” Be assured, Sir, the female mind is equally strong and capacious with our
                own; and when a woman is ignorant, it is the fault of man that she is so. It is a
                sort of vanity, or conscious superiority in our sex, that disdain to acknowledge an
                equal in the other. . . .  And I firmly believe, that the frivolity, so often depreciated
                in women, would cease to exist, if they were properly encouraged in the pursuit of
                more rational amusements. (1: 42)
                </quote>
                Here Polack likely refers to Bathsua Pell Makin’s expression “a learned woman” in her
                work, <title level="m">An Essay to Revise the Antient Education of Gentlewoman, in
                    Religion, Manners, Arts and Tongues</title> (1673). Desbro, a refined and
                thoughtful male character, becomes the defender of a “learned woman” and an
                educational philosophy aimed at “rational amusements” promoted in a previous era&#8212;the
                very kind of arguments that surfaced more than a hundred years later in the 1790s.
                In her <title level="m">Essay</title> Makin argues,
                <quote>
                <emph>To all Ingenious and Vertuous Ladies ...</emph><lb/>
                Custom, when it
                is inveterate, hath a mighty influence: it hath the force of Nature itself. The
                Barbarous custom to breed Women low, is grown general amongst us, and hath prevailed
                so far, that it is verily believed . . . that Women are not endued with such Reason,
                as Men; nor capable of improvement by Education, as they are. It is lookt upon as a
                monstrous thing; to pretend the contrary. A Learned Woman is thought to be a Comet,
                that bodes Mischief, when ever it appears. To offer to the World the liberal
                Education of Women is to deface the Image of God in Man, it will make Women so high,
                and men so low, like Fire in the House-top, it will set the whole world in a Flame.

                In both the 1670s and 1790s the question of female education turned on the subject of
                women’s capacity for reason and rationalism. Whereas Rousseau would argue in
                <title level="m">Emile</title> that women should be educated to serve men, and not to
                develop their own capacity for independent thought and self-possession, Polack would
                respond&#8212;armed with allusions to women writers of the 1790s&#8212; in her novel’s Preface
                where she states, “I have endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep within the
                limits of simplicity, for, were I to soar above the mediocrity of power, my
                ignorance would soon be detected and despised . . . I have, therefore, confined
                myself to that rational morality which many, I hope, will admire, and which all can
                comprehend” (1: i–ii). Here Polack hints at her confidence in her readership, and
                her assumption that “rational morality” is something <emph>all</emph>&#8212;and
                not just men&#8212;can comprehend.</p>
            <p> We may wonder why a religiously traditional writer and the first Anglo-Jewish
                novelist would root the plot of her 1830 novel in debates from the 1790s among
                non-Jews. Born in 1786, Polack likely came of age as a reader in the years
                immediately following these debates. While she would have followed strict religious
                observances as a member of The Great Synagogue, she would not have read Jewish
                secular fiction, as none had yet been written. Hence, her reading habits and
                intellectual interests would have been shaped by books to which she had access,
                books written by non-Jews that rebuked popular gothic romances, promoting in their
                place texts advocating women’s capacity for reason. Polack’s knowledge of the very
                romance her title seems to reject and Jacobin writing from the 1790s is suggestive
                of her access to a broad range of literature. Indeed, her novel’s litany of references to novels,
                political treatises, plays, poetry, and religious history indicate that she was a
                learned woman in her own right.</p>
            <p> While Kelly notes the persistence of debates in Jacobin fiction about the abuses of
                power, Polack’s engagement with rationalism pushes these debates into new territory.
                On the one hand, she includes passages that stridently promote women’s causes from
                across the social landscape; for Courtney abuses middle class women like Eliza’s
                mother as well as the working poor, such as the young maid Susan. Both women perish,
                suggesting that male abuse is a universal problem unaffected by social barriers. It
                is here, in depictions of emotional and physical abuse, where Polack weaves together
                educational philosophy and the mystery of Eliza’s father’s identity. While I agree
                with Galchinsky’s claim that Jewish women’s resistance to romance is tied to
                conversionist efforts of the period, I want to suggest that Polack is up to
                something else in <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author"> According to Galchinsky, “All of the earliest Anglo-Jewish
                    women writers felt that they had to respond to the romance genre” (36).</note>
                Certainly gothic features frequently associated with romance are absent from the
                novel; but the novel’s emphasis on mystery and intrigue, murder, un-restrained
                passions, and women’s sexual vulnerability in the face of seducers and philanderers
                tie the novel to the tradition of eighteenth-century romance writing. As I suggest
                in the following analysis, Polack seems far less interested in rejecting the
                tradition of romance, than she does in reforming it. In effect, her novel moves
                romance away from the preserve of entertainment and toward a foundation for rational
                education. Thus, when she refers to fiction <emph>without</emph> romance,
                Polack signals both an approval of fiction (as it was defined by her contemporaries)
                and a concern for the potentially threatening effects of romance novels (as they
                were written) on young, female audiences. She therefore bends the tradition of
                romance to serve her higher goals of promoting female reason and morality.</p>
            <p>The romance obviously has a long history, changing over time to accommodate shifting
                audiences and tastes as well as cultural functions of fiction. Toni Wein has noted
                of this history that “the aesthetic conflicts provoked by the romance revivalists
                [in the late eighteenth century] speak to a growing awareness of literature’s
                fitness for ideological service [. . . while] arguments on its behalf testify to the
                increasing importance of reading as a mode of entertainment” (40). She adds that one
                of the dominant features of romance in this period was the “topos of discovered
                origins” and of creating fictions that “reinstill[ed] the desire for social
                hierarchy” (40). On one level, <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>
                emphasizes a more democratic and pluralistic image of English society, one inclusive
                of immigrants, Jewish people, Catholics, and those living in poverty, and thus
                speaks to some of the ideological conventions Wein details. The novel’s interest in
                charity simultaneously imagines beneficent communal leaders who model forms of
                kindness and respect for the poor while using their higher social positions to
                benefit others. Discussions among characters about how to educate children or why
                learned women shouldn’t be perceived as a threat advance the novel’s political and
                literary concerns. Nevertheless, the mystery of Eliza’s past and the revelation of
                her rakish father and murderous uncle aestheticize mystery, drawing readers into a
                hidden plot of damsels in distress, sexual predators, and acts of intrigue performed
                by characters of ill-repute. Indeed, the novel’s emotional draw emerges through the
                slow unfolding of family secrets and the salacious revelation that, had such details
                <emph>not</emph> been revealed, Eliza may have accidentally married
                her half-brother. For these reasons, romance is not just present as a sub-plot in
                the novel; it’s the aesthetic force driving discussions about slow courtship rituals,
                the advocacy of parental authority in questions of marriage selection, and the
                importance of marrying into one’s faith group. In other words, Polack is not
                rejecting romance: she’s using it to further her vision of a rational educational
                agenda. </p>
            <p>When Desbro arrives at the Howard home without explanation and with an infant in his
                arms, the narrator notes, “There was much mystery in the affair, and mystery is
                seldom the companion of virtue” (1: 14). Subsequent references to his unknown past
                repeat the word “mystery” as if to build wonder and suspense with each new mention.
                In a later passage even the level-headed Howard notes, “there was a mystery attached
                to the birth of Eliza, some parts of which were still wrapt in obscurity, in fact,
                they might never be elucidated” (1: 179). Withholding information to keep readers in
                suspense was a well-known trait of the romance. As Eliza’s Jewish friend, Rebecca
                Zachariah, explains when Eliza impatiently asks too many questions, “You would make
                a terrible heroine of romance . . . you want to know all the mystery at once” (2:
                34). The mysteries of Desbro are disclosed in the final pages of the first volume.
                His history, which has been transcribed and saved by Howard, recounts Desbro’s
                moment of pure passion and unreason upon hearing Courtney confess without remorse,
                “It has ever been my fate, to love variety, and as your sister was not really my
                wife, [because he was already married] I was not compelled to sacrifice my
                inclination longer than I pleased” (1: 241). Desbro details his reaction to his
                would-be brother-in-law’s arrogant disregard for his sister Eliza’s well-being:
                <quote>
                The cool, taunting, and insulting tone in which all this was uttered, irritated me
                more than the coarsest invectives could have done, I felt chokeing,&#8212;my eyes rolled
                with all the wildness of passion, unfortunately, a knife lay on a table near which I
                stood,&#8212;I seized it, and in a moment of phrenzy, plunged it into his bosom to the
                very haft[.] The noise he made in falling, roused me in some measure to the
                recollection of what I had done, and its probable consequences, I left the house,
                regardless of my own safety, but my niece! the orphan so awfully bequeathed to me!
                the thought of her, brought me to a full sense of my situation. . . . I ran without
                stopping, till I arrived at the house of Mrs. Ellis [Eliza’s caretaker]. . . . I
                laid down, and soon found myself incapable of rising, the agitation of my mind, had
                brought on a fever, I lay for a fortnight hardly conscious of my own existence; and
                when I recovered, it was some time before I was in a state fit to travel. . . . (1:

                The novel’s careful withholding and eventual disclosure of the
                attempted murder sub-plot recall tropes of romance novels, including bigamy and
                murder. Desbro’s wildness of passion in response to Courtney’s bigamy aligns
                Polack’s anti-romance novel with the very qualities it purports to define itself
                against. The reader’s challenge is to find a way to integrate seemingly
                contradictory pressures on romance and rationalism.</p>
            <p>Gillian Beer explains that in the late eighteenth century the romance was thought to
                focus on “ideal possibilities” in contrast to the novel, which focused on “actual
                possibilities” (53). Richardson’s eponymous hero, Pamela, summarizes some of the
                most compelling arguments against romance when she claims:
                <quote>
                There were very few novels and romances that my lady would permit me to read; and
                those I did, gave me no great pleasure; for either they dealt so much in the
                marvelous and improbable, or were so unnaturally inflaming to the passions, and so
                full of love and intrigue, that most of them seemed calculated to fire the
                imagination, rather than to inform the judgement. (qtd. in Beer 14)
                </quote>
                Beer adds that the romance Pamela critiques, “drowns the voice of reason, it offers a
                dangerously misleading guide to everyday life, it rouses false expectations and
                stirs up passions best held in check” (14). The distinction between romance and
                realism was not simply a literary delineation, but was one bound up by questions
                concerning the effects of literary form on unsuspecting readers. The 1780s and 90s
                witnessed a rise of criticism of the kind of romances Pamela critiques. In
                <title level="m">The Progress of Romance</title> (1785) one of Clara Reeve’s
                characters declares, “If read indiscriminately they [romances] are at best
                unprofitable, frequently productive of absurdities in manners and sentiments,
                sometimes hurtful to good morals” (7). Later this same character notes, “A
                Circulating Library is indeed a great evil,&#8212;young people are allowed to subscribe to
                them, and to read indiscriminately all they contain; and thus both food and poison
                are conveyed to the young mind together” (77). In such descriptions, literary
                dangers are tied to education and the choice of reading material. If only parents
                would teach young readers <emph>how</emph> to read and select works of
                literature, these critiques suggest, they could mitigate romance’s dangers.</p>
            <p>Other significant strands of the debates about romance’s dangers focused on
                distinctions of literary form. Isaac D’Israeli among others claimed that “From
                Romances, which had now exhausted the patience of the public, sprung NOVELS,”
                adding, “It is not surprising that romances have been regarded as pernicious to good
                sense, morals, taste, and literature” (D’Israeli 2: 258). Sir Walter Scott responded
                to Dr. Johnson’s definition of romance by claiming, “We would be rather inclined to
                describe a Romance as a ‘a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of
                which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents;’ thus being opposed to the
                kindred term <emph>Novel</emph>, which Johnson has described as ‘a smooth
                tale, generally of love’; but which we would rather define as ‘a fictitious
                narrative, differing from the Romance, because the events are accommodated to the
                ordinary train of human events, and the modern state of society’” (65). In her
                Preface to <title level="m">The Old English Baron</title> (1778), a response to Horace
                Walpole’s <title level="m">The Castle of Otranto</title> (1764), Clara Reeve argued
                that history, fictional or not, “represents human nature as it is in real life,
                alas, too often a melancholy retrospect! Romance displays only the amiable side of
                the picture; it shews the pleasing features, and throws a veil over the blemishes”
                (12). Her emphasis on real life anticipates later literary interests in realism.
                However, at the point when Polack is writing&#8212;the first two decades of the nineteenth
                century&#8212;writers are not thinking about later Victorian debates about realism’s
                limits, but instead are preoccupied with the challenge of representing plausible
                events as a model for instruction. In fact, another Jacobin novel to which Polack
                refers, <title level="m">Things as They Are; or The Adventures of Caleb
                Williams</title> (1794) in which the titular figure engages in a murder in the name
                of justice, much like Desbro’s attempted murder of Charles Courtney, readers are led
                to sympathize with murderous acts committed for just causes that seek an end to
                abuses of power. And while stories of love had the potential to lead young women
                astray, or to mistake the fantasies they read about in romance novels with the
                actual worlds in which they lived, it was also the presence of what Deborah Lutz
                calls “the dangerous lover” who was considered to be a threat to young girls. Lutz
                describes this type of character as “the one whose eroticism lies in his dark past,
                his restless inquietude, his remorseful and rebellious exile from comfortable
                everyday living” (ix). In <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> dangerous
                lovers do manage to hurt several women, and stand in stark opposition to the more
                educated, refined gentleman who turn out to be far better marriage material. Yet,
                characters such as Desbro bridge these categories, and suggest either that what
                looks like romance might in fact be something else&#8212;something more like
                <emph>life as it is</emph>. Alternately, Desbro’s care of his niece Eliza
                and dedication to his sister’s good character spin moments of passion and violence
                as potentially worthy of forgiveness. If romances depicted villains giving way to
                passionate outbursts and violence, Polack’s adaptation of this form is to make their
                violence both justified and redeemable. In her vision of <emph>life as
                it is</emph>, characters grow and change, and therefore stand in sharp contrast to
                romance’s stock and static characters who stand for recognizable villainous
                types.</p>
            <p>I’m suggesting that to read <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>
                exclusively in the context of Anglo-Jewish literary history misses an opportunity to
                understand Polack’s engagement with English writers. Similarly, to read English
                writers of this era outside of the contexts of the rise of Jewish secular culture,
                and that of other marginalized writers, is to miss seeing how literary debates from
                the center were variously interpreted, how they were evoked by writers from the
                margins, such as Polack, who expanded discussions of reason and rationalism as they
                advocated for religious pluralism and reform. Michael Ragussis illuminates other
                related features of these debates. During the very period when writers were carving
                out distinctions between romance and fiction, Protestant English culture became
                focused on what he describes as “the rhetoric of conversion and the figure of the
                Jewish convert” (1). Conversion entailed more than acts of transforming Jews into
                Christians; it was also interested in, Ragussis notes, advancing a form of repentance
                and reconciliation with God in the wake of transgressive acts. Ragussis explains,
                “the conversion of the Other (heathen, infidel, or Jew) is the surest sign of the
                conversion of the self, so that the true convert proves himself by becoming a
                proselytizer” (2). The prominent model of conversion in English fiction was
                therefore one that welcomed Jews (and others) into Christianity. Such logic had the
                advantage of positioning the English as liberal and tolerant of difference, open to
                accepting Jews, as long as they were willing to abandon their Jewish identity.<note

                    British Novel</title>, especially chapters 1 and 3.</note> Polack’s interest
                in promoting respect for religious difference surely grew out of conversion
                pressures in this period that rejected religious pluralism. Polack’s insistence on
                religious consistency, read in light of this context, is not a sign of Jewish
                resistance to change, but serves as a bulwark against the seductions of
                conversionist rhetoric, much of which had been imbibed and propelled by romance
                novels.</p>
            <p>Interactions between Jewish and Christian families in <title level="m">Fiction
                Without Romance</title> are presented as an opportunity to dispel prejudice and to
                help readers see and respect people as they are. Polack’s
                insistence on respect for religious difference and promotion of religious diversity
                invites us to consider how religious instruction converged with literary debates.
                Richard Altick notes that the rise of religious-based criticism against romances
                intensified in the early years of the nineteenth century as, he explains,
                <quote>
                The hostility to novels which had been building up for several decades reached its
                peak in the early nineteenth century. The primary target was the circulating-library
                novel, compact of sensationalism, sentimentality, and (in the evangelical view)
                salaciousness. It was this very kind of book, however, which was best adapted to the
                taste of the reader whose limited education equipped him to relish little else . . .
                By barring from cheap religious reading matter the qualities most attractive to the
                novice reader; by denying him any acquaintance with pleasurable reading in
                elementary schools, village libraries, and other educational agencies under their
                control . . . the religious parties severely limited both the range and the
                attractiveness of the literary experience available to the working class. (123)
                </quote>
                What gets lost in Altick’s discussion is a fullness of religious perspectives, and an
                awareness of the ways non-normative religious groups&#8212;and particularly Jewish
                working-class writers like Polack&#8212;actively participated in educational and religious
                debates <emph>through</emph> the use of romance. In the 1841 census Polack
                is listed as a teacher. Given the reading level of <title level="m">Fiction Without
                    Romance</title>, it’s likely that Polack wrote it for classroom use to educate
                children about the dangers of romance and the importance of cultivating rational
                morality. Perhaps it’s not surprising that an educator would preface her novel by
                stating, “I am not so presumptuous as to say, that I do not fear criticism; nor am I
                so pusillanimous as to shrink from it. I shall receive it as the wholesome
                chastisement which a judicious tutor bestows on the pupil whom he wishes to train
                towards proficiency” (1: i). Indeed, the novel and its paratexts are tied on all
                fronts to an educational philosophy rooted in reading and writing with proficiency.
                Yet, in such opening remarks Polack places herself in the position of the student
                who awaits “wholesome chastisement” from her teacher/reader. While this might be a
                sign that Polack had hopes of publishing again under the tutelage of her critics, it
                also reveals her opinion of how book reviews should work. Sadly, Polack never
                received the kind of feedback she describes in this passage. Her novel is listed in
                several newspapers announcing newly published books, but most fail to offer
                commentary&#8212;wholesome or otherwise&#8212;on the quality of the writing or her treatment of
                her subjects.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Only two Reviews

            <p>While <title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title> has clear associations with
                English literary culture, one of its boldest moves was to connect Jacobin concerns
                about educational reform with Jewish debates about modernity and emancipation. In
                the novel’s publication year (1830)
                <quote>
                all public offices were closed to professing Jews. They were debarred from Parliament
                and from civic office and were disqualified from any employment connected to the
                administration of justice. In the civil sphere, Jews were obstructed from entering
                professions which demanded a Christian oath: most branches of schoolteaching,
                medicine and the Bar were closed to them and, for the same reason, Jews were
                ineligible to take degrees or hold any office at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
                Between the years 1830–1871 these political and civil disadvantages were erased.

            <p>As Anglo-Jews fought for and won political emancipation, they simultaneously faced
                evangelical conversionist efforts. In fact, the rise of conversionist activity and
                discourse had the effect of mobilizing Jewish communities throughout London. Gerry
                Black explains,
                <quote>
                The most important Societies were the Missionary Society (not specifically aimed at
                the Jews), founded in 1795; the London Missionary Society, effectively a committee
                of the Missionary Society that was created to work exclusively among the Jews; and
                the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews (LSPCJ), founded in
                1809. Between 1806 and 1813, three missionary schools were established in and around
                the Jewish quarter. (Black 29–30)
                </quote>
            As a resident and teacher in the Jewish quarter, Polack would have known first-hand
                the work of these missionary schools and her community’s response. The Rabbi of her
                Synagogue, Chief Rabbi Hirschell, spoke out on several occasions about the
                manipulations of missionary groups who made a habit of bribing Jewish children with
                food, clothing, and money (Black 30). According to Ragussis, “missions to convert
                the Jews became the subject of public scandal in the opening decades of the
                nineteenth century [during which] . . . English national character and its reputation
                for tolerance were called into question” (3). In subsequent years these conversion
                efforts made their way into British literary culture. He adds,
                <quote>
                What had been throughout most of the eighteenth century a steady (if somewhat
                negligible) stream of literature on the conversion of the Jews and their restoration
                to Palestine became nothing short of a torrent in the 1790s. In the tumultuous
                events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, millenarians saw the signs
                of the Second Coming, which, according to biblical prophecy, was to be preceded by
                the restoration of the Jews to Palestine and their conversion. (Ragussis 4)

            <p><title level="m">Fiction Without Romance</title>’s emphasis on marrying within one’s
                faith emerges directly from such fears about conversion and religious intermarriage.
                By imaging a friendship between Jewish and Christian young girls who educate one
                another on their differing religious cultures, Polack sets up a model for
                anti-conversionist tactics and learned respect for religious difference. In the
                process, she forges a new relationship between Jews and Christians governed by
                education and respect rather than a the compulsion of one group to conquer the other
                through conversion. We see this pattern played out repeatedly in conversations about
                the treatment of Jewish characters in the novel. A discussion of religious
                persecution between Eliza and Desbro helps to ground and unite these isolated
                moments. Eliza asks, “But, how is it, my dear uncle . . . that you seem so much more
                attached to the members of that nation [the Jewish people] than of some others? For
                instance, do you not think highly of the society of friends?” (2: 10) to which
                Desbro replies:
                <quote>
                Most assuredly I do . . . but they are not so much entitled to our commiseration,
                having never undergone the various kinds of persecution, at least, in so great a
                degree, as the Jews have been fated to endure . . . while in the society of the
                Israelite . . . though their tenets are rigidly severe among themselves, yet, in the
                company of others, they are sprightly, intelligent, and among the better sort,
                generally men of refined education and polished manners. . . . [their women are]
                amiable and very lively; they have the reputation for great modesty, and for their
                exemplary conduct as wives and mothers, I believe they almost stand unrivalled. (2:
                10–11)

                Desbro supports the notion that children should be made to feel at ease with a range
                of people from disparate cultures and religious backgrounds, and to sympathize with
                those who have suffered from unjust persecution and prejudice. While much of Eliza’s
                education takes place in the cottage, sequestered from urban life, she has
                opportunities to meet visitors from London, and later to travel to London where she
                encounters refugees from Europe, and learns from her uncle Desbro&#8212;the would-be
                murderer with a passion for violence&#8212;how and why one must treat others with respect.
                Through these narrative turns, Polack focuses on questions at the center of secular
                English culture about the importance of educating children to honor religious
                pluralism. In so doing, Polack sketches the stakes of those debates for a wider
                audience of novel readers that included both Jewish and English audiences. The
                putative turn away from romance was thus a turn toward plots that readers could find
                in real life, things as they are, and from which they could develop a moral
                sensibility through the experience of reading romance in fiction without
                romance.</p>
