                <p rend="noCount">This essay explores why so many nineteenth-century British writers
                    and artists reimagined the biblical figure of Ruth, beginning with Keats’s <title
                    level="a">Ode
                    to a Nightingale,</title> which surprisingly depicts Ruth as “sick for home… amid the
                    alien corn.” It also considers works by Felicia Hemans, Thomas Hood, John
                    Adams-Acton, and Grace Aguilar that follow in Keats’s wake but have received
                    little scholarly attention. I argue that Keats shaped a new representational
                    tradition in which Ruth becomes a figure of alienation and homesickness. In
                    doing so, Keats departs from the Bible but aligns with contemporaneous anxieties
                    about psychological, national, religious, and even racial otherness. </p>

                                <p>In the penultimate stanza of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> (1819), Keats
                                    takes an unexpectedly biblical turn, describing how the titular
                                    bird’s song was once heard by Ruth “when, sick for home, / She
                                    stood in tears amid the alien corn” (lines 66–67). This
                                    reference to the protagonist of the Book of Ruth is unexpected
                                    first because the poem has previously eschewed religious
                                    allusions in favor of those from classical mythology,
                                    Shakespeare, and Milton; Keats himself privileged poetic
                                    imagination over religious revelation. As Adam Plunkett
                                    explains, “Shakespeare was scripture for him, and scripture was
                                    not; he knew them but didn’t revere them.” But it is even more
                                    unexpected because of its interpretation of Ruth herself.
                                    Keats’s description of Ruth as homesick in an “alien” land is,
                                    as we shall see, not in keeping with the biblical text nor with
                                    the general tenor of nineteenth-century responses to it&#8212;of which
                                    there were many. Indeed, along with Keats, the
                                    nineteenth-century British writers and artists who adapted or
                                    alluded to Ruth’s story include William Blake, Thomas Hood,
                                    Felicia Hemans, Christina Rossetti, Grace Aguilar, William
                                    Tennant, Benjamin Farjeon, George Eliot, George Dawe, Charles
                                    Eastlake, George Frederick Watts, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward
                                    Burne-Jones, William Morris, Walter Crane, Simeon Solomon,
                                    Thomas Matthews Rooke, and John Adams-Acton. Such a list, by no
                                    means comprehensive, prods us to consider why so many British
                                    artists and writers from this period imagined&#8212;and
                                    reimagined&#8212;Ruth.</p>
                                <p>The Book of Ruth itself continues to generate diverse interpretations.
                                    Scholars as varied as J. Hillis Miller, Julia Kristeva, Sylvia Barack Fishman,
                                    and Bonnie Honig have read the Book of Ruth to comment on the nature of literary
                                    theory and translation, twentieth-century debates about European immigration, and
                                    the liberating power of mothers in the Bible, respectively. But nineteenth-century
                                    British <emph>cultural adaptations</emph> of the Book of Ruth have generated limited scholarly analysis. Given how deeply the Bible saturated this culture, this gap is surprising, and one I hope to begin to fill in by examining Romantic interpretations of Ruth, attending to the intertextuality of literary and artistic production. According to Northrop Frye, one of the few critics to treat literary adaptations of Ruth, this “comparative neglect” can be traced to what he terms “the irrepressible cheerfulness of the story, which is all about completely normal people fully understanding one another and leaves the literary imagination little to do.”<note place="foot" resp="author"> Frye discusses the Book of Ruth in <title level="a">The Bride from a Strange
                                        Land</title> (58). Eve Stoddard’s <title>A Genealogy of Ruths: From Alien Harvester
                                            to Fallen Woman in Nineteenth-Century England</title> is the only other attempt
                                        to assess Ruth as a nineteenth-century figure I have encountered. Stoddard focuses
                                        on echoes of Ruth in poems about harvesting that do not mention the Book of Ruth.
                                        She also hears echoes of the biblical Ruth in Elizabeth Gaskell’s <title
                                        level="m">Ruth</title> and Wordsworth’s poem of an abandoned, mad young woman
                                        named Ruth, leading Stoddard to argue for connections between the biblical story
                                        and female fallenness (though she admits that the connection is “somewhat tenuous
                                        and ironic” in Wordsworth’s case (53)). While very interesting, these biblical
                                        echoes are somewhat faint.</note> As I demonstrate, some of the nineteenth-century
                                    writers and artists who <emph>did</emph> imagine Ruth would disagree. For, as
                                    <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> reminds us, their renderings of
                                    Ruth, particularly as a stranger in a strange land, a foreigner in a new nation,
                                    are not always “irrepressibl[y] cheerful.”</p>
                                <p>There are many reasons Ruth became a compelling vehicle for
                                    Romantic writers and artists but all stem from the way the
                                    particulars of her biblical narrative chimed with the cultural
                                    dynamics of their own era. Despite being one of the shortest
                                    parts of the Bible, The Book of Ruth entails everything from
                                    religious conversion, mother-daughter relationships, and
                                    marriage laws, to agricultural practices and migration, not to
                                    mention love, loss, birth, and sex&#8212;in other words, topics with
                                    longstanding appeal but specific early nineteenth-century
                                    iterations. Like many of the writers I consider, I am
                                    particularly interested in Ruth as a figure who traverses
                                    geographic, religious, and national boundaries. In fact, the
                                    Book of Ruth has been read as a welcoming counterpoint to the
                                    ethnic isolationism and tribalism of later books Ezra and
                                    Nehemia. </p>
                                <p>The story opens when Naomi, her husband, and her sons leave
                                    Bethlehem due to famine and arrive in Moab, where the sons marry
                                    Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah. After the death of her sons and
                                    husband, Naomi decides to return to Israel, apparently never
                                    having felt at home in the “country of Moab” (<title level="m">King
                                    James Bible</title>, Ruth 1.6), one of the first signals
                                    that the text conceptualizes “home” in both familial and
                                    national terms. Initially, Ruth and Orpah say they will follow
                                    Naomi. But when Naomi urges them to “return each to her mother's
                                    house,” only Ruth refuses, pledging in what have become among
                                    the Bible’s most quoted lines, “whither thou goest, I will go;
                                    and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
                                    people, and thy God my God” (1.16). Together, they journey to
                                    Bethlehem. There, Ruth gleans in fields that turn out to belong
                                    to Boaz, a kinsman of Naomi’s who protects Ruth even though she
                                    is a “Moabitish damsel,” a “stranger” (2.6, 2.10). Through Ruth,
                                    the incorporation of strangers, foreigners, immigrants, into the
                                    Jewish people is celebrated, seen as her “full reward . . . given thee
                                    of the Lord God of Israel” (2.12), as well as Naomi’s reward for
                                    her past suffering. Boaz and Ruth go on to marry and have a son,
                                    Obed, who becomes a forbearer of David and Christ, making Ruth,
                                    an outsider, essential to both Jewish and Christian lineage. </p>
                                <p>Moreover, in both Jewish and Christian theology, Ruth has been seen as an early, if not
                                <emph>the</emph> earliest, convert. But there is some ambiguity about just what she converted
                                    <emph>to</emph>: a family, a faith, an ethnic group, or something more like a nation? The ambiguity
                                    is embedded in Ruth’s pledge to Naomi. The “ands” (“. . . I will go;
                                    <emph>and</emph> where thou lodgest . . . thy people shall be my people,
                                    <emph>and</emph> thy God my God”) simultaneously elide and distinguish between territory, family,
                                    ethnicity, and religion. Because the Book of Ruth can be read at once as lauding and exposing the
                                    uncertainty of religious conversion and national belonging, its narrative resonated with nineteenth-century
                                    anxieties about Englishness and what Michael Ragussis has termed its “culture of conversion,” one fixated on
                                    Jews (15–17). Increasingly, writers, Christian and Jewish, employed the Book of Ruth as a lens through which
                                    to examine not only gender and conversion, but immigration, national belonging, and Jewish acceptance in modern England.</p>
                                <p>In the works about Ruth I consider in this essay, these topics manifest themselves in the emphasis (or notable
                                    lack thereof) on Ruth’s familial relationships and faith in God, depictions of land and landscape, and conception
                                    of “home,” a frequently invoked term intertwined with English domestic ideology
                                    <emph>and</emph> experiences of migration. I focus on Keats’s <title level="a">Ode,</title> then consider works that follow in its wake:
                                    Felicia Hemans’s and Thomas Hood’s poems entitled <title level="a">Ruth</title> and sculptor John Adams-Acton’s
                                    <title level="a">Ruth Amid the Alien Corn.</title> I conclude with a reading of Anglo-Jewish writer Grace Aguilar’s
                                    exegesis of Ruth in <title level="m">The Women of Israel</title> (1886), which
                                        subtly fashions Ruth not just as a Moabite convert to
                                        Judaism but as a Jewish immigrant in England. How might
                                        Keats’s revision of Ruth&#8212;one that reads her against the
                                        grain, to use an apt harvest metaphor&#8212;elucidate Romantic
                                        dynamics of longing and belonging? What does it mean to
                                        recast Ruth as an emblem of loneliness, in effect as an
                                        out-of-place immigrant, at this moment in early
                                        nineteenth-century English culture? I argue that Keats
                                        shaped a new representational tradition in which Ruth
                                        becomes a figure of alienation and loss. In doing so, Keats
                                        departs from the Bible but aligns with contemporaneous
                                        sympathies and anxieties about psychological, national, and
                                        religious otherness. As Aguilar averred, “the women of the
                                        Bible are but mirrors of ourselves” (8).<note place="foot" resp="author"> All Aguilar quotations come from

                                <p>That nineteenth-century writers saw England as analogous to
                                    Ruth’s Bethlehem is supported not only by the general view of
                                    England as a “new Israel” but by the specifics of the imagery
                                    and language used in some texts and visual art. Take Scottish

                               This description echoes both the end of Milton’s <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title> and that of “England’s
                                    mountains green” in William Blake’s <title level="m">Milton</title>, which also contains the most famous iteration
                                    of England as a new Jerusalem. Blake was likely the first figure
                                    associated with Romanticism to portray Ruth. In
                                    <title level="m">Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion</title> (1804–1820),
                                    Blake includes “Ruth the Moabite” in the sacred “Maternal Line”
                                    (213). He takes up Ruth in more detail in two captivating
                                    images, <ref target="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1795-William-Blake-Naomi-entreating-Ruth-Orpah.jpg"><title

                                    Both depict what Blake, in his <title level="m">Descriptive
                                    Catalogue</title>, deemed “the most pathetic passage in the
                                    Book of Ruth, where Naomi having taken leave of her daughters in
                                    law, with intent to return to her own country; Ruth cannot leave
                                    her, but says, ‘Whither thou goest [. . .]’” (549). Blake translates
                                    this passage into a tableau of three figures at the moment of
                                    decision, Ruth clinging to Naomi on the left and Orpah turning
                                    away on the right. “Naomi entreating . . .” offers a sadder, gloomier
                                    take on the scene, with Naomi’s expression pained and Orpah bent
                                    in grief. Blake’s second version of this scene, still somber, is
                                    more uplifting. Naomi’s arms are literally raised up, Ruth no
                                    longer crouching. They embrace more naturally, eye-to-eye, as if
                                    the image endorses their union. In both compositions, Ruth and
                                    Naomi are offset by Orpah. She functions as Ruth’s mirror image,
                                    her body echoing Ruth’s but traveling in the opposite direction,
                                    back towards Moab, towards the familiar past, to accentuate
                                    Ruth’s movement towards the future. </p>
                                <p>While Blake’s complex engagement with the Bible is well-covered,
                                    these images have received scant critical attention. In this,
                                    they are typical of Romantic representations of Ruth. Blake’s
                                    images are also typical&#8212;if anything in Blake’s idiosyncratic
                                    work can be deemed typical&#8212;in emphasizing Ruth’s relationship
                                    with Naomi and the moment of conversion and connection.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Among other artists to do

                                                  and Simeon Solomon, the Anglo-Jewish Pre-Raphaelite who painted and drew Ruth repeatedly.</note>
                                    What stands out about visual representations of Ruth from this period is their
                                    <emph>relationality</emph>. Whether they envision her refusal to leave Naomi, her first conversation with Boaz
                                    in his fields, their first night together on the threshing floor, or her holding Obed, they see Ruth as a social
                                    being, reinforcing her official roles of daughter-in-law, wife, mother, and/or ancestress of the Jewish and
                                    Christian people. Blake’s images are certainly not “cheerful.” But their sorrow stems from Ruth’s fear of division
                                    from Naomi; for nineteenth-century viewers who, raised
                                    on the King James Bible, all knew what was
                                    coming, they contain the promise of Ruth’s future happiness in her soon-to-be-home of Bethlehem.</p>
                                <p>With these iterations of Ruth in mind, I want to return to Keats,
                                    whose reference to Ruth is likely the most famous in
                                    nineteenth-century literature. <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> is one of
                                    six odes now located at the heart of the Keats canon and the
                                    Romantic tradition. Keats was twenty-four, two years before his
                                    death from tuberculosis, when he composed the poem in the spring
                                    of 1819. <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> has been read as a meditation on
                                    poetry’s power and limitations, as well as its relationship to
                                    music, represented by the nightingale’s “immortal” song (1ine
                                    61). Also notable is the poem’s attraction to erasure and
                                    escape, what Helen Vendler has termed “imaginative
                                    self-annihilation,” all familiar Romantic concerns
                                    (102). In the stanza preceding Ruth’s appearance, for example, Keats’s
                                    confides in the nightingale that

                              Of all the religious and literary figures to select, why Ruth?
                                    Why “alien,” why the tears? Scholars have tried to account for Keats’s decision in various
                                    ways. Barry Gradman, for example, theorizes that, “while Keats
                                    here is speaking consciously of Ruth, he may be thinking,
                                    unconsciously, of Cordelia in <title level="m">King Lear</title>,”
                                    a link traced in part to their shared “filial piety” (16,

                                    their filial affection. Victor Lams hears echoes of Milton’s

                                    (152). There are some notable resemblances that suggest Keats
                                    may have been influenced in part by Wordsworth’s poem; in
                                    addition to referencing a nightingale, <title level="a">Solitary Reaper</title>
                                    features a woman “single in the field,” singing by herself a
                                    tune that haunts the speaker in ways that foreshadow the
                                    melancholy music of Keats’s nightingale. However, Wordsworth’s
                                    reaper is a generic “Highland lass,” a rural type rather than a
                                    specific individual or character, let alone one as well-known as
                                    a popular biblical figure.</p>
                                <p>Keats himself provided no explanation for his incorporation of
                                    Ruth. His letters contain only one reference to Ruth, but
                                    unrelated to the composition of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title>; he deems
                                    her a “deep one,” presumably due to her strategic enticement, at
                                    Naomi’s urging, of the sleeping Boaz on the threshing floor
                                    (<title level="a">Complete Works</title> 124–25). This letter only
                                    adds to the uncertainty of Keats’s poetic adaptation of Ruth,
                                    since in the poem she seems neither sensual nor sly, neither
                                    marriageable nor manipulative. To the extent that Keats would
                                    have viewed Ruth in relation to the Hebrew Bible, Judaism,
                                    and/or Jews, we can examine his letters on these topics; they
                                    include a few references to connections with and a few
                                    disparaging jibes at Anglo-Jews. For instance, in a letter from
                                    the same year as <title level="a">Ode,</title> he remarked, “I hope I have learned a
                                    little better and . . . am confident to cheat as well as any literary
                                    Jew of the Market and shine up an article on any thing without
                                    much knowledge of the subject” (95).<note place="foot" resp="author"> For

                                                  Keats’s letter of Feb. 24th, 1819 to George and Georgiana, in which he
                                                  describes going to a chapel built by “a great Jew converter” who has
                                                  spent lots of money on “a great number of poor Jews.” Keats adds that
                                                  “of course his communion plate was stolen” and that the “converter”
                                                  spoke to his [presumably Jewish] clerk, who
                                                  apologized and said, “‘I dare shay, your honor,
                                                  it’s among ush’” (26). According to Andrew Motion, Keats’s mother may
                                                  have lived with a Jewish man named Abraham after his father’s death,
                                                  while Fanny Brawn married a Sephardic Jew after Keats’s death (32, 568).</note>
                                    This casual, depressingly familiar type of comment suggests
                                    Keats’s skepticism about the sincerity of Anglo-Jewish writers
                                    (note the way Jewish writers are figures of “the Market” rather
                                    than of the mind) but does little to illuminate his overarching
                                    opinions about Anglo-Jews, immigrants, or the Book of Ruth in
                                    this context. Thus, it is impossible to ascertain definitively what Keats was
                                    thinking when he selected Ruth for <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title></p>
                                <p>But the poem’s language, imbued with its historical context, can
                                    help us arrive at a better understanding of how Keats’s Ruth
                                    functions in the poem and might have resonated with his readers
                                    as an outcast, a psychological other. To fully understand
                                    Keats’s startling revision of Ruth, we must recognize the way
                                    the poem links her not <emph>just</emph> to a
                                    universal, ahistorical sadness but <emph>also</emph>
                                    to contemporaneous socio-political discussions about territory,
                                    immigration, and national belonging. Particularly revealing are
                                    the phrases “sick for home” and “alien corn,” the latter of
                                    which presents an especially original, memorable juxtaposition.
                                    These phrases evoke early nineteenth-century debates about
                                    whether foreigners, and Jews specifically, could join an
                                    Englishness that sometimes saw them as&#8212;and sometimes itself
                                    seemed&#8212; “alien.” Assessing the place of representations of Jews
                                    and Judaism in Romantic culture, Judith Page maintains that they
                                    “test the Romantic faith in the efficacy of sympathetic
                                    imagination and its implied ideal of an inclusive community”
                                    (xii). Keats’s Ruth, who calls forth the readers’ sympathies
                                    precisely because of her marginality, her sense of being cut off
                                    from her homeland, reinforces this analysis. Keats extends his
                                    sympathetic imagination to Ruth by contemplating what it might
                                    feel like to be a foreigner away from one’s original home, and
                                    does so in part by granting <emph>her</emph> a
                                    sympathetic imagination, one capable of memory and desire. </p>
                                <p>Fittingly, the stanza featuring Ruth illustrates how the
                                    nightingale’s song can transcend the categories of time, nation,
                                    and class that structured early nineteenth-century English
                                    society. The poem tracks the song “[t]hrough . . . winding mossy
                                    ways,” back to the “ancient days” when it might have been heard
                                    by “emperor and clown.” The generality of these terms makes the
                                    arrival in the next lines of Ruth (the only specific character
                                    mentioned in the poem) all the more striking. Keats may have
                                    heard the same song as emperor and clown, but it is with Ruth
                                    that he feels a special kinship. From the ode’s opening
                                    confessional declaration&#8212;“My heart aches” (1) &#8212;Keats lays the
                                    groundwork for the parallel between Ruth’s “sad heart” and his
                                    own, transforming her into a figure of emotional struggle and
                                    estrangement.<note place="foot" resp="author"> In <title level="m">Imagination

                                            Karla Alwes briefly
                                                  analyzes Ruth in similar, ahistorical terms as “a
                                                  wanderer and stranger” for whom “earth holds no
                                                  solace” but does not note the significant
                                                  departure this constitutes from the biblical
                                                  account of Ruth, whose solace arguably derives in
                                                  part through her gleaning from the earth’s bounty
                                                  (125).</note></p>
                                <p>But again, if Keats was looking for a literary or biblical figure
                                    symbolizing sorrow, surely there are more obvious choices. In
                                    the Bible, by the time she is gleaning, Ruth has already
                                    <emph>voluntarily</emph> pledged herself to this new
                                    land and people; while not yet married to Boaz, she is taking
                                    the first steps towards securing the happy ending: a successful
                                    marriage plot, to put it in nineteenth-century terms. The
                                    contrast between a more typical rendering of Ruth and Keats’s
                                    version can be illustrated by returning briefly to Tennant’s
                                    poem (published a few years after Keats’s but characteristic in
                                    its depiction of Ruth). Tennant’s version opens with Naomi
                                    telling her daughters-in-law to return home. <emph>Naomi</emph>,
                                    not Ruth, is the one who is “broken and
                                    forlorn” and “sick of heart” (6, 8); the phrase “lorn and sick
                                    of heart” becomes a kind of refrain, Naomi’s epithet. Following
                                    the biblical verses, Ruth and Orpah shed tears with Naomi at the
                                    thought of parting, but Orpah returns to Moab while Ruth vows to
                                    join Naomi as her comforter, preparing “sweet solace” (42) for
                                    her as they take their way to Bethlehem. As I noted at the
                                    start, this trajectory is presented in muted but optimistic
                                    tones, rising literally and figuratively with the poem’s final
                                    phrase: “green ascent.” </p>
                                <p>In contrast, there is no green ascent, no hopeful progress or
                                    welcomed familial inclusion for Ruth in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title>
                                    By the next stanza, the poem’s last, Ruth has also been cut off
                                    from Keats, or rather Keats has been cut off from her. The
                                    “forlorn” at the end of the Ruth stanza is repeated at the next
                                    stanza’s start. Keats is left with his “sole self” (72), a
                                    phrase underlining his aloneness, since by definition the self
                                    is one’s own. We might say he has been alienated from his fellow
                                    aliens. In fact, Keats excises all the other figures from the
                                    biblical story: his Ruth is neither daughter-in-law, wife/widow,
                                    vulnerable supplicant/youthful seductress, nor new wife/mother.
                                    Instead, she floats free from the Book of Ruth’s plot, almost as
                                    if she has been dropped into the poem’s dreamscape of “alien
                                    corn,” emphasizing the disconnect between Ruth and the land. </p>
                                <p>The only part of the Bible story that remains is her status as “a
                                    stranger,” though her attitude towards that status is quite
                                    different. Moab is unnamed, but presumably it is the “home” for
                                    which she longs. It’s as if Keats’s Ruth has a touch of Orpah in
                                    her, a reluctance to leave what Keats implies was her true
                                    country. The description of Ruth raises the question: can one
                                    actually be “sick” for home? The concept of homesickness or
                                    nostalgia was comparatively new, emerging in the mid-1700s among
                                    soldiers, travelers, and immigrants in an increasingly mobile
                                    European society; starting with Swiss doctor Johannes Hofer in
                                    the late 1680s, it was thought to be an actual, physiological
                                    disease&#8212;meaning one could literally be “sick for home.”<note place="foot"

                                    Perhaps Keats, who trained as a surgeon, would have been
                                    familiar with this diagnosis. In any case, Keats creates a Ruth
                                    who is out of place, nostalgic for her lost country. He
                                    implicitly adopts the immigrant condition as a symbol of his own
                                    dislocation and emotional exile. In doing so, he modifies the
                                    pattern of Shelley, Coleridge, and Wordsworth, all of whom at
                                    some point appropriated the figure of the Wandering Jew to

                                <p>The Book of Ruth, Adele Berlin asserts, is about “the continuity
                                    of the people and its land” (260), from exile and return, to
                                    customs governing harvest and land inheritance. Similarly, J.
                                    Hillis Miller sees the Book as a “story . . . organized around the
                                    crossing of borders and the establishment of territorial rights”
                                    (217). In <title level="a">The Politics of Gleaning in Keats,</title> Andrew Bennett
                                    elucidates an aspect of these territorial rights relevant to
                                    Keats’s cultural moment. Bennett explains that in 1818, due to
                                    new laws governing enclosures that restricted access to land
                                    previously available for harvest, the “the very concept of the
                                    gleaner underwent a sea-change&#8212;from the archetypal beneficiary
                                    of charity to a criminal . . .” (34–38). Building on Bennett’s
                                    analysis of those excluded from the bounty of English land, I
                                    want to add another implication of “alien corn.” </p>
                                <p>In early nineteenth-century culture, the term “alien” was one
                                    with dual registers. There is the <emph>emotional</emph> alienation associated with Romantic poets
                                    and that we have already seen at work in Keats’s poem (“do I
                                    wake or sleep?”). But there is also a <emph>national</emph> meaning of “alien”: an immigrant or outsider
                                    from Englishness. “Alien” did not refer to Jews only, yet the
                                    term was regularly used to describe them and surfaced often in
                                    deliberations over their legal and cultural status. From the
                                    so-called “Jew Bill” of 1753 to the Aliens Act and creation of
                                    the Aliens Office in 1793, and early efforts at Jewish
                                    emancipation, Keats was writing during a period in which there
                                    was a proliferation of parliamentary speeches, sermons, novels,
                                    and articles about whether Jews belonged in England (which had
                                    only allowed them back under Cromwell in 1656), whether they
                                    could or must convert to Protestantism, and whether they
                                    deserved “alien” status. Examples range from texts as different
                                    as <title level="m">Reports on the diseases in London:

                                    but to remain perpetual Aliens” [Lemoine
                                    18]). Within a decade after the publication of <title level="a">Ode
                                    to a Nightingale,</title> during
                                    Parliamentary deliberations over the proposal for the Removal of
                                    Jewish Disabilities, Robert Peel would endorse the view that
                                    “The Jew . . . is regarded in the light of an alien&#8212;he is excluded
                                    because he will not amalgamate with us in any of his usages or
                                    habits.” In contrast, Thomas Macaulay would reject the logic that Jews
                                    “cannot be made Englishmen altogether. The statesman who treats
                                    them as aliens, and then abuses them for not entertaining all
                                    the feelings of natives, is as unreasonable as the tyrant who
                                    punished their fathers for not making bricks without straw”
                                        (150).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See Thomas Babbington
                                            Macaulay, <title level="a">Jewish Civil Disabilities</title> (1829).
                                            The Aliens Act of 1793 also continued to have implications for Jews,
                                            occasionally being used to deport “suspicious” Jewish peddlers
                                            (Endelman 276). Although they do not address Ruth in Keats, Hemans,
                                            or Aguilar, Sheila Spector’s two edited collections of work on British
                                            Romanticism and Jews offer helpful overviews of the way Jews informed
                                            and were informed by Romanticism and English politics between the defeat
                                            of the “Jew Bill” and Emancipation.</note>
                                    This kind of public discourse, I suggest, informed the way
                                    Keats’s readers encountered his Ruth, a Jew who is also not a
                                    Jew and an alien who is also not an alien, when they found her
                                    “amidst the alien corn.” She can be read as a woman gleaning
                                    simultaneously in the fields of ancient Bethlehem and early
                                    nineteenth-century England, a convert to (proto) Judaism in the
                                    Bible and as a Jewish immigrant to modern England.</p>

                                    But Adams-Acton’s Ruth is directly mediated by Keats’s poem; the
                                    line “Ruth, when, sick for home, she stood in tears amid the
                                    alien corn” is engraved at the bottom of the pedestal upon which
                                    she stands. Even without the quotation, this Ruth captures a
                                    Keatsian sorrow and isolation in marble. She stands, leaning on
                                    one hip, knee slightly bent, head down. She looks as if she has
                                    fallen into an unhappy memory, having ceased the gleaning
                                    indicated by the sheaves of wheat at her side. Her youthful face
                                    and despondent pose radiate homesickness, while her unclothed
                                    torso adds an element of eroticism, making her a figure of
                                    sympathy and sexual appeal.</p>
                                <p>Perhaps Adams-Acton was thinking, too, of Thomas Hood’s poem
                                    <title level="a">Ruth</title> (1827), which eyes Ruth through the desirous gaze of
                                    Boaz, the poem’s speaker. Hood moved in similar circles to and
                                    was deeply influenced by Keats in his serious verse, including
                                    his <title level="a">Ruth,</title> published eight years after Keats’s <title level="a">Ode</title>
                                    (Whitley 39). Like Keats, Hood
                                    envisions Ruth not with Naomi, but in the fields: “Thus she
                                    stood amid the stooks . . .” (15). Yet the similarities end here.
                                    Boaz paints Ruth as both sexually fertile (“she stood breast
                                    high amid the corn” [l.1], her skin is “ripened” and has the
                                    “glowing kiss” of the sun [6, 4]), and domestically devoted
                                    (“Praising God with sweetest looks” [16]). The poem concludes by
                                    offering an implicit alternative to Keats’s “homesick,”
                                    alienated Ruth. Boaz’s final line offers to “share my harvest
                                    and my home” (20). The alliterative linkage between “harvest”
                                    and “home” underscores the biblical narrative of Ruth’s
                                    integration into a new “home” through immigration and
                                    intermarriage. Her gleaning&#8212;and Boaz’s willingness to
                                    share&#8212;analogizes the view of immigrants as welcomed to the
                                    fruits of the land.</p>
                                <p>The most interesting, in my view, of the texts resembling Keats’s
                                    <title level="a">Ode</title> is Felicia Hemans’s sonnet <title level="a">Ruth</title> from her late collection
                                    <title level="m">Female Characters of Scripture: A Series
                                    of Sonnets</title> (1833, 1834). The most famous poet of the
                                    era, Hemans was “met with immediate and extensive popularity,”
                                    according to one Victorian critic (qtd. in Wolfson 602–3); her
                                    best-known poems became “virtual national anthems” (Wolfson
                                    xiii). Over the past two decades, scholars have reassessed
                                    Hemans’s ambiguous place within the (traditionally masculine)
                                    Romantic literary landscape&#8212;including whether she should be seen
                                    as Romantic at all or rather as an early Victorian&#8212;and debated
                                    her constructions of gender, nationalism, and empire (Leighton
                                    2, Cronin 67–109). Throughout her poetry, themes of motherhood,
                                    faith, “feminine” subservience and yet also female
                                    self-expression predominate. Her work might be said, drawing on
                                    titles to two of her collections, to offer
                                    <title level="m">Records of Woman</title> with a particular, if not untroubled,

                                    Affections</title>.</p>
                                <p>Despite such engagement with domesticity and gendered
                                    spirituality, Hemans’s late work on biblical women has garnered
                                    relatively little attention, her portrayal of <title level="a">Ruth</title> even less.
                                    (For instance, accomplished recent readings of Hemans’s work by
                                    Wolfson, Angela Leighton, Jason Rudy and others do not discuss

                                    Characters of Scripture’,</title> Anne Nichols laments the overlooking
                                    of Hemans’s late religious works in part because they capture
                                    “the ambivalence [Hemans] and many of her contemporaries held
                                    towards the position of women,” ultimately employing biblical
                                    figures to “broad[en] standard definitions of acceptable
                                    femininity” (559, 574). Others have noted the sonnets’
                                    “contradictory combination of the emancipatory and the
                                    conservative,” concluding that the collection is more
                                    gender-flexible than readers might expect (Mason and Roberts
                                        73).<note place="foot" resp="author"> See <title level="a">Glorification of the

                                                  emphasizes her domesticity and her progress from
                                                  “lowly” to “exalted” in ways that typologically
                                                  align with Hemans’s representations of New
                                                  Testament women. See also Emma Mason and Jonathan

                                    offers a test case for Hemans’s emphasis on women’s power, one
                                    that hinges on the now-familiar, if frequently contested, “sense
                                    of home” in early nineteenth-century culture and Romantic
                                    tradition. </p>
                                <p><title level="a">Ruth</title> is one of fifteen sonnets in <title level="m">Female
                                    Characters of Scripture</title>, first published in
                                    <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title> in 1833. The collection was
                                    initially divided into two sections: one featured Old Testament
                                    <title level="a">Daughters of Judah,</title> from Miriam and Ruth to Rizpah and the
                                    Shunamite woman; the other focused on New Testament figures such
                                    as Mary, Mary Magdalene, and the <title level="a">Penitent Anointing Christ’s

                                    frames Ruth with the Hebrew Bible suggests she views Ruth in a
                                    specifically Jewish but also a typologically-driven
                                    “Judeo-Christian” context.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Cynthia Scheinberg notes
                                    that the rise of the female poet (as cultural image and economic figure) parallels

                                    The collection opens with a bifurcated invocation. The first
                                    part summons “the gracious Forms” of Old Testament women, with
                                    their “dark prophetic Eastern eyes,” to return and “renew”
                                    contemporary England (597)&#8212;a figurative, poetic immigration of
                                    sorts. The second part shifts to New Testament women, who are
                                    praised not for their “prophetic” power but for their “heart
                                    subdued” (597). The first sonnet, a tribute to Miriam, provides
                                    the clearest championing of female poetic skill (Melnyk
                                    74). However,
                                    <title level="a">Ruth,</title> the second sonnet, retreats from that “prophetic”
                                    vision, resting Ruth’s appeal on her “calm heart” and “gentle
                                    eye.” I cite the sonnet in full:

                              Compared to Keats, Hemans draws more overtly on the Biblical
                                    account. As in the Bible, Ruth’s gentleness and devotion are
                                    prominent, particularly her devotion to God. Hemans repurposes
                                    the best-known part of Ruth’s pledge as the sonnet’s final line,
                                    emphasizing its import with the couplet’s rhyme (“tone”/“own”).
                                    (Weaving the language of the Bible directly into verse was a
                                    common strategy in poetic representations of biblical figures at
                                    this time.) </p>
                            <p>Yet the “image” of Ruth that is “brought back” to Hemans, I
                                    argue, derives more from Keats than the King James.<note place="foot" resp="author"> There
                                        is, to my knowledge, no direct documentary evidence that Hemans modeled her sonnet on
                                        Keats, but she read widely in the literature of the period, was personally friendly with
                                        Wordsworth, Shelley, and other Romantic poets, and also seems to echo Keats in other poems;
                                        Gary Kelly, for instance, notes the resemblance between a passage in Keats’s <title level="a">Ode
                                        on a Grecian Urn</title> and one of Hemans’s in <title level="m">Forest
                                                  Sanctuary</title> (<title level="m">Felicia Hemans</title> 233n1).
                                                  Ultimately, I think the similarities of language
                                                  and approach in the texts themselves constitute
                                                  sufficient evidence to support this reading. Even
                                                  if Hemans did not know <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title> her
                                                  sonnet would still buttress my thesis that there
                                                  was a cultural shift towards representing Ruth as
                                                  alienated and homesick.</note> There
                                    are many echoes of <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale</title> here: corn, bird,
                                    tears, weariness, the Romantic atmospherics of “dreamy motion
                                    fann’d.” Both poets approach Ruth from the perspective of the
                                    lyric <emph>I</emph> rather than a detached
                                    third-person observer or Ruth herself. Nor do they write from
                                    the position of another figure from the story, as Hood does with
                                    Boaz. In fact, Boaz and Naomi are notably absent from Hemans’s
                                    adaptation just as they are from Keats’s (technically Naomi is
                                    implied by “thy,” but the referent is never made explicit). In
                                    Hemans, the speaker seems almost to be re-living an experience
                                    of witnessing Ruth in the fields at harvest time: “I see thee
                                    stand / Lone, midst the gladness of the harvest-band,” the
                                    speaker recounts. Whether this “I” is part of the
                                    “harvest-band,” a detached observer, or perhaps Hemans herself
                                    is unclear. But it is the Romantic affiliation with Ruth’s
                                    marginalized condition and the implicit testament to the power
                                    of imagination to call it forth from personal or cultural memory
                                    that is central. </p>
                                <p>As this reference to Ruth’s loneliness indicates, the resemblance
                                    to Keats is most significant in the way Hemans, too, fashions a
                                    sympathetically isolated Ruth. The poem ostensibly argues for
                                    the <emph>lack</emph> of regret Ruth feels having
                                    chosen her new family and faith in Bethlehem:

                                In other words, Hemans implies that Ruth’s nostalgic sorrow for
                                    her people and her nation (“fatherland”) is exceeded by her
                                    religious faith. </p>
                                <p>Yet the poem’s muted tone and repetition of Ruth’s solitude run
                                    counter to this argument. There is something insistent and
                                    almost monitory in “’tis not to rue,” as if the speaker is
                                    trying to convince Ruth, readers, and herself that Ruth has no
                                    second thoughts. The “forlornness” of the epithet “O forlorn /
                                    Yet not forsaken Ruth!” lingers on. In fact, “forlorn” lingers
                                    from Keats, who uses the word twice in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title>
                                    Hemans paints Ruth “lone, as a wood-bird” allied with nature
                                    rather than the surrounding people. Even within nature, Hemans
                                    describes Ruth as a bird in the wrong natural space&#8212;a wood-bird
                                    stranded, fatally, over the ocean. (The brutality of “fall’n in
                                    its weariness” can be missed upon first reading&#8212;“perilous seas”
                                    indeed.) Hemans further isolates Ruth “lone, midst the gladness
                                    of the harvest-band.” She is cut off from the comfort of both
                                    nature <emph>and</emph> culture; the “harvest-band” in
                                    Bethlehem is rejoicing without her and Moab is “smil[ing] far
                                    away!” Again, it is worth noting this puzzling departure from
                                    the Book of Ruth, in which Moab is not depicted sentimentally.
                                    No substantive details about the land are provided, aside from
                                    the fact that this is where Naomi’s husband and two sons die.
                                    Ruth herself never looks homeward or signals any doubts about
                                    her decision. Instead, she repeatedly expresses gratitude for
                                    the kindness shown to her as “a Moabitish damsel” in this new
                                    land of promise and plenty (Ruth 2.6). </p>
                                <p>The alienation of Hemans’s Ruth is mitigated by the poem’s
                                    reliance on the gendered trope of home. Hemans’s investment in
                                    home, Deborah Kennedy argues, should not be read as merely a
                                    sign of “conventional domesticity. If we only view the word
                                    ‘home’ as an encoded term for the oppression of women, then we

                                    Scripture</title>.) <title level="a">Ruth</title> implies that its protagonist,
                                    despite mourning her homeland, has forged a more valuable,
                                    transportable version of home. “Home” is contained in the
                                    feminine “affectionate . . . glance” rather than a physical space.
                                    This notion of “home” embodied, literally, in women’s bodies
                                    offers some measure of control and “calm” in an unpredictable
                                    world. </p>
                                <p>But the notion that home can be constructed out of woman’s love
                                    and embodied affection is undercut by the ultimate aloneness and
                                    loneliness of Hemans’s Ruth. If “home” resides in a woman’s
                                    glance, who will actually look into Ruth’s “gleam[ing]” eyes?
                                    Who will “recognise” Ruth’s “pure” love? Emma Mason and Jonathan
                                    Roberts read the absence of male biblical figures in the sonnet
                                    collection as a strategy Hemans employs to redistribute
                                    narrative power to women (72). This rings true for Hemans’s
                                    account of Miriam, and might make sense in terms of leaving out
                                    Boaz, or even Obed. But what about Naomi? Would not the poem’s
                                    articulation of female influence through shared affection be
                                    more powerful if Ruth had someone with whom she could share it?
                                    The biblical text as well as the many visual representations of
                                    Ruth provided a range of representational strategies embodying
                                    Ruth’s inclusion. By choosing to focus on Ruth weeping rather
                                    than entwined with Naomi, Boaz, or Obed, Keats and Hemans
                                    rewrite Ruth’s defining characteristics as loneliness,
                                    alienation, and nostalgia. </p>

                                    Aguilar’s <title level="a">Women of Israel</title> (1844). Aguilar
                                    is a fitting writer with whom to conclude because she was
                                    indebted to Romanticism’s language of feeling, particularly
                                    Hemans’s narratives of domesticity and spirituality (Galchinsky
                                    373); like Keats, Hood, and Hemans, her understanding of Ruth
                                    pivoted on conceptions of home as domestic and national space.
                                    Yet she offers a distinctive Anglo-Jewish rebuttal to the
                                    construction of an alienated Ruth. “No Jewish female author has
                                    attained the . . . well-deserved popularity achieved by Grace
                                    Aguilar,” <title level="j">The Jewish Chronicle</title> declared:
                                    “Her numerous literary productions have been read and
                                    appreciated in England, America, Germany, and France. Her
                                    <title level="m">Women of Israel</title> . . . is a book teeming with
                                    powerful lessons to her own sex and eloquent exhortation to the
                                    opposite sex” (qtd. in <title level="m">Cyclopædia</title> 69).
                                    The foundational lesson Aguilar imparts is not just the value of
                                    Jewish women in biblical history, something she thinks has been
                                    overlooked both in the patriarchal Jewish exegetical tradition
                                    and the Protestant mythologizing of Jewish women, but their
                                    striking relevance. She follows Hemans’s lead to consider how
                                    “female characters of scripture” might serve as “warning” and
                                    “example” for nineteenth-century women, Anglo-Jewish women in
                                    particular (7). As “mirrors of ourselves” (14), the Women of
                                    Israel refract nineteenth-century concerns about the
                                    compatibility of Englishness and
                                    Jewishness. This

                                    We now come to a portion of our history as women of Israel which
                                    from the loveliness of female character that it displays, has in
                                    neither history nor romance been equaled. In the Bible it is
                                    termed the book of Ruth; but as Ruth does not properly belong by
                                    birth and ancestry to the women of Israel, Naomi must be the
                                    subject of our consideration. With her history, however, Ruth is
                                    so entwined that we cannot reflect on the one without also
                                    pausing on the touching beauty of the other. (223)

                                This seemingly perfunctory introduction, with its familiar
                                    gendered praise, perfectly captures the paradox of Ruth’s
                                    belonging: on the one hand, Aguilar claims that she “does not
                                    properly belong,” a belonging predicated on lineage and
                                    ethnicity that cannot be erased even after conversion, marriage,
                                    or immigration. With its vaguely coercive “must,” the passage
                                    redirects our attention to Naomi. On the other hand, Aguilar
                                    recognizes that Ruth is “so entwined” with Jews, that it’s
                                    impossible to ignore her. Nor, it seems as the chapter
                                    progresses, does Aguilar want to. </p>
                                <p>In fact, what makes Aguilar’s interpretation of Ruth so
                                    interesting&#8212;on its own terms and in light of the trajectory of
                                    Ruths previously surveyed&#8212;is how it subtly inverts the original
                                    story, aligning the non-Jewish Ruth with Victorian Jews and the
                                    Jewish Naomi with Protestant England. This inversion is evident
                                    in Aguilar’s repeated emphasis on Ruth’s <emph>choosing</emph>
                                    to become a Jew, which makes her “as worthy
                                    if not even more so to be the ancestress of David than the
                                    lineal descendants of Abraham” (236). Aguilar writes:
                                    <quote>
                                    When Ruth resigned alike home, parents, and the gods of her
                                    youth, she voluntarily engrafted herself upon the children of
                                    God . . . her acceptance of, and obedience to, the Law were entirely
                                    <emph>voluntary</emph> not merely received from
                                    education and as heritage. (235)
                                    </quote>
                                    In this reading, Anglo-Jews are like Ruth in that they (or their
                                    ancestors) voluntarily chose to move to England and accept
                                    English laws and habits; thus they could be viewed as not only
                                    equal but more worthy of Englishness than those who have
                                    “merely” inherited it. </p>
                                <p>To a writer who articulated her frustration that in England “Jews
                                    are still considered aliens and foreigners” and thus
                                    “separated . . . from sympathy and fellowship” (Aguilar, <title level="a">History</title>
                                    332), Keats’s version of Ruth in the “alien corn” might have
                                    struck a discordant note. Yet Aguilar’s reading of Ruth likewise
                                    meditates upon what Ruth might have remembered about her past
                                    and whether true belonging in a new land is possible. Aguilar is
                                    clear that Ruth has not forgotten&#8212;“We never find Ruth forgetting
                                    her origin” (244), we are reassured&#8212;but she differentiates
                                    between forgetting and nostalgizing. By privileging choice and
                                    faith over blood and race, Aguilar attempts to transform the
                                    potentially unsettling fact that Ruth continues to be seen as
                                    simultaneously Israelite and Moabite into a model for Anglo-Jews
                                    to be both English and Jewish. Her Ruth preserves a degree of
                                    difference, yet is emphatically part of the national family. In
                                    Bethlehem/England, she is not “sick for home”: she <emph>is</emph> home.</p>
                                <p>In situating Aguilar in an artistic lineage&#8212;a “maternal line”?&#8212;of
                                    Ruths, my aim has been to demonstrate that such Romantic
                                    adaptations of Ruth were in conversation with each other,
                                    conversations that crossed medium and genre. Moreover, I hope to
                                    have demonstrated that such works were also in conversation with
                                    fundamental nineteenth-century cultural concerns not often seen
                                    as relevant to the seemingly “cheerful,” pastoral idyll of the
                                    Book of Ruth. Without registering the backdrop of British
                                    desires and anxieties about forms of alienation, belonging, and
                                    belief, we risk missing what made Ruth both so popular and so
                                    meaningful. For it is not despite but precisely
                                    <emph>because</emph> there is a debate about whether
                                    Ruth “does not properly belong” that she is so “entwined”
                                    with&#8212;indeed, so at home in&#8212;the nineteenth-century cultural
                                    imagination.</p>
