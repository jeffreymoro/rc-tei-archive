            <p class="noCount">This essay explores why so many nineteenth-century British writers and artists reimagined
               the biblical figure of Ruth, beginning with Keats’s 
               “Ode to a Nightingale,”
               which surprisingly depicts Ruth as “sick for home… amid the alien corn.” It also considers
               works by Felicia Hemans, Thomas Hood, John Adams-Acton, and Grace Aguilar that follow
               in Keats’s wake but have received little scholarly attention. I argue that Keats shaped
               a new representational tradition in which Ruth becomes a figure of alienation and
               homesickness. In doing so, Keats departs from the Bible but aligns with contemporaneous
               anxieties about psychological, national, religious, and even racial otherness.</p>

               <p>In the penultimate stanza of 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  (1819), Keats takes an unexpectedly biblical turn, describing how the titular bird’s
                  song was once heard by Ruth “when, sick for home, / She stood in tears amid the alien
                  corn” (lines 66–67). This reference to the protagonist of the Book of Ruth is unexpected
                  first because the poem has previously eschewed religious allusions in favor of those
                  from classical mythology, Shakespeare, and Milton; Keats himself privileged poetic
                  imagination over religious revelation. As Adam Plunkett explains, “Shakespeare was
                  scripture for him, and scripture was not; he knew them but didn’t revere them.” But
                  it is even more unexpected because of its interpretation of Ruth herself. Keats’s
                  description of Ruth as homesick in an “alien” land is, as we shall see, not in keeping
                  with the biblical text nor with the general tenor of nineteenth-century responses
                  to it—of which there were many. Indeed, along with Keats, the nineteenth-century British
                  writers and artists who adapted or alluded to Ruth’s story include William Blake,
                  Thomas Hood, Felicia Hemans, Christina Rossetti, Grace Aguilar, William Tennant, Benjamin
                  Farjeon, George Eliot, George Dawe, Charles Eastlake, George Frederick Watts, Dante
                  Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Walter Crane, Simeon Solomon,
                  Thomas Matthews Rooke, and John Adams-Acton. Such a list, by no means comprehensive,
                  prods us to consider why so many British artists and writers from this period imagined—and
                  reimagined—Ruth.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Book of Ruth itself continues to generate diverse interpretations. Scholars as
                     varied as J. Hillis Miller, Julia Kristeva, Sylvia Barack Fishman, and Bonnie Honig
                     have read the Book of Ruth to comment on the nature of literary theory and translation,
                     twentieth-century debates about European immigration, and the liberating power of
                     mothers in the Bible, respectively. But nineteenth-century British <em>cultural adaptations</em> of the Book of Ruth have generated limited scholarly analysis. Given how deeply the
                     Bible saturated this culture, this gap is surprising, and one I hope to begin to fill
                     in by examining Romantic interpretations of Ruth, attending to the intertextuality
                     of literary and artistic production. According to Northrop Frye, one of the few critics
                     to treat literary adaptations of Ruth, this “comparative neglect” can be traced to
                     what he terms “the irrepressible cheerfulness of the story, which is all about completely
                     normal people fully understanding one another and leaves the literary imagination
                     little to do.”

                              “The Bride from a Strange Land”
                              (58). Eve Stoddard’s A Genealogy of Ruths: From Alien Harvester to Fallen Woman in

                     </div> As I demonstrate, some of the nineteenth-century writers and artists who <em>did</em> imagine Ruth would disagree. For, as 
                     “Ode to a Nightingale”
                      reminds us, their renderings of Ruth, particularly as a stranger in a strange land,
                     a foreigner in a new nation, are not always “irrepressibl[y] cheerful.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>There are many reasons Ruth became a compelling vehicle for Romantic writers and artists
                  but all stem from the way the particulars of her biblical narrative chimed with the
                  cultural dynamics of their own era. Despite being one of the shortest parts of the
                  Bible, The Book of Ruth entails everything from religious conversion, mother-daughter
                  relationships, and marriage laws, to agricultural practices and migration, not to
                  mention love, loss, birth, and sex—in other words, topics with longstanding appeal
                  but specific early nineteenth-century iterations. Like many of the writers I consider,
                  I am particularly interested in Ruth as a figure who traverses geographic, religious,
                  and national boundaries. In fact, the Book of Ruth has been read as a welcoming counterpoint
                  to the ethnic isolationism and tribalism of later books Ezra and Nehemia. </p>
               <p>The story opens when Naomi, her husband, and her sons leave Bethlehem due to famine
                  and arrive in Moab, where the sons marry Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah. After the
                  death of her sons and husband, Naomi decides to return to Israel, apparently never
                  having felt at home in the “country of Moab” (<em>King James Bible</em>, Ruth 1.6), one of the first signals that the text conceptualizes “home” in both
                  familial and national terms. Initially, Ruth and Orpah say they will follow Naomi.
                  But when Naomi urges them to “return each to her mother's house,” only Ruth refuses,
                  pledging in what have become among the Bible’s most quoted lines, “whither thou goest,
                  I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and
                  thy God my God” (1.16). Together, they journey to Bethlehem. There, Ruth gleans in
                  fields that turn out to belong to Boaz, a kinsman of Naomi’s who protects Ruth even
                  though she is a “Moabitish damsel,” a “stranger” (2.6, 2.10). Through Ruth, the incorporation
                  of strangers, foreigners, immigrants, into the Jewish people is celebrated, seen as
                  her “full reward . . . given thee of the Lord God of Israel” (2.12), as well as Naomi’s
                  reward for her past suffering. Boaz and Ruth go on to marry and have a son, Obed,
                  who becomes a forbearer of David and Christ, making Ruth, an outsider, essential to
                  both Jewish and Christian lineage.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in both Jewish and Christian theology, Ruth has been seen as an early, if
                  not <em>the</em> earliest, convert. But there is some ambiguity about just what she converted <em>to</em>: a family, a faith, an ethnic group, or something more like a nation? The ambiguity
                  is embedded in Ruth’s pledge to Naomi. The “ands” (“. . . I will go; <em>and</em> where thou lodgest . . . thy people shall be my people, <em>and</em> thy God my God”) simultaneously elide and distinguish between territory, family,
                  ethnicity, and religion. Because the Book of Ruth can be read at once as lauding and
                  exposing the uncertainty of religious conversion and national belonging, its narrative
                  resonated with nineteenth-century anxieties about Englishness and what Michael Ragussis
                  has termed its “culture of conversion,” one fixated on Jews (15–17). Increasingly,
                  writers, Christian and Jewish, employed the Book of Ruth as a lens through which to
                  examine not only gender and conversion, but immigration, national belonging, and Jewish
                  acceptance in modern England.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the works about Ruth I consider in this essay, these topics manifest themselves
                     in the emphasis (or notable lack thereof) on Ruth’s familial relationships and faith
                     in God, depictions of land and landscape, and conception of “home,” a frequently invoked
                     term intertwined with English domestic ideology <em>and</em> experiences of migration. I focus on Keats’s 
                     “Ode,”
                      then consider works that follow in its wake: Felicia Hemans’s and Thomas Hood’s poems
                     entitled 
                     “Ruth”
                      and sculptor John Adams-Acton’s 
                     “Ruth Amid the Alien Corn.”
                      I conclude with a reading of Anglo-Jewish writer Grace Aguilar’s exegesis of Ruth
                     in <em>The Women of Israel</em> (1886), which subtly fashions Ruth not just as a Moabite convert to Judaism but as
                     a Jewish immigrant in England. How might Keats’s revision of Ruth—one that reads her
                     against the grain, to use an apt harvest metaphor—elucidate Romantic dynamics of longing
                     and belonging? What does it mean to recast Ruth as an emblem of loneliness, in effect
                     as an out-of-place immigrant, at this moment in early nineteenth-century English culture?
                     I argue that Keats shaped a new representational tradition in which Ruth becomes a
                     figure of alienation and loss. In doing so, Keats departs from the Bible but aligns
                     with contemporaneous sympathies and anxieties about psychological, national, and religious
                     otherness. As Aguilar averred, “the women of the Bible are but mirrors of ourselves”
                     (8).

               <p>That nineteenth-century writers saw England as analogous to Ruth’s Bethlehem is supported
                  not only by the general view of England as a “new Israel” but by the specifics of
                  the imagery and language used in some texts and visual art. Take Scottish poet William
                  Tennant’s 
                  “Ruth and Naomi”
                  (1836), a poem reprinted in journals and anthologies for several decades. Tennant
                  concludes, </p>

               </blockquote>
               <p> This description echoes both the end of Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em> and that of “England’s mountains green” in William Blake’s <em>Milton</em>, which also contains the most famous iteration of England as a new Jerusalem. Blake
                  was likely the first figure associated with Romanticism to portray Ruth. In <em>Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion</em> (1804–1820), Blake includes “Ruth the Moabite” in the sacred “Maternal Line” (213).
                  He takes up Ruth in more detail in two captivating images, <a class="link_ref" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1795-William-Blake-Naomi-entreating-Ruth-Orpah.jpg">
                     “Naomi Entreating Ruth and Orpah to Return to the Land of Moab”
                     </a> (1795) and <a class="link_ref" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:William_Blake,_Ruth_the_Dutiful_Daughter-in-law,_1803_Southampton_Art_Gallery.jpg">
                     “Ruth the Dutiful Daughter-in-law”
                     </a> (1803). Both depict what Blake, in his <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>, deemed “the most pathetic passage in the Book of Ruth, where Naomi having taken
                  leave of her daughters in law, with intent to return to her own country; Ruth cannot
                  leave her, but says, ‘Whither thou goest [. . .]’” (549). Blake translates this passage
                  into a tableau of three figures at the moment of decision, Ruth clinging to Naomi
                  on the left and Orpah turning away on the right. “Naomi entreating . . .” offers a
                  sadder, gloomier take on the scene, with Naomi’s expression pained and Orpah bent
                  in grief. Blake’s second version of this scene, still somber, is more uplifting. Naomi’s
                  arms are literally raised up, Ruth no longer crouching. They embrace more naturally,
                  eye-to-eye, as if the image endorses their union. In both compositions, Ruth and Naomi
                  are offset by Orpah. She functions as Ruth’s mirror image, her body echoing Ruth’s
                  but traveling in the opposite direction, back towards Moab, towards the familiar past,
                  to accentuate Ruth’s movement towards the future.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Blake’s complex engagement with the Bible is well-covered, these images have
                     received scant critical attention. In this, they are typical of Romantic representations
                     of Ruth. Blake’s images are also typical—if anything in Blake’s idiosyncratic work
                     can be deemed typical—in emphasizing Ruth’s relationship with Naomi and the moment
                     of conversion and connection.

                     wife, mother, and/or ancestress of the Jewish and Christian people. Blake’s images
                     are certainly not “cheerful.” But their sorrow stems from Ruth’s fear of division
                     from Naomi; for nineteenth-century viewers who, raised on the King James Bible, all
                     knew what was coming, they contain the promise of Ruth’s future happiness in her soon-to-be-home
                     of Bethlehem.</p>
               </div>
               <p>With these iterations of Ruth in mind, I want to return to Keats, whose reference
                  to Ruth is likely the most famous in nineteenth-century literature. 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  is one of six odes now located at the heart of the Keats canon and the Romantic tradition.
                  Keats was twenty-four, two years before his death from tuberculosis, when he composed
                  the poem in the spring of 1819. 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale”
                  has been read as a meditation on poetry’s power and limitations, as well as its relationship
                  to music, represented by the nightingale’s “immortal” song (1ine 61). Also notable
                  is the poem’s attraction to erasure and escape, what Helen Vendler has termed “imaginative
                  self-annihilation,” all familiar Romantic concerns (102). In the stanza preceding
                  Ruth’s appearance, for example, Keats’s confides in the nightingale that </p>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> By the seventh stanza, Keats follows the nightingale’s song back in time: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               </blockquote>
               <p> Of all the religious and literary figures to select, why Ruth? Why “alien,” why the
                  tears? Scholars have tried to account for Keats’s decision in various ways. Barry
                  Gradman, for example, theorizes that, “while Keats here is speaking consciously of
                  Ruth, he may be thinking, unconsciously, of Cordelia in <em>King Lear</em>,” a link traced in part to their shared “filial piety” (16, 22)—despite the very
                  different sources, natures, and endings of their filial affection. Victor Lams hears
                  echoes of Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>. Most persuasive is Jeffrey Baker’s connection to Wordsworth’s 
                  “Solitary Reaper”
                  from 1807 (152). There are some notable resemblances that suggest Keats may have been
                  influenced in part by Wordsworth’s poem; in addition to referencing a nightingale,
                  
                  “Solitary Reaper”
                  features a woman “single in the field,” singing by herself a tune that haunts the
                  speaker in ways that foreshadow the melancholy music of Keats’s nightingale. However,
                  Wordsworth’s reaper is a generic “Highland lass,” a rural type rather than a specific
                  individual or character, let alone one as well-known as a popular biblical figure.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Keats himself provided no explanation for his incorporation of Ruth. His letters contain
                     only one reference to Ruth, but unrelated to the composition of 
                     “Ode to a Nightingale”
                     ; he deems her a “deep one,” presumably due to her strategic enticement, at Naomi’s
                     urging, of the sleeping Boaz on the threshing floor (
                     “Complete Works”
                      124–25). This letter only adds to the uncertainty of Keats’s poetic adaptation of
                     Ruth, since in the poem she seems neither sensual nor sly, neither marriageable nor
                     manipulative. To the extent that Keats would have viewed Ruth in relation to the Hebrew
                     Bible, Judaism, and/or Jews, we can examine his letters on these topics; they include
                     a few references to connections with and a few disparaging jibes at Anglo-Jews. For
                     instance, in a letter from the same year as 
                     “Ode,”
                      he remarked, “I hope I have learned a little better and . . . am confident to cheat
                     as well as any literary Jew of the Market and shine up an article on any thing without
                     much knowledge of the subject” (95).

                              and Georgiana, in which he describes going to a chapel built by “a great Jew converter”
                              who has spent lots of money on “a great number of poor Jews.” Keats adds that “of
                              course his communion plate was stolen” and that the “converter” spoke to his [presumably
                              Jewish] clerk, who apologized and said, “‘I dare shay, your honor, it’s among ush’”
                              (26). According to Andrew Motion, Keats’s mother may have lived with a Jewish man
                              named Abraham after his father’s death, while Fanny Brawn married a Sephardic Jew
                              after Kea…</span></div>
                     </div> This casual, depressingly familiar type of comment suggests Keats’s skepticism about
                     the sincerity of Anglo-Jewish writers (note the way Jewish writers are figures of
                     “the Market” rather than of the mind) but does little to illuminate his overarching
                     opinions about Anglo-Jews, immigrants, or the Book of Ruth in this context. Thus,
                     it is impossible to ascertain definitively what Keats was thinking when he selected
                     Ruth for 
                     “Ode to a Nightingale.”
                     </p>
               </div>
               <p>But the poem’s language, imbued with its historical context, can help us arrive at
                  a better understanding of how Keats’s Ruth functions in the poem and might have resonated
                  with his readers as an outcast, a psychological other. To fully understand Keats’s
                  startling revision of Ruth, we must recognize the way the poem links her not <em>just</em> to a universal, ahistorical sadness but <em>also</em> to contemporaneous socio-political discussions about territory, immigration, and
                  national belonging. Particularly revealing are the phrases “sick for home” and “alien
                  corn,” the latter of which presents an especially original, memorable juxtaposition.
                  These phrases evoke early nineteenth-century debates about whether foreigners, and
                  Jews specifically, could join an Englishness that sometimes saw them as—and sometimes
                  itself seemed— “alien.” Assessing the place of representations of Jews and Judaism
                  in Romantic culture, Judith Page maintains that they “test the Romantic faith in the
                  efficacy of sympathetic imagination and its implied ideal of an inclusive community”
                  (xii). Keats’s Ruth, who calls forth the readers’ sympathies precisely because of
                  her marginality, her sense of being cut off from her homeland, reinforces this analysis.
                  Keats extends his sympathetic imagination to Ruth by contemplating what it might feel
                  like to be a foreigner away from one’s original home, and does so in part by granting
                  <em>her</em> a sympathetic imagination, one capable of memory and desire.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Fittingly, the stanza featuring Ruth illustrates how the nightingale’s song can transcend
                     the categories of time, nation, and class that structured early nineteenth-century
                     English society. The poem tracks the song “[t]hrough . . . winding mossy ways,” back
                     to the “ancient days” when it might have been heard by “emperor and clown.” The generality
                     of these terms makes the arrival in the next lines of Ruth (the only specific character
                     mentioned in the poem) all the more striking. Keats may have heard the same song as
                     emperor and clown, but it is with Ruth that he feels a special kinship. From the ode’s
                     opening confessional declaration—“My heart aches” (1) —Keats lays the groundwork for
                     the parallel between Ruth’s “sad heart” and his own, transforming her into a figure
                     of emotional struggle and estrangement.

                              Karla Alwes briefly analyzes Ruth in similar, ahistorical terms as “a wanderer and
                              stranger” for whom “earth holds no solace” but does not note the significant departure
                              this constitutes from the biblical account of Ruth, whose solace arguably derives
                              in part through her gleaning from the earth’s bounty (125).</span></div>
                     </div>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>But again, if Keats was looking for a literary or biblical figure symbolizing sorrow,
                  surely there are more obvious choices. In the Bible, by the time she is gleaning,
                  Ruth has already <em>voluntarily</em> pledged herself to this new land and people; while not yet married to Boaz, she is
                  taking the first steps towards securing the happy ending: a successful marriage plot,
                  to put it in nineteenth-century terms. The contrast between a more typical rendering
                  of Ruth and Keats’s version can be illustrated by returning briefly to Tennant’s poem
                  (published a few years after Keats’s but characteristic in its depiction of Ruth).
                  Tennant’s version opens with Naomi telling her daughters-in-law to return home. <em>Naomi</em>, not Ruth, is the one who is “broken and forlorn” and “sick of heart” (6, 8); the
                  phrase “lorn and sick of heart” becomes a kind of refrain, Naomi’s epithet. Following
                  the biblical verses, Ruth and Orpah shed tears with Naomi at the thought of parting,
                  but Orpah returns to Moab while Ruth vows to join Naomi as her comforter, preparing
                  “sweet solace” (42) for her as they take their way to Bethlehem. As I noted at the
                  start, this trajectory is presented in muted but optimistic tones, rising literally
                  and figuratively with the poem’s final phrase: “green ascent.”</p>
               <p>In contrast, there is no green ascent, no hopeful progress or welcomed familial inclusion
                  for Ruth in 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale.”
                  By the next stanza, the poem’s last, Ruth has also been cut off from Keats, or rather
                  Keats has been cut off from her. The “forlorn” at the end of the Ruth stanza is repeated
                  at the next stanza’s start. Keats is left with his “sole self” (72), a phrase underlining
                  his aloneness, since by definition the self is one’s own. We might say he has been
                  alienated from his fellow aliens. In fact, Keats excises all the other figures from
                  the biblical story: his Ruth is neither daughter-in-law, wife/widow, vulnerable supplicant/youthful
                  seductress, nor new wife/mother. Instead, she floats free from the Book of Ruth’s
                  plot, almost as if she has been dropped into the poem’s dreamscape of “alien corn,”
                  emphasizing the disconnect between Ruth and the land.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The only part of the Bible story that remains is her status as “a stranger,” though
                     her attitude towards that status is quite different. Moab is unnamed, but presumably
                     it is the “home” for which she longs. It’s as if Keats’s Ruth has a touch of Orpah
                     in her, a reluctance to leave what Keats implies was her true country. The description
                     of Ruth raises the question: can one actually be “sick” for home? The concept of homesickness
                     or nostalgia was comparatively new, emerging in the mid-1700s among soldiers, travelers,
                     and immigrants in an increasingly mobile European society; starting with Swiss doctor
                     Johannes Hofer in the late 1680s, it was thought to be an actual, physiological disease—meaning
                     one could literally be “sick for home.”

                     In any case, Keats creates a Ruth who is out of place, nostalgic for her lost country.
                     He implicitly adopts the immigrant condition as a symbol of his own dislocation and
                     emotional exile. In doing so, he modifies the pattern of Shelley, Coleridge, and Wordsworth,
                     all of whom at some point appropriated the figure of the Wandering Jew to embody a
                     broader or more personal sense of restless estrangement from normative English life.

               <p>The Book of Ruth, Adele Berlin asserts, is about “the continuity of the people and
                  its land” (260), from exile and return, to customs governing harvest and land inheritance.
                  Similarly, J. Hillis Miller sees the Book as a “story . . . organized around the crossing
                  of borders and the establishment of territorial rights” (217). In 
                  “The Politics of Gleaning in Keats,”
                  Andrew Bennett elucidates an aspect of these territorial rights relevant to Keats’s
                  cultural moment. Bennett explains that in 1818, due to new laws governing enclosures
                  that restricted access to land previously available for harvest, the “the very concept
                  of the gleaner underwent a sea-change—from the archetypal beneficiary of charity to
                  a criminal . . .” (34–38). Building on Bennett’s analysis of those excluded from the
                  bounty of English land, I want to add another implication of “alien corn.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In early nineteenth-century culture, the term “alien” was one with dual registers.
                     There is the <em>emotional</em> alienation associated with Romantic poets and that we have already seen at work in
                     Keats’s poem (“do I wake or sleep?”). But there is also a <em>national</em> meaning of “alien”: an immigrant or outsider from Englishness. “Alien” did not refer
                     to Jews only, yet the term was regularly used to describe them and surfaced often
                     in deliberations over their legal and cultural status. From the so-called “Jew Bill”
                     of 1753 to the Aliens Act and creation of the Aliens Office in 1793, and early efforts
                     at Jewish emancipation, Keats was writing during a period in which there was a proliferation
                     of parliamentary speeches, sermons, novels, and articles about whether Jews belonged
                     in England (which had only allowed them back under Cromwell in 1656), whether they
                     could or must convert to Protestantism, and whether they deserved “alien” status.
                     Examples range from texts as different as <em>Reports on the diseases in London: particularly during the years 1796–1800</em> (“I have seen [the disease ‘lethargy’] mostly in Jews and other aliens of a dark,
                     swarthy complexion” [Willan 277]) to the 1810 article 
                     “Progress and Practice of the Jews in England”
                      (“the Jews, in the eye of the Common Law, were always looked upon as Aliens; neither
                     natural-born subjects, nor capable of being naturalized; but to remain perpetual Aliens”
                     [Lemoine 18]). Within a decade after the publication of 
                     “Ode to a Nightingale,”
                      during Parliamentary deliberations over the proposal for the Removal of Jewish Disabilities,
                     Robert Peel would endorse the view that “The Jew . . . is regarded in the light of
                     an alien—he is excluded because he will not amalgamate with us in any of his usages
                     or habits.” In contrast, Thomas Macaulay would reject the logic that Jews “cannot
                     be made Englishmen altogether. The statesman who treats them as aliens, and then abuses
                     them for not entertaining all the feelings of natives, is as unreasonable as the tyrant
                     who punished their fathers for not making bricks without straw” (150).

                              being used to deport “suspicious” Jewish peddlers (Endelman 276). Although they do

                     in the fields of ancient Bethlehem and early nineteenth-century England, a convert
                     to (proto) Judaism in the Bible and as a Jewish immigrant to modern England.</p>

                     disturbing account of the fatal hybridity of a young Englishman who discovers his
                     Jewish roots—is subtler in its debts to Keats and beyond the historical scope of this
                     essay.

                     </div> But Adams-Acton’s Ruth is directly mediated by Keats’s poem; the line “Ruth, when,
                     sick for home, she stood in tears amid the alien corn” is engraved at the bottom of
                     the pedestal upon which she stands. Even without the quotation, this Ruth captures
                     a Keatsian sorrow and isolation in marble. She stands, leaning on one hip, knee slightly
                     bent, head down. She looks as if she has fallen into an unhappy memory, having ceased
                     the gleaning indicated by the sheaves of wheat at her side. Her youthful face and
                     despondent pose radiate homesickness, while her unclothed torso adds an element of
                     eroticism, making her a figure of sympathy and sexual appeal.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Perhaps Adams-Acton was thinking, too, of Thomas Hood’s poem 
                  “Ruth”
                  (1827), which eyes Ruth through the desirous gaze of Boaz, the poem’s speaker. Hood
                  moved in similar circles to and was deeply influenced by Keats in his serious verse,
                  including his 
                  “Ruth,”
                  published eight years after Keats’s 
                  “Ode”
                  (Whitley 39). Like Keats, Hood envisions Ruth not with Naomi, but in the fields: “Thus
                  she stood amid the stooks . . .” (15). Yet the similarities end here. Boaz paints
                  Ruth as both sexually fertile (“she stood breast high amid the corn” [l.1], her skin
                  is “ripened” and has the “glowing kiss” of the sun [6, 4]), and domestically devoted
                  (“Praising God with sweetest looks” [16]). The poem concludes by offering an implicit
                  alternative to Keats’s “homesick,” alienated Ruth. Boaz’s final line offers to “share
                  my harvest and my home” (20). The alliterative linkage between “harvest” and “home”
                  underscores the biblical narrative of Ruth’s integration into a new “home” through
                  immigration and intermarriage. Her gleaning—and Boaz’s willingness to share—analogizes
                  the view of immigrants as welcomed to the fruits of the land.</p>
               <p>The most interesting, in my view, of the texts resembling Keats’s 
                  “Ode”
                  is Felicia Hemans’s sonnet 
                  “Ruth”
                  from her late collection <em>Female Characters of Scripture: A Series of Sonnets</em> (1833, 1834). The most famous poet of the era, Hemans was “met with immediate and
                  extensive popularity,” according to one Victorian critic (qtd. in Wolfson 602–3);
                  her best-known poems became “virtual national anthems” (Wolfson xiii). Over the past
                  two decades, scholars have reassessed Hemans’s ambiguous place within the (traditionally
                  masculine) Romantic literary landscape—including whether she should be seen as Romantic
                  at all or rather as an early Victorian—and debated her constructions of gender, nationalism,
                  and empire (Leighton 2, Cronin 67–109). Throughout her poetry, themes of motherhood,
                  faith, “feminine” subservience and yet also female self-expression predominate. Her
                  work might be said, drawing on titles to two of her collections, to offer <em>Records of Woman</em> with a particular, if not untroubled, focus on championing <em>Domestic Affections</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Despite such engagement with domesticity and gendered spirituality, Hemans’s late
                     work on biblical women has garnered relatively little attention, her portrayal of 
                     “Ruth”
                      even less. (For instance, accomplished recent readings of Hemans’s work by Wolfson,
                     Angela Leighton, Jason Rudy and others do not discuss these sonnets at all.) There
                     are a few helpful exceptions. In 
                     “Glorification of the Lowly in Felicia Hemans’ Sonnets ‘Female Characters of Scripture’,”
                      Anne Nichols laments the overlooking of Hemans’s late religious works in part because
                     they capture “the ambivalence [Hemans] and many of her contemporaries held towards
                     the position of women,” ultimately employing biblical figures to “broad[en] standard
                     definitions of acceptable femininity” (559, 574). Others have noted the sonnets’ “contradictory
                     combination of the emancipatory and the conservative,” concluding that the collection
                     is more gender-flexible than readers might expect (Mason and Roberts 73).

                     “Ruth”
                      is one of fifteen sonnets in <em>Female Characters of Scripture</em>, first published in <em>Blackwood’s</em> in 1833. The collection was initially divided into two sections: one featured Old
                     Testament 
                     “Daughters of Judah,”
                      from Miriam and Ruth to Rizpah and the Shunamite woman; the other focused on New Testament
                     figures such as Mary, Mary Magdalene, and the 
                     “Penitent Anointing Christ’s Feet.”
                      That Hemans (who earlier published 
                     “The Hebrew Mother”
                     ) frames Ruth with the Hebrew Bible suggests she views Ruth in a specifically Jewish
                     but also a typologically-driven “Judeo-Christian” context.

                     </div> The collection opens with a bifurcated invocation. The first part summons “the gracious
                     Forms” of Old Testament women, with their “dark prophetic Eastern eyes,” to return
                     and “renew” contemporary England (597)—a figurative, poetic immigration of sorts.
                     The second part shifts to New Testament women, who are praised not for their “prophetic”
                     power but for their “heart subdued” (597). The first sonnet, a tribute to Miriam,
                     provides the clearest championing of female poetic skill (Melnyk 74). However, 
                     “Ruth,”
                      the second sonnet, retreats from that “prophetic” vision, resting Ruth’s appeal on
                     her “calm heart” and “gentle eye.” I cite the sonnet in full: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">

                     Ruth’s gentleness and devotion are prominent, particularly her devotion to God. Hemans
                     repurposes the best-known part of Ruth’s pledge as the sonnet’s final line, emphasizing
                     its import with the couplet’s rhyme (“tone”/“own”). (Weaving the language of the Bible
                     directly into verse was a common strategy in poetic representations of biblical figures
                     at this time.)</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Yet the “image” of Ruth that is “brought back” to Hemans, I argue, derives more from
                     Keats than the King James.

                              sonnet on Keats, but she read widely in the literature of the period, was personally
                              friendly with Wordsworth, Shelley, and other Romantic poets, and also seems to echo
                              Keats in other poems; Gary Kelly, for instance, notes the resemblance between a passage
                              in Keats’s

                              the similarities of language and approach in the texts themselves constitute sufficient
                              evidence to support this reading. Even …</span></div>

                      here: corn, bird, tears, weariness, the Romantic atmospherics of “dreamy motion fann’d.”
                     Both poets approach Ruth from the perspective of the lyric <em>I</em> rather than a detached third-person observer or Ruth herself. Nor do they write from
                     the position of another figure from the story, as Hood does with Boaz. In fact, Boaz
                     and Naomi are notably absent from Hemans’s adaptation just as they are from Keats’s
                     (technically Naomi is implied by “thy,” but the referent is never made explicit).
                     In Hemans, the speaker seems almost to be re-living an experience of witnessing Ruth
                     in the fields at harvest time: “I see thee stand / Lone, midst the gladness of the
                     harvest-band,” the speaker recounts. Whether this “I” is part of the “harvest-band,”
                     a detached observer, or perhaps Hemans herself is unclear. But it is the Romantic
                     affiliation with Ruth’s marginalized condition and the implicit testament to the power
                     of imagination to call it forth from personal or cultural memory that is central.</p>

               <p>As this reference to Ruth’s loneliness indicates, the resemblance to Keats is most
                  significant in the way Hemans, too, fashions a sympathetically isolated Ruth. The
                  poem ostensibly argues for the <em>lack</em> of regret Ruth feels having chosen her new family and faith in Bethlehem: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="indent4">and if thy gentle eyes</div>
                     <div class="indent1">Gleam tremulous through tears, ’tis not to rue</div>
                     <div class="l">Those words, immortal in their deep love’s tone,</div>
                     <div class="l"><em>“Thy people and thy God shall be mine own!”</em> (598)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> In other words, Hemans implies that Ruth’s nostalgic sorrow for her people and her
                  nation (“fatherland”) is exceeded by her religious faith.</p>
               <p>Yet the poem’s muted tone and repetition of Ruth’s solitude run counter to this argument.
                  There is something insistent and almost monitory in “’tis not to rue,” as if the speaker
                  is trying to convince Ruth, readers, and herself that Ruth has no second thoughts.
                  The “forlornness” of the epithet “O forlorn / Yet not forsaken Ruth!” lingers on.
                  In fact, “forlorn” lingers from Keats, who uses the word twice in 
                  “Ode to a Nightingale.”
                  Hemans paints Ruth “lone, as a wood-bird” allied with nature rather than the surrounding
                  people. Even within nature, Hemans describes Ruth as a bird in the wrong natural space—a
                  wood-bird stranded, fatally, over the ocean. (The brutality of “fall’n in its weariness”
                  can be missed upon first reading—“perilous seas” indeed.) Hemans further isolates
                  Ruth “lone, midst the gladness of the harvest-band.” She is cut off from the comfort
                  of both nature <em>and</em> culture; the “harvest-band” in Bethlehem is rejoicing without her and Moab is “smil[ing]
                  far away!” Again, it is worth noting this puzzling departure from the Book of Ruth,
                  in which Moab is not depicted sentimentally. No substantive details about the land
                  are provided, aside from the fact that this is where Naomi’s husband and two sons
                  die. Ruth herself never looks homeward or signals any doubts about her decision. Instead,
                  she repeatedly expresses gratitude for the kindness shown to her as “a Moabitish damsel”
                  in this new land of promise and plenty (Ruth 2.6).</p>
               <p>The alienation of Hemans’s Ruth is mitigated by the poem’s reliance on the gendered
                  trope of home. Hemans’s investment in home, Deborah Kennedy argues, should not be
                  read as merely a sign of “conventional domesticity. If we only view the word ‘home’
                  as an encoded term for the oppression of women, then we deprive it of a complex of
                  significations” (281–2). (Kennedy does not address 
                  “Ruth”
                  but her analysis of home in Hemans’s oeuvre can apply to <em>Female Characters of Scripture</em>.) 
                  “Ruth”
                  implies that its protagonist, despite mourning her homeland, has forged a more valuable,
                  transportable version of home. “Home” is contained in the feminine “affectionate .
                  . . glance” rather than a physical space. This notion of “home” embodied, literally,
                  in women’s bodies offers some measure of control and “calm” in an unpredictable world.</p>
               <p>But the notion that home can be constructed out of woman’s love and embodied affection
                  is undercut by the ultimate aloneness and loneliness of Hemans’s Ruth. If “home” resides
                  in a woman’s glance, who will actually look into Ruth’s “gleam[ing]” eyes? Who will
                  “recognise” Ruth’s “pure” love? Emma Mason and Jonathan Roberts read the absence of
                  male biblical figures in the sonnet collection as a strategy Hemans employs to redistribute
                  narrative power to women (72). This rings true for Hemans’s account of Miriam, and
                  might make sense in terms of leaving out Boaz, or even Obed. But what about Naomi?
                  Would not the poem’s articulation of female influence through shared affection be
                  more powerful if Ruth had someone with whom she could share it? The biblical text
                  as well as the many visual representations of Ruth provided a range of representational
                  strategies embodying Ruth’s inclusion. By choosing to focus on Ruth weeping rather
                  than entwined with Naomi, Boaz, or Obed, Keats and Hemans rewrite Ruth’s defining
                  characteristics as loneliness, alienation, and nostalgia. </p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The last text in this essay’s lineage of Ruths is Grace Aguilar’s 
                     “Women of Israel”
                      (1844). Aguilar is a fitting writer with whom to conclude because she was indebted
                     to Romanticism’s language of feeling, particularly Hemans’s narratives of domesticity
                     and spirituality (Galchinsky 373); like Keats, Hood, and Hemans, her understanding
                     of Ruth pivoted on conceptions of home as domestic and national space. Yet she offers
                     a distinctive Anglo-Jewish rebuttal to the construction of an alienated Ruth. “No
                     Jewish female author has attained the . . . well-deserved popularity achieved by Grace
                     Aguilar,” <em>The Jewish Chronicle</em> declared: “Her numerous literary productions have been read and appreciated in England,
                     America, Germany, and France. Her <em>Women of Israel</em> . . . is a book teeming with powerful lessons to her own sex and eloquent exhortation
                     to the opposite sex” (qtd. in <em>Cyclopædia</em> 69). The foundational lesson Aguilar imparts is not just the value of Jewish women
                     in biblical history, something she thinks has been overlooked both in the patriarchal
                     Jewish exegetical tradition and the Protestant mythologizing of Jewish women, but
                     their striking relevance. She follows Hemans’s lead to consider how “female characters
                     of scripture” might serve as “warning” and “example” for nineteenth-century women,
                     Anglo-Jewish women in particular (7). As “mirrors of ourselves” (14), the Women of
                     Israel refract nineteenth-century concerns about the compatibility of Englishness
                     and Jewishness. This is particularly marked in Aguilar’s reading of Ruth. Part literary

                              I briefly explore Aguilar’s depiction of Ruth in

                     </div> her chapter on the Book of Ruth begins: <span class="quote">‘We now come to a portion of our history as women of Israel which from the loveliness
                        of female character that it displays, has in neither history nor romance been equaled.
                        In the Bible it is termed the book of Ruth; but as Ruth does not properly belong by
                        birth and ancestry to the women of Israel, Naomi must be the subject of our consideration.
                        With her history, however, Ruth is so entwined that we cannot reflect on the one without
                        also pausing on the touching beauty of the other. (223) ’</span> This seemingly perfunctory introduction, with its familiar gendered praise, perfectly
                     captures the paradox of Ruth’s belonging: on the one hand, Aguilar claims that she
                     “does not properly belong,” a belonging predicated on lineage and ethnicity that cannot
                     be erased even after conversion, marriage, or immigration. With its vaguely coercive
                     “must,” the passage redirects our attention to Naomi. On the other hand, Aguilar recognizes
                     that Ruth is “so entwined” with Jews, that it’s impossible to ignore her. Nor, it
                     seems as the chapter progresses, does Aguilar want to.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In fact, what makes Aguilar’s interpretation of Ruth so interesting—on its own terms
                  and in light of the trajectory of Ruths previously surveyed—is how it subtly inverts
                  the original story, aligning the non-Jewish Ruth with Victorian Jews and the Jewish
                  Naomi with Protestant England. This inversion is evident in Aguilar’s repeated emphasis
                  on Ruth’s <em>choosing</em> to become a Jew, which makes her “as worthy if not even more so to be the ancestress
                  of David than the lineal descendants of Abraham” (236). Aguilar writes: <span class="quote">‘When Ruth resigned alike home, parents, and the gods of her youth, she voluntarily
                     engrafted herself upon the children of God . . . her acceptance of, and obedience
                     to, the Law were entirely <em>voluntary</em> not merely received from education and as heritage. (235)’</span> In this reading, Anglo-Jews are like Ruth in that they (or their ancestors) voluntarily
                  chose to move to England and accept English laws and habits; thus they could be viewed
                  as not only equal but more worthy of Englishness than those who have “merely” inherited
                  it.</p>
               <p>To a writer who articulated her frustration that in England “Jews are still considered
                  aliens and foreigners” and thus “separated . . . from sympathy and fellowship” (Aguilar,
                  
                  “History”
                  332), Keats’s version of Ruth in the “alien corn” might have struck a discordant note.
                  Yet Aguilar’s reading of Ruth likewise meditates upon what Ruth might have remembered
                  about her past and whether true belonging in a new land is possible. Aguilar is clear
                  that Ruth has not forgotten—“We never find Ruth forgetting her origin” (244), we are
                  reassured—but she differentiates between forgetting and nostalgizing. By privileging
                  choice and faith over blood and race, Aguilar attempts to transform the potentially
                  unsettling fact that Ruth continues to be seen as simultaneously Israelite and Moabite
                  into a model for Anglo-Jews to be both English and Jewish. Her Ruth preserves a degree
                  of difference, yet is emphatically part of the national family. In Bethlehem/England,
                  she is not “sick for home”: she <em>is</em> home.</p>
               <p>In situating Aguilar in an artistic lineage—a “maternal line”?—of Ruths, my aim has
                  been to demonstrate that such Romantic adaptations of Ruth were in conversation with
                  each other, conversations that crossed medium and genre. Moreover, I hope to have
                  demonstrated that such works were also in conversation with fundamental nineteenth-century
                  cultural concerns not often seen as relevant to the seemingly “cheerful,” pastoral
                  idyll of the Book of Ruth. Without registering the backdrop of British desires and
                  anxieties about forms of alienation, belonging, and belief, we risk missing what made
                  Ruth both so popular and so meaningful. For it is not despite but precisely <em>because</em> there is a debate about whether Ruth “does not properly belong” that she is so “entwined”
                  with—indeed, so at home in—the nineteenth-century cultural imagination.</p>

               “The Bride from a Strange Land”
               (58). Eve Stoddard’s <em>A Genealogy of Ruths: From Alien Harvester to Fallen Woman in Nineteenth-Century England</em> is the only other attempt to assess Ruth as a nineteenth-century figure I have encountered.
               Stoddard focuses on echoes of Ruth in poems about harvesting that do not mention the
               Book of Ruth. She also hears echoes of the biblical Ruth in Elizabeth Gaskell’s <em>Ruth</em> and Wordsworth’s poem of an abandoned, mad young woman named Ruth, leading Stoddard
               to argue for connections between the biblical story and female fallenness (though
               she admits that the connection is “somewhat tenuous and ironic” in Wordsworth’s case
               (53)). While very interesting, these biblical echoes are somewhat faint.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               and Georgiana, in which he describes going to a chapel built by “a great Jew converter”
               who has spent lots of money on “a great number of poor Jews.” Keats adds that “of
               course his communion plate was stolen” and that the “converter” spoke to his [presumably
               Jewish] clerk, who apologized and said, “‘I dare shay, your honor, it’s among ush’”
               (26). According to Andrew Motion, Keats’s mother may have lived with a Jewish man
               named Abraham after his father’s death, while Fanny Brawn married a Sephardic Jew
               after Keats’s death (32, 568).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>Imagination Transformed: the Evolution of the Female Character in Keats’s Poetry</em>, Karla Alwes briefly analyzes Ruth in similar, ahistorical terms as “a wanderer and
               stranger” for whom “earth holds no solace” but does not note the significant departure
               this constitutes from the biblical account of Ruth, whose solace arguably derives
               in part through her gleaning from the earth’s bounty (125).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “The Wandering Jew”
               (c. 1809), and Coleridge’s 
               “Rime of the Ancient Mariner”

               “Jewish Civil Disabilities”
               (1829). The Aliens Act of 1793 also continued to have implications for Jews, occasionally
               being used to deport “suspicious” Jewish peddlers (Endelman 276). Although they do
               not address Ruth in Keats, Hemans, or Aguilar, Sheila Spector’s two edited collections
               of work on British Romanticism and Jews offer helpful overviews of the way Jews informed
               and were informed by Romanticism and English politics between the defeat of the “Jew

               “Glorification of the Lowly in Felicia Hemans’ Sonnets ‘Female Characters of Scripture”
               (559, 574). Nichols offers a rare reading of Hemans’s 
               “Ruth,”
               one that emphasizes her domesticity and her progress from “lowly” to “exalted” in
               ways that typologically align with Hemans’s representations of New Testament women.

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">There is, to my knowledge, no direct documentary evidence that Hemans modeled her
               sonnet on Keats, but she read widely in the literature of the period, was personally
               friendly with Wordsworth, Shelley, and other Romantic poets, and also seems to echo
               Keats in other poems; Gary Kelly, for instance, notes the resemblance between a passage
               in Keats’s 
               “Ode on a Grecian Urn”
               and one of Hemans’s in <em>Forest Sanctuary</em> (<em>Felicia Hemans</em> 233n1). Ultimately, I think the similarities of language and approach in the texts
               themselves constitute sufficient evidence to support this reading. Even if Hemans
               did not know 
               “Ode to a Nightingale,”
               her sonnet would still buttress my thesis that there was a cultural shift towards
               representing Ruth as alienated and homesick.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
