                <p rend="noCount">Nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish literature engages a wide range of
                    thematic and aesthetic preoccupations. This volume brings together several
                    essays that highlight such breadth, even as the essays converge upon several
                    questions that recur consistently throughout this literature: what does it mean
                    to advertise one’s subjectivity, especially where the expression of such
                    subjectivity is inflected by aesthetic and formalist concerns that are
                    historically connected to English nationalism? Such questions are especially
                    relevant when considered alongside the historical context: Jews in England did
                    not achieve political emancipation until 1858, and they were widely regarded as
                    racially other for much of the century. Jewish writers do not answer such
                    questions with one voice; however, their political and cultural contexts put
                    pressure on their aesthetic choices, and we explore these choices in the essays
                    that follow.</p>

                <p> This <title level="j">Praxis</title> volume brings together essays about
                    Anglo-Jewish culture of the nineteenth century. This simple description,
                    however, belies some significant problems in classification, and indeed, it is
                    this very complexity about classification that unites these essays. For the very
                    meaning of “Anglo-Jewish” is no less conflicted than the definition of
                    “culture.” Indeed, we may well ask: who qualifies for the designation of
                    “Anglo-Jewish”? Does the hyphen always apply to English writers who happen to be
                    born as Jews? What if they do not directly or explicitly explore Jewish themes
                    in their works, or if they do not explicitly self-identify as Jews or maintain
                    any semblance of direct Jewish communal life? When mainstream authors engage
                    themes with pronounced Jewish inflections, are they participating in a
                    burgeoning Jewish culture? And what counts as a “Jewish inflection” in the first
                    place? All of the essays in this volume engage the complexity of this delicate
                    process of self-identification, and indeed of communal identification. The field
                    of Anglo-Jewish nineteenth-century literature has been gaining traction of late,
                    and the time has come to explore authors and subjects that sometimes skirt the
                    margins of the field. </p>
                <p> The questions about Jews and nineteenth-century literature are essentially
                    questions about Romanticism and modernity. As such, these essays span such
                    topics as aesthetic form and Jewish cultural inheritance; experimentation with
                    narrative structure in novels and fictional prose; ethics and morality; and
                    theories of cultural, religious, and aesthetic inheritance. What we call “Jewish
                    cultural inheritance,” however, is not reducible to a totalizing definition, and
                    it is perhaps for this very reason that the study of Anglo-Jewish culture throws
                    into sharp relief some of the most pressing questions relevant to the very
                    intricate nineteenth century more generally: how do we define our cultural
                    inheritance, and what is at stake in so doing? How far can we go in designating
                    literary or cultural “influence” without falling prey to oversimplifications
                    about cultural transmission? How do we demarcate and circumscribe our selective
                    attention in defining the shifting boundaries of center and margin? To what
                    degree do racial, ethnic, and religious categories inflect inherited aesthetic
                    norms? When Meri-Jane Rochelson, for example, examines a later
                    nineteenth-century novel set in Romantic-era England, its analytic yield
                    includes clarity about social criticism whose provenance&#8212;and
                    influence&#8212;spans centuries and cultures. All the same, <title level="m">The
                        King of Schnorrers</title> (1894), the novel by Israel Zangwill that she
                    subjects to such multi-faceted scrutiny, begins with a satiric overview of a
                    setting that heralds a very knowing Jewish narrator: “In the days when Lord
                    George Gordon became a Jew, and was suspected of insanity; when, out of respect
                    for the prophecies, England denied her Jews every civic right except that of
                    paying taxes . . .” (1). </p>
                <p> What were those “civic right[s] except that of paying taxes” which the Jews of
                    the era were denied?<note place="foot" resp="author"> The next five paragraphs,

                            1714–1830</title>, especially chapter 4.</note> As Jewish numbers
                    increased through the nineteenth century, agitation for relief from the Jewish
                    civil and political disabilities became an increasingly public concern. These
                    included, among other disabilities, an inability to vote or to trade in the City
                    and on the Exchange, and exclusion from membership in Parliament. Jews could not
                    officially own freehold land, but since law tended to follow precedent in the
                    matter of Jewish disabilities, and since some wealthy Jews in England did indeed
                    hold land, this restriction was abandoned in the 1840s. In the early part of the
                    nineteenth century, Jews were excluded from most professions and corporations,
                    since they required swearing allegiance to the articles of the Church of
                    England.</p>
                <p>These disabilities notwithstanding, British Jews in the nineteenth century tended
                    to recognize England as a land that had granted them freedom, and political and
                    social refuge. After all, the Portuguese Inquisition, from which many Jews fled
                    to England, was not disbanded until 1821. The characteristic stance of British
                    Jews throughout the nineteenth century was one of gratitude for safe haven, even
                    when they acknowledged the significance of their restrictions, one of which was
                    represented by their exclusion from study and later from fellowship at England's
                    ancient universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, a condition that was not
                    remedied until 1871 with the passage of the Universities Tests Act. </p>
                <p> The Jewish civil disabilities are by no means the sole defining or even the most
                    important context for Jews in the nineteenth century. Especially in comparison
                    with most of their coreligionists on the continent, English Jews occupied an
                    enviable position of wellbeing. For England, national Christianity was defined
                    by the Church of England. Penal law had enacted civil disabilities against
                    Protestant Nonconformists and Catholics in the seventeenth century with the goal
                    of ensuring that municipal, civil, or military office be held only by members of
                    the Church of England. In 1828 Parliament easily passed the Sacramental Test
                    Act, which repealed the Test and Corporation Acts for Nonconformists.<note

                    received emancipation in 1829 with the passage of the Catholic Relief Act. This
                    left only the Jews still subject to the civil disabilities. Oaths “on the true
                    faith of a Christian” were still mandatory. When the Jewish Relief Bill of 1830
                    failed to pass Parliament, the Jews, as Michael Clark observes, “were now no
                    longer part of a broad excluded group but a deliberately stigmatized community;
                    the only politically disadvantaged minority in Britain” (31). One of the Jewish
                    community's leaders, Francis Goldsmid, referred to the bill's failure as a
                    “badge of dishonour” (34). </p>
                <p> The invective raised against Jews whenever their statutory rights were addressed
                    tended to be registered as invective against Jews as Jews, not simply as persons
                    who subscribe to a faith other than the Church of England. The condition of the
                    Jews in England, that is, was not analogous to that of Nonconformists or
                    Catholics. Indeed, the subject of nationalism for British Jewish subjects was
                    never an elementary affair. An earlier controversy also bears relevance to this
                    history. I refer to the Jewish Naturalization Bill of 1753, the so-called “Jew
                    Bill” that was in fact repealed almost immediately after it was passed. It
                    produced one of the most fiery political clamors of the eighteenth century, and
                    some of its resonances were felt into the nineteenth century. The Jew Bill
                    sought to change the constitutional requirements that would grant Parliament the
                    right to confer naturalization for professing Jews; this process could only have
                    been granted, however, through a private act of Parliament, an expensive and
                    inevitably rare prospective occurrence.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See

                    and religious clamor of the eighteenth century. It was quickly repealed before
                    ever once being resorted to, and still its tremors raged. Eventually the storm
                    died down, with very little real political fallout.</p>
                <p>The storm may well have died down, but it remained a point of reference for Jews
                    even a century later. As Todd Endelman describes it, <quote> . . . opponents of
                        the act resurrected crude medieval libels and made extravagant claims about
                        the consequences of the legislation. Britain would be swamped with
                        unscrupulous brokers, jobbers, and moneylenders, who would use their
                        ill-gotten gains to acquire the estates of ruined landowners. Moreover,
                        because dominion followed property, Jews would control Parliament (which
                        would be re-named the Sanhedrin), convert St. Paul's to a synagogue,
                        circumcise their tenants, and perpetrate countless other anti-Christian
                        crimes. (<title level="m">Jews of Britain</title> 75) </quote> England may
                    well have been enjoying a time of relative tranquility in the eighteenth
                    century, but a noisy, reactive din presented itself in the 1750s when it was
                    presumed that the Jew could present himself for citizenship. While the
                    nineteenth century did realize some significant gains in the acceptance of Jews
                    as part of the British polity, Jews were frequently reminded of the tenuous
                    nature of their absorption within England’s self-definition.</p>
                <p> Such is the historical context in which nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish
                    literature takes its place. It is a literature that does not respond with a
                    single voice to its antecedents. This volume therefore seeks to provide
                    representative examples of poetry and prose that span the entire century. Jews
                    found their way into sundry forms and genres even when such aesthetic
                    inheritances could be complicated within a Jewish refraction. It is these
                    nuanced appropriations of aesthetic categories, and the questions they raise,
                    that inspire the essays that follow. Indeed, the very title of Michael
                    Scrivener’s article highlights the urgency of such questions to our very
                    understanding of mainstream culture: <title level="a">Situating the King Sisters
                        within Literary Tradition.</title> Scrivener’s argument sustains a bold
                    claim, and his argument surveys a vast array of cultural kinds, with special
                    attention given to the Gothic, Della Cruscan, the erotic and the popular. The
                    latter reflect the contributions of Charlotte King (better known as Charlotte
                    Dacre) and Sophia King, daughters of John “Jew” King (1753–1823), infamous
                    moneylender and stern critic of political convention. For Scrivener, we ignore
                    such authors at our peril, for the work of Charlotte and Sophia King was central
                    to such high canonical authors as Shelley and Byron. More urgently, Scrivener is
                    the first critic to read the King sisters in terms of mainstream and Jewish
                    traditions, a brilliantly audacious argument to make about authors who do not
                    directly address exclusively Jewish themes in their work. Although both
                    Charlotte and Sophia married outside of the Jewish faith and did not describe
                    themselves as Jewish authors, Scrivener subtly reads their work and their
                    self-representations in terms of a self-conscious theatricality. Some aspects of
                    that theatricality reflect a kind of sublimated Jewish self-consciousness.
                    Performing daring roles, including sexual ones, they seek to overcome the
                    pejorative associations with their father, whose notoriety as “Jew King” was
                    never detached from his putative embodiment of stereotypical Jewish
                    characteristics. To read Charlotte and Sophia King, then, is to become oriented
                    to a formative expression of British Romanticism that, for Scrivener, finds its
                    ground in a vexed Jewish self-identification.</p>
                <p> Heidi Kaufman takes up the author Maria Polack, often identified as the first
                    Jewish woman novelist, and her novel <title level="m">Fiction Without
                        Romance</title> (1830). Romance has been a key term in the newly established
                    scholarly field of nineteenth-century Jewish fiction; as Michael Galchinsky has
                    pointed out, romance is a genre well suited to nineteenth-century Jewish women
                    novelists who sought to counter Christian conversionist texts. Such authors
                    could also mobilize the features of romance fiction to address their own
                    frustrations over their coreligionists’ treatment of women in communal life. As
                    Kaufman points out, however, Polack’s novel is situated in a rural community,
                    and its heroine is a Christian Protestant who undergoes a specifically Christian
                    education in a pastoral setting. Polack’s concerns in this novel focus primarily
                    on morality and education as they are found in English society. The question
                    begs itself: why would an urban Jewish writer engage such thematic
                    preoccupations? Does this text properly belong to a tradition of Jewish
                    literature? To be sure, the novel does include minor plots involving Jewish and
                    Catholic elements, but Eliza Desbro, the Christian protagonist, exemplifies a
                    successful process of Christian moral education. Does Polack even have cultural
                    standing to wield such literary types? Kaufman’s nuanced reading of the
                    situation sees Polack as finally appropriating the demands of the romance genre
                    to produce a new form of literary realism. This is a concern that dates back to
                    the 1790s, and to those authors who sought to transcend the restrictions of
                    romance by sustaining a steady gaze on historical reality. The historical
                    reality inhabited by Maria Polack is one in which assimilation to dominant norms
                    is an imperative with which Jews and Christians alike must contend. Kaufman’s
                    project, then, seeks to extend the reach of Anglo-Jewish literature in the
                    nineteenth century by reading its crossing of boundaries, both religious and
                    culture. Ultimately, for an Anglo-Jewish writer to cross boundaries in this
                    manner is for her to instantiate an Anglo-Jewish identity. </p>
                <p> Sarah Gracombe reads the appropriations of the biblical Ruth by various authors,
                    and while she does give due attention to Grace Aguilar, the Anglo-Jewish author,
                    she also casts a wide net, one that includes Keats, Thomas Hood, and others.
                    This stands as an important contribution to the study of Jewish representations
                    in English literary history, for Gracombe engages the subjects of geographical
                    territory and historical alienation as lyrical tropes that are refracted through
                    the prism of the historical Jew in nineteenth-century England. The Bethlehem of
                    the biblical Ruth, after all, tended in this century to be conflated with
                    England, and the land of England was increasingly defined in terms of its own
                    self-differentiation from its alien others. Gracombe gauges highly nuanced
                    interpretations of the Jewish resonance across a variety of nineteenth-century
                    poems. The biblical Ruth, perhaps Judaism’s most famous convert, stands, in
                    Keats’s celebrated formulation in <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale,</title>
                    “amid the alien corn.” Even with the love and reassurance of her mother-in-law,
                    indeed she stands “sick for home.” The biblical Ruth makes appearances in Blake,
                    in Thomas Hood, in Felicia Hemans, and in texts from many other
                    nineteenth-century authors, and these appearances are often refracted through a
                    cultural interpretation of the Jew within the English nation. Gracombe reminds
                    us that Ruth as psychological other, as outcast, is not merely theoretical or
                    historical; indeed, she joins the variously lyricized Ruths to the sociological,
                    political, and historical discussions about English nationhood. Could Jews
                    presume to embody Englishness? What do mainstream English authors imagine when
                    they imagine a Jewish woman calibrating the extent of her alienation? </p>
                <p> With Meri-Jane Rochelson’s essay on Israel Zangwill, we move finally to the end
                    of the century, one in which the Jewish population in England has exploded to
                    more than a quarter of a million, and Jewish civil and political disabilities
                    have been fully abolished. Zangwill, as Rochelson points out, was “the
                    best-known Jew in the Anglophone world” at the end of the nineteenth century,
                    and he enjoyed status as a genuine literary celebrity. Rochelson takes as her
                    example Zangwill’s novel <title level="m">The King of Schnorrers</title> (1894),
                    a work of comedy set in late-eighteenth-century England that manages to train a
                    steady and critical eye on the social experience of the Jew in England.
                    Serialized in <title level="j">The Idler</title>, the work boldly stakes a claim
                    to the cultural authority of English letters; as such, Zangwill seeks to
                    naturalize Jewish life for high culture. To <foreign xml:lang="de"
                        >schnor</foreign> is to inveigle funds from another person, and in a wry
                    Foreword to one of the reprints in 1894, Zangwill avers of the <foreign
                        xml:lang="de">schnorrer</foreign> that he “is as unique among beggars as
                    Israel among nations” (v). What does such “uniqueness” mean when studied against
                    the ever-increasing numbers of Jews in England? Indeed, what does publicly
                    displayed Jewish wit over Jewish idiosyncrasies portend in a world still anxious
                    about immigration, aliens, and otherness? For as Rochelson argues, <foreign
                        xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> exists outside of the boundaries of
                    respectable society, and yet Zangwill represents it, and its concomitant wit,
                    learning, creativity, <emph>and</emph> instability, as essential to the reality
                    of social functioning. It is no surprise, then, that Zangwill attained near
                    heroic stature among immigrant east-end London Jews.</p>
                <p> If <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> echoes the historical, political
                    effort to take what one rightfully deserves, then Zangwill’s effort to put
                    Jewish <foreign xml:lang="de">schnorring</foreign> on public display in a
                    mainstream publication begs larger questions. What is the relationship of Jewish
                    self-representations to the ways in which Jews tended to be defined within
                    mainstream culture? Perhaps more pressing is the dynamic that this volume as a
                    whole seeks to throw into relief: our aesthetic and cultural norms exist in a
                    delicate balance with their diffusion through the broadest cultural history. A
                    robust engagement with nineteenth-century literature marries depth to
                    breadth.</p>
