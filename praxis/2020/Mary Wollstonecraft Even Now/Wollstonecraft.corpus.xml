<title level="a">Care: For Wollstonecraft</title> situates the feminist legacy of Wollstonecraft’s 
                    life works in contemporary discourses and practices of care in order to foreground the still-radical implications of 
                    her concepts of mothering, women’s writing, and passional activism. Fictional works frame her critiques of marriage 
                    within the broad context of care, both for impoverished communities and against the social institutions that diminish 
                    especially women’s capacities to care. Nonfictional and fictional works posit the linkage between women’s writing and 
                    good mothering as the chief vehicle of psychosocial reform, one that, in textualizing the biological and personalizing 
                    the sociopolitical, greatly expands notions of what a mother is and what good-enough mothering entails. At the same 
                    time, the essay argues that caring for Wollstonecraft involves confronting the severe hazards that this linkage 
                    created for Wollstonecraft and her progeny as a way of underscoring both why care is neither a safe topic nor a safe 
                    practice and why Wollstonecraft’s feminism is not as heteronormative or bourgeois as frequently is alleged.</p>

<p>To call Mary Wollstonecraft the mother of Western liberal feminism is hardly a radical claim, but it pinpoints the question 
                   of Wollstonecraft’s feminist legacy. In specifying her pioneering role in articulating and promoting the rights of women, the 
                   claim is hardly unusual in applauding her radical achievements. After all, she was the first to define woman as a being with 
                   thinking powers, to expose the processes of socialization as designed to impede the progress of women, to protest the reduction 
                   of women’s virtue to chastity and feminine modesty, and to delineate the damage done to society as well as to individual men, 
                   women, and children by sustaining the culture’s irrational views on womanhood. On the other hand, a growing number of readers 
                   have come to construe the assumptions and philosophical traditions that undergird the claim as at best liberal—i.e., 
                   individualist, heteronormative, white, and bourgeois. In this view, what is hardly radical about claiming Wollstonecraft as 
                   the mother of Western liberal feminism is that her notions of “woman,” “mother,” “rights,” and “revolution in female manners” 
                   are impediments more than spurs to social justice work. Her writings have fallen off of most feminist syllabi unless they appear 
                   in the section that is historical, meaning also antiquated.</p>
<p>It is true that Wollstonecraft’s emphases on equality, autonomy, and the non-particularity of women’s bodies do not accord well 
                   with the intersectional and embodied tenets underlying contemporary feminist theories and movements like #blacklivesmatter and 
                   trans* advocacy and practices. The gender system that she inherited and revised remains binary; and while her vindications of 
                   woman are sensitive to class and, occasionally, to racial dynamics, by and large the sensibilities that they foreground are white 
                   and middle-class. And while there is validity in contextualizing her efforts and assessing her limits as largely reflective of 
                   the times in which she wrote, vindicators of Wollstonecraft should not rest satisfied with such qualifications. The revolutionary 
                   ethos with which she wrestled included massive agitations by enslaved persons in the West Indies that enlisted African concepts 
                   and practices in their freedom struggles (Robinson 9–29, 71–101). Though Wollstonecraft died before an independent Haiti was 
                   achieved, that revolutionary movement and set of conditions were part of her times, and it is simply true that her writings are 
                   not deeply informed by them or informative about them.</p>
<p>I wish to explore this dimension of her legacy in a somewhat indirect fashion by situating Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre within the 
                   branch of contemporary feminism that I deem closest to her enterprise: the care movement, especially its theoretical articulation 
                   in the ethics of care. Already I hear horselaughs over the validity of the comparison, not to mention its relevance to evaluating 
                   Wollstonecraft’s ongoing relevance to radical politics. For one thing, theorists of care, such as Fabienne Brugère, Virginia Held, 
                   Nel Noddings, and Joan Tronto, claim as their foremothers feminists who stress the differences between women and men, such as 
                   Carol Gilligan, Nancy Chodorow, and Luce Irigaray, not egalitarian feminists such as Wollstonecraft, who sought to affirm women’s 
                   similarity to men because both are reasoning creatures. For another, many of Wollstonecraft’s most astute and admiring critics 
                   characterize her personality as uncaring, censorious, prone to sounding the depths of her own needs more than those of others. We 
                   get somewhere in addressing the first concern by invoking William Godwin’s distinction between the “moral,” or expressed position, 
                   of a work and its “tendency,” which evolves over time and in accordance with the changing circumstances and vocabularies of its 
                   readerships (Godwin 139). In fact, one could say that the history of Wollstonecraft scholarship epitomizes this tendency, since 
                   scholars often interpret her significance in relation to their own desires regarding feminism, making the history of scholarship 
                   on Wollstonecraft into a minihistorical survey of waves of feminist thought. Some decry the factual distortions that result from 
                   the impulse, but I view the interpenetration as faithful to her methodology and one of the chief registers of her impact (Ayers 
                   1–14). Moreover, her practice of active revision models the tendency. The striking changes that mark her textual output, covering 
                   a period of less than ten years but featuring major cognitive and affective upheavals, suggest that she views revision as a 
                   literary as well as societal imperative and that she stays responsive to her changing experiences of both. In my view, no writer 
                   in her liberal-radical cohort is less defensive about exposing the errancy of her thought and examining the contradictions between 
                   what she writes and what she feels as is Wollstonecraft. Nor do any of them risk more than she in doing so.</p>
<p>The status of Wollstonecraft’s care as it affects evaluations of her personality is connected to the question of her legacy in more 
                   direct, though contradictory, ways. I will be arguing that her conceptions of care are deeply linked to her notions and experiences 
                   of mothering, a point that not only courts the accusation that her writings are bourgeois and heteronormative but also invites the 
                   strongest censure of her character as uncaring and self-absorbed. I venture into this minefield because to me it is part of what 
                   caring for her legacy entails. Because her “mothering” is never simply biological, is always connected to writing and to valuing 
                   literature as a means to entwine the psychological with the sociopolitical in its reformation of individuals, Wollstonecraft’s care 
                   is an early exemplum of what theorists and practitioners of care still are seeking to achieve: a fundamental restructuring of the 
                   values that undergird the organization, activities, and rewards of care. At the same time, taking seriously the depth of her 
                   ambivalence toward care as expressed in and made apparent by her writings exposes why care remains so difficult to give, take, or 
                   endorse as a radical sociopolitical endeavor.</p>

<p>Theorists of care foreground the radical interdependence of human life, not just at birth or as a condition of human neoteny. They 
                   thus perceive the autonomy of the individual as at best only partially achieved and, even when so, as never gained or maintained 
                   independently (Held, <title level="m">Ethics</title> 9–29). They value the activities and customary givers of care and argue that 
                   extending this valuation necessitates a fundamental rethinking of what constitutes the “good life” and thus a fundamental 
                   reorganization of societal structures and priorities to gain it. Philosophically, an ethics of care rejects not only individualism 
                   but also the institutional organizations that support individualist premises. Theorists prioritize “care” over “justice” because 
                   they deem the abstractions of the latter insufficiently attentive to the local, embodied, relational, and preferential aspects of 
                   caregiving. This orientation makes theorists and practitioners feminist, whether or not they call themselves feminists, because 
                   another primary concern is to gain respect and compensation for the persons on whom care activities generally fall and long have 
                   fallen: poor, disenfranchised, non-white, and immigrant women (Boris and Klein 19–39, 123–48). Because the dominant view long has 
                   been that those who need care are “babies” and those who give it are second-class citizens (if that), care tends not to be taken 
                   seriously or viewed as of vital interest. Even today, for all our voiced concern over precarity, bare life, embodied mentation, and 
                   globalization, neither public policy discussions nor theoretical inquiries in the humanities tend to foreground care or perceive 
                   their humanitarian concerns as addressed productively by an ethics of care.</p>
<p>This relative lack of enthusiasm for care has a lot to do with ongoing antipathy to women and resistance to the fact that we all 
                   need care, at times desperately. Some proponents have offered other terms, such as “the ethics of love” or “relational ethics,” 
                   in hopes of diminishing the sentimentalism that many hear in “care.” Others find “ethics” too stuffy for the improvisational life 
                   practices that care inspires. This is why I find Aranye Fradenburg’s contention that care “is always, in some sense, care of the 
                   wild” such a productive disruption of customary aversions to care <emph>and</emph> of existing theories of care (Fradenburg 70). 
                   Her accounts of the evolution of care as well as of its usual activities—so many of which touch on the skin, the membrane that both 
                   demarcates and mediates a creature’s inner and outer worlds—highlight both the dangers of viewing care as domesticating and the 
                   denials of environmental, racial, and psychic realities that are required in order to espouse such a view. Her accounts also 
                   underscore the meaningful and meaning-making nature of care activities, their often artful expressivity. Step one in overcoming 
                   resistance to care, Fradenburg argues, is to recognize that “care is neither a safe topic nor a safe practice. Care is difficult, 
                   both to accept and to give” not only because it exhausts “our reserves of narcissism” but also because it is “one of the primary 
                   modes by which the bodies and minds of creatures shape and re-shape one another” (70). Step two is acknowledging the evolving 
                   histories of care as generating “various rhetorics (chemical, electrical, gestural, alphabetic)” through which organisms “cross 
                   boundaries and foster relationality” (72).</p>
<p>The life writings of Wollstonecraft exemplify the theoretical tenets of care and the wildness that care confronts, soothes, and 
                   provokes both consciously and unconsciously. Her coordination of the relations among woman, human, reason, justice, and care employs 
                   more of an Enlightenment ethos and vocabulary than contemporary care theorists use, but neither her conclusions nor her 
                   methodological processes are as far from theirs as her emphasis on “rights” and “woman” might suggest. The enlightened aspects of 
                   her tenets stem from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the first Western philosopher to posit “human” as interdependent, not autonomous, and 
                   its rationality evoked by and in need of pity and care (Brugère, <title level="a">Justice</title>). Rousseau also is the first 
                   Western philosopher to conceive of confession and fiction as major vehicles of philosophy’s coming to consciousness about the 
                   complexity of human cognition. Both of these contributions explain why Wollstonecraft is “half in love” with Rousseau for admitting 
                   into philosophy the vulnerability and frequently pitiful nature of male rationality (Wardle 145). The remaining half mobilizes its 
                   outrage over Rousseau’s sanctioned mistreatments of “woman” into devising a new philosophy, narrative, and psychosocial history of 
                   female experiences, the deliberateness of which effort, it bears repeating, is unprecedented, including her new-philosophical 
                   project of displaying through “an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has thinking powers” (Advertisement 
                   to <title level="m">Mary</title> 5). But Wollstonecraft’s care also anticipates Fradenburg’s attention to the wildness and 
                   antidomesticating impulses inherent in caring that showcases its significance as a “life-and-death matter” (Fradenburg 68).</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft’s efforts to foreground “woman” as having thinking powers underlie all of her works and employ several methodological 
                   tenets that are care-centric because they are interdependent. Her fictional writings verge upon philosophy in that they feature 
                   females in the process of thinking, characterize a Mary or a Maria in order to focalize the “wrongs of woman” and gain sympathy for 
                   them, and work to demonstrate that the social institutions that frame and allegedly support the affective lives of individuals 
                   actually repress whatever capacity for creativity they possess—intentionally so, in the case of women. This is why Wollstonecraft 
                   foregrounds marriage as the most despotic social institution affecting women, calls for a revolution in female manners, and 
                   prioritizes altering the mentality of middle-class women, since that group of women is being trained from birth to consider their 
                   prospects as identical with marriageability. But what is less often recognized is how Wollstonecraft’s antimarriage polemic, 
                   especially as depicted in her fictional and semiautobiographical writings, is situated in an explicit discussion of care, and not 
                   simply of the emancipated female protagonist. Texts link the melancholic sensibility of their love-thwarted, <emph>because</emph> 
                   married, protagonists to caregiving activities that in turn make visible the class-intersecting, though also class-benighted, 
                   aspects of Wollstonecraft’s evolving depictions of “woman.”</p>
<p>Both <title level="m">Mary: A Fiction</title> (1788) and <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</title> (1798) embed their 
                   protagonists’ one-on-one caregiving activities within a broader survey of societal care organizations and the protagonists’ 
                   engagement with them. Both texts also circuit their observations on societal and domestic care through protagonists whose early 
                   development is described as significantly lacking, especially in care from their mothers, a lack that shapes each of their 
                   sensibilities and its dual orientation toward melancholy and care. Mary’s capacity and desire to care for her beloved Ann, 
                   weakened at a young age by consumption, which entails their traveling from England to the warmer climate of Portugal and Mary’s 
                   attending her there until she dies, literally is framed by her involvement in caring for various impoverished families. Melancholy 
                   rambles take a young Mary to the “huts of a few poor fishermen, who supported their numerous children by their precarious labour,” 
                   in whose company she “frequently rested, and denied herself every childish gratification, in order to relieve the necessities of 
                   the inhabitants” (<title level="m">Mary</title> 15).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Those rambles occur “[w]hen her mother 
                       frowned, and her friend looked cool” (15).</note>  
                   After Ann dies and before she redirects her care-tending to a second husband substitute (Henry), Mary “relieved the poor” in the 
                   villages around London, procuring lodging and domestic necessities for a “poor woman” she had met on the voyage back to England 
                   and providing “every comfort” for a family of seven that included hiring a “poor neighbor” to “nurse the woman, and take care of 
                   the children” (<title level="m">Mary</title> 56). Holding aside for now the class politics evinced in these depersonalizing and 
                   self-oriented acts of philanthropy, they are depicted as moving her beyond her constitutional melancholy and restoring her to life. 
                   “In these pursuits,” Mary “learned the luxury of doing good,” acquiring “a sparkle” in “eyes” which, without their moistening by 
                   “the sweet tears of benevolence,” lacked luster (<title level="m">Mary</title> 15–16). “Is any sensual gratification to be compared 
                   to that of feeling the eyes moistened after having comforted the unfortunate?” (<title level="m">Mary</title> 59).<note place="foot" resp="editors">More should be said of this “moistening” that rewards her philanthropic activities.</note>  
                   In <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title>, Maria’s ability to care-tend her infant daughter is thwarted by her confinement 
                   in a madhouse after she attempts to escape from a brutish marriage, where she is guarded by Jemima. But this failure of interpersonal 
                   care motivates the text’s sweeping analysis of the wrongs done to women by societal institutions designed to minimize their care, a 
                   class-inflected account occasioned by combining Jemima’s and Maria’s life stories, each of which enumerates differing psychic, 
                   relational, and societal consequences of treating females as bodies to be given in marriage or given out to domestic and sexual 
                   service, often an apt depiction of what bourgeois marriages entail.</p>
<p>On one level, this emphasis on the interplay between societal and interpersonal operations of care is how the antimarriage plot works 
                   to mitigate doubts regarding these women’s virtue. The independence of mind evidenced in the ability of all three female protagonists 
                   to brook social convention requires ongoing protection, which staying bastilled in a brutish marriage or occupation nullifies. Put a 
                   different way, the fellow-feeling of Mary and between Maria and Jemima—even granting Mary’s and Maria’s patronizing attitudes toward 
                   “the poor”—is shown to be invigorated through their ability to give care, a point intended to demonstrate the immorality of marriage 
                   bonds and the civic-mindedness of free-thinking women. On another level, emphasis on the interplay introduces Wollstonecraft’s two 
                   pioneering and still radical contributions to an ethics of care: highlighting literature as the arena that interweaves the social 
                   and psychological, and depicting women’s writing as a form and act of mothering. For the chief difference between these two works 
                   of fiction, positioned as they are on opposing sides and affective evaluations of her <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights 
                       of Woman</title> (1792), is that Mary’s caregiving activities are directed toward adults, whereas Maria’s are directed toward 
                   an infant whose fate is improved by Jemima’s taking care of Maria, a change that is activated by the narrations of each of their 
                   life stories.</p>
<p>Thwarted in physically nursing her daughter and “uncertain whether I shall ever have an opportunity of instructing you,” Maria 
                   “addresses” her life story to her baby daughter as a form of sustenance “meant rather to exercise than influence your mind” 
                   (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 123). This effort not only reverses one of the causes of the neglectful mothering that Mary and 
                   Maria experience. It also is penned by a mother both “labouring under a portion of the misery, which the constitution of society 
                   seems to have entailed on all her kind” and daring to “break through all restraint to provide for your happiness” by “voluntarily 
                   brav[ing] censure herself, to ward off sorrow from your bosom” (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 123). This means that good mothering 
                   for Wollstonecraft is a matter of narrative as much as of biology and is inseparable from women being willing to admit, value, 
                   reflect on, and convey their sometimes rapturous and oftentimes sorrowful experiences to current and future minds in the making. It 
                   also means that good mothering is a rarity and that working to make it less so necessitates appealing directly to the class of women 
                   whose consignment to domesticity is hampering their care and their desire to give or take care.</p>
<p>Connecting writing to mothering and to the futures bodied forth in each undergirds all of Wollstonecraft’s projects and falls roughly 
                   into two phases. The first phase (1787–1792) stages a staggered, more piecemeal relation among “woman,” motherhood, and female 
                   reader-writers, suggesting that informing women effectively is a precondition to better mothering and that both necessitate not only 
                   women reading but also finding or composing for themselves better reading material. The earliest texts portray books as better 
                   mothers than existing biological mothers (<title level="m">The Female Reader</title> and <title level="m">Thoughts on the Education 
                       of Daughters</title>), feature a surrogate mother who ultimately inscribes her wise counsel in a book (<title level="m">Original 
                       Stories from Real Life</title>), and depict a woman literally coming to (not) know her mind through the activity of writing 
                   down, and thereby discovering, her feelings (<title level="m">Mary: A Fiction</title>; Carlson 221–32). Though treating the two 
                   largely as separate topics, <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> connects mothering to writing in a 
                   critical fashion, ascribing middle-class women’s lack of interest and competence in either arena to their preoccupation with men 
                   and male standards or values. In the second phase (1794–1797), the spheres are integrated in the case of middle-class white women. 
                   The female persona through whom the demand for women’s rights gets expressed is a biological mother and a writer, though not 
                   depicted as a published author (the I of <title level="m">A Short Residence</title>, Maria in <title level="m">The Wrongs of 
                       Woman</title>). In this, they conceive a future of better possibilities by working simultaneously on the prime agents of 
                   futurity—the rising generation, new ways of thinking—and by depicting reform of the one as interconnected with reform of the other. 
                   This interconnection, as she argues in <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, is key to producing better home lives and a more 
                   informed citizenry. Infant minds stand a better chance of expanding if they are engaged by attentive, less self-absorbed and 
                   male-preoccupied mothers, who themselves will be more open to having their selves reformed when holding, and feeling held by, a 
                   text that regards them, and an infant that will come to regard them, as thoughtful persons and as deserving of care.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft’s linkage of mothering and women writing was a brilliant strategy to defuse readers’ alarm by tying together the most 
                   conservative and forward-looking roles then being assigned to “woman.” By the second <title level="m">Vindication</title>, the 
                   strategy is a more or less conscious approach to the paradox of decrying the power that its primary readership wields and must 
                   mobilize if legal and political change is to occur. The linkage also makes two useful interventions in contemporary discussions 
                   of care. It underscores the importance of the arts in fostering the curative and quotidian aspects of care and of finding adequate 
                   language to describe and defang the isolating nature of pain. While gaining ground, this branch of care practice and theory remains 
                   undercultivated. It also mediates an internal debate over whether serious care reform begins best on the homefront or with the 
                   social and economic institutions that foster indifference to care and its conventional agents at home. The latter proponents 
                   construe economic realities as trickling through, if not flooding, every other relational structure and perceive the familial realm 
                   as still awash in gender asymmetries (Sevenhuijsen, Tronto, and Williams). The former contend that the elimination of social 
                   impediments is necessary but insufficient because the capacity to care is acquired, not inborn, and acquired primarily through the 
                   dynamics of infant-(m)other attachment (Hollway). Wollstonecraft’s texts show that, for care to flourish, both societal institutions 
                   and psychic investments therein need to be restructured in tandem and that treating society and psyche or public and private as 
                   separate spheres exacerbates the problem; this is arguably why she does not confine social critique to nonfiction and psychological 
                   or interpersonal analysis to fiction. Her twinned and generically hybrid approach is also why Wollstonecraft’s concern with 
                   mothering is not as conservative or heteronormative as is sometimes alleged. For her, mothering is heterotextual, passional, chosen, 
                   and deployed “rather to exercise than influence” young minds (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 123).</p>
<p>Her mothering also is the most unsettling aspect of her biography and legacy. By way of context, it is fair to say that mothering 
                   was the first role assigned to her as a child and that the prematurity of her assumption of the role affected her priorities from 
                   then on, including her need to be assured of her priority in the minds of male lovers. The eldest daughter of differently neglectful 
                   parents, by age ten she had major responsibility for the care of her five younger siblings as her mother’s physical and mental 
                   health deteriorated and as her elder brother employed himself elsewise. Sisters Eliza and Everina affirmed repeatedly her 
                   responsibility for them, as they turned to Wollstonecraft, even as adults, for assistance in money, employment, and venting and as 
                   all three turned on each other over perceived inadequacies of care. One of the most sobering examples of Wollstonecraft’s sisterly 
                   mothering concerns her efforts to rescue Eliza from her husband Meredith Bishop’s household after Eliza had given birth to a 
                   daughter and fallen into a serious depression. Initiated out of alarm over Eliza’s derangement and vague hints that Bishop was 
                   abusive, Wollstonecraft’s plan succeeded in separating Eliza not only from Bishop, with whom she was never reconciled and whose 
                   plausibility as a husband seems not in particular doubt, but also from baby Mary, who died several months later. Then there is the 
                   dark history of Wollstonecraft’s mothering of Fanny, in which her attempts at suicide twice threatened to leave Fanny parentless 
                   while still a baby, so consumed was Wollstonecraft by her passion for Gilbert Imlay. Though rescued from both attempts, 
                   Wollstonecraft left no indication that rescue was a secret hope or design (Williams 222–23). A suicide note indicates that, in the 
                   event of an intervention, she wanted not to be resuscitated, even if death meant leaving Fanny motherless, though probably also in 
                   the able care of her nursemaid, Marguerite Fournée.</p>
<p>There is no getting around this limit in Wollstonecraftian care. Nor is my emphasis on her fusion of mothering and writing meant to 
                   be compensatory or exculpatory. The “mothering” effected by her writing has disagreeable elements too, including self-absorption, 
                   self-righteousness, a know-it-all spirit, and little patience with other people’s unwillingness to suffer patiently. All of this 
                   makes the tragic outcomes of her writing-mothering, especially in Fanny’s life, very hard to bear. My sense of the gains in taking 
                   Wollstonecraft’s care seriously result from acknowledging the risks that she took by detailing resistances to caregiving that women 
                   like her experience, especially after she had gone on record castigating patriarchal minimizations of it. The frankness with which 
                   she explores her antipathy to the sacrifices attendant in caring is inspiring, as is her willingness to revise her views on “woman” 
                   in light of accumulated experiences of the conflicts within and between her various roles as feminist single mother writer activist. 
                   Amidst recurrent bouts of passion and depression, she never stopped attempting to redesign her future and that of rising generations 
                   by registering the hazards and co-implications of those experiences.</p>
<p>Such redesigning affects how the female protagonists in later texts construe the special hazards of mothering. While the writing 
                   voices of <title level="m">A Short Residence</title> and <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title> are more confident than in 
                   earlier texts—less strident or unsympathetic, more experimental—they now voice a “dread” over the future to which increased options 
                   for females consign their daughters. The narrator of <title level="m">A Short Residence</title> dreads that, by cultivating her 
                   daughter’s “sensibility” and “delicacy of sentiment,” she is “sharpen[ing] the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain 
                   guard—I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit” 
                   (<title level="m">Short Residence</title> 84). Similarly, Maria “lamented” that “her child” was “a daughter, and anticipated 
                   the aggravated ills of life that her sex rendered almost inevitable” (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 85). 
                   It is as if the acquisition of confidence in writing allows female protagonists to feel the full weight of male indifference to 
                   their flourishing and to find this indifference unbearable—whether the 
                   culprit is patriarchy or Imlay. As regards the “hapless fate” that this enjoins upon daughters, her protagonists question what 
                   constitutes maternal care if facilitating the aspirations of children almost certainly means heightening their suffering or 
                   shortening their lives. One thinks here of “the talk” that Black parents in the U.S. today are forced to have with their 
                   children.<note place="foot" resp="editors">

<p>Toni Morrison’s <title level="m">Beloved</title> is the most nuanced treatment of a maternal love so fierce that the act of killing 
                   one’s child is preferable to delivering her over to a fate worse than death. Comparison to Morrison exposes Wollstonecraft’s 
                   narrative limitations as regards artistry, range of topics, knowledge of and expressed sympathy for certain types of characters, 
                   but it also highlights her willingness to confront moral complexity in her fiction. As relates to Fanny, the comparison embodies 
                   the opposite challenge of discerning maternal love in the act of killing oneself and thereby leaving parentless a one-year-old baby 
                   girl, especially considering Fanny’s eventual suicide on the anniversary of her mother’s death at the age of 22. I share Janet 
                   Todd’s impatience over the tendency to read Fanny as consigned to this fate, as if she was destined to commit suicide rather than 
                   worn down to it from being so used and disregarded by all of her variously overbearing family members 
                   (Todd, <title level="m">Death</title> xiii–xiv). Still, it puzzles me why Todd expresses such skepticism over Wollstonecraft’s 
                   revolutionary character, even if Wollstonecraft’s heroines are preachy, her correspondence “prickly,” and her postures “alternately” 
                   needy and full of “lofty independence” (Todd, <title level="m">Life</title> 15). Todd’s biography enumerates the range of mothering 
                   activities that Wollstonecraft assumed as sibling, schoolteacher, governess, and writer, but regards her career turn to writing as 
                   primarily an opportunistic rather than idealistic or even pragmatic attempt to use her observations of bad mothering across the 
                   classes in order to improve it. Since “she was always telling people what to do, how to read and respond, how to raise their children 
                   and improve themselves,” why not try writing? (<title level="m">Life</title> 75). Todd’s tendency to depict the glass as half empty 
                   extends to Wollstonecraft’s expressions of emptiness. Stating that depression and other mental disturbances run deep in the 
                   Wollstonecraft family, Todd underscores a “cultural component in their malady,” the “high esteem in which the middle classes held 
                   melancholy” (<title level="m">Life</title> 75). True enough. But Todd’s accounts construe the cultural dimension almost solely as 
                   a license for personal histrionics by characterizing Wollstonecraft’s expressions of anguish as postures, self-dramatizations, and 
                   appeals for male attention and attentiveness.</p>
<p>I raise this not to endorse reparative over paranoid readings, both approaches being fundamental to critical care, as 
                   Wollstonecraft’s writings attest (Sedgwick). My point is that her writings relate issues of care to social justice work by 
                   demonstrating how deeply one’s genetic and familial origins shape everything that follows, that such origins are shaped by 
                   socioeconomic and cultural factors, and that, if existence is to become bearable for subjects whose originating conditions are 
                   designed to keep them subordinated, then they generally have to assume the burden of changing these conditions because no one else 
                   will take up the project. Whatever else one says about her upbringing, Wollstonecraft was put upon from early on, witnessed forms of 
                   injustice from within the family, and viewed her writing career as the only means to an independence that could do something to 
                   change the dependence that informed and continued to deform the minds, brains, and bodies of women seeking to experience something 
                   like freedom. Plus, she knew that attaining financial independence was crucial to sharing her resources with those close at hand or 
                   far off in the future. Wollstonecraftian sensibilities can sound hopelessly bourgeois if we ascribe them to an isolated “self” rather 
                   than to experienced discordances between that self and the world, and if we deem despair over being isolated or a longing to captivate 
                   as distinctively middle-class. Starting with early letters to girlhood friends and continuing throughout her published writings and 
                   private correspondence, Wollstonecraft’s writings struggle to coordinate interconnection and isolation, attachment and detachment, 
                   independence and codependence, needing to be recognized and refusing to conform. She does not frame those struggles as an 
                   investigation or an ethics of care, but we could name them as such now.</p>
<p>If we did, several re-estimations of her life writings and legacy might follow. I have suggested that her efforts to twine writing and 
                   mothering join together what are generally differentiated disciplinary approaches—sociological versus psychological—to the reform, in 
                   this case, of care institutions, understood as primarily societal or familial. Hers unite the two realms through a new-philosophical 
                   enlistment of the intercourse between texts and lives and the conviction that her kinds of text function as surrogate mothers to the 
                   adult and infant persons whom they are in the process of remaking. Moreover, she casts the “heroine” of her texts as a representative, 
                   not an individual, in order to showcase how cultural recognition of women with thinking powers effects, and should affect, changing 
                   social policies on education, marriage, and property laws as well as better caretaking of infants, children, men, and themselves. In 
                   terms of their content and style, Wollstonecraft’s writings are more sociological than psychological in their renditions of female 
                   psychology. They thematize the difficulties of interpersonal dynamics more than they depict them as co-created or co-creative, whether 
                   between partnered adults or mothers and infants. The infant whose existence is portrayed as motivating Maria’s narration of her life 
                   story is wholly absent except to her mind; to a large degree so is Fanny in <title level="m">A Short Residence</title>, whose embodied 
                   presence is most movingly described when Wollstonecraft is away from her on business, some say because she temporarily feels freed of 
                   that presence (Gordon 316).</p>
<p>In these later works Wollstonecraft’s depictions of mother-infant interactions are perhaps best described as co-created but not yet 
                   co-creative for either party.<note place="foot" resp="editors">My thinking on these dynamics are shaped by Mary Jane Davis Kennedy’s 
                       dissertation, <title level="u">New-born: Affect, Attachment, and the Infant Embodied Unconscious in Romantic Literature and 
                           Medicine,</title> University of California, Santa Barbara, September 2018.</note>  
                   Radical for her times, the depiction is a still-valid point from which to conduct contemporary revisions of care. We have a much 
                   richer knowledge base and vocabulary than did Wollstonecraft for remarking the mutual interplay between infants and (m)others, the 
                   intensity of the gratifications on each side, and the necessity for each party to turn away from the other so as to avoid impingement 
                   by or upon the mother. But this has not taken us very far in reorienting policies or practices of care. Fradenburg suggests how 
                   hospital and hospice care might enlist the tactile and sound-soothing practices of infant care when treating all patients, recalling 
                   the emergence of language out of grooming activities and the self-soothing benefits of both (74–77). If we viewed Wollstonecraft’s 
                   life writings in the context of feminist care rather than of enlightenment justice, we might not need so many reminders that care is 
                   “neither a safe topic nor a safe practice” because it is “one of the primary modes by which the bodies and minds of creatures shape 
                   and reshape one another” (Fradenburg 70). Wollstonecraft’s writings fear more often than they celebrate this coinvolvement, but this 
                   seems largely because the asymmetries felt so stark to her and the upholders of them so unapologetic.</p>
<p>The wildness of Wollstonecraft’s care is epitomized by what is truly unprecedented in the composition of <title level="m">The Wrongs 
                   of Woman; or Maria</title>: writing to a baby daughter who would have been abandoned if the author had succeeded at drowning and 
                   promulgating writing as the best means for preparing a daughter for eventualities for which she can never adequately be prepared. 
                   For all its limitations, <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title> is a stunningly brave text in addressing maternal abandonment, 
                   including Maria’s possible suicide attempt, and having that mother actually envision the consequences of it on her baby girl. “To 
                   think that [her infant] was blotted out of existence was agony, when the imagination had been long employed to expand her faculties; 
                   yet to suppose her turned adrift on an unknown sea, was scarcely less afflicting” (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 85–86). Yes, 
                   Wollstonecraft depicts the fictional mother as primarily the victim, not the agent, of the separation that so anguishes her. And yes, 
                   meanwhile she sends the memoirs to a male inmate whose marginal notations in Rousseau’s <title level="m">Heloïse</title> have shown 
                   him to be a promising partner to her body and mind. But these limitations do not erase the complexity of the experiences that Maria 
                   records in order to exercise her daughter’s mind, and they show that extending female <foreign xml:lang="fr">jouissance</foreign> is 
                   a part of good mothering. Nor does she leave textual caretaking of Fanny at this. Composition of <title level="m">The Wrongs of 
                       Woman</title> occurs alongside <title level="m">Lessons</title>, a reading primer composed for Fanny at the imagined advent of 
                   the arrival of a new sibling. <title level="m">Lessons</title> depicts reading as a relational act that helps a young creature 
                   interpret her environs by learning to name, adjust to, and readjust them.</p>
<p>To my mind, then, wanting to understand all that care signifies in Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre is what caring for her legacy enjoins. 
                   It accepts that her care generally is not congenial, even when it is sentimentalized, and is usually suffused with a metaphysical 
                   and psychological darkness that occasions destructiveness and anxiety. Hers is a wildness whose approach-avoid impulses are more 
                   polarized than proximal, more reactive than worked through. But, unlike her contemporary writing peers, her treatment of this is 
                   remarkably straightforward—in fact, her writing sounds desperate to get a better handle on the intensity of the pulls she 
                   experiences in both directions. Her writings also acknowledge that societal ambivalence toward caretaking and caregivers deepens 
                   personal ambivalences toward care in those charged with doing carework but also that redressing the former does not guarantee 
                   altering the latter. In fact, those resistances are generally the least susceptible to change.</p>
<p>One way that feminist pedagogues might take care of Wollstonecraft’s legacy is to devise syllabi that are less linear in their 
                   construal of waves and less delineated in their concepts of womanhood. Though Wollstonecraft’s writings are not intersectional in 
                   the contemporary sense, that aims to expose how the experiences of Black women, owing to their multiple marginalization, are 
                   invisible to systems grounded in a logic of discrete categories, their depiction of mothering as an interaction between biology 
                   and textuality models a still-vital method for disrupting categories of identity altogether (Crenshaw). Such a course might feature 
                   care units that are topically intersectional, such as grouping <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> with 
                   Marilynne Robinson’s <title level="m">Housekeeping</title>, Patricia William’s <title level="m">An Alchemy of Race and 
                       Rights</title>, and Eileen Boris and Jennifer Klein’s <title level="m">Caring in America</title>. Or <title level="m">Letters

                   Toni Morrison’s <title level="m">God Help the Child</title>. It might pair her correspondence and Godwin’s 
                   <title level="m">Memoir of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> with contemporary 
                   memoirs such as Vivian Gornick’s <title level="m">Fierce Attachments</title>, Alice Walker’s <title level="m">The Chicken

                           The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant</title>, Cherríe Moraga’s <title level="m">Native Country of the Heart</title>. 
                   It might even put her thinking on care in conversation with university studies and its efforts to make higher education more 
                   equitable, less corporatized, more radically liberal, also by changing the material conditions of teaching and scholarship. As 
                   survey data guiding my university’s discussion of improving campus child care opportunities indicate, far fewer male than female 
                   faculty perceive the availability of child care to be a “very serious” problem affecting their work life, and most white female 
                   faculty view it as a faculty-first issue until or even after they are reminded about staff and graduate student needs. It is 
                   regrettable that the institution established to foster minds in their complex interactions with brains, bodies, and environs 
                   remains so myopic in its imaginings of interdependence, especially when push comes to shove under racial capital. I think too 
                   that, for all her identification with men, Wollstonecraft identified with their having resources and wished to extend that 
                   privilege to herself and others. She was not afraid to make waves or to speak truth, including nonsense, to powerful men, and she 
                   was used to the experience of not feeling supported or being supported. I would want her in faculty meetings.</p>
<p>For persons whose starting points are inauspicious, who perceive the arts as relational and potentially transformational, who are 
                   committed to learning from an experience not held to be singular, and who both entertain and suspend the question of whether it is 
                   texts or persons that make living more bearable or more insufferable, the life writings of Mary Wollstonecraft have a lot to say. 
                   My sense is that their greatest potential lies in the portrayal of the evolving relationship between Maria and Jemima that was cut 
                   short by her death. Taught to perceive and treat each other as enemies because of the hostilities that class hierarchy breeds in 
                   both parties, Maria and Jemima are able to come together through an evolving complex of circumstances that <title level="m">Wrongs 
                       of Woman</title> seeks to generalize and propagate. They are shown first to be thrown together by circumstances that they do 
                   not control and that are outside of any individual’s control, whose alteration requires a joining of forces. They join forces 
                   through separate experiences of gender subordination and a shared concern for a future embodied in a baby and a memoir over whose 
                   fate they have differentiated investments. They come to discover this common ground in their shared “fondness of reading” and 
                   through narrating their life stories to each other (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 114).</p>
<p>Attention to Jemima’s cultivated sensibility marks significant progress from <title level="m">Mary: A Fiction</title>, where Mary’s 
                   involvement with the nameless “poor” expresses her benevolence but is unconcerned with discerning theirs, except to note their 
                   ingratitude. But Maria’s “often-repeated question” why Jemima’s “sentiments and language were superior” to her “station’” prompts 
                   new objections in the implied exceptionalism of Jemima’s having a “refined” sensibility, its alignment of class position with 
                   particular kinds of sentiment, and the presumed desirability of bourgeois refinement (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 113). It 
                   would be unwise to dismiss the still-patronizing attitude evident in Wollstonecraft’s depictions of this developing relationship 
                   and, thereby, to resist asking why the heightening of imagination celebrated in British Romanticism so often becomes a classist 
                   and racialized affront. But neither should we disregard two caveats offered in this depiction. For what is arguably exceptional is 
                   not Jemima’s rich mind but the fact that her “master” noticed and entered into dialogue with it, even requesting her opinion and 
                   feedback on his writings before submitting them to print (admittedly, so that he could “profit by the criticism of unsophisticated 
                   feeling”) (<title level="m">Wrongs</title> 114). Too, the relationship that Maria and Jemima begin to form, though lopsided, is 
                   co-created in the process of each opening her heart to the other.</p>
<p>My interest in having intersectional feminists find reason to care for Wollstonecraft clearly says more about my desires than theirs 
                   or even hers. The investment has everything to do with the complex of my relational, intellectual, and professional histories that 
                   have positioned me to read her works more carefully than I have read most other writers. This would not be the first time that I 
                   have been guilty of poor object choice. But I hope that the desire is Wollstonecraftian in its attempts to lay bare various 
                   challenges to her legacy and address them in ways that reveal to subsequent readers what else needs to be taken down or more fully 
                   taken up. Caring for Wollstonecraft involves seeking to move on from wherever one starts up. We could start by hearing some 
                   different things in the mother of Western liberal feminism.</p>

<title level="a">The Radicalism of Queenship</title> calls attention to Mary Wollstonecraft’s 
                    engagement with exceptional historical women, focusing especially on her comments on royal women such as Queen 
                    Caroline Matilda of Denmark and Norway. In highlighting how Wollstonecraft found it useful to think with royal 
                    women, the paper suggests the importance of placing Wollstonecraft—and feminism more broadly—within many 
                    different and often complimentary philosophical approaches and traditions. The paper then charts the role that 
                    queens and other elite women have played in the emergence and articulation of western feminisms, focusing 
                    especially on developments in Britain.</p>

<head>The Radicalism of Queenship: Mary Wollstonecraft and Alternative Sources of the Rights of Women</head>

<div type="section">
<p>It is well known that Mary Wollstonecraft had little patience for history, and especially for histories of exceptional 
                or “worthy” women. “I have been led to imagine,” she wrote in her 1792 <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of 
                    Woman</title>, “that the few extraordinary women who have rushed in eccentric directions out of the orbit prescribed 
                to their sex, were male spirited, confined by mistake in a female frame” (68). Wollstonecraft seems to have held elite 
                women in particular contempt, and condemned court culture for the “wretchedness” that “flow[s] from hereditary honours, 
                riches, and monarchy” and the “dispensations of providence” (19). For Wollstonecraft, we have thus been led to believe, 
                the key to women’s emancipation lay primarily in their claims to natural rights as human beings, that is, those 
                inalienable rights that transcended culture, nation, and biology.</p>
<p>But a closer reading of the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>—along with some of 
                Wollstonecraft’s other seminal texts—suggests that history, and specifically the history of royal women, may not have 
                been as anathema to Wollstonecraft as we might think. The very impetus for writing the <title level="m">Vindication of 
                   the Rights of Woman</title>, after all, turned in part on a debate regarding the Salic Law, the law passed in 
                fifteenth-century France barring women from the throne. Wollstonecraft was allegedly infuriated when her colleague 
                Thomas Christie—a fellow radical and editor of the <title level="j">Analytical Review</title>—defended the French 
                National Assembly’s decision <emph>not</emph> to tamper with the Old Regime laws governing royal succession, on the 
                grounds that the Salic Law reflected the “natural” sexual and social order (Bruder 109–10). As Christie explained in 
                his <title level="m">Letters on the Revolution in France, and on the New Constitution</title>, published in 1791, 
                “The ancient Salic Law, which excludes females from succeeding to the throne, was considered by the Assembly as a 
                fundamental and wise regulation of the monarchy, which merited to be solemnly renewed, and permanently established.” It 
                was in preserving the Salic Law, he added, that the French had demonstrated most clearly “that they knew where to draw 
                the line, and so to honour the sex as not to injure their <emph>real</emph> happiness, or endanger the welfare of 
                society.” This was a far cry from the state of Britain, where women were allowed “to rule over men”—an “unnatural and 
                shocking” development that marked the “reversal of the laws of Nature” (217–18). Such misogynistic claims, Helen Bruder 
                notes, served as further grist for Wollstonecraft’s feminist mill, and helped motivate her to write the 
                <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, published the following year (110).</p>
<p>What is more, the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> itself, though clearly written in certain 
                respects against the past, is peppered with references to “history.” And the “history” that Wollstonecraft invokes is 
                often a productive one for women, with lessons both for the “fair sex” and for those men who write about women. Yes, 
                the “history of woman” often amounts to little more than a depressing tale of women as either “slave” or 
                “despot”—“situations [that] equally retard the progress of reason” (115). But the “history of all nations” also offers 
                up instructive tales regarding women’s inability to be “confined to merely domestic pursuits” (402). It is perhaps for 
                this reason that she recommends history as a component of girls’ educations. In particular, she urges girls to acquaint 
                themselves with “heroic characters” from the past as a necessary corrective to romantic fiction (431).</p>
<p>In her <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</title>, published four 
                years later in 1796, Wollstonecraft further explores these didactic dimensions of history, especially as they apply to 
                the formation of women’s character. She dwells, for instance, on the example provided by the British-born Queen 
                Caroline Matilda of Denmark and Norway (1751–1775), consort of King Christian VII (and sister of King 
                George III).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on Wollstonecraft’s strategic discussion of Queen Matilda, see 
                    Bahar 126.</note> Though a flawed figure—she had an affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee, her Privy 
                Counsellor—Caroline Matilda nevertheless gains Wollstonecraft’s respect for her public spiritedness and charity work, 
                her sensible parenting practices, and even her impatience with custom. She wished, Wollstonecraft writes, “to do 
                immediately what can only be done by time” (204). Thus while Wollstonecraft ultimately sees Caroline Matilda as a tragic 
                character—she died very young, from scarlet fever, after enduring the dissolution of her marriage, the execution of her 
                lover, and her exile to Germany—Wollstonecraft also finds in Caroline Matilda’s life an inspiring story of female 
                fortitude and grit. Because of her birth and rank, Caroline Matilda had been able to live her life differently from the 
                majority of women (even if in ways still highly constrained by her sex). Women such as Caroline Matilda therefore offered 
                clues as to what might be possible for all women, if given greater latitude and access.</p>

<div type="section">
<p>Why does Wollstonecraft’s engagement with figures like Queen Caroline Matilda matter? I take up these considerations 
                because my own current research, published as <title level="m">The Right to Rule and the Rights of Women: Queen Victoria 
                     and the Women’s Movement</title>, charts how women’s rights activists leveraged Queen Victoria—and the tradition of 
                female rule in Britain more generally—to make arguments for female emancipation over the course of the nineteenth century. 
                I am deeply interested in the ways in which Britain’s history of female royal leadership (and what paradoxically might be 
                construed as the egalitarian dimensions of certain royal institutions and practices) impacted the development of feminist 
                consciousness. Already in the late seventeenth century, John Locke was speculating in his <title level="m">First Treatise 
                    on Government</title> on the uses of queens regnant in challenging the patriarchal vision contained in the Book of 
                Genesis. “Will any one say,” Locke wondered, “that either of our queens, Mary or Elizabeth, had they married any of their 
                subjects, had been by this text [i.e., Genesis] put into a political subjection to him? or that he should thereby have 
                had monarchical rule over her? God, in this text, gives not, that I see, any authority to Adam over Eve, or to men over 
                their wives, but only foretels [<foreign xml:lang="la">sic</foreign>] what should be the woman’s lot . . . ” (32–33).</p>
<p>These themes would be further developed by the writers Sarah Egerton, Catherine Trotter, Mary, Lady Chudleigh, and Mary 
                Astell during the reign of Queen Anne.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On female poets and Queen Anne, see 
                    Orr 40.</note> As Astell explained in the third edition of her <title level="m">Some Reflections Upon 
                    Marriage</title>, published in 1706, Queen Anne’s rule forced a reappraisal of patriarchy: “If by the Natural 
                Superiority of their Sex, they mean that every Man is by Nature superior to every Woman . . . it would be a Sin in any 
                Woman to have Dominion over any Man, and the greatest Queen ought not to command but to obey her Footman, because no 
                Municipal Laws can supersede or change the Law of Nature; so that if the Dominion of the Men be such, the Salique Law, 
                as unjust as English Men have ever thought it, ought to take place over all the Earth, and the most glorious 
                Reigns . . . were wicked Violations of the Law of Nature!” (3–4). Several others would adopt similar strategies in the 
                decades that followed, including the jurist Henry Homes (Lord Kames), Bluestockings Hester Thrale Piozzi and Elizabeth 
                Montagu, and the radical playwright Thomas Holcroft.</p>
<p>By the late eighteenth century, in fact, such strategies were commonplace in feminist circles. Even without a female 
                sovereign currently on the throne, a number of British radicals culled the past, and especially the royal past, in 
                order to stretch Enlightenment thinking on the function, value, and capabilities of women. As I discovered in writing 
                my first book on <title level="m">Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism</title>, late-Enlightenment “male 
                feminists” frequently invoked the principle of royal succession, and women’s prominent positions within the court more 
                generally, in fashioning arguments in favor of “women’s rights.” According to the Scottish Physician William Alexander, 
                there was a grave injustice in the fact that women could rule, but were forbidden from performing any lesser civil or 
                political functions. “In Britain,” he wrote in his <title level="m">History of Women</title> (1779), “we allow a woman 
                to sway our scepter, but by law and custom we debar her from every other government but that of her own family, as if 
                there were not a public employment between that of superintending the kingdom, and the affairs of her own kitchen, 
                which could be managed by the genius and capacity of woman” (2:439).</p>
<p>Other male reformers eager to inject a more egalitarian strain into British politics routinely underscored this same 
                point. Richard Dinmore and Thomas Starling Norgate, both Norwich-based radical reformers well known for their feminist 
                sympathies, stressed that “women’s rights” were firmly in keeping with Britain’s constitutional history, as reflected 
                in the nation’s royal succession policies. As Dinmore explained in his <title level="m">Brief Account of the Moral and 
                    Political Acts of the Kings and Queens of England</title> (1793), “The want of this right [women’s right to vote] 
                is peculiarly absurd in this kingdom, where a woman may reign, though not vote for a member of Parliament” (178–79). 
                To flesh out their arguments, Dinmore and Norgate drew attention to the fact that those queens who had actually served 
                the nation had been largely capable, and in some cases even highly adept at carrying out their demanding functions. In 
                this regard, Queen Elizabeth I especially became something of a lodestar. For Dinmore, Elizabeth “may fairly be 
                considered the best monarch that ever sat on the English throne.” “Indeed,” Dinmore continues, “the character of this 
                Queen convinces us of the injustice that has hitherto been done to the Rights of Women” (178). In Norgate’s similar 
                assessment, relayed in his “Observations on the Reign and Character of Queen Elizabeth,” Elizabeth I was a “great and 
                splendid” leader, who demonstrated by her very example that women should be accorded more power at all levels of society 
                and government (142–43).</p>
<p>Nor was it just the men who took up such arguments. The writers Mary Robinson and Mary Hays, two of Wollstonecraft’s 
                closest female interlocutors, also adopted comparable strategies. As the historian Mary Spongberg has suggested, the 
                royal female life held immense value for Robinson and Hays, who drew “on the lives of royal women in distinctly feminist 
                ways, critiquing the patriarchal strictures that shaped their lives and the absence of feminine influence in the 
                recounting of history” (74).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Spongberg 74 for further elaboration: “In developing 
                    this form of women’s history, such writers challenged masculinist generic conventions to carve out a uniquely 
                    feminine historical space in which to understand the condition of all women.”</note> We see such tendencies firmly 
                on display in these women’s writing. Robinson—former mistress to the Prince of Wales (the future King George IV)—used 
                Elizabeth I to measure the female sex’s inner if often thwarted potential. “Judge,” she commanded her readers in 
                her <title level="m">Letter to the Women of England</title> (1799), “whether England ever boasted a more wise or more 
                fortunate sovereign: one, more revered in council; more obeyed in power; or more successful in enterprize. And yet 
                Elizabeth was but a woman!” (29).</p>
<p>In her <title level="m">Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</title> (1798), Hays also explored this 
                theme: “Let it not be said that crowned heads are too much out of the common road, to be brought forward for examples; 
                for as they are neither more nor less than men and women, they come quite within our sphere” (36). Given that queens 
                were <emph>only</emph> women, Hays explained, it was well worth considering their achievements. They deserved a central 
                place in any inquiry into, and argument in favor of women’s improved treatment. Over twenty years later, Hays would 
                offer more sober reflections on this point in her <title level="m">Memoirs of Queens</title> (1821)—especially in her 
                striking meditation on Queen Caroline, the estranged wife of George IV. On becoming King in 1820, George IV had tried 
                to obtain a divorce from Caroline on the grounds of adultery, much to the chagrin of his angry subjects. Recounting the 
                trial of Queen Caroline, and the public’s impassioned response, Hays suggested that the occasion had emboldened women 
                to rise up in “common cause against the despotism and tyranny of man.” To “<emph>equity</emph> not gallantry,” she 
                observed, “do [women] now prefer their claim” (127). According to Hays, then, Queen Caroline’s public humiliations had 
                inspired women to speak up in defense of their own rights and prerogatives. In this way, even royal women’s misfortunes 
                could be used to salutary effect.</p>
<p>Once Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, these kinds of arguments only accelerated. On the one hand, 
                nineteenth-century activists were deeply interested in Victoria as a woman, and used her to demonstrate that the female 
                sex had the capacity to reason, to grapple with politics, and even to balance their professional and familial 
                obligations. Here, after all, was a woman who—by necessity—was pursuing joint commitments in the private and public 
                sphere. As the leading suffragist campaigner Millicent Garrett Fawcett explained in her <title level="m">Life of Her 
                    Majesty Queen Victoria</title>, published to coincide with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria had proven 
                definitively that women could combine work and family. “Politics and political responsibilities of the greatest kind 
                have not unsexed her,” she observed in a chapter entitled “The Warp and Woof of Home and Politics” (225). By extension, 
                activists were also quick to call attention to any unfair treatment that they perceived the Queen to be receiving, or to 
                expose what they construed as sexism. A reporter for the London <title level="j">Daily News</title>, for example, took 
                to task those “political misogynists” who insisted that “all the credit usually given to female Sovereigns belongs to 
                their male advisers, and that all the mischief done under the reigns of men may be attributed to the feminine influences 
                which surrounded them” (<title level="j">Daily News</title> 5).</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, Victorian women’s rights campaigners were interested in promoting the simple fact that their 
                nation now had a female head of state. Victoria’s status alone gave them plenty of ammunition. As feminist advocates 
                frequently noted, echoing their seventeenth- and eighteenth-century predecessors, was it not extremely paradoxical that 
                women were permitted to rule in Britain while their female subjects, up until the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
                at least, were denied most of the rights and privileges accorded to men? “Every wife except a queen regnant,” Linda 
                Colley reminds us, “was under the legal authority of her husband, and so was her movable property”—and this dispossession 
                persisted until the passage of the Married Women’s Property Acts in 1870 and 1882 (238). On the political front, the 
                disjuncture was even more striking. Even at the close of Victoria’s rule, in 1901, British women still lacked the 
                parliamentary franchise—a right that men had secured through the successive Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884, but that 
                women would only be granted in 1918, with the passage of the Representation of the People Act (and even then, the law 
                only applied to women over the age of 30).</p>
<p>Leading nineteenth-century women’s rights campaigners frequently seized on this paradox and tried to exploit it for 
                various reasons: to demonstrate their loyalty to the Queen, to celebrate (and sometimes even inflate) Victoria’s political 
                prerogatives, and to call attention to the national tradition of including women in the royal line of succession. All of 
                these became prominent features of Victorian campaigning, especially in regard to the question of the female franchise. 
                “But if those,” the leading feminist spokesperson Harriet Taylor wrote in the <title level="j">Westminster Review</title> 
                in 1851, “who assert that the ‘proper sphere’ for women is the domestic, mean by this that they have not shown themselves 
                qualified for any other, the assertion evinces great ignorance of life and of history.” “Women,” she added, “have shown 
                fitness for the highest social functions, exactly in proportion as they have been admitted to them. By a curious anomaly, 
                though ineligible to even the lowest office of state, they are in some countries admitted to the highest of all, the 
                regal . . . Concerning the fitness, then, of women for politics, there can be no question. . . .” (297).</p>

<p>As Wollstonecraft’s comments in the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                and <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> suggest, she too 
                was susceptible to this line of thinking, even if hers was a more muted strain than that of many of her peers. Her probing 
                comments about Queen Caroline Matilda, her endorsements of “history” and “heroic characters,” and even her dismay at 
                Thomas Christie’s comments in regards to the French Revolutionaries’ preservation of the Salic Law—all of these impulses 
                suggest that Wollstonecraft too saw in the history of monarchy some of the raw material out of which to vindicate her sex. 
                Inasmuch as Wollstonecraft has come to serve as a placeholder for or signifier of modern western feminist commitments, 
                then, I see three key reasons why we should be more attuned to these aspects of her work, with significance both for our 
                understanding of Wollstonecraft herself and for the broader feminist conversation in which she was, and indeed remains, 
                a central participant.</p>
<p>First, being attentive to these dimensions of Wollstonecraft’s thinking alerts us to the range of traditions in which 
                 Wollstonecraft was working—and to the range of traditions which have informed western feminism more generally. To 
                 appreciate the historical bent of some of Wollstonecraft’s thinking is to recognize, as scholars have increasingly tried 
                 to stress, that Wollstonecraft, like so many of her peers and followers, was never operating exclusively within the 
                 framework of natural rights or what we might describe as Enlightenment liberalism. Rather, “modern” feminism emerged 
                 from eclectic origins, and developed by drawing on insights and inspirations from a range of sources. It was, and 
                 continues to be, animated by many different logics—sometimes even contradictory ones. Wollstonecraft drew on natural 
                 rights philosophy, yes. But she also drew on constitutional theory, English history, the “woman worthy” tradition, and 
                 the theology of Rational Dissent. The goal here, then, is not to downplay the significance of natural rights in the 
                 evolution of feminism, but rather to see it as one of many currents. Feminism is not, and never has been, a linear 
                 development.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This is one of the points that I develop in my book. See Chernock, 
                     <title level="m">Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism</title>.</note>
</p>
<p>This brings me to my second point. 
                 A greater attention to Wollstonecraft’s historical interests, especially in regard to the history of royal women, 
                 does more than simply illuminate the range of forces shaping early feminist conversations. When read alongside the 
                 treatises penned by her peers and successors, Wollstonecraft’s engagement with the past also suggests that history, 
                 and particularly royal history, seems to have exercised a strong pull in women’s rights deliberations—and in the 
                 broader construction of what Barbara Taylor has described as the “feminist imagination.” It is not, then, just that 
                 queens and princesses figured in early feminist conversations. Rather, it is that they figured prominently and 
                 persistently. These royal women, moreover, were typically culled from a specifically British past, though women 
                 from other cultures and traditions were also referenced on occasion (especially in those works situated at the nexus 
                 of feminist argument and female biography—consider, for example, Mary Hays’s <title level="m">Female Biography; or 
                     Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries</title>, published in 1803).</p>
<p>The national dimensions of this story are especially worthy of consideration. For the feminism that emerged in 
                 Britain, in fits and starts during the seventeenth century and then in a more fully fleshed-out form from the late 
                 eighteenth century, was built on very particular and often quite hopeful readings of the nation’s past. National 
                 traditions and customs, especially as pertaining to the tradition of female royal leadership, played a key role in 
                 the development of British feminism. We need to bear this national context in mind, as it reminds us that feminism 
                 cannot always be easily exported—grafted, as it were, onto other societies. Rather, we need to recognize the ways in 
                 which women’s rights conversations, even in their most nascent stages, were often informed by a keen sense of national 
                 pride, and even of patriotism. However instrumental or manufactured their gestures may have been, women’s rights 
                 advocates were eager to fashion a “useable history,” drawing on their nation’s past, in order to legitimate their 
                 egalitarian vision. In fact, feminism took root in Britain in part because it appealed to a shared cultural and 
                 political inheritance. In short, Queens Elizabeth I, Anne, and Victoria mattered—as Queen Elizabeth II does today. 
                 While this is not to suggest that feminisms cannot circulate and combine beyond national borders, it is to appreciate 
                 that such arguments often resonate best when they can appeal to the local and specific as well as to the universal 
                 and the general.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Chernock, <title level="a">Gender and the Politics of 
                     Exceptionalism</title> for a further elaboration of this argument.</note>
</p>
<p>My third and final point relates to 
                 early feminists’ fascination with female sovereigns and other members of the royal family, and with what this 
                 fascination might tell us about the continuing—and often misunderstood—appeal of the monarchy. In this respect, 
                 this point has the most direct connection to our present moment. In contemporary feminist circles, I have found 
                 that royal watching is often dismissed as a mindless or trivial practice. And the study of elites, royals especially, 
                 continues to receive little attention from scholars of women and gender—especially from those studying the modern 
                 period (the period following the Glorious Revolution of 1688). “Studies of British womanhood,” observes Clarissa 
                 Campbell Orr in <title level="m">Queenship in Britain</title>, “have, with valuable exceptions . . . tended to focus 
                 on women of middling or lower social rank; aside from the attention given to Caroline of Brunswick, feminist 
                 historians have yet to revisit the royal family and are only just starting on the aristocracy” (7).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Orr notes, however, that “much is to be gained for women’s history and feminist history by 
                     looking at women at the social apex, including their roles, representations and symbolic importance for other 
                     men and women . . . They could influence taste, fashion, social customs and moral values” (7).</note> This 
                 distancing and denigration extends to what we often describe as “girlie-girl culture,” with its emphasis on 
                 Disneyfied versions of princesses and queens. As the cultural critic Peggy Orenstein observes in her influential 
                 book <title level="m">Cinderella Ate My Daughter</title>, marketers have found increasingly successful ways to ply 
                 their pink princess products to their youngest consumers. In the process, she argues, they communicate insidious 
                 messages about female dependence, desire, and beauty.</p>
<p>On this score, even the contemporary British royal family comes in for scrutiny. For the historian Charles Beem, 
                 Queen Elizabeth II offers little by way of feminist inspiration or example. “Elizabeth II,” he writes, “has never 
                 been inclined to erase the gendered distinctions between her male and female household officers. Like all her 
                 predecessors as female kings, Elizabeth II is an honorary male, with no apparent interest in furthering feminist 
                 goals of gender equality for her female subjects” (177–78). And the author Hilary Mantel provided a particularly 
                 scathing assessment of monarchy in the pages of the <title level="j">London Review of Books</title> (2013), where 
                 she described the Duchess of Cambridge as “becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung,” a woman who 
                 allowed herself to be crafted into someone whose “only point and purpose” was “to give birth.”</p>
<p>To be sure, critics like Orenstein, Beem, and Mantel make some astute points. There is nothing inherently empowering 
                 about studying, citing, emulating, or being a queen or princess. In truth, the British royal family has often been 
                 used to promote conservative, even retrograde, gender roles and ideals. (A survey of antisuffragist posters and flyers 
                 from the Edwardian period, with their enthusiastic references to Queen Victoria and her belief in the “mad, wicked 
                 folly” of women’s rights, quickly confirms this.) And many of the biographies of royal women churned out each year 
                 often do more to reinforce than to undermine patriarchal values and assumptions. Female members of the royal family, 
                 too, have at times played a complicit role in this process—despite the egalitarian dimensions of their institution. 
                 By the same token, there is also a troubling fixation on particular moments in the female life cycle—especially 
                 marriage—in the gendered royal fantasies sold to young girls by companies such as Disney.</p>
<p>Yet, when placed within the much longer tradition of feminist activism, such practices take on more complex meanings. 
                 Though occupying positions that were indeed “beyond the reach of most women,” royal women performed and, I would 
                 argue, continue to perform, a vital function in the elaboration of British and western feminisms (Cowman 17). This 
                 is especially true of (though not limited to) queens regnant. As I have indicated here, queens regnant provided an 
                 early legal framework for demanding women’s right to vote, as well as their right to own property and to receive an 
                 education more on par with men’s. What is more, they offered examples of real women in the public sphere—women 
                 leading the state, engaging in the political process, heading the Church of England and the military, participating 
                 in charitable activities, and (in the case of Anne, Victoria, and Elizabeth II) balancing their weighty 
                 responsibilities with the needs of their husbands and children. This all while conducting their private lives in the 
                 public eye and confronting their own fair share of misogyny and mistreatment along the way. Little wonder that queens 
                 regnant, and royal women more generally, opened up a space for women to write their own histories. For as Gina Luria 
                 Walker, Mary Spongberg, Benjamin Dabby, and Karen O’Brien have suggested, royal women’s very visibility emboldened 
                 women to write their pasts as part of a national story—a story that was in part celebratory, and in part attuned to 
                 continuing imbalances and inequities.</p>
<p>These associations, I would argue, continued to exert a hold well into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, 
                 even as the monarchy itself has adopted a much more strictly ceremonial position. How else to explain the fact that 
                 Helena Normanton, the first practicing female barrister in Britain, devoted so much of her writing for popular 
                 periodicals during the 1920s and 30s to discussion of the history of queens and the liberating precedent established 
                 with Britain’s rejection of the Salic Law? Indeed, as Normanton insisted in the pages of <title level="j">Good 
                     Housekeeping</title>, in reflecting on her own trail-blazing career, Queen Victoria had “helped women . . . by 
                 her own professional achievements as a ruler” (74).</p>
<p>And how else to explain the fact that some women expressed similar stirrings watching “Princess Elizabeth” grow up 
                 during the 1930s and 40s, relishing the prospect of Elizabeth one day assuming a role that would in some ways 
                 necessarily disrupt male-female relations? We see tantalizing evidence of this phenomenon borne out in women’s and 
                 girls’ euphoric responses to Elizabeth once she ascended the throne in 1952—a euphoria to which Mass Observation data 
                 collected at the time bears ample witness. For the young Margaret Thatcher, just recently married and keen to enter 
                 politics, the symbolism of Queen Elizabeth II’s accession was charged indeed. “Women can—<emph>and must</emph>—play 
                 a leading part in the creation of a glorious Elizabethan era,” Thatcher wrote in an article titled “Wake Up, Women,” 
                 which appeared in the <title level="j">Sunday Graphic</title> shortly after Elizabeth’s succession.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Thatcher notes in her opening paragraph, echoing Victorian suffragists’ arguments, “A young 
                     Queen, the loveliest ever to reign over us, now occupies the highest position in the land. If as many earnestly 
                     pray, the accession of Elizabeth II can help to remove the last shreds of prejudice against women aspiring to 
                     the highest places, then a new era for women will indeed be at hand. We owe it to the Queen—and to the memory 
                     of a father who set her such a wonderful example throughout his life—to play our part with increasing 
                     enterprises in the years ahead. I hope we shall see more and more women combining marriage and a career. 
                     Prejudice against this dual role is not confined to men. Far too often, I regret to say it comes from our own 
                     sex.”</note> A similar headiness was on display in 1950s America. One female analyst accounted for women’s 
                 interest in Elizabeth by noting that “Philip takes orders from Elizabeth . . . What wife doesn’t secretly wish she 
                 had the same authority?” As another American analyst put it, this was the first time “that the women of America have 
                 found a heroine who makes them feel superior to men” (qtd. in Prochaska 166). To be sure, these responses may have 
                 stemmed from some degree of (perhaps willful) misreading of Elizabeth II’s limited constitutional role in the modern 
                 British state. Nonetheless, they demonstrate the persistence of queenship as a radical construct.</p>
<p>The bond that Princess Diana formed with women during the 1980s and 90s—both in life and death—also points to the 
                 continuing subversive uses of the British monarchy. As with Queen Caroline’s subjects in the early nineteenth 
                 century, Diana’s followers also included those who saw in their Princess a means of airing larger grievances about 
                 women’s status, the sexual double standard, and the cruelties and disappointments of marriage. Diana herself did 
                 quite a bit to promote this image, especially in the last years of her life. What is more, she took great pains to 
                 debunk the princess fantasy and demonstrate that there is no such thing as “happily ever after.” The “after” might 
                 not even include marriage. As she explained during her tell-all 1995 television interview, “You know, people think 
                 that at the end of the day, a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me” (qtd. in Lyall). 
                 It may well be that some young girls today have this message in mind when they don their princess attire. To play 
                 the part of queen or princess might allow girls not just to daydream about love, beauty, and marriage, but also to 
                 imagine themselves in positions of authority—ruling, deciding, leading. Even Disney seems to have cottoned onto this 
                 possibility (or at least recognized that a focus on girls’ empowerment might also move products). Tellingly, the 
                 company recently launched a global “Dream Big, Princess” campaign. Its message: “For every girl who dreams big, 
                 there’s a Princess to show her it’s possible.”</p>
<p>In this context, it is not that surprising that the actress and women’s rights activist Emma Watson—a UN Women 
                 Goodwill Ambassador who helped to launch the HeForShe campaign in 2014—opted to play Belle in the recent live-action 
                 remake of <title level="m">Beauty and the Beast</title>. Such interpretations are only gaining greater prominence 
                 now that the outspoken feminist Meghan Markle has joined the royal family. Since becoming the Duchess of Sussex, 
                 Markle has been very public in her campaigning to end “period poverty” and expand the global reach of feminism. She 
                 has also made clear that her husband and son will be involved in this mission. As the duchess explained recently, 
                 “It’s impossible for me to sit back and not do anything.”</p>
<p>These are some initial thoughts on the subject. But they point to the ways in which our contemporary fascination 
                 with the monarchy—and especially with female royalty—might be filtered through a feminist lens. This lens only 
                 provides a sharper focus, moreover, when we take into consideration the broader sweep of women’s and gender history. 
                 For the monarchy has long informed feminist arguments and practices, and helped to nurture alternative, more 
                 egalitarian, and at times quite subversive understandings of women’s role in the nation. Indeed, as I have tried 
                 to show here, even Mary Wollstonecraft—that iconic though often misunderstood “mother of feminism”—found that 
                 queens could be quite helpful to think with. For all of her emphasis on women’s natural rights, Wollstonecraft 
                 recognized that culture, and specifically her own culture, also had its uses.</p>

<p rend="noCount">This essay uses recent feminist work on <title level="m">Antigone</title> to investigate a

<emph>As a professional Romanticist, I’ve spent time swimming in pools—lakes, ponds—of melancholy and loss. In 
                    this liquid milieu, I learned about tears and thoughts too deep for tears. Lately though, I find myself in a 
                    more desiccated landscape, lit with fiery rage. When I was young, feelings of sorrow and rage converged; it 
                    seemed to me all one terrain. The girl cried while fighting; she fought while crying. Now I stare at the 
                    response emoji on Facebook where a face wet with tears sits apart from one burning with anger, each a distinct 
                    emotional ecosystem. In these heydays of chaos, can’t we find ways to hold together tears and anger, water and 
                    fire?</emph>
</p>
<p>Part of this question I borrow from Stanley Cavell, as he considers “the unknown woman” of Hollywood melodramas 
                    of the ’30s and 40s. Are we up to, he wonders, have we forms of intelligibility strong enough to match “the 
                    heydays of chaos reaching our ears?” (Cavell 45). For Cavell, the heroine of melodrama presents one such form. 
                    She figures a specific kind of unknown-ness, he writes, in which she appears “powerless to make [herself] known,” 
                    because in the current world she remains unwelcome on her own terms. Equally unheard on her own terms, this 
                    misfit inhabits extreme states of structural “voicelessness,” an incomprehension or suppression of her voice that 
                    can amount to “suffocation” (43). In the isolation which attends the voicelessness of the heroine of melodrama, 
                    Cavell discovers the source of her critical power, “her ability to judge the world” (16). In addition to the 
                    unknown woman, other features distinguish these melodramas: conversation brought to an impasse (particularly 
                    between woman and man); a past that has been “frozen, mysterious, with topics forbidden”; and “the negation of 
                    marriage itself,” especially “marriage as a route to creation” and happiness (6).<note place="foot" resp="editors">All these features mark the two literary texts that motivate this essay, Mary 
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence</title> and Sophocles’ 
                        <title level="m">Antigone.</title>
</note> But it is most pointedly in the theatrical, excessive, desperate, 
                    and, I would add, often lyrical expression of a woman’s suffocating voicelessness that we find the possibility 
                    of alternate, alien forms of intelligibility, forms strong enough perhaps to match our own heydays of 
                    chaos.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Structural madness” is Cavell’s useful characterization of this woman’s 
                        position.</note>

<p>The melodrama of the unknown woman is for Cavell an avenue to philosophy itself (“the opening knowledge of the 
                    human is conceived as the experience of being unknown”), its gendered politics muted though not absolutely 
                    unvoiced (22).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In her <title level="a">Reply to Cavell</title> and 
                        <title level="m">Feminism Without Women</title>, Modleski offers an early feminist critique of Cavell’s 
                        treatment of film melodrama. He responds to her charges in <title level="m">Contesting Tears</title> (30–37) 
                        even as he admits his “repeated reluctance to attempt to catch the tide of debate on this issue of gender” 
                        (30).</note> Several feminist thinkers have effectively bent Cavell’s insights toward a consideration of 
                    modern feminism, itself often unwelcome and unheard on its own terms. Like Cavell they discover surprising 
                    resources embedded in melodrama. Lauren Berlant, Sara Ahmed, and others have pinpointed the melodramatic “female 
                    complaint,” “feminist killjoy,” and “affect alien” as agents of feminist and queer critique. To resist “getting 
                    along,” to refuse to “move on” or align with conventional notions of progress and happiness serves, in Ahmed’s 
                    words, to “expose the bad feelings that get hidden, displaced, or negated”—and consequently unknown—“under public 
                    signs of joy.” If one recognizes “the objects that promise happiness to be not quite so promising,” a coincident 
                    sadness and anger may leap forth (Ahmed 38–39). Melodrama relies on those angrily sad and sadly angry ones who, in 
                    Ahmed’s terms, are “prepared to kill some forms of joy”— even if it requires, in some cases, killing themselves 
                    (50).</p>

<p>These concerns—of sorrow as anger, of voicelessness as voices unheard—and the forms for their intelligibility all  
                    meet in Mary Wollstonecraft’s last finished work, the remarkable <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short 
                        Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796). The same concerns motivate Bonnie Honig’s revisionary 
                    reading of Sophocles’ <title level="m">Antigone</title> for contemporary feminist political theory. Approaching 
                    the <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title> as Honig approaches <title level="m">Antigone</title>, through the lens of melodrama, makes intelligible feminist possibilities in 
                    Wollstonecraft’s most plaintive—and, I would suggest, quite angry—work, composed between her two attempts at 
                    suicide. When we place Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written</title> alongside recent feminist work 
                    on <title level="m">Antigone</title>, we begin to hear what is unvoiced or barely voiced in her writing. We discover 
                    a vital and timely feminist poetics.</p>
<p>In turning to <title level="m">Antigone</title>, feminist scholars add a question prior to the one concerning forms 
                    of intelligibility: do we have ears disposed to catch the un- or under-known, the un- or under-voiced? When 
                    Sophocles’ heroine reflects, “I’m a strange new kind of in-between thing, aren’t I? / Not at home with the dead or 
                    the living,” the Theban Chorus refuses to hear her: “You’re too extreme / you reckless girl” (Sophocles 39). When 
                    Wollstonecraft, writing to Gilbert Imlay after her first suicide attempt, writes: "I . . . seem to have no home, 
                    no resting place to look to—I am strangely cast off," is she also too extreme? Is he even listening? (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:426–27). Wollstonecraft rewrote this and other letters from her travels in Scandinavia 
                    for the published <title level="m">Letters Written</title>. Even after reclaiming her letters, though, her 
                    questions persist: “Life, what art thou? Where goes this breath? this I, so much alive?” (6:279). How much does 
                    her reader hear in that cry?</p>

<p>It may be a perverse thought, that a feminism derived from Sophocles’ <title level="m">Antigone</title> can teach 
                    us something about Wollstonecraft. I want to pursue that thought, and also reverse it, so that we find 
                    Wollstonecraft shaping the reception of a feminist Antigone. Investigation suggests the story of Antigone had 
                    no direct influence on Wollstonecraft. In his sweeping survey, <title level="m">Antigones: How the Antigone Legend 
                        Has Endured in Western Literature, Art, and Thought</title>, 
                    George Steiner dates the start of the “Antigone vogue” almost exactly to the time of Wollstonecraft’s death. He 
                    muses that she, Jeanne Manon Roland, and Germaine de Stael share a “resonance” that anticipates Antigone’s 
                    subsequent Romantic appeal (Steiner 7, 10). Whether <title level="m">Antigone</title> “resonated” with 
                    Wollstonecraft, whether she read or saw the play, remains unknown. A student of the philosophical travelogue, 
                    she very probably read Barthélemy’s popular <title level="m">Travels of Anacharsis the Younger</title> (1788), 
                    where, after watching Sophocles’ tragedy performed, Anacharsis stands exhausted: “I had no more tears to shed” 
                    (qtd. in Steiner 7).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="j">The Analytical Review</title>, where 
                        Wollstonecraft often published, noted with joy the election of Barthélemy, “the author of Anarcharsis,” 
                        “a man of letters, of genius, of sublime views” to the French Directorate. <title level="a">National 
                            Affairs,</title> vol. 25, no. 6, Jun. 1797, 668.</note> Steiner finds this dehydrated “seminal 
                    passage . . .  echoed” by Antigone’s male admirers throughout the nineteenth century (7). We know that 
                    <title level="m">Antigone</title> captivated German philosophers and poets circa 1800, that Wollstonecraft’s 
                    son-in-law Percy Shelley later confessed his adoration for the play’s “godlike victim” (“Some of us,” he wrote, 
                    “have in a prior existence been in love with an Antigone”); and we know, thanks to Yopie Prins, that Antigone was 
                    an alluring figure for later “women of Greek Letters” (qtd. in Steiner 10; Prins 234–36). Yet in eighteenth-century 
                    literary circles, Antigone remained a minor character, seldom on stage and celebrated primarily as devoted daughter 
                    or star-crossed lover, with no signal appeal for women intellectuals. That Antigone had little appeal, found no 
                    audience, accords with a point she makes herself: “O reaches of the plains of Thebes,” she complains, “no one sheds 
                    a tear for me” (Sophocles 39). Wollstonecraft makes a similar cry, near the close of her <title level="m">Letters</title>, “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted tear!’” (6:344). 
                    This last, perplexing cry will return later, but for now it tells that the legacy of Wollstonecraft, like that 
                    of Antigone, is tied up with the limits not just of intelligibility, but also of tears: a melodramatic 
                    legacy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Horrocks’ edition points out that this line echoes a line from

<p>In addition to the apparent anachronism of my pairing, there is the generic mismatch of a figure from classical 
                    tragedy with an epistolary first-person narrator. Antigone: tragic, timeless, defiant even of worldly time. 
                    Wollstonecraft’s traveler: subject to a historical moment she strains to transcend. Her persona—a single mother 
                    traveling alone after a period of emotional duress, writing to an unresponsive “you”—appears ripe for film 
                    melodrama, uncannily like the anonymous woman in Max Ophuls’ <title level="m">Letter from an Unknown Woman</title> 
                    or Charlotte Vane in <title level="m">Now Voyager</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Berlant on travel

                        (81–114, 115–50).</note> Despite generic discrepancies, though, Antigone and Wollstonecraft do both serve as 
                    icons for Western feminism: person and persona, melodramatic and tragic, larger than life. It’s worth recalling 
                    Lacan’s thought that the “figure of Antigone forms part of our [i.e., Western] morality” whether we know it or 
                    not; worth recalling too is Honig’s conviction that “the idea that we [in the West] could . . . think politically 
                    in ways untouched by [Antigone] is as improbable as Oedipus’s hope that he could . . . live out his life . . . 
                    untouched by fate” (Lacan 284; Honig 37). By these accounts, any feminist politics or moral philosophy 
                    <emph>must</emph> be touched by Antigone. Lacan’s thought and Honig’s conviction suggest a Wollstonecraft—and 
                    a feminism—inevitably touched by tragedy, myth, and fatalism. They suggest consequently the touch of 
                    timelessness brushing against any feminism living in time.</p>
<p>But what of the inverse, the conviction that Wollstonecraft’s Romantic feminism, a feminism <emph>in time</emph>, 
                    touches on myth? Or that Antigone cannot be understood without Wollstonecraft?<note place="foot" resp="editors">Cecilia Sjöholm pivots from Hegel’s reading of Antigone to the feminist ethics of 
                        Wollstonecraft’s writings in order to investigate Antigone’s role in “the invention of feminine desire” 
                        (Sjöholm 14–27).</note> When Steiner remarks that the “life” of Wollstonecraft “resonates” with the figure 
                    of Antigone elevated by nineteenth-century writers, he implies that Wollstonecraft forecasts the image of 
                    Antigone forged by Schiller, Hegel, and subsequent writers: a modern Antigone “emblematic of a programme of 
                    feminine emancipation and political parity” (Steiner 9–10). If, for instance, one considers Antigone from the 
                    angle of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written</title>, striking correlations appear. Neither woman 
                    “knows her place”: they insist on venturing outside the walls of domestic space. Both stand—scandalously—outside 
                    the institution of marriage. Both provoke comment that they speak like men. Both women find themselves in a 
                    landscape riven by war and death. Isolated by grief, each announces her grievances against the gendered lifeworld 
                    that surrounds her, a lifeworld that hardly responds. Each obsesses about confinement, suffocation, and being shut 
                    up. Each identifies repeatedly with birds and other creatures with wings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Birds 
                        are a persistent motif in <title level="m">Antigone</title>. Wollstonecraft invokes “wings” nine times in 
                        the <title level="m">Letters Written</title>, and notices crows, bitterns, geese, and other birds 
                        repeatedly.</note> Despite opposition and neglect, each woman labors to hold forth. They take, we are told 
                    repeatedly, their time. And each one attempts to take her life.</p>
<p>With these resonances in mind, one can begin to see how, marked by the limits of gender, by suicide and mourning, 
                    the tragedy of <title level="m">Antigone</title> and Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written During a 
                        Short Residence</title> both reach for forms that confound the sorrow of this world with unending rage. In 
                    doing so, they adopt timelessness, unendingness, as a critical alternative to living in the present.</p>

<p>Sophocles’ tragedy opens at dawn, with Antigone trying to recruit her sister Ismene’s help in burying their 
                    brother Polyneikes. Their uncle Kreon, ruler of Thebes, has commanded that Polyneikes’ corpse remain unburied 
                    and dishonored, carrion for the birds that circle beyond the walls of the city. When Ismene balks, Antigone 
                    grows scornful. The scene ends with Antigone rebuking her sister: “I would not take your help now if you asked 
                    me” and with Ismene offering this blessing: “Go then but know / although you go without your mind / you go as

<p>Soon afterward a sentry reports to Kreon that Polyneikes’ corpse has been mysteriously covered with dust; later, 
                    guards catch Antigone trying to re-cover it. Kreon sentences his rebellious niece to be buried alive. Ismene 
                    begs to join her; Antigone declines the offer: “Take heart and live, Ismene / my soul died long ago” (30). In 
                    an extended dirge for herself, Antigone names her prison in terms that reduce a woman’s life to one claustral 
                    spot: “O tomb / O bridal chamber / O house in the ground forever” (40). She is to be shut up, “bastilled . . . for 
                    life,” to quote Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Maria</title> (<title level="m">Works</title>

                    does Ismene, last of the children of Oedipus and Jocasta. Beside himself with grief as the play ends, the ruler 
                    speaks of himself in the third person: “Kreon no more exists than someone who does not exist” (Sophocles 54).</p>

<p>For recent feminist thinkers, <title level="m">Antigone</title> plays a crucial role.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Walsh provides an excellent survey of recent feminist engagement with <title level="m">Antigone</title> in criticism and performance. Feminist classicists especially, in the words of 
                    Page Dubois, seek a more “heterogeneous, unstable, polymorphous kind of reading” of Greek tragedy (qtd. in 
                    Walsh 7).</note> Twice Judith Butler reflects on the play, in readings that respond to the last two centuries 
                    of Western philosophical inquiry. Like her predecessors, Butler emphasizes Antigone’s defense of the burial of 
                    her brother. But <title level="m">Antigone’s Claim</title> (2000) also presents the heroine as the daughter of 
                    incest who loves her dead, traitorous brother in excess of law, contesting thereby the assumed interdependency 
                    of laws of kinship and laws of state. Antigone’s words, by which the monstrously “unspeakable nevertheless 
                    makes itself heard,” are governed, Butler proposes, by catachresis, the rhetorical figure or intelligible form 
                    which “exploit[s] the very terms . . . meant to enforce its silence”: voicelessness voiced (<title level="m">Claim</title> 78; also 82). In <title level="m">Precarious Life</title> (2004), written in the 
                    early years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Butler again recommends Antigone, this time as a model for mourning 
                    that crosses the lines of enmity and amity, private and public, life and death. “Risking death herself to bury 
                    her brother against the edict of Creon,” this latter Antigone “exemplifies the political risks in defying the 
                    ban against public grief” (<title level="m">Precarious</title> 46). (Like others, Butler mutes Antigone’s 
                    suicide.)<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">Home Fire: A Novel</title>, Kamila Shamsie’s 2017 
                        fictional adaptation and update of <title level="m">Antigone</title>, treats the suicide at length—a 
                        rarity.</note> Antigone’s classical status—that is, her felt timelessness—strengthens Butler’s claims for 
                    a general sense of shared mortality, as Keri Walsh has argued. Antigone secures an eternal return to the end 
                    of human life: as it has been, so it will be, ever-endingly.</p>
<p>Butler’s meditations on mourning lean heavily on the expression I used to describe Kreon: “beside himself.” To 
                    be “<emph>beside oneself</emph> with rage or grief”—Butler binds the two emotions—is to be <emph>ecstatic</emph>, 
                    she explains (<title level="m">Precarious</title> 24). Ecstasy supplants catachresis as the chosen form of 
                    intelligibility.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It hints too at the Dionysian rituals surrounding Athenian 
                        tragedy, performed just outside, “beside,” the Agora, the space of democratic debate (Loraux 24–25).</note> 
                    Though she associates a politics of ecstasy with “the feminist and lesbian/gay movements” of previous decades, 
                    Butler muses that perhaps such being beside oneself is “more persistent . . . maybe it is with us all along” 
                    (24). Maybe it is classic rather than historical. Here Butler finds the source of community: “Despite our 
                    differences in location and history,” she remarks, “Loss has made a tenuous ‘we’ of us all” (20).</p>
<p>On this account, neither “I” nor “we” have much choice about loss; being exposed happens inevitably—a 
                    circumstance that puts us within the ambit of tragedy. Butler accepts that “any narrative of personal 
                    grief <emph>would have to be</emph> a story in which the very ‘I’ who seeks to tell the story is stopped in 
                    the midst of the telling; the very ‘I’ is called into question by its relation to the Other (23; emphasis 
                    added). Such acute self-consciousness echoes Kreon, the ruler, at the end of the tragedy. Beside himself with 
                    grief, “seeking refuge from sovereignty,” he acknowledges the flimsiness of “I”: “Take Kreon away / he no more 
                    exists than someone who does not exist” (Honig 89; Sophocles 54).</p>
<figure rend="leftFloat">
<graphic width="270px" url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/wollstonecraft/images/Favret_margin7.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>Via tragedy, Butler cultivates the timelessness of loss for the ecstatic state it discloses, a state that was 
                    there all along. It must inevitably overwhelm each living “I,” inviting it to become larger than life, more 
                    self-consciously mortal yet more ecstatically—in grief, in rage—beside itself with others, living or dead (the 
                    distinction hardly matters). But Antigone does not share this welcome fatality; Kreon does. Yes, Antigone buries 
                    her outlaw brother. Yes, she embraces the dead as she heads toward death. But the wailing lament she delivers is 
                    for herself. Voiced proleptically before she dies, staged before the chorus, her dirge protests the sentence of 
                    death and calls down vengeance. If Antigone claims timelessness, she does so by defiantly taking time for 
                    herself. She leaves not on Kreon’s terms or timetable, immured in a cave, waiting to suffocate. She refuses that 
                    fatal air. Instead she takes her own life, stealing the sovereign prerogative. Coming halfway through the play, 
                    her suicide does not fulfill tragedy. Her chosen mode of death is not inevitable.</p>
<p>There is losing, and there is also taking. “Take heart,” she instructs her sister, “and live” (30).</p>

<p>My reading of Butler’s Antigone is prompted by <title level="m">Antigone, Interrupted</title> (2013), written by 
                    feminist political theorist Bonnie Honig. In part a response to <title level="m">Precarious Life</title>, 
                    Honig’s book cautions against the pull of “precarity” for at least two reasons. First, because ecstatic grief 
                    risks blunting anger. In undoing sovereign power, that is, grief can undo the contestation necessary to a vital 
                    politics.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Butler offers her reflections as “beside” argumentation (<title level="m">Precarious Life</title> 19, 24–25).</note> Second, Honig questions a humanism and feminism defined 
                    by fatality rather than natality. She cites Hannah Arendt’s <title level="m">The Human Condition</title> to claim 
                    that being mortal “does not mean that we are born to die.” By extension, “the fact that we grieve does not mean 
                    that grief and grievability should be the center of our politics” (Honig 119–20). Honig could have recruited 
                    Luce Irigaray as well, whose most recent reflections center on Antigone’s devotion to a cosmically full life-world, 
                    where the burial of corpses is an act of ecological responsibility. For Irigaray, “The supreme value for 
                    [Antigone] is life. No other value can substitute for it: no abstract ideal, no truth or absolute” 
                    (Irigaray 9).</p>
<p>In the light of natality, Honig recasts Butler’s ecstatic grief into fierce, combative grievance. “<emph>To 
                    grieve</emph>,” she reminds us, “is both extra-political . . . and fundamentally political” in often 
                    uncomfortable ways. “The term connotes mourning, resistance to injustice, reification of wrong and,” she adds, 
                    “vengeance for it.” Grievance actively “takes sides” (120). Such grievance ripples the surface, for instance, 
                    when Wollstonecraft warns her reader, “I am sad . . . and have cause” (6:331).</p>
<figure rend="leftFloat">
<graphic width="345px" url="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/wollstonecraft/images/Favret_margin9.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>Within this layered sense of grievance in Sophocles’ drama, Honig finds active conspiracy. She asks us to hear 
                    the link between <emph>conspire</emph> and <emph>aspire</emph> (perhaps <emph>inspire</emph> and 
                    <emph>respire</emph> as well): a shared breath of possibility (91). Conspiracy can offer a “mechanism of change” 
                    within overpowering systems and structures. Partaking of both sovereignty and vulnerability, conspiracy gives 
                    us “both more and less agency than we think,” Honig argues (88). Attending to conspiracy, moreover, swings the 
                    weight of the play away from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">agon</foreign> of Kreon-Antigone to more intricate, 
                    lateral relationships between the sisters, Chorus, soldiers, audience, and utterances of the play 
                    (88).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Katie Fleming probes the ways Sophocles’ tragedy has been performed 
                        in “complicit[y] with fascism” (Fleming 169). Honig implies that collaboration and complicity have no 
                        inherent ideological bent.</note> Antigone’s initial effort to conspire with her sister appears to fail, 
                    but Honig suggests both women learn as they go, growing more subtle and successful as they conspire (aspire, 
                    inspire) with language and with others. A similar trajectory marks Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters</title>.</p>
<figure rend="rightFloat">

</figure>
<p>The rhetorical form favored by aspiring conspirators is <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign>, a type 
                    of <emph>double entendre</emph> or utterance <emph>sotto voce</emph>—the blowing of dog whistles, perhaps—which, 
                    distinct from the violence of catachresis or the abandon of ecstasy, sustains plural meanings, “playing off 
                    how different audiences will understand the same locution” (Burton). Examples 
                    in the play abound, including the last exchange between Ismene and Antigone, a delicate dance performed before 
                    their uncle.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Honig argues that Ismene was responsible for the “first burial”

                    elsewhere” (Honig 90; Sophocles 40). This is one form of grievance available to these women: openly sorrowing,

                    audiences: this happens when Wollstonecraft revises and then publishes her letters to Imlay, activating 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> each time she addresses “you,” her variously constituted readers.</p>
<p>In its untimely conspiracy with language, the heroine’s voice refuses a place within what Honig calls “an economy

                    also 135). Think of <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> as one weapon in the heroine’s arsenal of 
                    excess—talking too much, borrowing without permission, reaching out beyond her immediate audience, taking what 
                    is not hers, airing grievance—in a situation defined by rigid economies of time and money, as Carson’s

<head>IV. Always and Ever</head>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>Both Butler and Honig borrow from the work of feminist classicist Nicole Loraux, whose account of the mourning 
                    voice in classical Greek tragedy upends traditional scholarship. In distinction from the rhetorical forms that 
                    hold Honig and Butler, Loraux attends to poetics. In particular her discussion of the adverb for always—<foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>—discloses yet another form of intelligibility where sorrow and anger fuse. By 
                    focusing on the moments when Antigone forsakes the time of the present for the timelessness of <emph>always</emph>, 
                    we can detect the feminist implications of Loraux’s insights.</p>
<p>In ancient Greek, the value of always—<foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>—typically aligns with a vital force 
                    constantly regenerating itself. Émile Benveniste characterizes it as “transitory and permanent, running out and 
                    being reborn in the course of generations . . . subsisting forever in its <emph>endlessly beginning</emph> 
                    finitude” (qtd. in Loraux 28; emphasis added). We might think of it as the flip-side to Butler’s ever-ending 
                    mortality. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Aei</foreign> usually signifies an <emph>always</emph> in time and full of 
                    time (<foreign xml:lang="la">saecula saeculorum</foreign>), derived from human measure, specifically the cycles 
                    of human generation. Designating a regularly renewing identity that overrides superficial alterations, the 
                    adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> helps secure the ongoingness of an autochthonous State. It may be 
                    familiar to us as the <emph>always</emph> of Burkean tradition (“always acting as if in the presence of 
                    canonized forefathers”) or the permanence of the classics, or even as an ever-regenerating Romanticism (Burke 
                    102). Yet in her very name, Antigone (<emph>anti</emph> [against]—<emph>gone</emph> [birth, offspring]) 
                    protests this sort of <emph>always</emph>. For her part, Wollstonecraft in the <title level="m">Letters 
                        Written</title> famously imagines an end to human ongoingness, a time “when the earth could no longer 
                    support [man]. Where was he to fly from universal famine? . . . The world appeared a vast prison” 
                    (102).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Juengel and Seiler-Smith have helped me appreciate this

</figure>
<p>Loraux calls attention though to a mutant version of <emph>always</emph> alive in the tragedies, especially 
                    Sophocles’. There the adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> “does not belong to [humans]” but to the 
                    atemporality of gods immune to death. It attaches particularly to passion and obsession, to madness, or, in 
                    Antigone’s case, to what Loraux designates as a “rigid indeterminability” (or unendingness) for which her world 
                    has no terms (31). Protagonists like Antigone export their grieving outside the strictures of state law to the 
                    timeless realm of this other <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>. Their “passion <emph>lives</emph> by 
                    claiming for itself <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>, always, as its temporality” (32; emphasis added). 
                    Loraux’s choice of verb accentuates the implication: the interminable griever grabs at a mode of life untethered 
                    to generation, mortality, or fatality. In the tragedies <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> issues “a repetitive 
                        de-negation” of “man’s destiny as mortal,” as “made of death” (34). Such grieving flies against the Greek 
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">polis</foreign> and its monopoly on <emph>always</emph>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Irigaray makes a parallel distinction between Antigone’s devotion to generation (of life) 
                            as opposed to genealogy (inheritance of property and patronym) (Irigaray 10).</note> Additionally, as 
                    a “fierce and obstinate rejection of forgetting,” this <foreign xml:lang="grc">aie</foreign> protests separating 
                    past from present (34).</p>
<p>Such timelessness belongs to the gods—and to a lyric mode that presses beyond language. It penetrates the sonic 
                    texture of tragedy, Loraux finds, each time  the word repeats exhalations of grief. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Aiai</foreign>—an exclamation like “alas!”—reverberates in <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> and in its combinations so that when, for instance, Antigone exclaims, 
                    “O home in the ground forever,” the word signifying forever (άϴίφρουρο/<foreign xml:lang="grc">aeiphrouros</foreign>) redoubles her plaint. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> 
                    of <emph>always</emph> sings out in ubiquitous cries (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Aiai</foreign>), but also in 
                    internal rhymes, freighted moments of assonance, and frequent passages of song. <emph>Always</emph> and 
                    <emph>alas</emph> thus conspire with the singing of choral refrains. Like Honig’s 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign>, they are there waiting to be heard.</p>
<p>Loraux makes analogies between these phonic signals in the tragedies and oratorio or lyric poetry (51). But 
                    emphasizing the role of sound and song in tragic grieving pulls her account close to a particularly Romantic 
                    form of intelligibility, by which that era’s heyday of chaos reached many ears. Emergent even as Antigone 
                    assumed her place in modern Western thought as “emblematic of a programme of feminine emancipation and political 
                    parity,” even as the author of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> died from giving 
                    birth, that form is melodrama (Steiner 9–10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In recruiting both Arendt and 
                        melodrama for her reading of Antigone, Honig steps away from Anna Siamopoulos, who uses Arendt to critique 
                        the “melodramatic worldview” of Hollywood film (Siamopoulos 181–82). Carolyn Williams helpfully situates 
                        early nineteenth-century melodrama in a more radical political framework than Hollywood’s version (Williams 
                        360–61).</note>

<head>V. Still Harping</head>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>At this point you may be feeling sad and angry that this essay has not engaged Wollstonecraft’s writing in much 
                    detail. But perhaps, insofar as Mary Wollstonecraft helped write the script for a modern Antigone, this essay 
                    has been talking about Wollstonecraft’s work all along.</p>
<p>In addition to anticipating Antigone, Wollstonecraft anticipated in her <title level="m">Letters Written</title> 
                    such moments of audience annoyance (“You will say that I am growing bitter, perhaps personal—Ah! Shall I whisper 
                    to you that you—yourself—are strangely altered?’?” [172]) as well as audience impatience (“Still harping on the 
                    same subject, you will exclaim——How can I avoid it . . . ?” [153]). Her ventriloquism offers moments of <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> that further conspiracy, splitting the nominal letter-reader apart from 
                    readers of the published text, whom she woos to her sense of grievance. Playing too on the distance of the spoken 
                    from the written word, she insists on being heard even as she anticipates the desire for her to be quiet (“shall 
                    I whisper to you?”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Writing of nineteenth-century stage melodrama in ways that 
                        echo Cavell, Williams refers to the dialectic of “melodrama’s generic form”: a consistent attempt both “to 
                        silence” and “to ‘tell all’” “mediat[es] the difficulty of expression—the many opportunities for it to be 
                        suppressed, to go wrong, to be misunderstood” (Williams 363).</note> The verb “harping” only heightens this 
                    dialectical unease, suggesting on the one hand that the letter-writer “repeat[s] or dwell[s] upon a subject to 
                    a wearisome or tedious length” and on the other “play[s] upon a [harp] string, to make music” (OED). A killjoy’s 
                    tedium to some ears may be stirring music to others. The OED cites a tone-deaf Polonius calling out Hamlet for 
                    “harping still on my daughter,” the ambivalence of the word—dwelling upon? playing upon?—opening up rich 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoetic</foreign> possibilities. Are we to hear <title level="m">Hamlet</title> in 
                    the letter-writer’s (ventriloquized) phrase? Wollstonecraft keeps such possibilities alive throughout the letters, 
                    as she works various potential “you”s with and against each other, her address veering from a tone of <foreign xml:lang="fr">entre nous</foreign> to subtle antagonism to stern command, as scholars have noted (e.g., 
                    <title level="m">Letters</title> 176).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Jacobus, Juengel, and

<p>Less recognized perhaps is the fact that the letter-writer simultaneously taps into lyric potential here, hoping

                    Many things could be said of the rhetoric of this passage—the switch 
                    to a “we” that excludes “you,” for instance, and the explicitly feminist stance. I want, though, to mark in 
                    its lyricism a premonition of the melodramatic and its service to feminism. Not simply the posture of female 
                    complaint—what Lauren Berlant recognizes as “the bitter vigilance of the intimately disappointed”—but the 
                    exploitation of lyric strategies, that singing harp, make the narrator’s voice heard even when her audience 
                    wants not to hear it (Berlant, <title level="m">Complaint</title> 1). Melo+drama, of course, implies the mix 
                    of music with drama. Note the music of Wollstonecraft’s closing chiasmus: “we reason deeply when we forcibly 
                    feel.” Pleading, keening, and aggrieved, the writer plays upon one string:  “W<hi rend="bold">e</hi> r<hi rend="bold">ea</hi>son d<hi rend="bold">ee</hi>pl<hi rend="bold">y</hi> when w<hi rend="bold">e</hi>

                    <emph>ee</emph>, // <emph>ee</emph>’, <emph>ee</emph>, <emph>ee</emph>’). Is this music—or the screech of 
                    nails on a chalkboard? Either way, the sound defies forgetting. You may wake tomorrow and hear it still.</p>

<p>In <title level="m">Cruel Optimism</title>, Berlant turns to genres such as melodrama to trace how they mediate 
                    “pressures of the present moment on the subject’s sensorium”—Cavell’s “heydays of chaos reaching our ears” (9). 
                    For Wollstonecraft, lyric moments similarly mediate or channel scraps and bits of tragedy for the reader’s 
                    sensorium. The landscape of the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> is littered with the dead, we recall: 
                    mummies, executions, soldiers training “to slaughter and be slaughtered,” phantoms, hauntings, and everywhere 
                    the stench of rotting fish. Wollstonecraft then fills the landscape with echoes of tragedy—Shakespeare’s 
                    specifically. In addition to Lear (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:310, 322, 414) and Macbeth (6: 252, 343, 
                    378),  the letter-writer alludes to or quotes the suicidal Prince of Denmark, as when we read, “the world’s 
                    a vast prison,” or the lament that “war, and ‘the thousand ills that flesh is heir to,’ mow [men] down in 
                    shoals” (6:336; also 253, 372, 277).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The editors of the <title level="m">Works

                    enters a house, “the tomb of the Capulets” she calls it, where “the worm riots . . . on the cheek of beauty” 
                    (6:285). In each case, the well-known lines both recall and effect turbulence. Like Antigone, the radical 
                    egalitarian writer claims identification with royalty and nobility; yet the words she quotes, like those 
                    from <title level="m">Lear</title>, attest to the futility of such distinctions: she sees “an effigy of majesty 
                    burned down to its sockets” (6:322). Whatever authority remains in the form of tragedy <emph>sounds</emph> 
                    fractured, vestigial, and gothic, relics presented in a minor key. The tragic pose thus risks sounding 
                    excessive, histrionic, overwrought: melodramatic. After all, this is a travelogue: she’s on a <emph>business 
                        trip</emph>. Yes, her lover left her and their child, but it’s not as if anyone’s been killed. . . . </p>
<p>Jeffrey Cox explains that in the Romantic era, the tragic hero can “only struggle to become a hero,” alienated 
                    as she is from the “fully meaningful world of gods and heroes” (Cox 158). If that’s the case, then 
                    Wollstonecraft, like the protagonists of melodrama, declines the struggle. She borrows. She feints. She plays, 
                    as the advertisement to her <title level="m">Letters Written</title> confesses, the part of “<emph>little</emph> 
                    hero of each tale,” pluralizing her roles (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:241; emphasis added). That 
                    pluralization has critical effect: for every reader who might hear self-indulgent sentiment on these pages, 
                    others might hear the music of unspoken acts of suicide, madness, and vengeance. Someone, something, 
                    <emph>has</emph> been killed, over and over again. Lyric strains and scattered echoes of tragedy sound against 
                    a death-strewn landscape, giving the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> an excessive or “extimate” 
                    dimension, allowing a timeless sense of grievance to intrude upon a living present even as the traveler eats 
                    meals, arranges transport, and describes the local customs of dress (Honig 149). If she cannot be understood in 
                    her owns terms, she will collect, parrot, or take the language of an authority—tragic, mythic, aristocratic, 
                    sovereign—an authority she knows and exposes as hollow.</p>
<p>These are the tactics of melodrama, that “peculiarly modern form” born in France alongside regicide, revolution, 
                    and “the loss of a tragic vision,” and carried to Britain in 1801 by Thomas Holcroft, sometime friend of William 
                    Godwin (Brooks 14).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the “political power” of the voiceless in early

                    into tragedy—in order to construct a contestatory, natalist, and democratic feminist politics, open to new 
                    publics—Wollstonecraft scatters tragedy into melodrama. Or at least, in the hybrid form of her <title level="m">Letters</title>—epistolary novel, travelogue, philosophical history, reverie, and memoir, 
                    threaded through with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">phonos</foreign> of tragedy and lyric—Wollstonecraft brings 
                    her reader to the verge of melodrama, searching for a form to make grievance intelligible. The “waning of genre” 
                    on display in melodrama, is not, Lauren Berlant reminds us, the waning of affect (<title level="m">Optimism</title> 6). Tragedy declined, at least in Wollstonecraft’s declension, does not sacrifice 
                    affective power. Nor does it slacken its reach for a passionate <emph>always</emph> on behalf of “the oppressed 
                    state of my sex.”</p>

<p>For if melodrama collects the vestiges of a tragic vision, in its Romantic moment it also enacts “passion’s 
                    revenge” upon the sentimental mode so dominant in the late eighteenth century (Chandler 34). With modern 
                    feminism, as I have sought to suggest with and through Antigone and Wollstonecraft, melodrama demands the 
                    exhaustion of sympathetic tears and their replacement with something more aggrieved. In her <title level="m">Letters</title>, Wollstonecraft conjures tears several times, and readers have taken them as 
                    signposts on a melancholy, sentimental journey away from the polemics of her two <title level="m">Vindications</title>. With the help of <title level="m">Antigone</title>, though, I hear 
                    something else raging through the letters of the wandering woman. The female “I” invokes tears in a gestural, 
                    stylized way: “I wished for night to hide the starting tears, or shed them on my pillow, and close my eyes on 
                    a world where I was destined to wander alone” (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:298). So stylized are these 
                    mentions that the incipient tears dwindle in the course of the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> to a 
                    single spare tear, no sooner summoned than disowned (“why starts the tear . . . ?” [6:272]; “The tear 
                    starts . . . I must fly” [6:294]). Such considerations lead back to the line encountered earlier, the closing 
                    gesture of the penultimate letter: “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted ear!’” 
                    (6:344).</p>
<p>The apostrophe to the world is itself indebted to Edward Young’s influential poem, <title level="m">The Complaint, 
                    or Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality</title>, where it signals a selfless, religiously inspired 
                    sympathy (I ought to cry for you, world, not for myself) even as it intensifies the speaker’s isolation from 
                    any fellow feeling out there in the world. In Wollstonecraft’s hands, the isolation is compromised by quotation: 
                    obviously, she and Young share this feeling (as does Wollstonecraft’s heroine in <title level="m">Mary, A 
                        Fiction</title>, who repeats the phrase). There’s an acknowledgment too, perhaps, of what her prose owes to 
                    her reading of lyric poetry. More significant, though, is the fact that the indebted line culminates several 
                    pages of mounting critique of “the whirlpool of gain,” the love of profit, and the “baleful effects of 
                    speculation,” announced at the demoralized end of a journey dictated, she implies, by “the commercial spirit” 
                    and paid for by her correspondent, himself “strangely altered” from his immersion in war speculation (6:340). 
                    In this context the language of sentiment, of tears exchanged, shows itself tainted by the credit-debt system 
                    that has enveloped wartime Europe. More even than the loss of tragic vision, melodrama exposes the bankruptcy 
                    of the sentimental. How much debt does that circulating tear carry, travelling from one cheek to another like a
                    promissory note? Honig finds Antigone refusing her place within “an economy of citizenship that domesticates 
                    desire, longing, pain and loss” (122; also 135); Wollstonecraft carries that refusal from the domesticating 
                    economy of <foreign xml:lang="grc">polis</foreign> to the sentimentalizing economy of capital.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Youssef provides an excellent analysis of the economics of sentimentality and its central 
                        engine, sympathy, in <title level="m">Romantic Intimacy</title>, 25–48.</note> “Take, O world, thy much 
                    indebted tear” may express selfless concession, or instead it may throw tears back in the world’s face: “Take 
                    that!” Or maybe, “Take it back!”—passion’s revenge, forcibly felt.</p>

<p>The letter-writer calls up a sentimental tear—as she calls up tragedy—to dramatize the expiration of its power. 
                    Like Antigone, she makes heard both sorrow and rage in language that echoes and implicates and speaks out of 
                    bounds, in excess of herself. In each case, with rhetorical sophistication, conspiratorial play, the sonic 
                    resources of lyric, and a desperate desire to take what hasn’t been given her, the woman voices her grievance 
                    against the state of the oppressed. She leans toward the melodramatic, suggesting the power of that mode for an 
                    unending feminism.</p>

<title level="a">The Philosopher and Her Poor: Wollstonecraft, Rancière, and the Rights and Duties 
                    of Humanity</title> argues that Wollstonecraft asserts rights not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus 
                    the mirror image of the dominant order), but as the necessary correlative of duties. By formulating women’s work 
                    as duty—a form of rational, voluntary obligation that entails reciprocal relations, including 
                    rights—Wollstonecraft recasts the ostensibly apolitical obligations of women as the <emph>actions</emph> of the 
                    political subjects they already are. By shifting focus from the entitlement to rights to the performance of duty, 
                    Wollstonecraft ties rights to the realization of one’s human capacities rather than status (wealth, rank, sex, or 
                    even humanity as mere species membership). She thereby creates the basis for a revolutionary political order that 
                    does not simply extend the prerogatives of an unjust status quo to new claimants but overturns the very structures 
                    that disbar women from exercising their rights.</p>

<div type="section">
<p>I take my title from Jacques Rancière’s <title level="m">The Philosopher and his Poor</title>, which asks how 
                 those systematically excluded from philosophy and from politics—the poor, the worker, the disenfranchised, the 
                 enslaved, what he calls the “non-part”—come to take their rightful part or share in the world.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Rancière, “the poor” includes not just the “economically disadvantaged part of the 
                     population,” but also “the people who do not count, who have no entitlement to exercise the power of the 
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">archê</foreign>, none for which they might be counted” (Rancière, “Ten Theses” 
                     32).</note> Drawing on the Platonic insistence that no man can have more than one occupation—a shoemaker 
                 must only be a shoemaker and nothing more—Rancière shows how the strict division of labor elaborated in Plato’s 
                 <title level="m">Republic</title> institutes an unjust order that cancels out the place of the poor, not least by 
                 securing the philosopher’s monopoly on thought. By aligning individuals and their purported abilities with fixed 
                 roles, this division codifies an essential character—an inalterable identity—that naturalizes a hierarchical order. 
                 Indeed, the shoemaker’s labor involves less the production of shoes than the reproduction of that order, for in 
                 doing only one thing, “the thing that marks him off and serves to put him in his place,” the shoemaker “does nothing 
                 but accredit, even at the cost of lying, the declared lie that puts him in his place” 
                 (<title level="m">Philosopher</title> 22, 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">If one’s place in the order of 
                     things exhausts one’s identity, then there is no surplus, no room to maneuver, no means to reallocate, power, 
                     resources, or speech within what Rancière calls the “distribution or partition of the sensible.” On the 
                     distribution, see <title level="m">The Politics of Aesthetics</title>, especially pp. 9–45.</note> On what terms, 
                 Rancière asks, can this declared lie—this fundamental wrong in the construction of the political order—be corrected, 
                 enabling those who do not have rights to become subjects able to assert or enact these rights? How “can those whose 
                 business is not thinking assume the authority to think and thereby constitute themselves as thinking subjects?” 
                 (<title level="m">Philosopher</title> xxvi). How are those excluded from philosophy and from politics to claim a 
                 place within the world?</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the exclusion of what Rancière calls the “non-part” from the whole is not a reflection of the political 
                 order, but <emph>constitutive</emph> of it, the question of the poor or the “non-part” is not a challenge to the 
                 status quo that arises from the margins; it is intrinsic to the very structure of politics. Setting aside for the 
                 moment the slippage between literal and metaphorical uses of poverty in Rancière’s discussion, I want to think about 
                 the way questions of right and of rights issue from the wrongful exclusion of certain parties. The unequal 
                 distribution of rights in Rancière’s account is “not just the class struggle, internal dissension to be overcome by 
                 giving the city its principle of unity”; it is rather “the constitutive wrong or torsion of politics as such” 
                 (<title level="m">Disagreement</title> 13, 14). That is, politics is not simply the relations that emerge from an 
                 anterior distribution of right (or rights) in a given order; instead, it is the manifestation of a fundamental wrong 
                 that unleashes the insurgent efforts of the non-part to take (its) equal part. “The struggle between the rich and the 
                 poor is not social reality, which politics then has to deal with,” Rancière contends. “It is the actual institution 
                 of politics itself” (<title level="m">Disagreement</title> 11). On these terms, a constitutive wrong is always 
                 already internal to our discourses of right.</p>
<p>In what follows, I want to use Rancière to address the way the revolutionary philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft thought 
                 about <emph>her</emph> poor—a group that, in eighteenth-century Britain and its empire, included not only the 
                 economically impoverished and the politically disenfranchised, but also women of all ranks, classes, and degrees of 
                 power. Like Rancière, Wollstonecraft places wrongs anterior to rights, recognizing how the unequal constitution of 
                 the political order comes before and lies behind the injustices done to women. Patriarchal domination is not the 
                 unrecognized backdrop in debates over the rights of man, but integral to the political order; women are active 
                 participants both in the oppressive status quo and in the revolutionary struggle against it, not passive bystanders 
                 upon whom prerogatives may be arbitrarily conferred. The struggle between men and women is not a social reality, 
                 which politics then has to deal with, but the actual institution of politics itself. On these terms, the wrongs done 
                 to women cannot simply be righted by expanding the numbers included in the status quo (by extending the franchise or 
                 giving select women power, for example), because the extension of the prerogatives of an unjust order to new 
                 claimants (whether the poor or women) leaves the underlying distribution of power, of visibility, intact. The 
                 extension of rights to new claimants will not suffice; the very terms on which rights are understood to exist must

<p>In reading Wollstonecraft with (and against) Rancière, I want to consider how his understanding of wrongs can help us 
                 grasp the terms of her reclamation of rights. Although gender is not a privileged category of analysis for Rancière 
                 (he does not single out women’s oppression as a special case, but treats it as yet another instantiation of 
                 injustice), the nigh-universal exclusion of women—half of the human race—from early political theory 
                 exemplifies his contention that politics emerge from a fundamental 
                 exclusion from the recognized order: an anterior distribution that decides who has power and who does not, who can 
                 speak and who can be heard. Enlarging an unjust political order does not produce justice; rather, the very basis for 
                 the distribution of rights must be revolutionized. It is for this reason, I argue, that Wollstonecraft asserts rights 
                 not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror image of the dominant order), but as the 
                 necessary correlative of duties.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“In eighteenth-century British political thought, 
                     rights such as freedom of conscience were often paired with duties such as religious tolerance. In such moral 
                     pairings, rights were understood as correlative, or reflexive and relational. Such correlative rights served as 
                     a kind of practical shorthand for abstract moral principles that defined ethical human relationships and 
                     obligations to one another within political communities” 
                     (Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft</title> 31).</note> By formulating women’s toil as duty—a form of 
                 rational, voluntary obligation that entails reciprocal relations, including rights—Wollstonecraft shows how the 
                 existing status of women already harbors within it the grounds for women’s title to rights.</p>
<p>Since Wollstonecraft insists that only human beings can have duties, the description of women’s activities as duty 
                 also implies a species classification, one that draws women into the compass of the revolutionary rights of man. 
                 Indeed, inasmuch as duties as ongoing actions constitute the subject who performs them, they enable new individuals 
                 and groups to join the circle of beings who possess what Hannah Arendt calls the “right to have rights,” by making 
                 human capacities and actions rather than property or inherited status into the basis for political personhood 
                 (<title level="m">Origins</title> 296). Because duty is an ongoing activity intrinsic to the realization of one’s 
                 human purpose, the rights with which it is coupled cannot be static possessions that some parties have and others 
                 lack. Duty creates what might be called rights-enacting rather than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft 
                 to circumvent the sharp division between human and political rights that has bedeviled philosophers from Edmund 
                 Burke to Hannah Arendt and Jacques Rancière. In insisting that “rights and duties are inseparable,” Wollstonecraft 
                 not only creates a space for those excluded a priori from the rights-bearing community, she also uses duty to 
                 reveal that women are <emph>already</emph> a part of the political order (266). By recasting the ostensibly 
                 apolitical obligations of women as the actions of political subjects, Wollstonecraft leverages the performance of 
                 duty into a reclamation of rights.</p>
<p>At first glance, rights play a strangely marginal role in Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre, notwithstanding their titular 
                 centrality to both <title level="m">Vindications</title>. Many critics have observed that Wollstonecraft’s 
                 emphasis on duty, education, and virtue seems like a deflection from the incendiary question of rights (ask not 
                 what you can do for women, but what women can do for you). Eileen Botting points to the fact that the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> features “the term ‘rights’ thirty-two times,” while the 
                 word “duties” appears “three times as often” (78); Virginia Sapiro notes that Wollstonecraft’s stress on “virtue” 
                 marks her commitment to a civic republican tradition rather than to a Lockean discourse of rights and contract. 
                 Barbara Taylor, Susan James, and Sandrine Bergès, among others, have given pride of place to Wollstonecraft’s 
                 interest in education, prioritizing interdependence over the autonomy that holds sway over proprietary models 
                 of rights.<note place="foot" resp="editors">James notes that Wollstonecraft sees “our rights as powers that are 
                     created by the institutional and personal relations between many embodied individuals. . . . Locating our 
                     rights or powers to act in individuals is a sort of shorthand. . . . If we want to concentrate rights . . . 
                     in individual hands . . . we need to start, as Wollstonecraft does, from the recognition of our mutual 
                     dependence” (159–60).</note> Inasmuch as duty, virtue, and education create rational, moral free agents, 
                 they enable women to realize the humanity that makes one a rights-bearing subject. Wollstonecraft’s emphasis 
                 on duty places not the bare necessities of life but the exercise of human capacities at the heart of women’s 
                 claim to rights.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft’s commitment to human capacities and obligations as the basis for rights famously pits her 
                 against her contemporary Edmund Burke, who derides the “rights of man” as an airy metaphysical abstraction in 
                 his <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>. Rights established through mere human 
                 being have no force for Burke. “In proportion as they are metaphysically true,” he asserts, “they are morally 
                 or politically false” (153). Custom, property, and reverence for authority—“the super-added ideas, furnished 
                 from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns, and the understanding ratifies, as necessary 
                 to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature”—secure the political order in Burke’s account. Without 
                 these collectively held fictions, “a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal; 
                 and an animal not of the highest order” (171). Humanity here is not the basis of a common title to rights, 
                 but a residue left when the trappings of rank and tradition have been stripped away.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft excoriates Burke’s worship of the “demon of property” and the “pestiferous purple” both in 
                 her response to the <title level="m">Reflections</title>, the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights 
                     of Men</title>, and in the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                 (<title level="m">VRM</title> 9; <title level="m">VRW</title> 87). Devoted to “the unnatural customs, which 
                 ignorance and mistaken self-interest have consolidated,” Burke fails to recognize the way inherited privilege 
                 and the interests (national and private) of the propertied deform human nature: “The Briton takes the place 
                 of the man, and the image of God is lost in the citizen!” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 10, 15). Whereas 
                 classical theories of political rights derive the possibility of equality from the supplanting of (unequal, 
                 because differently endowed) men by the fictive equality of the person (the man, the citizen), Wollstonecraft 
                 argues that the unequal distribution of political personhood introduces inequality within a community of 
                 otherwise equally entitled human beings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Arendt, “we are not born 
                     equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves 
                     mutually equal rights” (Arendt 301).</note> In her account, the replacement of the man by the citizen 
                 is a self-serving alibi for the degradation of one’s fellows to the status of beasts, as unjust prerogatives 
                 blind the privileged to the anterior claims of their fellows: “The man [is] changed into an artificial monster 
                 by the station in which he was born” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 10). Burke rates the poor as little better 
                 than beasts. “Your respect for rank,” Wollstonecraft rages, “has swallowed up the common feelings of humanity; 
                 you seem to consider the poor as only the livestock of an estate, the feather of hereditary nobility” 
                 (<title level="m">VRM</title> 17). Lacking the institutions (the state, the law, property) that would enable 
                 them to assert rights, the poor are at best entitled to compassion “extorted from a mixed feeling of disgust 
                 and animal sympathy” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 11). Like Burke’s denuded queen, that animal “not of the 
                 highest order,” the poor are instances of bare shivering humanity, whose defenseless plight substantiates 
                 Burke’s claim that the “abstract perfection” of natural rights “is their practical defect,” for such rights 
                 can be enforced only “<emph>by a power out of themselves</emph>” (151).</p>
<p>Burke’s treatise anticipates elements of Hannah Arendt’s influential description of the impotence of human 
                 rights in her account of the plight of stateless populations in the wake of World War I (to which, importantly 
                 for my purposes, Rancière responds). Indeed, Arendt invokes Burke’s pragmatic insistence that “the rights which 
                 we enjoy spring ‘from within the nation’” (<title level="m">Origins</title> 299). Although the inalienable 
                 “rights of man” ostensibly require “no special law . . . to protect them because all laws were supposed to 
                 rest upon them,” Arendt notes, they cannot uphold themselves (291). Once “human beings lacked their own 
                 government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them and no 
                 institution was willing to guarantee them” (292). Nationless refugees thus found themselves reduced to what 
                 Arendt famously called “the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human” (300). Stripped of “the protecting 
                 mask of a legal personality,” the mere human being is “without rights and duties, . . . outside the range of 
                 the law and the body politic of the citizens, as for instance a slave—but certainly a politically irrelevant 
                 being” (<title level="m">Revolution</title> 108, 107). On these terms, the human rights granted to refugees 
                 and others are, for Arendt, empty—rights in name only, bestowed upon subjects bereft of the powers to wield 
                 them.</p>
<p>The stark division between human and political rights that resides at the heart of Wollstonecraft’s struggle 
                 with Burke is likewise central to Rancière’s critique of Arendt’s description of human rights. Both Burke and 
                 Arendt see political rights as belonging to specific designated parties (for Burke the king, the propertied, 
                 authorities sanctioned by time and tradition; for Arendt citizens, or politically recognized “persons”). Yet 
                 if the community of rights-bearers is always already designated, how are the rightless to attain the rights 
                 from which they are categorically barred? Both Burke’s and Arendt’s accounts create an impasse in which, as 
                 Rancière has contended, “either the rights of the citizen are the rights of man—but the rights of man are the 
                 rights of the unpoliticized person; they are the rights of those who have no rights” <emph>or</emph> “the 
                 rights of man are the rights of the citizen . . . [which] means that they are the rights of those who have 
                 rights, which amounts to a tautology” (“Who?” 302). To treat only of political rights (or to treat human 
                 rights as if they can only be addressed in terms of preexisting political rights) is to accept the terms of 
                 a rigged system. That is, by creating a sharp line between the political and the nonpolitical subject, Arendt 
                 misrecognizes that it is precisely the drawing of this line—the exclusions made in the very constitution of 
                 the political—that is <emph>the</emph> political question par excellence. How, Rancière asks, can this line 
                 be redrawn?</p>
<p>Rancière uses the human to relitigate this division, leveraging the ability to exercise human capacities to 
                 open up an exclusionary order, blurring the thresholds between the political and the nonpolitical, citizen 
                 and human. Describing the rights of man in deliberately paradoxical terms as “the rights of those who have not 
                 the rights that they have and who have the rights that they have not,” Rancière argues that rights are not 
                 “predicates belonging to definite subjects”—nominal possessions that some humans “have” and others do not—but 
                 generative principles that entitle their claimants to “a sphere of implementation of these predicates” (302, 
                 303, 303). Rights, that is, create the “opening of an interval for political subjectivization,” in which 
                 subjects use rights that they do not (yet) possess (304). This seemingly contradictory formulation creates a 
                 kind of no-man’s (no-woman’s) land (or a not-yet-someone’s land) that tests the borders of inclusion and 
                 exclusion. In this paradoxical space in which one has and doesn’t have rights at one and the same time, those 
                 excluded from the political order can convert themselves from a “non-part” to a part (302).</p>
<p>Inasmuch as “political predicates are open predicates,” Rancière argues, “they open up a dispute about what 
                 they exactly entail and whom they concern in which cases” (303). It is apt for my purposes that the example 
                 Rancière uses to illustrate this “dispute” is a statement made by another female revolutionary: not 
                 Wollstonecraft, but Olympe de Gouges, author of the <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of 
                     Woman</title>, who insisted that “if women are entitled to go to the scaffold, they are entitled to go 
                 to the assembly” (303). That the revolutionary government executes women, Rancière points out, reveals that 
                 their bare ostensibly apolitical lives are in fact always already political, for if women may be killed by 
                 the state, then they are recognized as subjects within it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It is worth 
                     noting that Arendt registers this argument in <title level="m">Origins</title>. Stateless people are 
                     deprived of legality in a way that leaves them worse off than criminals: “It seems to be easier to 
                     deprive a completely innocent person of legality than someone who has committed an offence. . . . The 
                     deprivation of legality, <emph>i.e.</emph>, of <emph>all</emph> rights, no longer has a connection 
                     with specific crimes” (295). Wollstonecraft notes that women are “denied all political privileges, 
                     and [are] not allowed, as married women, excepting in criminal cases, a civil existence” 
                     (<title level="m">VRW</title> 256). The law only acts to protect women when the violation is 
                     materialized as physical violence: “The laws of this country—if women have a country—afford her no 
                     protection or redress from the oppressor, unless she has the plea of bodily fear” 
                     (<title level="m">Maria</title> 92).</note> Gouges’s claim to a right is not, Rancière points out, 
                 asserted directly or positively; it is instead “enacted in the process of a wrong,” in the construction of 
                 what Rancière calls a dissensus, which reveals the intractable contradictions at the heart of the social 
                 and political order by “putting two worlds”—in this case, the political life of the assembly 
                 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">bios</foreign>) and the “bare life” of the scaffold 
                 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">zoe</foreign>)—“in one and the same world” (304).</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft likewise sought to create a dispute or dissensus that would carve out a place for 
                 <emph>her</emph> poor (that is, for women), not by extracting the possibility of a right from a wrong, but 
                 through her insistence on the inseparability of rights and duties.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wollstonecraft recognizes the connection between sexual and economic oppression, even 
                     as she distinguishes between them. Lena Halldenius argues that what distinguishes the oppressed state 
                     of women from that of the poor for Wollstonecraft is not any intrinsic difference in their oppression, 
                     but the addition of “a ‘false morality’ identifying a woman’s virtue with subjugation and passivity” 
                     (Halldenius, <title level="a">Primacy</title> 78).</note> By shifting focus from the entitlement to 
                 rights to the performance of duty, Wollstonecraft grounds political participation in capacities for action 
                 rather than status (wealth, rank, sex, or even humanity as mere species membership). If, in Wollstonecraft’s 
                 account, the duties of women already exist, so too must the rights—even if they are yet to be acknowledged. 
                 If Olympe de Gouges insists that women’s presence on the scaffold entitles them to a seat in the assembly, 
                 Wollstonecraft argues that the performance of female domestic duties creates women’s title to political 
                 rights—not least because maternal duty entails what might be deemed the most political act of all: the 
                 reproduction and education of individuals who are considered to be citizens.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wollstonecraft and maternal duty, see Sapiro, 154–61. Wollstonecraft states that 
                     women’s first duty is “to themselves as rational creatures, and the next, in point of importance, as 
                     citizens, is that, which includes so many, of a mother” (VRW 216). If duty is a form of 
                     subject-constituting labor that for women involves the reproduction of others, to what degree is 
                     that labor absorbed by the self? Wollstonecraft’s model of maternal duty intersects with questions 
                     of property and the rights understood to issue from such claims. In a 1794 letter, Wollstonecraft 
                     uses Locke’s model of labor to stake a claim to women’s propriety over children: “Considering the 
                     care and anxiety a woman must have about a child before it comes into the world, it seems to me, by 
                     a <emph>natural right</emph>, to belong to her” (qtd. in Sapiro 157). Yet Wollstonecraft elsewhere 
                     pits herself against Lockean models of ownership as the basis for rights, as Lena Halldenius has 
                     argued, questioning the assimilation of the fruits of workers’ labor into the masters’ property 
                     and—by extension—the notion that parental labor grants similar rights over children 
                     (<title level="a">Feminist Critique</title>).</note>
</p>
<p>In advancing this line of argument, Wollstonecraft exposes the contradiction between the rightless female 
                 body that produces subjects and the rights-bearing subjects that women bear, thus revealing the relations 
                 that Burke and Arendt would characterize as not-political to reside at the heart of politics. Her claim for 
                 women’s rights rests not on political personhood, but on maternal duty and the relations it posits 
                 <emph>between</emph> human beings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">She thereby changes the basis for rights 
                     claims so as to circumvent what Wendy Brown describes as one of the key paradoxes of rights. Since 
                     masculinist rights discourse “presumes an ontologically autonomous, self-sufficient, unencumbered 
                     subject,” Brown argues, early feminists like Wollstonecraft “were arguing for something that could 
                     not be produced without simultaneously demanding a transformation in the nature of what they were 
                     arguing for, namely, the ‘rights of man’ for women. . . . Women both require access to the existence 
                     of this fictional subject and are systematically excluded from it by the gendered terms of 
                     liberalism” (431).</note> By making duty the basis of the right to have rights, Wollstonecraft 
                 reconfigures the very terms on which the subject can claim them. That is, she produces a title to political 
                 being grounded not in the fact of belonging to a specific subset (the rich, the propertied, the autonomous 
                 self-possessed subject), but predicated on the performance of actions that realize one’s humanity—on 
                 Rancière’s implementation of a political predicate.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as duty, virtue, and education create rational, moral free agents, they enable women to achieve the 
                 humanity that <emph>makes</emph> one a rights-bearing subject. It is for this reason that Alexandre Lefebvre 
                 has argued that Wollstonecraft is interested less in the role of human rights “in protecting people” than in 
                 their “potential . . . to transform people . . . [by] modify[ing] the relation we have to ourselves” (182). 
                 For Wollstonecraft, Lefebvre claims, human rights are an aspirational mirror, the instruments of rational 
                 self-actualization, “educational in and of themselves” in that they enable women “to view themselves in the 
                 image of human rights, for example, <emph>as</emph> self-determining agents free of spurious needs and 
                 passions, and <emph>as</emph> human rather than female beings” (184).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Lefebvre’s account affords a way out of the circular logic that haunts Wollstonecraft’s 
                     text, in which the realization of subjectivity can start to seem like a form of autopoeisis. Each 
                     component of Wollstonecraft’s virtue-duty-reason nexus appears to depend upon the others: if, as 
                     Wollstonecraft affirms,  “every being may become virtuous by the exercise of its own reason,” but 
                     virtue depends upon duty, and duty requires reason, what comes first (<title level="m">VRW</title> 90)? 
                     In order to escape from this circular logic, Wollstonecraft construes politics not as a sphere but as 
                     a process by which subjects are constituted in an ongoing fashion.</note> Serving “as the very content 
                 and medium of instruction,” human rights spur on the actualization of one’s human being (184). While for 
                 Lefebvre, rights anticipate the human subjects who will come to exercise them, duty, I want to argue, offers 
                 the means and immediacy of a present enactment, materializing virtue in practice by revealing that the 
                 subject is already the being she strives to be. If Rancière’s subjects “have the rights they do not have,” 
                 Wollstonecraft’s subjects have the virtue they do not have, realized through the enactment of duty that 
                 performs and creates the subjectivity that does not (yet) have rights. Duty thus does not de facto 
                 reproduce an oppressive division of labor; it entails forms of self-transformation that alter the very 
                 constitution of the political order. On these terms, duty precedes the acknowledgment of rights claims 
                 (if not the rights themselves), as humans perform subject-constituting activities in anticipation of legal 
                 and philosophical recognition of the human prerogatives they <emph>already</emph> possess.</p>
<p>Duty creates rights-enacting rather than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft to get around 
                 the sharp division between human and political rights that (as we saw above) Rancière condemns in Arendt’s 
                 account. Because duty is an ongoing activity intrinsic to the realization of one’s human purpose, the 
                 rights with which it is coupled cannot be static possessions that some parties have and others lack. For 
                 Wollstonecraft, capacities and actions rather than property or inherited status thus become the basis for 
                 rights. Put another way, neither men nor women “have” rights, for to “have” a right is to operate 
                 precisely according to a logic of possession that treats the class of rights-bearers as an already 
                 established fact. Instead, women and men <emph>perform</emph> the duties that show them to be—and enable 
                 them to become—rights-enacting subjects. Wollstonecraft thus uses duty to transform rights from something 
                 one has or owns into active principles acquired and wielded through virtuous action. As a result, rights 
                 may both be gained—and forfeited. As Wollstonecraft points out, those who fail to perform their duty—the 
                 idle rich who neglect their moral and political obligations—relinquish their rights: “A right always 
                 includes a duty,” Wollstonecraft notes, “and I think it may, likewise, fairly be inferred, that they 
                 forfeit the right, who do not fulfill the duty” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 227). Prerogatives exercised 
                 without the counterweight of duty, Wollstonecraft insists, are not rights but tyrannical powers.</p>
<p>At first glance Wollstonecraft’s insistence on duty may seem to reinstate a sexual division of labor that 
                 reinforces separate and unequal spheres. Even as Rancière’s shoemaker must stick to his last, so too are 
                 Wollstonecraft’s women seemingly enjoined to perform the very duties that trap them in patriarchal 
                 structures. Indeed, Wollstonecraft is careful to avoid intimating that she wishes to annihilate women’s 
                 customary obligations: “When I treat of the peculiar duties of women, as I should treat of the peculiar 
                 duties of a citizen or father, it will be found that I do not mean to insinuate that they should be taken 
                 out of their families, speaking of the majority” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 132). Yet by placing 
                 women’s duties alongside the obligations of men as citizens and fathers, Wollstonecraft reclassifies 
                 women’s domestic labors as themselves political, and throughout the text, she harnesses the performance 
                 of domestic duties to a grander trajectory of human self-realization: “Connected with man as daughters, 
                 wives, and mothers,” she writes, “their moral character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling 
                 these simple duties: but the end, the grand end of their exertions should be to unfold their own faculties 
                 and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 95). The duties with which men 
                 and women are charged are not outwardly imposed, circumscribed tasks, but subject-constituting activities, 
                 driven by an active imperative for human self-realization.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Women are 
                     “human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed upon this earth to unfold their faculties” 
                     (<title level="m">VRW</title> 74), and thus have, as Botting puts it, a “duty to develop their moral 
                     and intellectual potential as rational creatures of God.” Humanity furnishes a “naturalistic 
                     foundation” for rights claims prior to the institution of a social order able to assert normative 
                     standards (<title level="m">Wollstonecraft</title> 51, 74). Her version of humanity is grounded in 
                     god-given capacities, a theological model that embraces perfectibility in a future 
                     orientation.</note>
</p>
<p>Although the tasks of individuals may diverge depending on occupation, sex, rank, 
                 bodily strength, and skill, the principles that govern duty apply equally to all human beings. “I allow,” 
                 Wollstonecraft notes, that women “may have different duties to fulfil; but they are <emph>human</emph> 
                 duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them . . . must be the same” 
                 (<title level="m">VRW</title> 120). Notably, Wollstonecraft does not lean on a common “humanity” to 
                 justify women’s claims; instead, she treats “the human” as a modifier, a qualifier of an action rather 
                 than a noun: these are “<emph>human</emph> duties”—things that those who are to be considered human do. 
                 The humanity that for Wollstonecraft grounds a claim to human rights is not on these terms a simple 
                 matter of species belonging (in her account, women are often degraded to the status of prattling 
                 creatures, pets, birds). Rather, it involves the acquisition and exercise of reason and virtue (both 
                 qualities that distinguish humans from animals) through education and the performance of duty. “Reason,” 
                 Wollstonecraft insists, “is absolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty properly,” for 
                 “it is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own 
                 reason” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 133, 90). Duties are “not the blind impulse of unerring instinct” 
                 that drives beasts (<title level="m">VRM</title> 31). It is the knowing performance of a moral 
                 obligation that distinguishes duty from slavish toil in obedience to a command.</p>
<p>Indeed, so fundamental is duty to Wollstonecraft’s understanding of humanity that those who thwart women 
                 in performing duties prevent them from realizing their human being, magnifying “their inferiority till 
                 women are almost sunk below the standard of rational creatures” and creating the “doubt whether she is 
                 a moral agent, or the link which unites men with brutes” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 104). To prevent women 
                 from performing their duty is to strip them of the virtue that “can only be acquired by the discharge of 
                 relative duties,” reducing them to “mere animals” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 211, 76). It is on these 
                 terms, as Lena Halldenius argues, that we can argue that Wollstonecraft’s 
                 <title level="m">Vindication</title> “is <emph>primarily</emph> about rights: a right to the circumstances 
                 in which we can legitimately be expected to perform the duty of virtue” (<title level="a">Primacy</title> 80).</p>
<p>It is because Wollstonecraft wishes for women to have rights in a just order, rather than powers in an 
                 unjust one, that she focuses on the reciprocal relationship of rights and duties rather than grounding 
                 her arguments for rights solely on the wrongs suffered by women. Whereas Olympe de Gouges uses wrongs 
                 to claim rights, as we saw above, Wollstonecraft fears that a claim to rights based on wrongs will 
                 reproduce the structural principles that perpetuate injustice: a politics that is premised on wrongs 
                 rather than duty cannot escape or revise the structures that have produced an unjust status quo. The 
                 reversal of a wrong does not a priori yield a symmetrical right, nor does the negation of one term offer 
                 a clear portrait of what its opposite might entail. While correlative theories entail the reflexive 
                 relation of rights and duties, the seeming symmetry of rights and wrongs entails a reversal in which 
                 the injury defines the nature of the right and the subject called into being is defined through a harm. 
                 As Wendy Brown has argued, “ideals of freedom ordinarily emerge to vanquish their imagined immediate 
                 enemies, but in this move they frequently recycle and reinstate rather than transform the terms of 
                 domination that generated them . . . without addressing the <emph>subject constitution that domination 
                     effects</emph>” (7). Discussions of rights that focus on the adjudication of wrongs recognize only 
                 sensibility (a property shared by animals) rather than reason or virtue (human qualities), 
                 recapitulating the structural disenfranchisement that casts women as victims (and thus as unqualified 
                 to become subjects of rights).</p>
<p>Alleviating suffering palliates the overt injury, while leaving intact the <emph>real</emph> wrong (the 
                 anterior injustice, the lack of right, the underlying exclusion that constructs the political order). 
                 Thus, for example, men’s kindness to women, like their “tenderness for their humble dumb domestics,” 
                 reflects men’s duty to treat women gently, not an acknowledgement of women’s rights, while charity to 
                 the impoverished, Wollstonecraft observes, is condescension, not justice: “If the poor are in distress,” 
                 she notes, the rich “will make some benevolent exertions to assist them; they will confer obligations, 
                 but not do justice” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 243; <title level="m">VRM</title> 52). Rather than 
                 recognizing rights, the empowered confer—indeed, create—obligations. The act of “righting wrongs” thus 
                 installs certain parties as “the dispenser[s] of these rights,” as Gayatri Spivak has argued, confirming 
                 the existing monopoly on power by upholding the subordination of the weak to the 
                 empowered protectors or defenders of rights (524). Women and the poor are invited to feast on the crumbs 
                 dropped from the table rather than being offered a spot at it. It is in order to avoid this slippage from 
                 justice to benevolence that Wollstonecraft so insistently turns from the disempowering binary of right 
                 and wrong to the empowering reciprocity of rights and duties—a slippage also apparent in the elision of 
                 human rights and humanitarianism in our own day.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Indeed, the 
                     compassionate treatment of women or the poor is distressingly close to the treatment Wollstonecraft 
                     advocates for animals. For Wollstonecraft, kindness to animals is a human duty, not an animal right, 
                     for the correlative theory of duties and rights does not extend to beasts: “While humans had a duty 
                     to respect sentient life,” Botting notes, “animals did not have a corresponding right to be free from 
                     abuse by humans.” The claim that something should not be harmed (the recognition that it may be 
                     wronged) does not entail rights—nor does it acknowledge the humanity of the victims 
                     (Botting, <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft</title> 94). On Wollstonecraft’s view of the human 
                     distinction from animals, see Ruston 28–62 and Seeber; on Wollstonecraft and slavery, see 
                     Brace.</note>
</p>
<p>Yet Wollstonecraft also cannily exploits this reduction of women to suffering objects in order 
                 to vindicate her claims, ruthlessly compelling her reader to follow through on the logic of the 
                 present system in an all-or-nothing gambit. If rights and duties are the god-given birthright of 
                 <emph>all</emph> human beings (not concessions made by the dominant class to the poor), the only 
                 argument that justifies their denial is the categorical reclassification of the claimant as an animal: 
                 “Let women share the rights and she will emulate the virtues of man; for she must [either] grow more 
                 perfect when emancipated, or justify the authority that chains such a weak being to her duty.—If the 
                 latter, it will be expedient to open a fresh trade with Russia for [the] whips . . . [used by a husband 
                 or father to] reign, wielding this scepter, sole master of his house, because he is the only being in 
                 it who has reason” (266). Either the work that constitutes women’s duty is the activity of a rational 
                 (human) creature, in which case it demands the recognition of rights—or it is not, in which case women 
                 should be classed as animals.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Should it appear,” Wollstonecraft 
                     observes, “that like the brutes, [women] were principally created for the use of man, he will let 
                     them patiently bite the bridle, or should their rationality be proved he will not impede their 
                     improvement merely to gratify his sexual appetites” (104).</note> “Allowing this position,” 
                 Wollstonecraft continues, “women have not any inherent rights to claim; and by the same rule, their 
                 duties vanish, for rights and duties are inseparable” (266). In daring readers to try to do without 
                 the duties women already perform, Wollstonecraft raises the stakes even higher, exposing the centrality 
                 of women’s work to the reproduction of the very order upon which all alike depend.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft’s implacable logic creates precisely the kind of dissensus that Rancière identifies at 
                 the heart of Olympe de Gouges’s claim to women’s rights, but she does so not through wrongs, but 
                 through duties. If women are not rights-bearing entities, they have no duties; if they have duties, 
                 they must be rights-bearing entities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“If you do not respect people’s 
                     rights,” as Halldenius puts it, “you are not entitled to expect them to perform duties, for the 
                     simple reason that they do not have any” (<title level="a">Primacy</title> 90). By grounding 
                     rights not in property but human reason, she allows the excluded to accede to the title; her 
                     emphasis on education offers us a subject that doesn’t already exist but can come to 
                     be.</note> Either women are not human and should be treated as animals, or they are human and must 
                 be treated as such—in which case, the rights that are the necessary correlative of duty must 
                 accompany its fulfillment. Wollstonecraft thus exposes the dependence of the rights of man upon 
                 the toil of woman. Indeed, the rights of men are enacted <emph>as</emph> and <emph>through</emph> 
                 the wrongs of women.</p>
<p>Yet Wollstonecraft’s theory is not wholly exempt from the modes of exploitation she condemns. The 
                 line she seeks to draw between elective duty and the rightless toil that reduces women to beasts of 
                 burden presupposes an independence from necessity that allows tasks to be freely chosen—a version of 
                 work largely unavailable to the poor. Wollstonecraft’s celebration of the dignity of duty obscures the 
                 imperatives that constrain actual labor and the ways unremitting toil degrades the worker, male and 
                 female alike. Indeed, even as Wollstonecraft turns “impatiently to the poor, to look for man 
                 undebauched by riches or power,” she discovers that privation and a lack of education have left him 
                 “scarcely above the brutes, over which he tyrannized; a broken spirit, worn- out body, and all those 
                 gross vices which the example of the rich, rudely copied, could produce” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 
                 58). Hard labor proves to be a material impediment to reflection or to revolutionary critique: “The 
                 vulgar have not the power of emptying their mind of the only ideas they imbibed whilst their hands 
                 were employed” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 16–17). Unable to attain the disinterested stance of the 
                 philosopher necessary to critique the system, the “vulgar” swallow ideas decanted into them from above. 
                 The theoretical tools required to dismantle the master’s house cannot be fashioned by the poor 
                 themselves. Wollstonecraft’s theory, like that of Rancière’s philosopher, confines the shoemaker to 
                 his—or her—place.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In a material sense, eighteenth-century Englishwomen 
                     of course could not readily become shoemakers, which is one of the reasons Wollstonecraft gives 
                     such centrality to women’s right to work, on the one hand, and to the right to keep the fruit of 
                     one’s labors as opposed to property, on the other. “A man with half my industry, and, I may say, 
                     abilities, could have procured a decent livelihood, and discharged some of the duties which knit 
                     mankind together,” the abused servant Jemima charges in <title level="m">Maria</title>, “whilst 
                     I, who had acquired a taste for the rational, nay, in honest pride let me assert it, the virtuous 
                     enjoyments of life, was cast aside as the filth of society” (49). The capacity to support oneself 
                     here becomes the basis for belonging to the social and political community. Deprived of the 
                     ability to work, Jemima cannot gain the basic necessities required to perform her civic 
                     duty.</note>

<p>If the title of my essay, “The Philosopher and Her Poor,” takes the woman philosopher as a fait 
                 accompli, it also thereby dodges the question of <emph>how</emph> she attains a prerogative over 
                 thought in the first place—and at whose expense. Even as Wollstonecraft shares in the wrongs of 
                 women, she is the beneficiary of a division of intellectual labor that secures her monopoly over 
                 thought. The form of the philosophical text does not redistribute the authority to speak and the right 
                 to be heard; it leaves Rancière’s “partition of the sensible” intact—which is perhaps why 
                 Wollstonecraft, in her late political writings, turns to the novel to express the nature of these 
                 wrongs. Even as Rancière’s titular philosopher arrogates the right to speak for and about 
                 <emph>his</emph> poor, so too does Wollstonecraft assume a proprietary position of exteriority 
                 vis-à-vis <emph>her</emph> poor: the disenfranchised women whose rights she asserts.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The uneasy relation Wollstonecraft takes to “the poor” on whose behalf she 
                     (intermittently) speaks is evident in her pronoun usage throughout the <title level="m">Vindication</title>, where she shifts from the first person “I” to an inclusive 
                     “we” to a third-person characterization of women. If at times she identifies herself as a woman 
                     (“my own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures”), at others she 
                     separates herself from the disenfranchised category of “woman” she claims to represent (“I do 
                     not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves”) (<title level="m">VRW</title> 
                     75, 131). The economically impoverished—the literal rather than the metaphorical poor—are 
                     described by Wollstonecraft in the third person, typically en masse as the collective poor. 
                     Wollstonecraft’s philosophical voice thus claims a monopoly on discourse, reinscribing the 
                     fundamental political wrong that excludes the non-part from its rightful place.</note> The 
                 exclusions that secure philosophical freedom through the subordination of others haunt 
                 Wollstonecraft’s text, leaving the fate of “her” poor—and the prerogatives they might claim beyond 
                 the rights and duties Wollstonecraft stakes out—an open question.</p>

<quote>One form of immortality is hers undoubtedly: she is alive and active,

<div type="section">
<p>This collection of essays attests to Virginia Woolf’s claim in <title level="m">The Common 
                    Reader</title> (1932) that Mary Wollstonecraft remains a vital presence “even now,” even in this, 
                    our (so-called) postmodern, postfeminist, or posthuman time (163). Wollstonecraft considered 
                    herself among “those who are bold enough to advance before the age they live in, and to throw off, 
                    by force of their own minds, the prejudices which the maturing reason of the world will in time 
                    disavow” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 410), and she has often been described as “visionary” 
                    (Sapiro 33) or “way ahead of her time” (Rushton). We could say that as much as her work evolves 
                    out of and in urgent response to her own era, she also wrote for an era beyond her own, projecting 
                    into an uncertain future, sending up flares for the generations to come. From the opening sentences 
                    of her first published book, <title level="m">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</title> 
                    (1787), where she castigates mothers whose “thoughtless disregard of every thing, except the 
                    present indulgence” leads them to neglect their children (7), to the last sentences of the 
                    posthumously published <title level="m">Lessons</title> (1798), in which she anticipates “another 
                    day” for the girl to learn “how to think . . . herself” (474), she was always taking a prospective 
                    view, looking ahead, if not always hopefully, at least with an eye fixed on the need for change.</p>
<p>Given her orientation towards a future time, it should not be surprising that Wollstonecraft is still 
                    felt to be “alive and active” among us in the current moment, a moment in the still incomplete 
                    transformation of the world she sought to argue or experiment into existence. Claudia Johnson has 
                    noted “her remarkable afterlife” (5), and in surveying her mixed reception and “mutable legacies” 
                    through the twentieth century, Cora Kaplan has concluded that Wollstonecraft persists as “a living 
                    presence in an on-going struggle . . . more complicated and unfinished than ever” (268–69). Though 
                    it has been objected that regarding Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” distorts the historical 
                    record,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Barbara Taylor: “Every feminist generation reinvents 
                        her . . . <emph>Then</emph> vanishes into <emph>now</emph> in an appropriative gesture that 
                        strips both life and ideas of historic meaning, the life becoming emblematic of the dilemmas 
                        of contemporary womanhood, the ideas evaluated as if they were present-day precepts” (10–11). 
                        Also see Timothy J. Reiss’s essay about anachronistic readings of Wollstonecraft and Frances 
                        Ferguson’s response to it in <title level="m">Gender &amp; Theory: Dialogues on Feminist 
                            Criticism</title>. Ferguson invokes the claim of Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” to 
                        address the presentism in Reiss’s own argument.</note> recent readers continue to hear her 
                    voice in current debates on a range of social and political issues or to trace her influence in 
                    their own critical or creative projects. For example, Catherine Packham has recently heard echoes 
                    of Wollstonecraft’s arguments in Oxfam’s 2017 report on global economic disparity 
                    (<title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft, our Contemporary</title>), and photographer Moyra Davey 
                    invokes Wollstonecraft’s life story as a touchstone in her own meditation on family and memory in 
                    her films <title level="m">Les Goddesses</title> (2011) and <title level="m">Hemlock Forest</title> 
                    (2016).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Moyra Davey’s video projects have also been produced in 
                        book form with text and photographs as <title level="m">Les Goddesses/Hemlock 
                            Forest</title>.</note> An Oxfam report and an autobiographical video project may sound 
                    like unlikely manifestations of what Kaplan calls Wollstonecraft’s “almost material presence” among 
                    us (260), but their very unlikelihood signals that her words, her ideas, and her life experience 
                    still live on in disparate and sometimes unexpected guises, transfigured in ways that may indeed 
                    reach “beyond what she might personally have imagined” (Reuter et al. 907). Indeed, as she sat for 
                    her portrait in 1790 and again in 1797, she is unlikely to have imagined that one of those portraits 
                    would be gigantically projected onto the Houses of Parliament in 2011 (to launch the Mary on the 
                    Green campaign) or that in 2013 her image would be stenciled on the wall of the Newington Green 
                    Unitarian Chapel by the street artist Stewy (reproduced on the cover page of this volume); such 
                    recent remediations illustrate that Wollstonecraft continues to appear in surprising forms among us, 
                    even now.</p>
<p>These essays consider in particular some of the figurations and transfigurations of Mary Wollstonecraft 
                    as they appear in various arguments, theories, or practices among those which constitute the ongoing 
                    history of feminism, or, we should say, of feminisms. They think with as well as about Wollstonecraft 
                    by thinking with and about that history as it continues to be formulated and reformulated in the 
                    present. They do not attempt to provide a definitive or comprehensive portrait of Wollstonecraft or of 
                    the ongoing feminist movement for which her work offered an early impetus; such a moving picture could 
                    hardly be drawn once and for all in any essay or even in six. Instead, they comprise a sort of album 
                    of sketches or snapshots, each one approaching its subject in a different setting, from a different 
                    angle, or with a different lens and focus. They move in some of the directions her work points and 
                    explore some of the paths she marks out, though they do not always follow her blazes without doubling 
                    back (for instance to <title level="m">Antigone</title>) or venturing into territory (such as 
                    cyberspace) that would not have appeared on any map Wollstonecraft might have used to plot her own 
                    revolutionary itinerary. These essays hear Wollstonecraft’s voice spoken with unexpected accents (for 
                    instance, in the misogyny of twentieth-century pop psychology or the poststructuralist philosophy of 
                    Jacques Rancière) and find traces of her influence in positions she apparently refuted (such as on 
                    exceptional women as a force for social change). In her essay in this volume, historian Arianne 
                    Chernock observes that feminism “never has been a linear development,” and the essays collected here 
                    demonstrate that Wollstonecraft’s impact on feminist thought and movement also registers in loops and 
                    swerves, indirectly, and in ways that are often contested. The volume takes up the question of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s continuing relevance to contemporary feminist thought and its wider cultural movements 
                    as unfinished business, not to finish it, but to open the question to new or revisionary modes of 
                    critical inquiry and new or newly resonant terms of critical engagement—for example, to Julie Carlson’s 
                    “passional” reading of Wollstonecraft, which engages contemporary debates about care work and itself 
                    involves a kind of giving (or taking) care. Criticism that is motivated by or responsive to the lived 
                    experience of the critic has long been deemed a crucial feature of feminism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">As Shoshana Felman posits in <title level="m">What Does a Woman Want?: Reading and 
                            Sexual Difference</title>: “Feminism, I will thus suggest is indeed for women, among other 
                        things, reading literature and theory with their own life” (13).</note> Whether openly 
                    acknowledged as a contextual element or embedded as subtext, such “intimate critique” is at issue in 
                    more than one essay among those gathered here; <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a range of 
                        ways the life experience of the critic figures in criticism, see Freedman et al., 
                        <title level="m">The Intimate Critique: Autobiographical Literary Criticism</title>.</note> that 
                    the personal and the political are engaged in deep and often difficult conversation in a number of 
                    these essays surely owes something to Mary Wollstonecraft’s example.</p>
<p>Making connections between Wollstonecraft’s efforts to think and live both within and beyond 
                    Enlightenment principles of liberal humanism and various ongoing issues and debates in contemporary 
                    culture, from the political efficacy of social media to the impasses in theories and practices of 
                    social justice (including the impasses in our own critical theories and pedagogical practices), 
                    these essays not only ask how Wollstonecraft’s pioneering arguments live on after her in feminist 
                    thought, theory, and practice now, but they also collectively raise questions about how feminist 
                    thought, theory, and practice live on; together, they query how, what, or for whom feminism argues 
                    now.</p>
<p>If today we can recognize the gender trouble <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                    Woman</title> (1792) brews in Wollstonecraft’s rhetorical question, “Where is then the sexual 
                    difference, when the education has been the same?” or in her “wild wish . . . to see the distinction 
                    of sex confounded in society,” what might further consideration of her arguments about the condition 
                    of women based on their shared experience of oppression provide to current thinking about the social 
                    construction of sex or the fluidity of gender identity or the differences and complexities in the 
                    experience of oppression which are obfuscated in assertions of a universal womanhood (92, 126)? 
                    Wollstonecraft argued for the rights of “woman” as a specific social category of bodies for whom 
                    biology constituted an essential if not an absolutely delimiting circumstance. But as her earlier 
                    <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</title> (1790) also shows, that argument was 
                    pitched as part of a much larger set of concerns: the “revolution in female manners” for which she 
                    calls in <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was integral to a wider call 
                    “to reform the world,” and she saw the liberation of women from the conventions that kept them 
                    physically and intellectually weak and dependent as a necessary step in the effort to dismantle the 
                    “despotism” that more broadly constrained the lives of humans in the material realm of the social, 
                    the political, and the economic (114). The vocabulary with which she took up these issues has changed 
                    in current discourse—we are less likely to employ the language of reason or virtue to talk about the 
                    fundamental principles of human rights or social justice—but this volume revisits and revitalizes in 
                    modern terms some aspects of what Wollstonecraft herself called “my old argument,” which was, simply 
                    put, that women, however constituted as such, are people with minds as well as bodies, that women’s 
                    rights are human rights (<title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 132). As Lynn 
                    Festa’s rigorous scrutiny of this claim in her essay demonstrates, the different ways old arguments 
                    inform or impel new ones is part of what this collection seeks to explore.</p>
<p>The contributors gathered here work in three different disciplines—literature, history, and political 
                    science—though each of their essays crosses disciplinary borders strictly construed; each brings a 
                    multivalent perspective to the topic of how Wollstonecraft’s arguments and experiments continue to 
                    inflect feminist theories and practices today. Their essays are layered and adventurous; a few of 
                    them extend the dimensions of the essay form, taking advantage of the opportunities technology 
                    affords to incorporate other media, as Eileen Hunt Botting does, or to suggest other lines of 
                    thought in the margins, as Mary Favret does. The writer they are addressing—at once political 
                    philosopher and author of tales for children—may indeed demand such a hybrid and genre-stretching 
                    critical methodology, but we can also say that as a collection these essays themselves exemplify 
                    Wollstonecraft’s lively presence among us, taking up her challenge of writing as a form of political 
                    praxis, a mode of doing one’s work that tests conventional boundaries with the aim of pushing for 
                    systemic change going forward.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wollstonecraft’s writing as 
                        political practice, see Carlson in this volume as well Elizabeth Wingrove, 
                        <title level="a">Getting Intimate with Wollstonecraft in the Republic of Letters.</title>
</note> That all the contributors to this volume are white, cis-women may be one among many 
                    indications that even here, even now, the radical change to which Wollstonecraft looked forward is 
                    yet to be realized. The challenge is still on.</p>
<p>Julie Carlson explicitly confronts that challenge by considering the ascription of Wollstonecraft’s 
                    feminism as straight, white, and middle class. Framing her reading within current debates about the 
                    ethics of care, Carlson explores the possibilities of a less normative, more intersectional feminism 
                    emerging in Wollstonecraft’s work. Proposing that humans are interdependent rather than autonomous, 
                    the care movement redraws the boundaries between public and private, institutional structures and 
                    individuals, the social and the psychological, much as Wollstonecraft did in her political polemic, 
                    her attempts at philosophical fiction, and her struggle to live a life of the mind as a kind of 
                    activism or revisionary practice. Carlson sees Wollstonecraft elaborating an ethics of care 
                    especially in <title level="m">Mary: A Fiction</title> and <title level="m">Maria; or the Wrongs of 
                        Woman</title>, where stories of women’s disparate yet linked caregiving activities dramatize 
                    the risky process of establishing relationships through acknowledging and working across difference. 
                    Seeing this dynamic shifts Carlson’s critical focus from the much-discussed limitations of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s feminist legacy to the potential insight inadequacy or failure offers into complex 
                    systems of exploitation and injustice, including those operating at the ground of (inter)personal 
                    relations.</p>
<p>Approaching Wollstonecraft through Jacques Rancière’s ideas about the exclusions that structure the 
                    very logic of the political order, Lynn Festa addresses a contradiction that arises in 
                    Wollstonecraft’s argument that women’s rights are human rights. And not unlike Carlson, Festa 
                    ultimately reclaims the contradiction as the dispute or “dissensus” that creates space for 
                    reconstituting the political order at its foundation rather than merely expanding its boundaries. 
                    For the revolutionary philosopher of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Man</title> 
                    and <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, Festa contends, the discourse 
                    of rights develops “not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror 
                    image of the dominant order), but as the necessary correlative of duties.” Proposing duties as 
                    the basis for rights allows Wollstonecraft to conceive political subjectivity as the capacity for 
                    action rather than a possession that some people have and others do not. Festa thus sees 
                    Wollstonecraft strategically turning “from the disempowering binary of right and wrong to the 
                    empowering reciprocity of rights and duties” in order to argue that fulfilling domestic duties 
                    in itself constitutes women’s political participation. Admitting that an exclusionary division 
                    of labor inevitably haunts this stance, Festa nonetheless finds that in compelling the reader to 
                    confront the stark choice between seeing women as humans or seeing them as brute beasts, the text 
                    performs the dissensus Rancière proposes as crucial to revolutionary change.</p>
<p>In her essay, Julie Murray discerns a shadowy figure of Wollstonecraft cast in Sara Ahmed’s recent 
                    characterization of the feminist killjoy, though she focuses on a text from the mid-twentieth 
                    century to examine the force of seeing Wollstonecraft in Ahmed’s terms. In its “cartoonish 
                    depiction of Wollstonecraft” as a penis-envying neurotic, the authors of the pop psychology 
                    best-seller, <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</title> (1947), trace what they regard as 
                    the world-destroying ideology of feminism directly back to Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality.” 
                    Yet, as Murray reveals, their scathing critique at times appears to speak in a voice not so unlike 
                    Wollstonecraft’s own, absorbing her “withering tone” or adopting the technique of ironic mimicry 
                    she uses in <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. And the book written 
                    so passionately (or perhaps we could say, hysterically) against her inadvertently works to bolster 
                    her reputation, exaggerating her importance, at least relative to more recent accounts which 
                    dismiss her work for its complicity in liberal feminism’s normative prescriptions and progressive 
                    historiography. Murray returns to Ahmed at the end of her essay to suggest that in closely 
                    attending to the complicated and often conflicted affects involved in living a feminist 
                    life—especially negativity or ambivalence—we may discover not so much a particular path forward 
                    as a different mode of being in or of (re)making the world.</p>
<p>Eileen Hunt Botting’s contribution updates Murray’s interest in the caricature of Wollstonecraft’s 
                    arguments in twentieth-century popular discourse by considering the significant social and 
                    political reverberations of memes that get reproduced and disseminated through twenty-first-century 
                    social media as widely visible, as well as endlessly malleable, symbols of ideas. Looking at how 
                    Wollstonecraft herself was fashioned and also fashioned herself as a meme well before the invention 
                    of the World Wide Web, Hunt Botting advises that feminism needs to learn how to deploy these 
                    arguably superficial but nonetheless powerful symbols “for successful political action in the 
                    present and future.” For Hunt Botting, Hillary Clinton (or her campaign machine), along with 
                    Malala Yousafzai and Emma Watson, represent those who have begun to realize the feminist potential 
                    within the global circulation of memes; they also represent how high the stakes are in “the risky 
                    and virulent politics” of meme warfare. In the currency of Hunt Botting’s discussion, as well as 
                    in how quickly current circumstances turn into past history in the age of the internet, we can 
                    appreciate in a particularly striking way that what Woolf called Wollstonecraft’s immortality is 
                    sustained more by transformation or adaptation than by mere reiteration in the ongoing present.</p>
<p>Arianne Chernock detects the tones of Wollstonecraft’s voice submerged in the history of opinion 
                    about the role that queens and other royal women could play in feminist critique. If 
                    Wollstonecraft’s reflections on this issue were indirect or “more muted” than those of her peers 
                    Mary Hays or Mary Robinson, it is nonetheless important to be more attuned to this aspect of her 
                    thinking “both for our understanding of Wollstonecraft herself and for the broader feminist 
                    conversation in which she was, and indeed remains, a central participant.” Even when narrowly 
                    construed, the broader conversations of Western feminism or liberal feminism or white, middle-class 
                    feminism should be seen as more nuanced and multifaceted, interwoven with more divergent strands of 
                    thought and building their claims on more varied foundations than has typically been recognized. 
                    In the present moment, Chernock proposes, feminist scholars might look with more careful attention 
                    at the continuing appeal of “princess culture” among little girls and others in the West, which, 
                    though apparently so invested in perpetuating gender and race stereotypes, could also provide 
                    opportunities for revising those stereotypes as well as reimagining the structures of power they 
                    subtend.</p>
<p>Reaching farthest into the past of the essays included here, Mary Favret addresses the question of 
                    how Wollstonecraft lives among us even now by approaching 
                    <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title>
                     (1796) through <title level="m">Antigone</title> and recent revisionary accounts of 
                    Sophocles’ tragedy. In the resonant echoes produced by what we might call a form of strategic 
                    anachronism (whereby Wollstonecraft is seen to anticipate modern feminist readings of 
                    <title level="m">Antigone</title>), Favret elicits the unvoiced or unheard affects which register 
                    in Wollstonecraft’s work, especially the rage which accompanies sorrow and which turns what can 
                    sound like melodramatic excess into “a vital and timely feminist poetics.” Timely, but also in 
                    Favret’s terms, crucially time<emph>less</emph>—that is, unending, not yet or possibly ever over. 
                    In elaborating the ways Antigone’s cry of <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> (always) 
                    reverberates in <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title>, Favret makes 
                    the force of feminist complaint audible as the “lyric potential” of Wollstonecraft’s prose. Lyric 
                    may be a particularly Romantic modality, like melancholy or the sentimental, but it also 
                    articulates more public feelings; amplifying in her own prose style what she calls the “sonic 
                    undercurrent” of Wollstonecraft’s writing, Favret makes us hear Wollstonecraft’s expressions of 
                    private grief as “her grievance against the state of the oppressed.”</p>
<p>As Wollstonecraft looked forward to a future time when the world will have disavowed its prejudices, 
                    so these essays contemplate the problems feminism has sought to address as still unresolved. If 
                    this album of sketches or snapshots presents six different views of how Wollstonecraft appears 
                    “even now among the living,” it necessarily remains an open book, with many pages still blank and 
                    ready to be filled with other perspectives and other outlooks on both the past and the future.</p>

<p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton—the first woman nominated by a major party to run for the office of the U.S. 
                 presidency—tried and failed to take control of the memes circulating around her political identity. 
                 Alt-right social media posts, tweets, and news articles literally pictured her as a <ref target="https://i.imgflip.com/16zdj7.jpg">devil</ref>, a <ref target="https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/agenda/walking-dead-hillary-clinton-zombie-candidate">zombie</ref>, 
                 or in <ref target="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/88/5c/79885c807cf82a337f545f20f46f4dd9.jpg">
                     prison</ref>. In this ultraconservative media stream, Hillary was hardly presidential material. She 
                 was, rather, an establishment politician from hell who was heading to jail for her supposed crimes—that 
                 is, if she didn’t die first from the health problems that her campaign was desperately hiding from 
                 the public.</p>
<p>In response, Clinton and her supporters tried to take “the high road.” They produced some signature 
                 memes of the campaign, which underscored her qualifications for the presidency (see <ref target="http://textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr.com/">Texts from Hillary</ref>), her solidarity 
                 with girls, women, and minorities (through the <ref target="https://fsmedia.imgix.net/ed/21/75/4d/90a5/4ba2/931a/422695503190/this-collage-is-a-popular-image-on-various-pantsuit-nation-facebook-groups.jpeg">
                     Pantsuit Nation</ref> secret Facebook group), and her hopeful, progressive vision of social 
                 justice for all (such as “<ref target="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/669/ChlZGdOW0AAFhUD.jpg">I’m with Her</ref>” 
                 or “H→”) 
                 (Thrift). They also strove to subvert the misogynist language streaming forth from Trump and his 
                 followers (Martin). By appropriating a Trumpian term of hate like 
                 “<ref target="https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-12-22/7dba1be0-c870-11e6-864a-5359b2af823c_nw.gif">Nasty 
                     Woman</ref>,” encircling the insult in a red heart, and wearing the new logo on T-shirts 
                 for social media selfies, they put a positive yet defiant spin on one of the opposition’s malicious 
                 memes, transforming it into a code word for the cause to elect the first American woman president 
                 (Petrarca; Hess).</p>
<p>We all know who won this “meme warfare” (Boyd; Haddow). Former U.S. senator and secretary of state 
                 Clinton’s typically upbeat, liberal, and cosmopolitan message was trumped by the consistently negative, 
                 nationalistic, overtly white-male-supremacist campaigning of her rival, a man without political 
                 experience. A few days before Donald J. Trump won the White House without a majority of the popular 
                 vote (and to the surprise of most of the media, the political establishment, and the profession of 
                 political science), the British journalist Douglas Haddow remarked: “memes are ruining democracy” and 
                 have “poisoned the U.S. election” through their “mass replication” (Haddow).</p>
<p>Haddow’s then ominous, now prescient remark about the spread of politically poisonous memes raises some 
                 theoretical questions. What is a meme? What does it mean for a meme to be poisonous? How and why do 
                 memes replicate on a mass scale? To address these and other questions provoked by the unexpected 
                 outcome of Clinton’s loss to Trump, this essay clarifies the meaning of the meme and its roles in 
                 representing women in politics since the time of Mary Wollstonecraft. As scholars of British Romantic 
                 and Victorian literature know well, Mary<note place="foot" resp="editors">I use Wollstonecraft’s first 
                     name <emph>occasionally</emph> to underscore the similarity of her public and political reception 
                     to Hillary’s. For women—especially those who are women’s rights advocates—first-name recognition 
                     can be good or bad, because it does not always connote respect, and can often reduce the woman to 
                     stereotypes associated with her gender.</note>—much like Hillary more than two centuries after 
                 her—has been the subject of many portraits in the public sphere. These portraits—good, bad, and 
                 ugly—have shaped the trajectory of feminist politics worldwide (Kaplan 246–70).</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have argued that Wollstonecraft was the first woman to become an international feminist 
                 meme—or a highly visible, malleable, and cross-national symbol of the women’s movement—due to the 
                 transatlantic marking of the major centennials of her life, work, and death in the 1890s (Botting, 
                 Carey, and Wilkerson 13–38; Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft, Mill</title> 204–48). Even from 
                 the 1790s onward, she has been a widely recognized and controversial symbol for women’s rights, 
                 wielded by both critics and adherents alike, across languages, cultures, and nations. Like Hillary, 
                 Mary has done better internationally than in her often-hostile homeland in terms of her public 
                 reception (Botting, “Making” 273–95; Botting, “Wollstonecraft in Europe” 503–27). The study of the 
                 evolution of the Wollstonecraft meme in several of its symbolic iterations—both negative and 
                 positive—yields some important lessons for future feminist interventions in the risky and virulent 
                 politics of meme warfare. As Clinton’s defeat indicates, there is an urgent need for 
                 twenty-first-century feminists of all stripes to strategize the successful manipulation of the meme for 
                 their political ends. Now that the internet meme has become one of the most vital and volatile conveyors 
                 of ideas in contemporary politics, feminists must learn from their past (including their past mistakes) 
                 to tap the full power of the meme as a strategic asset, not a liability, for their common causes.</p>

<head>What Is a (Feminist) Meme?</head>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>Before we understand the historical development of the meme and its relationship to feminism and other 
                 forms of politics, we need to define what a meme is (Botting, “Why Memes Matter”). Memes are a staple 
                 of contemporary popular culture, but most people would be hard-pressed to define what exactly they are. 
                 Simply put, memes are broadly identifiable yet variously replicated symbols of ideas. In the twenty-first 
                 century, most people associate the meme with social media, in which a photo or picture is posted, 
                 circulated, annotated with a brief quote or slogan, then recirculated and reedited into new iterations of 
                 the original meme.</p>
<p>Within contemporary feminism, one famous recent example of such an internet meme is <title level="a">
<ref target="http://feministryangosling.tumblr.com/">Feminist Ryan Gosling</ref>,</title> a series of images 
                  of the “sensitive” male actor emblazoned with woman-friendly invitations such as “Hey girl, keep your 
                  laws off my body, but keep your hands on it.” As this example suggests, internet memes can be vehicles 
                  for irony and wry discontent with the status quo. They can also be more straightforward means of conveying 
                  information, supporting causes, and spreading awareness. “Feminist Ryan Gosling” aims to achieve the 
                  latter goals by educating people about basic feminist ideas in a funny and memorable way. While directed 
                  at an imaginary female audience, these feminist memes are not only for women. A recent study has shown 
                  that men are more likely to support feminist ideas after viewing the original “Feminist Ryan Gosling” 
                  memes. Danielle Henderson, a graduate student in gender studies, began to create the memes in 2011 in 
                  order to make some of the fundamental points of feminist theory more accessible and understandable to 
                  broader audience (Henderson).</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins invented the term <emph>meme</emph> to describe the nonteleological, evolutionary cultural 
                  process by which social symbols are formed, cross-fertilized, and reproduced in new and diverse 
                  iterations of an original (or “genetic”) idea (Dawkins 192, 322). Richard Rorty argued in turn that 
                  “memes are things like turns of speech, terms of aesthetic or moral praise, political slogans, proverbs, 
                  musical phrases, stereotypical icons, and the like” (Rorty 22). Upholding the political relevance of 
                  Dawkins’s concept for a pragmatic conception of feminism, Rorty explained that “different batches of . . . 
                  memes are carried by different human social groups, and so the triumph of one such group amounts to the 
                  triumph of those . . . memes” (Rorty 22). In this light, feminist memes can be understood as dominant 
                  clusters of public symbols that influence and embody the political ideas of the movement for women’s 
                  liberation from conditions of patriarchal oppression.</p>
<p>At first glance, memes may look like irrational or nonrational replications of stereotypes, as Colin 
                  McGinn recently argued. On this reading, memes are merely a series of reductive symbols produced by a 
                  random network of people. As such, memes lack substance or the capability to convey any truth: as mere 
                  stereotypes, they can only perpetuate stereotypes and untruths, such as racist (or also, on McGinn’s 
                  reading, religious) ideas. McGinn contrasts memes with “themes,” such as well-known refrains from 
                  classical music or other products of what he (rather exclusively) defines as human rationality, such as 
                  scientific concepts or theories.</p>
<p>Contra McGinn, I contend that the history of feminism suggests precisely the opposite about the relevance 
                  of the meme for philosophy and politics. Despite their seemingly superficial treatment of ideas, memes 
                  have proven to be powerful means for the public exchange of and critical engagement with complex 
                  feminist theories. The global popularity of “Feminist Ryan Gosling” alone suggests that, even in their 
                  less academic and political forms, memes can play an important role in the public representation of 
                  challenging, rapidly changing, and often abstruse ideas about gender, sex, and sexuality. <title level="a">
<ref target="http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/02/We-Can-Do-It-Rosie-the-Riveter-Wallpaper-2-AB.jpeg">Rosie 
                          the Riveter</ref>
</title> is 
                  another example of a meme that has had incredible staying power and cross-cultural appeal for 
                  feminism despite its specific genesis in U.S. propaganda during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Contemporary artist Barbara Kruger’s work from the 1980s—especially a poster developed for a pro-choice 
                  rally in Washington, D.C.—is another watershed for the emergence of the modern feminist meme. In <title level="a">
<ref target="http://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger/untitled-your-body-battleground">Untitled</ref>
</title> (1989), Kruger bisected a photo of a female model’s face, depicting 
                  one side as the negative image of 
                  the other. She sliced the bright-red slogan “Your body is a battleground” through the center of the 
                  picture. Through the cutting of the woman’s face into opposing halves, the striking reversals of color 
                  (black/white, red/monochrome), and the superimposition of text that can be read in different ways, 
                  Kruger created a multilayered political statement. “Untitled” at once exposes the divisiveness of 
                  abortion politics, the media’s harmful distortion of women’s self-images, the objectification of 
                  women’s bodies for men’s sexual and reproductive ends, and even the ironies of the feminist movement 
                  to “reclaim” or “defend” women’s bodily autonomy from domination under antiabortion policies. Kruger’s 
                  innovative combination of iconic imagery and ironic slogans in her artwork has since become a model 
                  for memes of all kinds, but perhaps especially the feminist memes shared on the pathways of the 
                  internet.</p>
<p>In his book <title level="m">Media Virus</title> (1994), Douglas Rushkoff developed an interpretive 
                  framework for understanding the virulent spread of memes through modern media. He conceptualized memes 
                  as a kind of “ideological code” that spread, like a virus, through media networks (Rushkoff 9–10). Memes 
                  attached themselves to whichever hosts proved hospitable for the reproduction and spread of their views, 
                  whether in belief, action, voice, print, or art. Rushkoff concluded that memes “infiltrate the way we 
                  do business, educate ourselves, interact with each other—even the way we perceive ‘reality’” (9–10).</p>
<p>Ruskoff’s theory of meme replication as akin to viral transmission influenced activist Andrew Boyd, 
                  who coined the term <emph>meme warfare</emph> in 2002. Boyd argued that memes had become the most 
                  significant political weapons in “the matrix of hearts and minds and media” that was “a vast theatre 
                  of viral warfare” (Boyd). Like other political movements, feminism has found its way into this vast 
                  twenty-first-century theatre of art and war, a virtual and digital battleground of signs and symbols. 
                  In order to navigate its own path through that battleground, feminism must pay heed to its 
                  past—especially the global reception of one of its founders—as a guide for successful political 
                  action in the present and future.</p>

<head>Wollstonecraft as Mother of the Feminist Meme</head>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>Long before <title level="a">Feminist Ryan Gosling,</title>
<title level="a">Your Body is a 
                  Battleground,</title> and <title level="a">Rosie the Riveter,</title> feminists 
                  across eras and cultures have made use of the meme for thoughtful and deliberate political purposes. 
                  Mary Wollstonecraft was exceptional in this regard for two reasons. First, it is widely known that 
                  she became a kind of putty in the hands of her patriarchal critics, especially after her untimely 
                  death from a childbirth infection in 1797. Her husband William Godwin’s well-meaning posthumous 
                  tribute, <title level="m">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (1798), 
                  shared too much information with the conservative British public about Wollstonecraft’s experiences 
                  with love outside of the institution of patriarchal marriage. English anti-Jacobin (anti–French 
                  Revolution) writers such as Richard Polwhele and John Corry seized the opportunity to recast 
                  Wollstonecraft in the image of their own critique of early feminist ideas, upholding her as the fallen 
                  woman in an oft-told morality tale detailing the inevitably tragic consequences of the permissive sexual 
                  behavior of the radicals of the Revolutionary era (Botting, <title level="a">Wollstonecraft in 
                      Europe,</title> 503–27).</p>
<p>In 1798, John Chapman created a stipple engraving of <title level="a">
<ref target="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw41811/Mary-Wollstonecraft">Mrs. 
                  Godwin</ref>
</title>—preserved by the 
                  National Portrait Gallery, London—which built upon these anti-Jacobin stereotypes of Wollstonecraft. 
                  Chapman altered Wollstonecraft’s 1797 portrait by John Opie so that she looked masculine in her facial 
                  features, and donned a hat typically worn by male supporters of the French Revolution, thus signaling to 
                  the public that her feminist ideas were a threat to womanhood itself. While these antifeminist morality 
                  tales instigated a negative trend in the reception of Wollstonecraft, especially in Britain during the 
                  Napoleonic era, they also made her even more famous worldwide.</p>
<p>With the international spread of newspapers and other journalistic media in the nineteenth century, 
                  Wollstonecraft became <emph>the</emph> household name for what she stood for—women’s rights (Botting, 
                  <title level="a">Making</title> 273–95). Whether loved or hated, she was a highly visible symbol of 
                  nascent feminist ideas of love, marriage, liberty, and citizenship, especially in continental Europe and 
                  the Americas during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Botting, <title level="a">Making</title> 
                  273–95; Botting, <title level="a">Wollstonecraft in Europe</title> 503–27; Botting and Matthews, <title level="a">Overthrowing</title> 64–83). By 1915, <title level="j">

                          New York Times</ref>
</title> could claim in a headline that the “Woman Suffrage Campaign” began with a 
                          book by “Mary Wollstonecraft More Than a Century Ago,” and append to the article an overtly 
                          feminized portrait-meme based upon the 1797 painting by John Opie.</p>
<p>Less discussed is a second political and literary trend that Wollstonecraft herself instigated with her 
                  first, quasi-autobiographical novel, <title level="m">Mary, a Fiction</title> (1788). A decade before 
                  the British anti-Jacobin critics turned her into a symbol of the dangerous assertion of women’s rights, 
                  Wollstonecraft made herself into a feminist meme by sharing in the public sphere a series of powerful 
                  arguments and vivid stories about her experiences and observations of women’s oppression on the basis 
                  of their sex. Between the publication of <title level="m">Mary</title> and her last, unfinished novel 
                  <title level="m">Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman</title> (1798), she self-reflectively fashioned (and 
                  refashioned) her public personae through the creation of literary personae who were composites of herself 
                  and other women in her life. She became we. Mary in her different incarnations was at once a woman 
                  philosopher who argued for equal rights for the sexes, a melancholic yet heroic survivor of a bad romance,
                  and an “everywoman” who had suffered oppression due to sexual discrimination. From her autobiographically 
                  inflected novels to her published letters to her political treatises, Wollstonecraft’s various 
                  self-images led to countless public reimaginings of the meaning of her life and writings for the 
                  evolution of feminism itself.</p>
<p>One of the unsung, yet strikingly successful, political strategies of first-wave feminists was to reclaim 
                  and repurpose negative memes of Wollstonecraft for the sake of fostering the authority, public appeal, and 
                  internal solidarity of their women’s movements. A veritable pantheon of first-wave feminist writers—Hannah 
                  Mather Crocker, Flora Tristan, Lucretia Mott, Margaret Fuller, George Eliot, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan 
                  B. Anthony, Olive Schreiner, Bertha Pappenheim, Elvira López, Ruth Benedict, Emma Goldman, Carrie Chapman 
                  Catt, and Virginia Woolf—looked back to Wollstonecraft’s life and ideas as an inspiration for their own 
                  pathbreaking storytelling and argumentation concerning the political urgency of the growing cause of the 
                  rights of women worldwide. Immortalizing in literature Wollstonecraft’s staying power as a feminist meme, 
                  Woolf wrote in 1929: “She is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace her 
                  influence even now among the living” (176).</p>

<head>The Feminist Meme after Mary: Hillary, Malala, Emma, and Back Again</head>
</div>
<div type="section">
<p>Back in the twenty-first century, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai, and Emma Watson are among the recent 
                  iconic counterparts to Wollstonecraft, the mother of modern feminist memes. Hillary has taken a long 
                  journey of public refashioning of herself. Her career has been a case study in cultivating political 
                  personae, beginning in the 1970s when the star graduate of Yale Law School chose to support her husband’s 
                  aspirations for the presidency rather than immediately pursue political office, and extending into the 
                  2000s when she used her years as a U.S. senator and U.S. secretary of state to define her global political 
                  identity as the first competitive female candidate for the U.S. presidency (Clinton i). While there have 
                  been many negative iterations of the Hillary meme—often making the lame suggestion she is actually a man 
                  in drag, much like Horace Walpole derided Wollstonecraft as a “hyena in petticoats”—these insults have in 
                  fact fueled her visibility as a significant political actor on the national and international stage 
                  (Walpole 337–38).</p>
<p>Critical responses to misogynistic Hillary memes have also trained two generations of feminists in the art 
                  of public defense of their favored political candidates. This is true on the national as well as 
                  international level. In 2015, Malala undercut the misogynistic meme of Hillary (or any woman) as 
                  unqualified to serve in the highest political offices of the world: “Even in America, even in America, 
                  people are waiting for a woman president” (qtd. in Porges). Malala’s own shifting self-narratives have 
                  likewise made her, arguably, among the most influential international feminist memes (and meme-makers) 
                  today. The youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize—awarded for her death-defying advocacy of the 
                  education of girls against the wishes of the Taliban—Malala now owns the internet when it comes to one 
                  of Hillary’s signature slogans, “Women’s rights are human rights.” This political slogan is 
                  philosophically rooted in the watershed arguments of Wollstonecraft’s 1792 book, <title level="m">A 
                      Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft, Mill</title> 
                  1–17). Hillary’s signature meme and Malala’s iteration of it therefore reproduce a venerable tradition 
                  of feminist argumentation dating to the French Revolutionary period.</p>
<p>Interviewed in 2015 by Emma Watson, U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador, Malala helped to define feminism—a 
                  controversial word in her Islamic culture that she had carefully avoided in her previous speeches and 
                  writings—in a way that would appeal to the broadest possible audience. As she simply and clearly put it: 
                  “Feminism is another word for equality” (qtd. in Vagianos). This slogan has since appeared under the 
                  image of Yousafzai with Watson, and circulated in various mimetic forms on the internet—producing yet 
                  another testament to the power of memes (and their makers) to thoughtfully and rationally engage, and 
                  thereby advance, the ideas of feminism worldwide (Vagianos). The <ref target="https://images.app.goo.gl/DPWLdysDHNPXe4wYA">2016 Hillary presidential campaign</ref> 
                  made a meme of this interview, with the 
                  text “I really think America needs a woman president” superimposed on the GIF of Emma and Malala 
                  conversing. Though on one level arguably parasitic, such a strategic appropriation of the Malala-Emma 
                  GIF demonstrates the ways that feminist memes—like memes more broadly—grow and spread through symbolic 
                  cross-pollination.</p>
<p>During her 2016 campaign for the presidency, Hillary embraced this tradition of making women (including 
                  herself) into positive memes for the sake of advancing women’s rights. In response to waves of 
                  misogynist attacks from the Trump campaign, Team Hillary—both her official and her grassroots 
                  campaigners—gave her public image a series of upbeat, appealing, good-humored makeovers. A working 
                  woman who once looked down on baking cookies became a <ref target="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/70/8c/69/708c695f8786af87703c1a7c2eaf8e82.jpg">maternal 
                      executive</ref>. 
                  The lying yet loyal First Lady became a strongly patriotic yet fiercely private world leader. She rose 
                  from the ashes of the scandals of Lewinsky, Benghazi, and “emailgate” to assume the pop-feminist 
                  incarnation of “<ref target="https://images.app.goo.gl/bKMmWy8WUvwuXdes7">Notorious HRC.</ref>” Even as 
                  many wished her to go to prison for her cache of top-secret emails, a growing number saw her “notorious” 
                  history as an asset in the dark and dangerous realms of presidential and international politics. Neither 
                  a devil nor a witch, she became in these memes a powerful stateswoman poised to do what it took to 
                  protect her nation from threats both domestic and international. Called a “progressive hawk,” she was 
                  represented as prepared to take down tyrants through special ops, beat a would-be dictator in a 
                  high-stakes presidential election, and make hard yet sober choices to defend her country’s security 
                  and other political interests on the global political stage (Cassidy). Almost every negative or mocking 
                  image of Hillary was turned upside down and transformed to advance her campaign for the presidency.</p>
<p>Was it all for naught? However creative, funny, and smart they may have been, the feminist memes made for 
                  Hillary’s 2016 campaign did not succeed in shattering that last glass ceiling for women in world 
                  politics: the U.S. presidency. In a conservative postmortem on the election results, Mark Lilla 
                  gleefully surmised that Hillary’s defeat marked the end of “identity politics,” including feminism: no 
                  longer could liberals assume that diffuse and abstract ideas such as “diversity” could successfully 
                  unite people around concrete and viable candidates, platforms, and policies (Lilla).</p>
<p>While nicely acerbic, Lilla’s critique of liberalism and feminism is (ironically, for an intellectual 
                  historian) conveniently shortsighted. If he took the long view—all the way back to the time of the 
                  French Revolution and its aftermath—he’d see that other feminists, such as Wollstonecraft and many of 
                  her followers, had suffered grave defeats and yet rose from the ashes, phoenix-like, in new, even more 
                  politically salient forms. Against this background, the 2016 U.S. presidential election marked not the 
                  end of feminism but the need for its rebirth in new political media.</p>
<p>Those new political forms include the ever-malleable, though still potent, feminist meme. If there is 
                  any lesson that Wollstonecraft and her many memes teach twenty-first-century feminisms, it’s the power 
                  of rebirthing and reshaping old ideas through new words, images, and media. Applying ourselves to this 
                  historic feminist task, especially in the wake of defeat, is the only path toward a new, hopefully 
                  successful, form of democratic politics that puts the protection of the rights of all people at its 
                  core. Sound familiar? It should. For readers of Wollstonecraft, the path forward for twenty-first-century 
                  feminisms will feel like an uncanny return to some of the guiding principles of <title level="m">A 
                      Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, which have been reinvigorated by the many mimetic 
                  iterations of the book and author in the centuries since.</p>

<p rend="noCount">This essay takes up the longstanding association between Wollstonecraft, feminism, and 
                joylessness via feminist critic Sara Ahmed’s ironic appropriation of the term “feminist killjoy.” I argue 
                that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim to being a killjoy can be traced to the mid-twentieth century, when two 
                American ego psychologists, obsessed with what they called Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality,” seized on 
                her personal biography with a determined vengeance in their book <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost 
                    Sex</title> (1947), and forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft and the annihilation 
                of joy.</p>

<div type="section">
<p>Few would disagree that, by most standards, Mary Wollstonecraft is key to Western feminism’s scene of 
                    origin, with all the weighty burdens and responsibilities—and only some of the romance—that goes along 
                    with being the origin of anything. Some might also suggest that Wollstonecraft is the original “feminist 
                    killjoy,” a term recently popularized by feminist scholar and activist Sara Ahmed. Ahmed’s ongoing blog, 
                    <title level="j">feministkilljoys</title>, is subtitled “killing joy as a world making project.” Her wry 
                    and ironic appropriation conjures the specter of Wollstonecraft, the world-making feminist who has long 
                    had the dubious privilege of being associated with an emotional register that swings from one form of 
                    joy-killing affect to another (anger, resentment, jealousy, suicidal despair, murderous rage). I would 
                    argue, furthermore, that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim to being a feminist killjoy can be traced to the 
                    mid-twentieth century, when two American ego psychologists seized on her personal biography with a 
                    determined vengeance and forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft, feminism, and 
                    joylessness. Marynia F. Farnham and Ferdinand Lundberg’s <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost 
                        Sex</title>, published in 1947, was an instant bestseller. Written and published in the hothouse 
                    of American postwar anxieties about the need to redomesticate women, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    provided the pseudoscientific justification necessary for the argument that women must return to the 
                    home to fulfill their logical, natural role as mothers and domestic managers. Now remembered mainly 
                    for its central part in shaping postwar conceptions of normative family life, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> was crucial in popularizing the idea that feminism, in thrall to modernity, was 
                    world-destroying, and that Wollstonecraft, <emph>the</emph> “modern woman,” was largely responsible for 
                    this sad state of affairs. <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> performs what Janet Todd has called, 
                    with great understatement, “an extraordinary retrospective psychoanalysis” of Wollstonecraft (728). 
                    With good reason, feminist commentators on Wollstonecraft have in the main refused to grant further 
                    authority to “a hostile team of Freudian epigones,” in the words of Margaret George, author of one of 
                    the earliest second-wave feminist biographies of Wollstonecraft (11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Janet 
                        Todd’s passing reference to <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> in her essay “The Biographies 
                    of Mary Wollstonecraft” first alerted me to the book. Mari Jo Buhle’s <title level="m">Feminism and Its 
                    Discontents</title> treats <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s analysis of Wollstonecraft in the 
                        context of twentieth-century American ego psychology. Otherwise, little has been written about 
                        <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s bizarre attack on Wollstonecraft.</note> But the reluctance 
                    to engage with <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s cartoonish depiction of Wollstonecraft has not, 
                    I would argue, been without its costs. A fuller reading of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s 
                    “analysis” goes a long way towards clarifying the source of some of the intensely negative affect that 
                    has long surrounded both Wollstonecraft and feminism. As seeming exemplars of the mid-twentieth-century 
                    social scientific establishment and its celebratory modernity—Farnham was a psychiatrist and Lundberg 
                    was a journalist and sociologist—the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> were strangely 
                    passionate in their fierce defense of tradition. For <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, 
                    Wollstonecraft personifies the “killjoy” whose world-destroying modernity annihilates everything in 
                    its path and must be stopped.</p>

<p>“Mary Wollstonecraft’s life reads like a psychiatric case history,” Farnham and Lundberg begin, 
                    speculating that had “psychoanalysis existed in 1792,” <quote>and had a psychoanalyst (Freud, let us 
                        fancy) been reviewing <title level="m">A Vindication</title> for one of the journals of the day, 
                        he would have been able to come at once to many certain conclusions about the unknown author. . . . 
                        As he read, our imaginary psychoanalyst of 1792 would not too slowly have come to the conclusion that 
                        the author was afflicted with a severe case of “penis-envy,” a term the founder of psychoanalysis 
                        coined to describe the attitude of those women who envy and constantly measure themselves against men, 
                        consciously or unconsciously. They can, so they fantasy, do anything a man can do. . . .The shadow of 
                        the phallus lay darkly, threateningly, over every move [Wollstonecraft] made, as it lay over the minds 
                        of the latter-day feminists. (149)</quote> Analyzing Wollstonecraft according to the terms of an 
                    unrelenting Freudianism that saw “penis-envy” as the structuring force driving her neurotically fueled 
                    feminism, Farnham and Lundberg proceeded with breathtaking confidence to an extended interpretation of 
                    her early life that firmly located the constitutively perverse origins of modern feminism in the fact that 
                    Wollstonecraft’s <quote>childhood had been fearfully tragic and had left her with a twisted personality. 
                        The reader must not lose sight of this fact, because it is to this book that feminism <emph>as an 
                            ideology</emph> is directly traceable. <title level="m">A Vindication</title> was reprinted many 
                        times during the nineteenth century, and many eulogistic biographies and biographical sketches of the 
                        author appeared. There was hardly a feminist who did not, at some time, pay tribute to <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, and credit it with being the source and fountainhead of 
                        feminist beliefs. The book and its author have been apostrophized again and again. (151)</quote> One 
                    of the first things to note about the above passage is that the precise referent of “this book” is not 
                    immediately apparent. Upon rereading, it does in fact become clear that the authors are referring to 
                    Wollstonecraft’s 1792 <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, but on an initial 
                    scan, it seems almost as though Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality” is in fact the “book” to which 
                    “feminism <emph>as an ideology</emph> is traceable.” That sense is reinforced a few pages later, when 
                    the reader is told that “Mary Wollstonecraft was an extreme neurotic of a compulsive type,” and that 
                    apparently, “out of her illness arose the ideology of feminism” (159). The relationship between 
                    Wollstonecraft and feminism that emerges here is one of part to whole: feminism is not a widespread 
                    social movement born of the experiences of millions of women, but rather an illness that can be traced 
                    to the “twisted” mind of one woman.</p>
<p>This referential ambiguity, the suggestion that Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality” is the “book” to 
                    which feminism owes its very existence, is not without precedent. William Godwin’s 1798 biography of 
                    Wollstonecraft, written and published only months after she died, is entitled <title level="m">Memoirs 
                        of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. Yoking the author and her work, and 
                    substituting, moreover, the text for which she is most famous for the woman herself, Godwin’s title 
                    stands as the first in a long line of conflations of Wollstonecraft’s life narrative with the 
                    quintessential example of her life’s work. When <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                        Woman</title> was published in a new edition in 1844—the first since the 1790s—it included large 
                    sections of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title> in the preface, beginning the tradition of 
                    reading <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> through the scandal-inflected lens 
                    of Wollstonecraft’s life, a lens through which the work was primarily read for generations. <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s insistence on an equivalence between the “book and its author,” 
                    both of which purportedly “have been apostrophized again and again,” only added to the sense that 
                    Wollstonecraft and her best-known book were easily substituted, one for the other, and substituted, 
                    finally, in the mode of apostrophe. That is to say, the dead and absent author and the inanimate book 
                    were both addressed by the living, and both were made present or animate—anthropomorphized, even—by the 
                    apostrophic address. That Wollstonecraft was hardly apostrophized until at least the end of the 
                    nineteenth century proved to be no obstacle to the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, who 
                    hyperbolically (and counterfactually) declared that she was apostrophized “again and again,” and whose 
                    own voices were as a result thrown at times in the very manner of apostrophe.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Barbara Johnson’s “Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion” for a discussion of the 
                        figure of apostrophe. “The absent, dead, or inanimate entity addressed,” Johnson writes, “is thereby 
                        made present, animate, and anthropomorphic. Apostrophe is a form of ventriloquism through which the 
                        speaker throws voice, life, and human form into the addressee, turning its silence into mute 
                        responsiveness” (30).</note> Ventriloquists after a fashion, Farnham and Lundberg occasionally put 
                    words in Wollstonecraft’s mouth, as we will see, or mocked her by speaking in her voice, thus 
                    unexpectedly producing the very effects of the apostrophic praise that they attributed to others.</p>
<p>While Farnham and Lundberg seemed to be thin on the details of <title level="m">A Vindication of the 
                    Rights of Woman</title>, regularly misrepresenting its argument, they had amply absorbed, by contrast, 
                    its famously withering tone. Roundly criticized for her acerbic air, Wollstonecraft was no stranger to 
                    bombast, and was prone to an ostentatious style that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    themselves inadvertently flattered through mimicry, offering, for example, this declamatory summary of 
                    her central argument: “The all-powerful, all-evil male had contrived for long ages to enslave and 
                    degrade the delicate, weak, all-good female. Only now was she to be liberated—by Mary Wollstonecraft!” 
                    (145). The extravagance of this mock-heroic invocation of Wollstonecraft might seem merely to underscore 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s unambiguous contempt for its subject, but I suggest that this 
                    figuration in fact revived rather than settled the ongoing question of Wollstonecraft and heroism. The 
                    figure of Wollstonecraft as feminist heroine and martyr framed the sympathetic treatments of her life 
                    starting in the late nineteenth century, with biographers such Elizabeth Robins Pennell arguing in 1885, 
                    for example, that “few women have worked so faithfully for the cause of humanity as Mary Wollstonecraft 
                    Godwin, and few have been the object of such censure. She devoted herself to the relief of her suffering 
                    fellow-beings with the ardour of a Saint Vincent de Paul, and in return she was considered by them a moral 
                    scourge of God” (1). <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s caricature of Wollstonecraft as chivalric 
                    protector, striving bravely to liberate women everywhere from male oppression, did less than its authors 
                    may have liked to undermine the stubborn association between Wollstonecraft and heroism: their mockery 
                    provoked second-wave feminists to defend her virtue and celebrate their feminist foremother as just the 
                    hero that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> accused her of considering herself. The 
                    problem that they inadvertently perpetuated becomes clear, however, when we remember the inconvenient 
                    fact that, as Barbara Taylor has quipped, Wollstonecraft was “never keen on heroines” (252).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wollstonecraft suggests in her <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                        that she wants “to see women neither heroines nor brutes,” but rather as “reasonable creatures” (146).
                    </note> Aiming, we might surmise, to expose with their mock tribute any lingering or latent arrogance in 
                    Wollstonecraft, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> worked instead to reinforce in the minds 
                    of subsequent generations of readers an association of Wollstonecraft with heroism that Wollstonecraft 
                    herself would have readily critiqued, and that <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                    offered little ground to support.</p>
<p>The authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> built their case against Wollstonecraft not only on an 
                    imprecise reading of <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, but equally on a rather hyperbolic, not to say 
                    inaccurate, sense of Wollstonecraft’s reception in the nineteenth century. Most feminist literary 
                    historians agree that the publication of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title> inadvertently rendered 
                    his late wife’s name anathema in polite company for almost a century because of its candid discussion of 
                    details related to Wollstonecraft’s suicide attempts, illegitimate child, and torrid love affairs. As 
                    Barbara Caine observes, “Wollstonecraft was not so much unknown to mid-Victorian feminists,” as she was 
                    “carefully and consciously avoided, especially in their published and public work” (262). Describing 
                    Wollstonecraft as “one of the dark secrets of Victorian feminism, haunting it as a shadowy and 
                    disreputable presence,” Caine notes that it wasn’t until the 1880s that “Wollstonecraft was finally 
                    rehabilitated and acknowledged as the founding figure in modern feminism” (263).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wollstonecraft as ghost, see also the recent essay by Devoney Looser,

</note> Whereas on <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s account, 
                    Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> “was reprinted many times 
                    during the nineteenth century,” and “many eulogistic biographies and biographical sketches of the author 
                    appeared,” in actual fact Wollstonecraft’s most famous book went almost fifty years before being published 
                    in a new edition in 1844. After this new printing, the book languished again until the 1890s, when new 
                    editions by Pennell and Millicent Garrett Fawcett were published. As for biographical treatments of its 
                    author, it wasn’t until Pennell’s 1885 publication of the <title level="m">Life of Mary Wollstonecraft 
                        Godwin</title> that Wollstonecraft’s life was again the subject of an individual biography, almost 
                    one hundred years after Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoir</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Wollstonecraft was in the main similarly left out of the otherwise ubiquitous Victorian 
                        publishing phenomenon of collective biographies of women, which were volumes of women’s lives organized 
                        according to an endless array of rubrics: women writers, pious women, royal women, elite and learned 
                        women, history’s “great women,” and so on. See Alison Booth’s <title level="m">How to Make It as a 
                            Woman: Collective Biographical History from Victoria to the Present</title> for a comprehensive 
                        study of the genre. Booth suggests that collective biographies of women constitute the “lost ancestors 
                        of late-twentieth-century women’s studies” (3). The ironic juxtaposition of Wollstonecraft’s dislike 
                        of the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, with her “heroic” place in origin stories of 
                        women’s studies suggests that our literary histories of the discipline of women’s studies are still 
                        incomplete, and that a fuller treatment of the history of women’s studies, one that takes into account 
                        literary and generic studies such as Booth’s, is yet to come.</note> Drawing heavily on Charles Kegan 
                    Paul’s biographical sketch in his edition of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters to Imlay</title> 
                    (1879), Pennell’s biography was, as we just saw, part of an earnest late-Victorian effort to restore 
                    Wollstonecraft’s sullied reputation, and to that end it trained its sights on the deeply sentimental image 
                    of Wollstonecraft as virtuous mother (Caine 269–72). All of which is to say, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> in some measure produced an impression that it otherwise claimed merely to record: 
                    namely, that a eulogistic aura surrounded Wollstonecraft through the nineteenth century. In the absence 
                    of any actual evidence that would substantiate that Wollstonecraft was continuously celebrated from the 
                    moment of her death, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> obfuscated with rhetoric what it was unable to 
                    confirm with fact. With its anxious repetitions, overstatements, and mock tributes—“reprinted many times,” 
                    “many eulogistic biographies,” “apostrophized again and again”—<title level="m">Modern Woman</title> risked 
                    being mistaken at moments for the very praise it roundly censured (151).</p>
<p>Compared to Wollstonecraft’s contemporary Hannah More, for instance, who was the subject of countless 
                    biographical treatments throughout the nineteenth century—and, as epitomized by Anne Stott’s biography, 
                    <title level="m">Hannah More: The First Victorian</title>, was beatified by Victorian writers—discussions of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s life among the generations that followed her were scant and few. In contrast to 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s assertion that during the nineteenth century there “was hardly a 
                    feminist who did not, at some time, pay tribute to <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, and credit it with 
                    being the source and fountainhead of feminist beliefs,” the historical record would suggest that very few in 
                    fact even dared to acknowledge an influence (151). Harriet Martineau was famously no fan of Wollstonecraft’s, 
                    raising her predecessor as a topic of discussion in her <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, as Caine 
                    argues, “only to dismiss her” (265). According to Caine, Martineau “took pains to deny that she had been 
                    influenced by Wollstonecraft,” and had no patience with Wollstonecraft’s unregulated emotional life. Martineau 
                    referred to Wollstonecraft in rather patronizing terms as “a poor victim of passion, with no control over her 
                    own peace, and no calmness or content except when the needs of her individual nature were satisfied” 
                    (400).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also Barbara Taylor’s discussion of Martineau and Wollstonecraft 
                        in <title level="m">Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination</title>, pp. 246–53.</note> For her 
                    part, George Eliot was more sympathetic than Martineau, but similarly distanced herself. Observing in an essay 
                    on Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller that there existed “in some quarters a vague prejudice against the 
                    <title level="m">Rights of Woman</title> as in some way or other a reprehensible book,” Eliot asserted that 
                    “readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, 
                    and withal rather heavy,” and cited its weighty content as “the true reason, perhaps, that no edition has been 
                    published since 1796, and that it is rather now scarce” (201).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Caine notes 
                        that Eliot “appears not to know about the edition of Wollstonecraft published in the 1840s” 
                        (267).</note> Seemingly perplexed that readers conflated Wollstonecraft’s life with her work, Eliot raised 
                    the possibility that Wollstonecraft’s work went unread in the nineteenth century precisely because it was 
                    continually mistaken for her life. In the nineteenth century, few read the book because most conflated it with 
                    the supposed immorality of the life. The history of the reading of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                        Woman</title> would thus have to include a history of its not having been read, or its having been 
                    overwritten by the life.</p>

<div type="section">
<p>By now it should be apparent that <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was marked by a pervasive sense of 
                    historical anachronism, one that was most noticeable and of greatest consequence when it came to the question 
                    of domesticity. If a primary goal of the book was to convince women to leave the workforce and to return to 
                    the home, then it is not surprising that the terrain of domesticity was a particularly charged one, and that 
                    this produced some intriguing distortions. Consider the following discussion from <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> about men, women, work, and family:<quote>Mary Wollstonecraft, in her <title level="m">Vindication</title>, approvingly echoed Francis Bacon’s sentiments about wife and children 
                            being hostages to fortune. Commenting on Bacon’s wholly erroneous statement, “Certainly the best works, 
                            and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men,” Mary said, 
                            “I say the same of the women.” Women, said Mary, had allowed men to weaken their bodies and cramp their 
                            minds, and by such “sinister methods” had been persuaded “to stay at home, and fulfill the duties of a 
                            mother and mistress of a family.” (162)</quote>Sounding more like a second-wave feminist on the horizon 
                    of things to come—someone such as Betty Friedan—than a late eighteenth-century critic of prevailing female 
                    manners and education, Wollstonecraft and her words are decontextualized here to a degree that borders on 
                    preposterous, and that raises once again the specter of the thrown voice. Her comments about Bacon actually 
                    occurred in the context of a much broader discussion of how male writers of conduct books had not prepared 
                    women effectively for the work of raising children and managing a family by proffering instead “arguments 
                    dictated by gross appetite” that “weaken [women’s] bodies and cramp their minds” (133). According to 
                    Wollstonecraft, feeble-minded and coquettish women did not make good mothers, and the advice literature 
                    addressed to women had for too long been dominated by male proponents of female servility in all things. 
                    Contra <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, Wollstonecraft’s argument was not that women had been duped into 
                    being mothers when they could or should instead have been unencumbered geniuses. Indeed, her primary concern 
                    throughout <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was that women had been trained to 
                    focus less on being prudent mothers and more on being alluring wives. “To be a good mother,” Wollstonecraft 
                    argued, <quote>a woman must have sense, and that independence of mind which few 
                        women possess who are taught to depend entirely on their husbands. . . . I now only mean to insist, that 
                        unless the understanding of woman be enlarged, and her character rendered more firm, by being allowed to 
                        govern her own conduct, she will never have sufficient sense or command of temper to manage her children 
                        properly. (222)</quote>Arguably the very architect of what would come to be one version of bourgeois 
                    motherhood in the Victorian era, Wollstonecraft, far from luring women away from the home and from their full 
                    and inevitable existence as mothers, was instead quite possibly the inventor of at least one version of the 
                    traditional domesticity that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> were so deeply anxious to 
                    recover.</p>
<p>Such historical irony extends to <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s discussion of the “program of 
                    feminism” supposedly laid out in Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication</title>:<quote>In its main 
                        portions, <title level="m">A Vindication</title> argued for an education for women the same as that which 
                        men were receiving in the many schools, particularly technical schools, now springing up. Along with equal 
                        education, Mary said, women would also enjoy an equal moral standard, equal political rights, equal laws, 
                        equal work opportunities, equal pay and equal participation in the trades and professions. <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, in short, laid out the entire program of feminism, and unrealized 
                        parts of the program (such as equal pay for equal work) are still being sought by feminists. (146)</quote>
                    Most readers of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> would have been 
                    surprised to learn that there was anything resembling a “program” within its pages. The criticisms generally 
                    leveled at the book were that it was by turns digressive, disorganized, discontinuous, and full of 
                    perambulations. Not surprisingly, Wollstonecraft had nothing to say about equal pay for equal work, or even 
                    much to say about women and work, period. The misapprehension that Wollstonecraft’s feminism was one that 
                    yearned to emancipate women from the strictures of domesticity has been longstanding in feminist history and 
                    has produced peculiar anachronisms. Such an argument might seem to be supported by a text like Wollstonecraft’s 
                    <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title>, which is devoted to the idea that domesticity oppresses women. 
                    In that novel, marriage is figured as that which has “bastilled” the central character, Maria, “for life,” a 
                    focus which has been taken as one more in a long line of feminist denunciations of domesticity as nothing more 
                    than an alibi for female incarceration by men. This seeming contradiction can be resolved, however, if we 
                    consider that Wollstonecraft is working with what we might call a stadial theory of domesticity, with a novel 
                    such as <title level="m">Wrongs</title> figuring an earlier, “barbaric” stage of domestic life, and the later 
                    chapters of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> sketching a hopeful future for women 
                    in the form of companionate marriage and bourgeois domesticity. Conferring upon women a quasi-professional 
                    status as mothers and household managers, modern bourgeois domesticity can thus be understood by 
                    Wollstonecraft as a space of liberation for women. That is, far from promoting women’s turn away from 
                    marriage, home, and motherhood, Wollstonecraft was arguably the architect of one version of the very 
                    “traditional” domesticity whose disavowal is constitutive of feminist historiography as such. This is a view 
                    that was lost, however, as Wollstonecraft’s vision of female influence in the home passed through a postwar 
                    feminism organized in large part by the drive to rescue women from domesticity, not launch them headlong 
                    towards it.</p>
<p>The most powerful example of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s blinkered view is by far its discussion of 
                    Wollstonecraft and “equality,” a term that bears enormous freight for Farnham and Lundberg’s text, and one 
                    whose origin in feminist thought the authors attempted to lay at the foot of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication</title>. Seemingly unconcerned that <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights 
                        of Woman</title> invoked the term “equality” and its cognates a scant number of times over the course of 
                    hundreds of pages, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> forged ahead in their determination 
                    to hold Wollstonecraft responsible for what they perceived as the scourge of feminism. “The central and 
                    guiding idea of the book as a whole,” they argue, is “centered around the magic word ‘equality’—a fetish of 
                    the feminist movement ever since. The word is just as evocative emotionally to feminists today as it was to 
                    Mary Wollstonecraft” (147). The problem, however, is that the word “equality” had none of the talismanic force 
                    for Wollstonecraft that it did for the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>. In a strange act of 
                    projection, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> attribute to Wollstonecraft the magical 
                    thinking about equality that they themselves embody. <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s archaic fear of 
                    feminism is captured in the text’s anxiety about the potential for an abstract idea to come to life, and for 
                    Wollstonecraft, the personification of feminism, to speak from beyond the grave.</p>
<p>
<title level="m">Modern Woman</title> reproduced the longstanding tendency to confuse Wollstonecraft and her 
                    book, the person and the thing. But <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s “analysis” of Wollstonecraft is 
                    even more remarkable for, among other things, the degree to which the authors display a restless anxiety about 
                    the animating agency of their own writing about Wollstonecraft. The authors of <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> give feminism a disfigured face, Wollstonecraft’s face, and then tremble at what they have 
                    created. This is all the more striking when we think about what is—inevitably—missing from <title level="m">A 
                        Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>: a robust discussion of legal personhood and women’s political 
                    agency. Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was published in 1792, 
                    soon after which discussions of the rights of women all but disappeared until late in the nineteenth 
                    century.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I argue elsewhere that the “rights of woman” gave way in the 
                        nineteenth century to the lives of women. In the absence of a robust conversation about rights, 
                        collective biographies of women, or the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, became the 
                        primary way of measuring the progress of women. See Murray, <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft and 
                            Modernity.</title>
</note> Nineteenth-century Britain was dominated not by debates about women’s legal 
                    personhood but, rather, in the wake of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, by furtive whisperings 
                    about Wollstonecraft’s personal life, culminating in <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s triumphant 
                    revelation of her “twisted personality.” Heather Keenleyside has argued that across the “modern disciplines,” 
                    such as “sociology and ethnology” but also “political economy, law, and psychoanalysis,” “writers turn to 
                    personification to establish their own modernity, repeatedly defining this modernity against a primitive 
                    confusion of persons and things” (447). One would think that as representatives of the social scientific 
                    establishment in postwar America, with its burgeoning inquiry into the study of personality, the authors of 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> would be firmly on the side of the moderns. But in an ironic reversal, 
                    it is the social scientists here who are premodern, producing the modernity of Wollstonecraft—and feminism—as 
                    an effect of their own “primitive” fear.</p>
<p>In a further, awkward attempt to pathologize feminism, to insist on its very origin in one woman’s “twisted 
                    personality,” the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> linked it to the violent dramas of the 
                    Wollstonecraft family: <quote>Mary had a real grievance, but it was against her parents; the same was true 
                        of later feminists. These parents had been the agents of a vicious society (as exemplified by the 
                        childhood household) vis-à-vis the growing child. To Mary, all men were oppressors of women. All women 
                        were long-suffering, all the cards in the deck were stacked against them. . . . All men had always, 
                        without exception, beaten women black and blue, humiliated them, as her father had done to her and her 
                        mother. And all women had, like her mother, accepted such humiliation without a whimper. . . . In 
                        retaliation Mary wanted women to turn on men and injure them. The worst humiliation she could think of 
                        for them, however, the crowning ignominy, was to make them acknowledge the “equality” of women, their 
                        identity with men. (159–60) </quote>The intensity of the psychic and affective drama in this passage is 
                    almost stupefying. In short order, we are presented with Wollstonecraft’s supposed resentment towards her 
                    parents, her resentment towards all men, and her subsequent desire to humiliate them by forcing them to 
                    acknowledge women’s equality with men. Superimposed on this Oedipal scene we also have a version of the 
                    revenge of the psychoanalysts: a potent brew of projection, ressentiment, and misogyny. If we throw into 
                    the mix what Susan Gubar calls Wollstonecraft’s own brand of “feminist misogyny,” then the analysts become 
                    ever more deeply entangled with their analysand (453). As Mari Jo Buhle observes, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> “appeared as the first popular application of selected—and bowdlerized—tenets of ego 
                    psychology to a refutation of feminism” (176). <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was an exemplary site 
                    in which the punitive ego psychology of postwar American Freudian psychoanalysis revealed most chillingly 
                    its fundamental hostility to feminism.</p>
<p>It is clearly not difficult to find fault with <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>. Since its initial 
                    publication it has been controversial, with opinions varying wildly even as it climbed the best-seller list. 
                    The anthropologist Margaret Mead was keenly alert to peculiarities of voice and tone, and observed in a 1947 
                    review in the <title level="j">New York Times</title> that <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was written 
                    “in assorted styles and moods, which suggest that the book had not two authors but four or five, or that it 
                    was written over a long period of time during which the mood of each changed markedly.” She went on to note 
                    that “perhaps most puzzling of all are the sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on the feminist movement,” 
                    with a good portion of those sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on Wollstonecraft (BR18). Mead’s comments 
                    are suggestive in indicating that, even at the moment of its publication, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    was understood as the product of a highly erratic—even “twisted”—voice, one that shifted, morphed, and was 
                    projected, or, in the idiom of apostrophe, thrown. Reading <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, one senses 
                    the instability of that voice, and the uncertainty about where it is coming from. At times patronizing, 
                    clinical, and detached, and at others possessed by an unrestrained contempt for its subject that feels 
                    impossibly personal, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> constitutes an attack on Wollstonecraft that is 
                    so total and complete, as if to suggest that without Wollstonecraft and her “twisted personality,” the world 
                    would have been spared the scourge of feminism entirely.</p>
<p>What emerges from these inconsistencies is <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s massive overinflation of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s power: it fetishizes her by turning her into a totemic figure far more dangerous than she in 
                    fact was. “Only deeply disturbed women,” they write, “disturbed by the nature of their childhood upbringing in 
                    the shattered home and the constricted circumstances they encountered in adult life,” could have “drawn what 
                    they supposed was pure wisdom from <title level="m">A Vindication</title>” (161). The authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> feared the affective contagion that would spread if women read 
                    Wollstonecraft’s work, and wanted to ensure that no woman—let alone the “deeply disturbed”—derived “wisdom” 
                    from Wollstonecraft’s writing. As they put it: “Mary Wollstonecraft hated men. . . . Hers was hatred of 
                    creatures she greatly admired and feared” (145). One wonders, finally, about the degree to which the same 
                    sentiment is true of the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, with respect to the subject of 
                    their “analysis.”</p>

<p>The sheer vitriol contained in <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s screed about Wollstonecraft still

                    the twenty-first century it is, quite simply, difficult to imagine Wollstonecraft as threatening. Far easier 
                    is to imagine her simply as irrelevant, or perhaps complicit with a blinkered view of progressive modernity, 
                    especially as second-wave celebrations of feminism’s founding mother gave way to third-wave critiques of

</note> In our own historical moment, 
                    Wollstonecraft’s name has little of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">frisson</foreign> it used to carry. The 
                    uttering of her name produces—as it did in the nineteenth century—neither fear, nor muted silence, nor 
                    secret desire. Long subsumed to a feminist historiography organized along generational lines of inheritance 
                    and succession, Wollstonecraft’s name conjures for many the feeling reserved for an aging and distant female 
                    relative.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Jennifer Henderson’s “Can the Third Wave Speak?” for a 
                        discussion of the generational and maternal metaphor that organizes waves of feminism.</note> To cast

                    nowhere, and not because her name is only spoken in hushed tones and anxious whispers. It seems not to be 
                    spoken much at all.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that because Wollstonecraft’s name isn’t on the tip of every feminist’s 
                    tongue today that she somehow doesn’t matter. The very title of Ahmed’s recent book, <title level="m">Living 
                        a Feminist Life</title> (2017), which she wrote while working on her blog, 
                    <title level="j">feministkilljoys</title>, reveals close affinities—perhaps not immediately apparent—with 
                    Wollstonecraft.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> is the first 
                        book that Ahmed has published since resigning from her position as a tenured professor at Goldsmiths in 
                        London, a post she left in 2016 in protest over that institution’s handling of sexual harassment cases

<title level="m">A Vindication 
                            of the Rights of Woman</title> is a critique of male-authored conduct books 
                    for women even as it is itself a conduct book, after a fashion. The same might be said, in some measure, about 
                    Ahmed’s <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title>. Ahmed’s effort to distinguish her book from something 
                    like prescriptive feminism is apparent on the first page: “Living a feminist life does not mean adopting a set 
                    of ideals or norms of conduct,” Ahmed insists, “although it might mean asking ethical questions about how to 
                    live better in an unjust and unequal world” (1). Ahmed continues:<quote>It is worth noting from the outset that 
                        the idea that feminism is about how to live, about a way of thinking how to live, has often been understood 
                        as part of feminist history, as dated, associated with the moralizing or even policing stance of what might 
                        be called or might have been called, usually dismissively, cultural feminism. (1)</quote>Ahmed clearly does 
                    not understand herself to be writing a feminist conduct book, yet an anxiety about prescriptive norms haunts 
                    the book, starting with the title. Given the “feminist history” to which she refers, it is difficult not to hear 
                    “How to Live a Feminist Life” even as one reads <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title>. The effort to 
                    place prescriptive feminism safely in the past, as “part of feminist history, as dated,” is belied by the 
                    stuttering over tense that happens when Ahmed gets to “the moralizing or even policing stance of <emph>what 
                        might be called or might have been called</emph>, usually dismissively, cultural feminism” (emphasis 
                    added). The charge of moralizing or policing is one that Ahmed herself has felt: “I have heard that judgment,” 
                    she writes; “it has fallen on my own shoulders” (2).</p>
<p>This tripping or stumbling over tense is not surprising when we think about the persistence of the logic of 
                    progressive modernity that informs feminist historiography. Each successive wave of feminism understands itself 
                    as having absorbed the lessons, mistakes, and hard-won knowledge of the previous wave. But what Ahmed registers 
                    at the start of her book is the degree to which arguments about feminism and moral authority are alive and well: 
                    the feminist killjoy lives. Feminism in the twenty-first century is still in some measure about a right and a 
                    wrong way to live a feminist life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Roxane Gay’s bestselling 2014 book 
                        <title level="m">Bad Feminist</title>. Gay takes as axiomatic that feminism is morally prescriptive, and 
                        thus her book perpetuates the logic by which younger women disavow the ostensibly prim, constraining 
                        morality of previous “waves” of feminism.</note> To be a killjoy, moreover, is in some sense to 
                    <emph>be</emph> an affect, to <emph>be</emph> the murderer of joy, to <emph>be</emph> joylessness. Ahmed writes 
                    about moving through the world as a feminist killjoy and about the way it feels to be the one to make others 
                    uncomfortable, to bring to a halt otherwise congenial conversation and sociability:<quote>Sometimes we keep 
                        laughing out of fear of causing a breakage. We might, in other words, decide not to become a killjoy in 
                        certain moments, because the costs would be too high: we would break what we need to hold on to, a 
                        relationship that we care about, a person we love, a world we cannot let go of. (171)</quote>
<title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> bears all the marks of the autobiographical, autoethnographic, 
                    and experiential writing that has come to characterize feminist writing of the third wave and beyond. But it 
                    also bears the marks of the writing of Wollstonecraft, whose <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short 
                        Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796) might well have been entitled <title level="m">Living

                    personal memoir, <title level="m">A Short Residence</title> constitutes an early example of feminist writing 
                    that seizes on the importance, for world-making, of a canny and shrewd sense of the affective culture that makes 
                    and unmakes our public lives and private pain. There is a cruel irony in the fact that the feminist 
                    historiography we have long credited Wollstonecraft with inventing has impoverished our very ability to read 
                    her. When we reduce her to a cartoonish worshipper of progress, we are no longer able to recognize the restless 
                    and affective ambivalence that she possessed not simply toward the past, but also the present and the 
                    future.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Scott J. Juengel’s <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft’s 
                        Perpetual Disaster.</title>
</note> Wollstonecraft’s work is perhaps the best evidence we have, finally, 
                    that we need a different tense and a different temporality—the future anterior, perhaps—even to begin to read 
                    it. Ahmed’s <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> is not a sign that feminism has moved on from 
                    Wollstonecraft. It is a sign, rather, that we are only now approaching the limit beyond which we might 
                    begin.</p>

<head>About this Volume</head>
<p rend="noCount">This volume attests to the continuing relevance of Mary Wollstonecraft to twenty-first century 
          feminist thought. Making connections between Wollstonecraft's efforts to think within and beyond Enlightenment 
          principles of liberal humanism and various significant issues and debates in contemporary culture from the impacts 
          of social media to the impasses in theories (and practices) of social justice, the essays collectively address 
          questions about what counts as feminism(s) now. <title level="j">Mary Wollstonecraft Even Now</title> explores 
          the range of concerns its contributors take up in considering the feminist afterlives of Wollstonecraft’s 
          controversial writings and ideas.</p>

<head>About the Design and Markup</head>
<p rend="noCount"> This volume was designed and encoded at the University of Colorado,
            Boulder by Site Manager T. J. McLemore and Technical Editor Dave Rettenmaier at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5
            was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool,
            with further TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text in
            archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and Dave
            Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to convert the TEI
            files into HTML. </p>

<head>About the Romantic Circles Praxis Series</head>
<p rend="noCount"> The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is devoted
            to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical investigation of the
            languages, cultures, histories, and theories of Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of
            Romanticism within these interrelated domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual terrain a world where Romanticism has, on
            the one hand, dissolved as a period and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on
            the other, retained a vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical
            discussions of today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this
            terrain with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
            scholarship.</p>
