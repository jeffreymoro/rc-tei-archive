            </epigraph></div>
            <div type="section">
                <p>This collection of essays attests to Virginia Woolf’s claim in <title level="m">The Common 
                    Reader</title> (1932) that Mary Wollstonecraft remains a vital presence “even now,” even in this, 
                    our (so-called) postmodern, postfeminist, or posthuman time (163). Wollstonecraft considered 
                    herself among “those who are bold enough to advance before the age they live in, and to throw off, 
                    by force of their own minds, the prejudices which the maturing reason of the world will in time 
                    disavow” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 410), and she has often been described as “visionary” 
                    (Sapiro 33) or “way ahead of her time” (Rushton). We could say that as much as her work evolves 
                    out of and in urgent response to her own era, she also wrote for an era beyond her own, projecting 
                    into an uncertain future, sending up flares for the generations to come. From the opening sentences 
                    of her first published book, <title level="m">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</title> 
                    (1787), where she castigates mothers whose “thoughtless disregard of every thing, except the 
                    present indulgence” leads them to neglect their children (7), to the last sentences of the 
                    posthumously published <title level="m">Lessons</title> (1798), in which she anticipates “another 
                    day” for the girl to learn “how to think . . . herself” (474), she was always taking a prospective 
                    view, looking ahead, if not always hopefully, at least with an eye fixed on the need for change.</p>
                <p>Given her orientation towards a future time, it should not be surprising that Wollstonecraft is still 
                    felt to be “alive and active” among us in the current moment, a moment in the still incomplete 
                    transformation of the world she sought to argue or experiment into existence. Claudia Johnson has 
                    noted “her remarkable afterlife” (5), and in surveying her mixed reception and “mutable legacies” 
                    through the twentieth century, Cora Kaplan has concluded that Wollstonecraft persists as “a living 
                    presence in an on-going struggle . . . more complicated and unfinished than ever” (268–69). Though 
                    it has been objected that regarding Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” distorts the historical 
                    record,<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Barbara Taylor: “Every feminist generation reinvents 
                        her . . . <emph>Then</emph> vanishes into <emph>now</emph> in an appropriative gesture that 
                        strips both life and ideas of historic meaning, the life becoming emblematic of the dilemmas 
                        of contemporary womanhood, the ideas evaluated as if they were present-day precepts” (10–11). 
                        Also see Timothy J. Reiss’s essay about anachronistic readings of Wollstonecraft and Frances 
                        Ferguson’s response to it in <title level="m">Gender &amp; Theory: Dialogues on Feminist 
                            Criticism</title>. Ferguson invokes the claim of Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” to 
                        address the presentism in Reiss’s own argument.</note> recent readers continue to hear her 
                    voice in current debates on a range of social and political issues or to trace her influence in 
                    their own critical or creative projects. For example, Catherine Packham has recently heard echoes 
                    of Wollstonecraft’s arguments in Oxfam’s 2017 report on global economic disparity 
                    (<title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft, our Contemporary</title>), and photographer Moyra Davey 
                    invokes Wollstonecraft’s life story as a touchstone in her own meditation on family and memory in 
                    her films <title level="m">Les Goddesses</title> (2011) and <title level="m">Hemlock Forest</title> 
                    (2016).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Moyra Davey’s video projects have also been produced in 
                        book form with text and photographs as <title level="m">Les Goddesses/Hemlock 
                            Forest</title>.</note> An Oxfam report and an autobiographical video project may sound 
                    like unlikely manifestations of what Kaplan calls Wollstonecraft’s “almost material presence” among 
                    us (260), but their very unlikelihood signals that her words, her ideas, and her life experience 
                    still live on in disparate and sometimes unexpected guises, transfigured in ways that may indeed 
                    reach “beyond what she might personally have imagined” (Reuter et al. 907). Indeed, as she sat for 
                    her portrait in 1790 and again in 1797, she is unlikely to have imagined that one of those portraits 
                    would be gigantically projected onto the Houses of Parliament in 2011 (to launch the Mary on the 
                    Green campaign) or that in 2013 her image would be stenciled on the wall of the Newington Green 
                    Unitarian Chapel by the street artist Stewy (reproduced on the cover page of this volume); such 
                    recent remediations illustrate that Wollstonecraft continues to appear in surprising forms among us, 
                    even now.</p>
                <p>These essays consider in particular some of the figurations and transfigurations of Mary Wollstonecraft 
                    as they appear in various arguments, theories, or practices among those which constitute the ongoing 
                    history of feminism, or, we should say, of feminisms. They think with as well as about Wollstonecraft 
                    by thinking with and about that history as it continues to be formulated and reformulated in the 
                    present. They do not attempt to provide a definitive or comprehensive portrait of Wollstonecraft or of 
                    the ongoing feminist movement for which her work offered an early impetus; such a moving picture could 
                    hardly be drawn once and for all in any essay or even in six. Instead, they comprise a sort of album 
                    of sketches or snapshots, each one approaching its subject in a different setting, from a different 
                    angle, or with a different lens and focus. They move in some of the directions her work points and 
                    explore some of the paths she marks out, though they do not always follow her blazes without doubling 
                    back (for instance to <title level="m">Antigone</title>) or venturing into territory (such as 
                    cyberspace) that would not have appeared on any map Wollstonecraft might have used to plot her own 
                    revolutionary itinerary. These essays hear Wollstonecraft’s voice spoken with unexpected accents (for 
                    instance, in the misogyny of twentieth-century pop psychology or the poststructuralist philosophy of 
                    Jacques Rancière) and find traces of her influence in positions she apparently refuted (such as on 
                    exceptional women as a force for social change). In her essay in this volume, historian Arianne 
                    Chernock observes that feminism “never has been a linear development,” and the essays collected here 
                    demonstrate that Wollstonecraft’s impact on feminist thought and movement also registers in loops and 
                    swerves, indirectly, and in ways that are often contested. The volume takes up the question of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s continuing relevance to contemporary feminist thought and its wider cultural movements 
                    as unfinished business, not to finish it, but to open the question to new or revisionary modes of 
                    critical inquiry and new or newly resonant terms of critical engagement—for example, to Julie Carlson’s 
                    “passional” reading of Wollstonecraft, which engages contemporary debates about care work and itself 
                    involves a kind of giving (or taking) care. Criticism that is motivated by or responsive to the lived 
                    experience of the critic has long been deemed a crucial feature of feminism.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">As Shoshana Felman posits in <title level="m">What Does a Woman Want?: Reading and 
                            Sexual Difference</title>: “Feminism, I will thus suggest is indeed for women, among other 
                        things, reading literature and theory with their own life” (13).</note> Whether openly 
                    acknowledged as a contextual element or embedded as subtext, such “intimate critique” is at issue in 
                    more than one essay among those gathered here; <note place="foot" resp="editors">For a range of 
                        ways the life experience of the critic figures in criticism, see Freedman et al.,

                    the personal and the political are engaged in deep and often difficult conversation in a number of 
                    these essays surely owes something to Mary Wollstonecraft’s example.</p>
                <p>Making connections between Wollstonecraft’s efforts to think and live both within and beyond 
                    Enlightenment principles of liberal humanism and various ongoing issues and debates in contemporary 
                    culture, from the political efficacy of social media to the impasses in theories and practices of 
                    social justice (including the impasses in our own critical theories and pedagogical practices), 
                    these essays not only ask how Wollstonecraft’s pioneering arguments live on after her in feminist 
                    thought, theory, and practice now, but they also collectively raise questions about how feminist 
                    thought, theory, and practice live on; together, they query how, what, or for whom feminism argues 
                    now.</p>
                <p>If today we can recognize the gender trouble <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                    Woman</title> (1792) brews in Wollstonecraft’s rhetorical question, “Where is then the sexual 
                    difference, when the education has been the same?” or in her “wild wish . . . to see the distinction 
                    of sex confounded in society,” what might further consideration of her arguments about the condition 
                    of women based on their shared experience of oppression provide to current thinking about the social 
                    construction of sex or the fluidity of gender identity or the differences and complexities in the 
                    experience of oppression which are obfuscated in assertions of a universal womanhood (92, 126)? 
                    Wollstonecraft argued for the rights of “woman” as a specific social category of bodies for whom 
                    biology constituted an essential if not an absolutely delimiting circumstance. But as her earlier 
                    <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</title> (1790) also shows, that argument was 
                    pitched as part of a much larger set of concerns: the “revolution in female manners” for which she 
                    calls in <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was integral to a wider call 
                    “to reform the world,” and she saw the liberation of women from the conventions that kept them 
                    physically and intellectually weak and dependent as a necessary step in the effort to dismantle the 
                    “despotism” that more broadly constrained the lives of humans in the material realm of the social, 
                    the political, and the economic (114). The vocabulary with which she took up these issues has changed 
                    in current discourse—we are less likely to employ the language of reason or virtue to talk about the 
                    fundamental principles of human rights or social justice—but this volume revisits and revitalizes in 
                    modern terms some aspects of what Wollstonecraft herself called “my old argument,” which was, simply 
                    put, that women, however constituted as such, are people with minds as well as bodies, that women’s 
                    rights are human rights (<title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 132). As Lynn 
                    Festa’s rigorous scrutiny of this claim in her essay demonstrates, the different ways old arguments 
                    inform or impel new ones is part of what this collection seeks to explore.</p>
                <p>The contributors gathered here work in three different disciplines—literature, history, and political 
                    science—though each of their essays crosses disciplinary borders strictly construed; each brings a 
                    multivalent perspective to the topic of how Wollstonecraft’s arguments and experiments continue to 
                    inflect feminist theories and practices today. Their essays are layered and adventurous; a few of 
                    them extend the dimensions of the essay form, taking advantage of the opportunities technology 
                    affords to incorporate other media, as Eileen Hunt Botting does, or to suggest other lines of 
                    thought in the margins, as Mary Favret does. The writer they are addressing—at once political 
                    philosopher and author of tales for children—may indeed demand such a hybrid and genre-stretching 
                    critical methodology, but we can also say that as a collection these essays themselves exemplify 
                    Wollstonecraft’s lively presence among us, taking up her challenge of writing as a form of political 
                    praxis, a mode of doing one’s work that tests conventional boundaries with the aim of pushing for 
                    systemic change going forward.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Wollstonecraft’s writing as 
                        political practice, see Carlson in this volume as well Elizabeth Wingrove, 
                        <title level="a">Getting Intimate with Wollstonecraft in the Republic of Letters.</title>
                    </note> That all the contributors to this volume are white, cis-women may be one among many 
                    indications that even here, even now, the radical change to which Wollstonecraft looked forward is 
                    yet to be realized. The challenge is still on.</p>
                <p>Julie Carlson explicitly confronts that challenge by considering the ascription of Wollstonecraft’s 
                    feminism as straight, white, and middle class. Framing her reading within current debates about the 
                    ethics of care, Carlson explores the possibilities of a less normative, more intersectional feminism 
                    emerging in Wollstonecraft’s work. Proposing that humans are interdependent rather than autonomous, 
                    the care movement redraws the boundaries between public and private, institutional structures and 
                    individuals, the social and the psychological, much as Wollstonecraft did in her political polemic, 
                    her attempts at philosophical fiction, and her struggle to live a life of the mind as a kind of 
                    activism or revisionary practice. Carlson sees Wollstonecraft elaborating an ethics of care 
                    especially in <title level="m">Mary: A Fiction</title> and <title level="m">Maria; or the Wrongs of 
                        Woman</title>, where stories of women’s disparate yet linked caregiving activities dramatize 
                    the risky process of establishing relationships through acknowledging and working across difference. 
                    Seeing this dynamic shifts Carlson’s critical focus from the much-discussed limitations of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s feminist legacy to the potential insight inadequacy or failure offers into complex 
                    systems of exploitation and injustice, including those operating at the ground of (inter)personal 
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Approaching Wollstonecraft through Jacques Rancière’s ideas about the exclusions that structure the 
                    very logic of the political order, Lynn Festa addresses a contradiction that arises in 
                    Wollstonecraft’s argument that women’s rights are human rights. And not unlike Carlson, Festa 
                    ultimately reclaims the contradiction as the dispute or “dissensus” that creates space for 
                    reconstituting the political order at its foundation rather than merely expanding its boundaries. 
                    For the revolutionary philosopher of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Man</title> 
                    and <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, Festa contends, the discourse 
                    of rights develops “not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror 
                    image of the dominant order), but as the necessary correlative of duties.” Proposing duties as 
                    the basis for rights allows Wollstonecraft to conceive political subjectivity as the capacity for 
                    action rather than a possession that some people have and others do not. Festa thus sees 
                    Wollstonecraft strategically turning “from the disempowering binary of right and wrong to the 
                    empowering reciprocity of rights and duties” in order to argue that fulfilling domestic duties 
                    in itself constitutes women’s political participation. Admitting that an exclusionary division 
                    of labor inevitably haunts this stance, Festa nonetheless finds that in compelling the reader to 
                    confront the stark choice between seeing women as humans or seeing them as brute beasts, the text 
                    performs the dissensus Rancière proposes as crucial to revolutionary change.</p>
                <p>In her essay, Julie Murray discerns a shadowy figure of Wollstonecraft cast in Sara Ahmed’s recent 
                    characterization of the feminist killjoy, though she focuses on a text from the mid-twentieth 
                    century to examine the force of seeing Wollstonecraft in Ahmed’s terms. In its “cartoonish 
                    depiction of Wollstonecraft” as a penis-envying neurotic, the authors of the pop psychology 
                    best-seller, <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</title> (1947), trace what they regard as 
                    the world-destroying ideology of feminism directly back to Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality.” 
                    Yet, as Murray reveals, their scathing critique at times appears to speak in a voice not so unlike 
                    Wollstonecraft’s own, absorbing her “withering tone” or adopting the technique of ironic mimicry 
                    she uses in <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. And the book written 
                    so passionately (or perhaps we could say, hysterically) against her inadvertently works to bolster 
                    her reputation, exaggerating her importance, at least relative to more recent accounts which 
                    dismiss her work for its complicity in liberal feminism’s normative prescriptions and progressive 
                    historiography. Murray returns to Ahmed at the end of her essay to suggest that in closely 
                    attending to the complicated and often conflicted affects involved in living a feminist 
                    life—especially negativity or ambivalence—we may discover not so much a particular path forward 
                    as a different mode of being in or of (re)making the world.</p>
                <p>Eileen Hunt Botting’s contribution updates Murray’s interest in the caricature of Wollstonecraft’s 
                    arguments in twentieth-century popular discourse by considering the significant social and 
                    political reverberations of memes that get reproduced and disseminated through twenty-first-century 
                    social media as widely visible, as well as endlessly malleable, symbols of ideas. Looking at how 
                    Wollstonecraft herself was fashioned and also fashioned herself as a meme well before the invention 
                    of the World Wide Web, Hunt Botting advises that feminism needs to learn how to deploy these 
                    arguably superficial but nonetheless powerful symbols “for successful political action in the 
                    present and future.” For Hunt Botting, Hillary Clinton (or her campaign machine), along with 
                    Malala Yousafzai and Emma Watson, represent those who have begun to realize the feminist potential 
                    within the global circulation of memes; they also represent how high the stakes are in “the risky 
                    and virulent politics” of meme warfare. In the currency of Hunt Botting’s discussion, as well as 
                    in how quickly current circumstances turn into past history in the age of the internet, we can 
                    appreciate in a particularly striking way that what Woolf called Wollstonecraft’s immortality is 
                    sustained more by transformation or adaptation than by mere reiteration in the ongoing present.</p>
                <p>Arianne Chernock detects the tones of Wollstonecraft’s voice submerged in the history of opinion 
                    about the role that queens and other royal women could play in feminist critique. If 
                    Wollstonecraft’s reflections on this issue were indirect or “more muted” than those of her peers 
                    Mary Hays or Mary Robinson, it is nonetheless important to be more attuned to this aspect of her 
                    thinking “both for our understanding of Wollstonecraft herself and for the broader feminist 
                    conversation in which she was, and indeed remains, a central participant.” Even when narrowly 
                    construed, the broader conversations of Western feminism or liberal feminism or white, middle-class 
                    feminism should be seen as more nuanced and multifaceted, interwoven with more divergent strands of 
                    thought and building their claims on more varied foundations than has typically been recognized. 
                    In the present moment, Chernock proposes, feminist scholars might look with more careful attention 
                    at the continuing appeal of “princess culture” among little girls and others in the West, which, 
                    though apparently so invested in perpetuating gender and race stereotypes, could also provide 
                    opportunities for revising those stereotypes as well as reimagining the structures of power they 
                    subtend.</p>
                <p>Reaching farthest into the past of the essays included here, Mary Favret addresses the question of 
                    how Wollstonecraft lives among us even now by approaching 
                    <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title>
                     (1796) through <title level="m">Antigone</title> and recent revisionary accounts of 
                    Sophocles’ tragedy. In the resonant echoes produced by what we might call a form of strategic 
                    anachronism (whereby Wollstonecraft is seen to anticipate modern feminist readings of 
                    <title level="m">Antigone</title>), Favret elicits the unvoiced or unheard affects which register 
                    in Wollstonecraft’s work, especially the rage which accompanies sorrow and which turns what can 
                    sound like melodramatic excess into “a vital and timely feminist poetics.” Timely, but also in 
                    Favret’s terms, crucially time<emph>less</emph>—that is, unending, not yet or possibly ever over. 
                    In elaborating the ways Antigone’s cry of <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> (always) 
                    reverberates in <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title>, Favret makes 
                    the force of feminist complaint audible as the “lyric potential” of Wollstonecraft’s prose. Lyric 
                    may be a particularly Romantic modality, like melancholy or the sentimental, but it also 
                    articulates more public feelings; amplifying in her own prose style what she calls the “sonic 
                    undercurrent” of Wollstonecraft’s writing, Favret makes us hear Wollstonecraft’s expressions of 
                    private grief as “her grievance against the state of the oppressed.”</p>
                <p>As Wollstonecraft looked forward to a future time when the world will have disavowed its prejudices, 
                    so these essays contemplate the problems feminism has sought to address as still unresolved. If 
                    this album of sketches or snapshots presents six different views of how Wollstonecraft appears 
                    “even now among the living,” it necessarily remains an open book, with many pages still blank and 
                    ready to be filled with other perspectives and other outlooks on both the past and the future.</p>
