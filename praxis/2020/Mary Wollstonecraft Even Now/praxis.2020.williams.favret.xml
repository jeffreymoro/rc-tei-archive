                <p rend="noCount">In <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), Raymond Williams 
                    launched an investigation into the historical character of Jane Austen’s fiction which has 
                    profoundly influenced our understanding of the novelist’s work and the period in which she 
                    wrote. This essay first examines Williams’s curiously static representation of Austen, 
                    offered by a critic otherwise attuned to a literary and social history conceived as unsettled 
                    and agitated. The limitations of his approach reflect both gender bias and a bias toward 
                    realism, especially evident in Williams’s reliance on the figure of perspective. To loosen 
                    understanding of the history in Austen, this essay proposes a turn to Williams’s later 
                    reflections on media, notably <title level="m">Television: Technology and Cultural
                    Form</title> (1974), where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries of visual 
                    perspective. Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams depicts it and 
                    to move Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons and other media.</p>

                <quote>After all, it is you yourself [Raymond Williams] who have shown that there are multiple 
                    social processes of a manifestly historical character in the work of Jane Austen, whose 
                    fiction is instinct with her time in a much more direct way than is usually thought. Your 
                    central argument is that she is not at all unhistorical—she’s a highly historical writer.

            <p>Jane Austen is a favorite touchstone in Raymond Williams’s discussions of both the novel 
                and the development of British culture more broadly. She inaugurates his account of
                <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</title> (1970) and then, 
                in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973), marks the historical shift 
                to “an acquisitive high bourgeois society at the point of its most evident interlocking with an
                    agrarian capitalism . . . [a]n openly acquisitive society, which is concerned with the 
                    transmission of wealth, [and] trying to judge itself by an inherited code and the morality 
                    of improvement” (Williams, <title level="m">English Novel</title> 21). Austen helps Williams 
                describe a “most difficult world to describe”: “active, complicated, and sharply speculative” 
                (Williams, <title level="m">Country</title> 115). In <title level="m">Keywords: A Vocabulary of 
                    Culture and Society</title> (1976), the novelist is tagged to terms Williams activated in 
                <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> specifically to track the rise of increasingly abstract
                forms of value: culture and improvement (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 88, 162).<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Austen also appears in the discussion of “Sensibility” (<title level="m">Keywords</title>
                    285). Alistair Duckworth’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the Improvement of the Estate</title>, 
                    also published in 1970, provides a finer-grained account of Austen’s approach to “improvement” 
                    than Williams allows himself. Williams appears not to have read Duckworth before publishing <title 
                        level="m">The Country and the City</title>.</note></p>
                <p>In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, 
                    and even <title level="m">The Politics of Modernism</title>, where she plays only bit parts, 
                    Austen nonetheless serves as a known quantity, a handy point of reference for the historical and 
                    social analyses Williams will roll out. As the editors of the <title level="j">New Left
                    Review</title> note in their interviews with Williams, even though he does not give Austen a chapter 
                    to herself, she nonetheless “figures as <emph>the starting point</emph> of a tradition” (<title 
                        level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 224; emphasis added). “Remarkably confident,” “quite 
                    extraordinarily composed,” Austen’s work injects stability and familiarity into Williams’s 
                    revisionary analysis (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 230).</p>
            <p>It was revisionary in the 1970s to treat Austen as “a highly historical writer,” to quote the 
                words of Williams’s interviewers (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 256).<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">This point intersects with <ref 
                        target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.gilmartin.html">Kevin Gilmartin’s essay 
                        in this collection</ref>.</note> Williams’s treatment refutes what he calls a truth 
                universally acknowledged (he does not employ quotation marks because he owns the phrase in 
                common with his readers): the truth, that is, that Austen “chose to ignore the decisive political 
                events of her time,” war and revolution (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 18; <title 
                    level="m">Country</title> 113). Williams does not claim that the novelist did
                    address such events; rather, he uses Austen’s example to argue powerfully that
                    history and politics belong less to events than to “the whole social experience”
                    (<title level="m">Country</title> 136). In the 1979 interview that became <title 
                        level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, Williams goes so far as to align Austen with 
                his view of the canonical Romantic poets (a radical move for any critic at the time).
                    “The Romantic attempts to grasp the momentous social changes of their time,
                    which were eventually to determine all politics,” Williams finds, “were of far
                    greater significance” than their stance on, say, political revolution.
            <quote>Just as—to take a comparable example—it was really much
                    more important that Jane Austen depicted a vast complex transition in the world
                    of English landowning and landholding than that she did not write about the
                    Napoleonic Wars. It is the same kind of judgment. It is not a general dismissal
                    of politics. (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 81–82)</quote>
               Williams’s understanding of the history in Austen’s fiction—a history of vast social, 
               economic, and cultural transition—has been supremely influential, coloring scholarly 
               works as diverse as Marilyn Butler’s <title level="m">Jane Austen and the War of Ideas</title>
                (1988), Clifford Siskin’s <title level="m">The Work of Writing: Literature and Social
                    Change 1700–1830</title> (1999), and Edward Said’s <title level="m">Culture and 
                        Imperialism</title> (1993).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the preface to 
                            a later edition, Butler comments on her failure to credit Williams in her 
                    study. Siskin cites his debt to Williams frequently. Said’s reading of <title 
                        level="m">Mansfield Park</title> was originally published in <title 
                            level="m">Raymond Williams: Critical Perspectives</title> (1989).</note></p>
            <p>This understanding builds, however, upon a curiously static representation of Austen, 
                offered by a critic otherwise attuned to a literary and social history conceived as 
                unsettled and agitated. As he elaborates in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>
                (1977), Williams typically directs his critical attention
                    to “structures of feeling” where historical experience hovers “in solution,” not
                    yet “precipitated” into “the fixed and explicit—the known relationships,
                    institutions, formations, positions” (133–34; 128). Williams comes to this
                    formulation, though, after his major work on Austen. If structures of feeling
                    hold loosely “all that is present and moving, all that escapes or seems to
                    escape from the fixed and the explicit and the known,” they seem absent from
                    Austen’s world (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 128). In <title level="m">The 
                        Country and the City</title> especially Williams precipitates the world of 
                her novels into something fixed, explicit and known—the anchor of an otherwise mobile 
                “whole social experience” (136). His treatment of Austen tends furthermore to 
                homogenize her fiction (so that any one work stands in for all) and to leave her work 
                unread. By unread I mean to say that in making Austen a touchstone, Williams leaves 
                the novels untouched, and because taken as so familiar, hardly seen.</p>
            <p>Williams’s powerful presentation of Austen in history in fact depends less upon 
                structures of feeling than a specific logic of vision and space. Most notably 
                in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, Williams focuses attention 
                on “a problem of perspective,” the title of the book’s second chapter. For him the term
                    designates a historiographical problem, but Williams’s “problem of perspective”
                    also works rhetorically to situate the work of reading into a telling and
                    restrictive geometry. The best critique of the rigidity of “perspective” is
                    Williams’s own shift in subsequent work to discerning “history in
                    solution.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Goodman’s analysis of “structures 
                        of feeling” in <title level="m">Georgic Modernity.</title></note> His 
                invocation of the “problem of perspective” in these earlier works, by contrast, is 
                especially inadequate to the stillness, quirks, and <emph>vertiges</emph> that 
                sometimes characterize the way history moves in Austen’s work.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">William Galperin’s work in <title level="m">Historical Austen</title>
                            elaborates the ways in which Austen’s oeuvre chafes against the 
                            emergent demands of narrative realism; D. A. Miller’s <title level="m">Jane 
                                Austen, or the Secret of Style</title> reads the smooth and settled surface of
                                Austen’s style as the index of possibilities foreclosed by her
                                social and historical position. In reimagining the familiar
                                “settlements” of Austen’s fiction, both critics find “within a
                                dimension of relatively fixed forms . . . an unease, a stress, a
                                displacement, a latency,” to invoke Williams’s own language
                                (<title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> 130). On the 
                    <emph>vertiges</emph> of <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, see Pinch (156–63) 
                    and Favret (163–71).</note></p>
            <p>To loosen understanding of the history in Austen, then, I propose a turn to Williams’s later 
                reflections on media, where rhythm, sound, and temporality replace the geometries of vision 
                and space. Doing so asks us to reconsider the work of reading as Williams depicts it and to move 
                Austen off the page and elsewhere, to less familiar horizons and other media. If works like <title 
                    level="m">The Country and the City</title> rely on Austen’s fiction  to establish a fixed and 
                familiar horizon, Williams’s writings on “the concept of flow” in new media unmoor that horizon—and 
                our expectations. On the one hand, film and television recognize and capitalize on something less 
                certain or settled emerging especially in the novelist’s later fiction: “qualifications, 
                reservations, indications . . . still sounding elsewhere” (to borrow the language of <title 
                    level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>). These features have the potential, as Williams
                    explains elsewhere, to disturb what consensus—critical, historical, or
                    formal—has otherwise “seemed to settle” (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 130). On the other 
                hand, though, Williams’s reflections reveal how new media work to smooth the flux of history into 
                programmatic <emph>flow</emph>—motion without variation or disturbance. Williams suggests 
                that <emph>flow</emph> may be a new form of fixity, and that suggestion in turn opens new questions 
                about Williams’s treatment of reading (in the medium of print), his commitment to metaphors of 
                liquidity (“in solution”), and his valuation of motion <emph>per se</emph>. We might learn more 
                about Austen as a “highly historical writer” by recognizing the limits of Williams’s treatment of 
                the novelist and adopting instead his insights about new media.</p>

           <p>In quoting from Williams’s most influential work on Austen, I give page numbers from both 
               <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence</title> and <title level="m">The 
                   Country and the City</title> because the analysis of Austen’s novels in the latter 
               repeats wholesale (then extends) that of the former. What interests me is not the obvious 
               change in norms of academic publishing but rather this conflation: that when Williams considers 
               Austen, his approach to a history of the novel and his approach to the social history of these 
               signal English spaces—country and city—so fully overlap. It’s almost as if his rendering of 
               Austen in <title level="m">The English Novel</title> motivates the larger project of <title 
                   level="m">The Country and the City</title>—that is, how “land” is “seen”: if Austen “sees 
               land in a way that she does not see ‘other sources’ of income,” he will cultivate other ways 
               of seeing, attuned to “other sources,” especially labor (<title level="m">English 
                   Novel</title> 21; <title level="m">Country</title> 115).</p>
            <p>The repetition in his analyses works in part because the figure of perspective—styled also as 
                “ways of seeing”—governs both projects. The movement of the eye implicit in perspective cannot 
                for Williams be dissociated from the mode of reading proposed in these works. In the second 
                chapter of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, <title level="a">The Problem of 
                    Perspective,</title> he explains that “the witnesses [i.e., authors and their texts] we 
                have summoned raise questions of historical fact and perspective, but they raise questions, 
                also, of literary fact and perspective” (12). For Williams <emph>perspective</emph>
                provides a provisional sort of mechanism for testing the assumptions of the present against 
                those of prior moments; more significantly, it helps to coordinate individual experience with 
                a given social structure. In this early effort, such coordination operates almost geometrically 
                in the (socially and dialectically) constructed spaces denominated as country and city. In fact, 
                recalling the function that it plays in painting, we recognize—as Williams must have—that 
                perspective figures the construction of those spaces. In his argument, the figure of perspective 
                helps to <emph>externalize</emph>, to diagram or map individual experience onto the perceived 
                world through lines of sight (see figure 1).</p>

            <p>Additionally, the second chapter’s famous image of an
                    “escalator” moving through time as if through space (“back we would go again,
                    over the next hill, to the 1750s”) implies that solving the “problem of
                    perspective” requires movement (10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">“The fact of what I have 
                        called the escalator may be an important clue to the real history, but only when we begin to 
                        see the regularity of its patterns” (<title level="m">Country</title> 10).</note> (Williams’s 
                escalator functions more like a mechanized walkway than a moving staircase—it seems to move laterally, 
                not necessarily ascending or descending). For Williams, proper criticism promotes movement, training the 
                eye to travel between detail and distance, near and far, particular and general, along multiple 
                sightlines. In escalator fashion, <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> organizes the reader’s 
                movement past many  stopping points (the “direct experience” of individual witnesses), a movement which 
                then allows the reader to step back and recognize “the regularity of [the] patterns” that make up “real 
                history” (<title level="m">Country</title> 10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">A distinctly 
                    twentieth-century engine of mobility, the escalator concretizes Williams’s notion of “historical 
                    perspective” (<title level="m">Country</title> 9–12). The reader rides the escalator from one historical 
                    example to another, thus gaining a view of the “general pattern” of an idea. Yet “what seems like a 
                    single escalator, a perpetual recession into history,” Williams adds, “turns out to be a more 
                    complicated movement. . . . [A]t different times . . . quite different values are being brought to 
                    question. We shall need precise analysis of each kind of retrospect, as it comes [into view]” (<title 
                        level="m">Country</title> 12). The reader’s (or critic’s) job is to organize those various 
                    “retrospects” into a unified field: “real history.” As we will see below, the process Williams describes 
                    here mimics closely the functioning of perspective developed in renaissance painting and later in 
                    realist fiction.</note> Placing history within the sightlines of perspective, though, reduces felt 
                experience to a single mode of perception, and a rationalized mode of perception at that (figure 2).

               Later work by Williams will adopt a more flexible and phenomenologically complex approach to treat the 
               relationship between individual and social experience.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The closing 
                   paragraph of <title level="a">The Problem of Perspective,</title> which announce the particular 
                   problem of “literary fact and perspective,” does offer a glimpse of a not-yet-fully fledged 
                   concept of “structures of feeling”:
                        <quote>The things they [the witnesses] are saying
                                are not all in the same mode. They range, as facts, from a speech in
                                a play and a passage in a novel to an argument in an essay and a
                                note in a journal. When the facts are poems, they are also, perhaps
                                crucially, poems of different kinds. We can only analyze these
                                important structures of feeling if we make from the beginning, these
                                critical discriminations [between kinds]. (<title level="m">Country</title> 12)</quote>
                   “Structures of feeling” here seem (tellingly) synonymous with “poems” or <emph>kinds</emph> of poems; 
                   they bear some quality distinct from “fact,” yet submit to a ready taxonomy.</note> But <title 
                       level="m">The Country and the City</title> follows the sharp angles of perspective.</p>
            <p>In these early works, the history available via <emph>perspective</emph> is mirrored by Williams’s mode 
                of reading. As Jean-Jacques Lecercle and others point out, it was Williams, contesting the tradition 
                laid down by F. R. Leavis, who prioritized literature for the New Left as it undertook its 
                investigations of British culture, an emphasis that continues to motivate literary critics.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">“To put it in a nutshell, [for Williams] the centrality of literature to cultural 
                    change provides a mediation between the general determination of the superstructure by the base and 
                    the social experience, which, being lived and felt, will percolate down to the individual” 
                    (Lecercle 41). Lecercle puts stress on the literary <emph>per se</emph>; I want to stress the practice 
                    of <emph>reading</emph> that literature. See also Baskin, <title level="a">Romanticism, Culture,

                            level="m">The Country and the City</title> works to concretize the ways in which <emph>reading</emph>
                offers a kind of <emph>perspective</emph>, binding the lived and felt experience of individuals to the 
                general forms of culture (e.g. literature, tradition). Reading can perform work similar to that of 
                perspective: the reader’s eye travels over the flat page on its way to building a three-dimensional 
                reality, a social totality defined by a horizon of “real history” beyond the page.

              To this end, especially in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, acts of reading and acts of seeing 
                overlap and amplify each other. You can leaf through the book and discover simply through the formatting a certain 
                reading practice: inset lines of verse stud and long block quotes knock and bump the way we follow the page. The 
                method does not differ from earlier works of literary criticism: like his own teachers, Williams trains our eyes 
                to read differently, more closely, these passages of quoted text. Yet because <title level="m">The Country and the
                City</title> consistently aligns reading with the landscape out the window (“back we . . . go again, over the next 
                hill, . . .”), the reader is encouraged to treat the printed page as topography, block quotes standing as landmarks 
                or outcroppings in the continually morphing landscape of British city and country. Analytic focus moves from close 
                to distant and back, the muscles of our inner eye as well as our reading eye exercised to toggle between small 
                detail (of text) and large prospect (of social history). What matters most is precisely that ongoing, alternating, 
                comparative movement, the constantly adjusting perspective: the work of the eye models the work of the mind.</p>
            <p>The treatment of texts mimics Williams’s manner of visualizing the landscape of his country. Here, for instance, 
                Williams recounts something like the tour Elizabeth Bennett takes in <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title> when she visits “the principal wonders of the country” around Derbyshire, including 
                Pemberley (Austen 157).<note place="foot" resp="editors">He is prompted by reading Matthew Arnold’s description 
                    of Britain’s “great fortified post[s] of the Barbarians” (<title level="m">Country</title> 105).</note>
                <quote>It is fashionable to admire these extraordinarily numerous houses: the extended manors, the neoclassical 
                    mansions, that lie so close in rural Britain. People still pass from village to village . . . to see the next 
                    and the next example, to look at the stones and the furniture. But <emph>stand at any point and look at the

                    through as labor <emph>and see</emph> how long and systematic that exploitation and seizure must have been, 
                    to rear that many houses, on that scale. . . . It isn’t only that you know, <emph>looking at the land and then 
                        at the house</emph>, how much robbery and fraud there must have been, for so long, to produce that degree 
                    of disparity, that barbarous disproportion of scale. The working farms are so small beside them. . . . What 
                    these “great” houses do is to break the scale, by an act of will corresponding to their real and systematic 
                    exploitation of others. For <emph>look at the sites</emph>, the façades, the defining avenues and walls, the 
                    great iron gates and the guardian lodges. They were chosen for more than the effect from the inside

                    meant to impress and overawe. (<title level="m">Country</title> 105–6; emphasis added)</quote>
               Our focus adjusts and readjusts throughout this paragraph:
                    it moves from “People” to “you” most notably, and from then to now, but also
                    from general series (“the next and the next example”), to pointed items (“the
                    stones and the furniture”; “those fields, those streams”), then back out to the
                    large prospect (“look at the land . . . and see the long and systematic . . .
                    exploitation”), only to swing back to reassess detail (“great iron gates,”
                    “guardian lodges”) before discovering finally beyond those details an abstract
                    truth: “you now see” the fact of “social disproportion.” Reading the page
                    teaches you to look at the landscape differently; looking at the landscape
                    (“look at the land”) teaches you to read anew: each is a lens correcting the
                    other. And both depend on that restless movement. The method, worked through
                    form as through argument, is so fully visualized and spatialized that its
                    extension into studies of landscape painting seems inevitable, if not
                    mandatory.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I’m thinking in particular of John Barrell’s powerful <title

                The dynamic is considerably more freighted and unsettled than the one we tend to associate with a surface/depth 
                hermeneutic of reading: here the insides and outsides of the manor houses figure at the very least a cartography 
                of class. They gesture to Williams’s own troubled position within and without the academic establishment.<note

                    writing that understands depth as the condition of—and therefore inextricable from—surface (and vice versa). 
                    An understanding of perspective also makes this point. In the passage quoted here and elsewhere in his 
                    criticism, Williams will accentuate the class markers of these perspectival positions.</note></p>
            <p>Williams constructs for his reader a mobile perspective
                    that he associates with many of his selected writers; but for him, Austen’s
                    perspective does not budge. Just a few pages after this tour of the manor
                    houses, Williams stages another lesson in vision and space in “Three around
                    Farnham.” “In this period of change,” the chapter begins, “it mattered very much
                    where you were looking from,” and Jane Austen is only ever looking from within
                    (108). As Williams maps the “perspectives” of three writers at work in the
                    Hampshire countryside circa 1800, Austen provides the pivot: she appears after
                    William Cobbett, the rabble-rousing outsider, has been shown riding his horse
                    around the neighborhood and before the Reverend Gilbert White strolls through
                    the gardens and woods of Selborne. In a world of flux she remains still: working
                    within “no single, settled society,” she nevertheless exhibits a “settled and
                    remarkably confident way of seeing” (113–14). Essentially enclosed, Williams’s
                    Austen is also strangely abstracted—the vanishing point in his picture of
                    Farnham. Williams concretely visualizes Cobbett: “a boy of fourteen, Cobbett ran
                    away from his father’s small farm at Farnham. Cobbett was to ride back through
                    these villages many times” (108, 117). And he lets White’s journal provide vivid
                    details of lived experience as the naturalist dissects a butcher-bird, notes the
                    ripening of berries, and attends to the horrific effects of the 1783 eruption of
                    the Laki volcano (118-19). By contrast, the figure of Austen remains hardly seen
                    behind those impenetrable walls: “not far away, in another parsonage, Jane
                    Austen was beginning to write. . . . in Chawton . . . inside the houses Cobbett
                    was passing on the road. . . . from the other side of the park wall. . . . from
                    inside the houses” (108, 112, 113, 117). No rooms divide this interior world, no
                    upstairs or downstairs, no delineation of domestic routine: “walls” and “houses”
                    are as concrete as it gets. Even as she tracks the “facts of general change and
                    a certain mobility” affecting the families of the landed classes, the novelist
                    herself remains <foreign xml:id="fr">immeuble</foreign> (113).</p>

            <p>Like the novelist, Austen’s fiction remains both already known (settled, composed) yet hardly 
                seen. In both these early works Williams barely quotes from the novels: two sets of fewer 
                than three lines from <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, followed by a series of small 
                scraps, not even sentences, and those only in order “to abstract this social history” which 
                motivates him (115) (figure 4). He does not have to submit these bits for close analysis any 
                more than he has to put quotation marks around a truth universally acknowledged (113). 
                Compared to the large blocks of <title level="m">Tom Jones</title> or <title 
                    level="m">larissa</title>, of Eliot’s fiction and Hardy’s, mention of Austen’s novels 
                blends into the page, barely registering topographically because they are already part of, 
                fully within, the known landscape. The techniques Austen develops “would only have to 
                be <emph>taken outside the park walls</emph>” by later novelists to gain the requisite 
                distance to become a properly “social criticism” worthy of more sustained attention, of 
                that recommended mobile focalizing, close and distant, by the reader (<title level="m">English
                    Novel</title> 23; <title level="m">Country</title> 117; emphasis added).</p>
               <p>In <title level="a">Knowable Communities,</title> a later chapter of <title level="m">The 
                   Country and the City</title>, Williams insists upon the intimate, inside the walls, 
                   “face-to-face” scale of Austen’s world:
                   <quote>It is outstandingly face-to-face; its crises, physically and spiritually, are in 
                       just these terms: a look, a gesture, a stare, a confrontation; and behind these, all 
                       the time, the novelist is watching, observing, <emph>physically</emph> recording and 
                       reflecting. (166) </quote>
            <emph>Outstandingly</emph> visual, the novelist (not unlike the critic) is gifted at seeing and 
                   recording <emph>how others see</emph>, yet little but seeing seems to be seen. As Williams
                    notes elsewhere, what Austen sees is “understandably internal and exclusive”
                    without benefit of larger movement or distance (117).<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">Williams does not mention any outdoor scenes in the novels: neither, 
                        for instance, the satire of the picturesque in Bath (<title level="m">Northanger
                            Abbey</title>), nor the passage in <title level="m">Emma</title> where Emma 
                        stands in the doorway of a shop and observes passersby (a scene studied by Pinch

                            fits the concerns of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, where 
                        narrator, protagonist, and reader all stand and look at the grounds of Donwell Abbey:

                        Free indirect discourse makes it difficult to know if we can take this ideologically 
                        laden view at face value.</note> “Understandably” means we already know why: the 
                   reasons <emph>stand under</emph> our feet, beneath our gaze, without obtruding upon the 
                       page. In a pattern that marks his analysis of Austen, <emph>outstanding</emph> features 
                   are absorbed, folded into the <emph>understood</emph>. At the same time, her “settled and 
                   remarkably confident way of seeing” masks a stunted way of seeing: a “foreshortening” of 
                   perspective, a “blurring of [the] forces” at work on the larger social prospect (120, 166). 
                   Cobbett, perpetually riding by on his horse, can read “class” written on the countryside; 
                   Austen, perpetually “inside the houses,” “can never see that”: the common “underlying 
                   economic process” (117). When Edward Said quotes these lines in <title level="m">Culture 
                       and Imperialism</title> (84), Susan Fraiman calls him—and Williams—out for clinging to 
                   “the myth of feminine myopia”: 
                   <quote>While Said wants to go beyond Williams’s class analysis, his Austen, too, is tied 
                       to and constrained by a domestic purview in a specifically gendered way. Defined thus, 
                       her work is offered as “the perfect example” (<title level="m">C&amp;I</title>, 59) 
                       of the hegemonic geography emergent in the pre-imperialist period, centered on a 
                       Eurocentric formulation of the category “home.” Positioned at the beginning of his 
                       genealogy and at the heart of his argument, Austen’s fiction works, at least in part, 
                       to characterize as domestic and to sex as feminine the larger body of European 
                       culture. (Fraiman 819)</quote><note place="foot" resp="editors">Fraiman’s criticism of 
                           Said is instructive: Said neglects to read <title level="m">Mansfield

                           his reading against the text, and fails, tellingly, to recognize the ironies of 
                           Austen’s fiction, specifically in its treatment of Sir Thomas Bertram. Most 
                           crucially, he ignores the ways gender inflects the novel’s presentation of empire 
                           and colonial slavery.</note>

                                her (4–5). Despite her centrality to the Great Tradition, “for

                                his book (1).</note> Fraiman’s reading of Said suggests that Williams’s 
                    positioning of Austen serves as a way of domesticating and feminizing—and I would 
                    add, <emph>immobilizing</emph>—the landholding class and the culture it produced, validating 
                    by contrast a certain modern—and masculinized—ethic of mobility.</p>
              <p>“Ethic of mobility” is a term borrowed from Elizabeth Deeds Ermarth’s foundational study of 
                  realist fiction, <title level="m">Realism and Consensus in the English Novel: Time, Space 
                      and Narrative</title> (1983). The term implies that Austen’s status for Williams is not 
                  just a function of gender; it may also be a question of genre. Ermarth explains how pictorial 
                  perspective finds its narrative counterpart in literary realism and how this shared logic of 
                  perspective demands from both an “ethic of mobility” (Ermarth 55–58). I cannot do justice 
                  here to Ermarth’s meticulous work, but the link she forges between perspective and realism 
                  reminds us that Williams approaches the English novel as a realist project. More significantly, 
                  her insights suggest that <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, with its 
                  investment in perspective, adopts the techniques of realist fiction—and nowhere more overtly 
                  than in <title level="a">Three around Farnham.</title> That chapter asks the reader to track 
                  and compare three specific cases, unified in time and space, in order to arrive at an abstract 
                  idea of what Williams calls “real history.” In perspectival drawings, Ermarth explains, “the 
                  actual form of something [its identity] emerges from a series of vantage points” or 
                  “appearances”; realist narrative similarly depends upon a reader sorting and comparing multiple 
                  appearances (e.g., Cobbett, Austen, White) in order to compose a social whole.
                  <quote>[The] invariant identity of anything
                    cannot be identified at once, but only eventually, through a series where
                    similitudes and recurrent elements can be distinguished among the differences.
                    [Given a homogeneous sense of time and space] the details . . . understood as
                    discreet cases, now come to be understood as partial expressions of hidden

                    visual apprehension, or, as in the novel, of apprehension by any single
                    individual, in a single moment. (Ermarth 16)</quote>
                  What Ermath designates as “series,”
                    Williams dubs “pattern” or “general movement” made visible by the moving
                    escalator—and the ongoing motions of reading; the “hidden whole” is the social
                    totality or “real history.” For Ermarth, an ethic of mobility both supports and
                    follows from the work perspective performs in painting and narrative realism; it
                    applies as well to the work perspective performs in Williams’s mode of critical
                    reading.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ermarth distinguishes perspectival painting 
                        from the realist novel: “viewpoint in realist fiction is not (despite the spatial 
                        metaphor) a matter of sight and space; it is a matter of time and consciousness” (64). 
                        Williams seems to collapse this distinction, repeatedly mapping the time of reading as 
                        a realm of vision and space.</note></p>
                <p>Ermarth derives the term “ethic of mobility” in contrast to the “ethic of stillness” which Leo 
                    Bersani uses to characterize Austen’s <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>. Stillness makes 
                    that novel a limit case, whose “social universe is inimical to the values of realism” and whose 
                    “social hierarchy . . . depends upon maintaining position” (Ermarth 55). Or, as Bersani puts 
                    it, <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> is a novel where a “tremblingly still Fanny Price” 
                    registers “a sense of the dangers”—and <emph>demands</emph>, we might add, thinking of the way 
                    Fanny is swapped between homes—“of movement” (Bersami 75). Bersani and Ermarth together suggest 
                    that Austen’s fiction may not always fit the logic of perspective governing realism; it may not 
                    always move in the ways narrative realism would come to demand. Indeed, recent critical work by 
                    Anne-Lise François (on <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title>), Sonia Hofkosh (on <title 
                        level="m">Northanger Abbey</title>), and Williams Galperin (on all the novels) have given us 
                    ways of reading Austen against the currents of realism, and within a capacious understanding of 
                    romance. We might simply recall the fragile bubble of romance in <title 
                        level="m">Persuasion</title>, where the lovers step away from vision, sightlines and 
                    chronological time: they “slowly pace,” “heedless of every group around them, seeing neither 
                    sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and 
                    children, . . . and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end” (240–41).<note

                        in <ref target="/praxis/williams/praxis.2020.williams.gilmartin.html">Kevin Gilmartin’s

                                than one class move through the main street of Highbury.</note> Another reason 
                    that Austen fails to appear fully in Williams’s work, then, could be this: her fiction 
                    cannot be seen fully within the framework of the realist novel; it eludes a realist mode 
                    of reading.</p>
                <p>When Williams does envision a concrete image of Austen the novelist—“behind these [looks, etc.], 
                    all the time . . . watching, observing, <emph>physically</emph> recording and reflecting”—the 
                    image startles: not just because its apparently 3D depiction of Austen relies on a hard-to-locate 
                    “behind” (is she behind the faces? behind the words we read?); and not just because 
                    “<emph>physically</emph> recording and reflecting” raises further questions about the materiality 
                    of the scene (does <emph>physically</emph> recording describe an act of eye, hand, or ear? 
                    Does <emph>physically</emph> also modify reflecting?) (<title level="m">Country</title> 166). 
                    The language startles because the watcher-recorder surfaces only to vanish again. Just watch: 
                    “Her eye for a house, for timber, for the details of improvement,” Williams notes, “is quick, 
                    accurate, monetary” (115). We see a quick eye, her eye. Then:
                    <quote>Yet money or other kinds, from the trading houses, from the colonial plantations, has 
                        no visual equivalent; it <emph>has to be converted</emph> into these signs of order <emph>to 
                            be recognised</emph> at all. This way of seeing is especially representative. <emph>The 
                                land is seen</emph> primarily as an index of revenue and position; its visible order 
                        and control are a valued product, while the process of working <emph>it is hardly seen</emph> 
                        at all. (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 22; <title level="m">Country</title> 115; 
                            emphasis added)</quote>
                  What happens to her eye, to her, in “this way of seeing”?
                    Elsewhere in this collection of essays, Brian McGrath diagnoses this recurrent
                    feature of Williams’s prose, the recourse to the passive voice. Used sometimes
                    ironically, the passive voice can demonstrate, McGrath writes, “how difficult it
                    can be to determine and stabilize the difference between subjects and objects
                    (the agents who act and the things that are acted upon)” (McGrath). Like
                    perspective, then, the passive voice operates as another mechanism for holding
                    together the individual instance with the larger social whole. In Williams’s
                    writing about Austen, though, its use matches a pervasive disappearing of this
                    woman and her novels. Some unstated generality or abstracting force (“the land
                    is seen,” “the process . . . is hardly seen”) absorbs the novelist, leaving “no
                    visual equivalent” of her “process of working” (the irony hits hard) (<title 
                        level="m">Country</title> 115). The abstracting happens again when Williams 
                    decrees,  “Where only one class is seen, no classes are seen” (117). And again, 
                    when “through the holes of this tightly-drawn mesh most actual people are not to be 
                    seen,” the mesh-maker in turn drops from view, written over by abstraction and stark 
                    impersonality (call it the park wall) (118). D. A. Miller will later twist the 
                    characterization, attributing to the novelist this refusal of embodied personhood, 
                    as if it were a mode of protection, effacing <emph>perforce</emph> her “peculiar” social 
                    status as spinster-woman-author, before “disappearing” into a flawless style 
                    (Miller 8–9).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Nick Dames adapts Williams’s 
                        characterization: “Austen has that trick of slipping out of focus, of seeming to be 
                        vanishing into the historical background even as she’s coming closer to us” 
                        (95).</note> Williams shows less sympathy. His paragraph concludes:
                    “No other community [than the landed gentry] . . . is by any means knowable. And
                    it is not only most of the people who have disappeared. . . . [it] is also most
                    of the country, which becomes real [in these novels] only as it relates to the
                    houses which are the real nodes; for the rest the country is weather or a place
                    for a walk” (<title level="m">Country</title> 166).</p>
                 <p>The taut cadence and irony of that last clause—“for the
                    rest the country is weather or a place for a walk”—is nearly Austenian. It
                    signals, if not contempt, then at least Williams’s alienation from this specific
                    “knowable community” and its mode of seeing. But Williams overlooks Austen’s own
                    ironies, and overlooks too her own manner of alienation from the network of
                    manor houses (and her sometimes forced movement among them), all of which might
                    position her differently on the landscape, with a less stable angle of vision.
                    Both <title level="m">The English Novel</title> and <title level="m">The City and the 
                        Country</title> ignore the slippages and fissures of Austen’s irony, emphasizing 
                     instead the “achievement of a unity of tone,” “her remarkable unity of tone,” “a 
                     unity of language in all its main uses,” “a remarkable unity of tone” and what the 
                     editors of <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> echo in citing her 
                     “extraordinary unity of tone” (<title level="m">Country</title> 115, 116, 
                     169; <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 228). With George Eilot, 
                     Williams can hear fracture and inconsistency, a “break in the texture” and 
                     coherent “idiom” inherited from Austen. Such dissonance gives evidence of the 
                     “acute difficulty” Eliot takes on when trying to comprehend a broader social 
                     world than her predecessor (<title level="m">Country</title> 168–69).<note place="foot" 
                         resp="editors">In an extraordinary passage, Williams announces his class 
                         sympathies with Eliot (168–71).</note> In Austen’s fiction he hears no 
                     dissonance; hardly seeing, he seems hardly to hear. Impervious unity of tone 
                     provides the aural equivalent of her “remarkably settled and confident way of 
                     seeing,” elsewhere concretized in the impregnable walls that fix and delimit Jane 
                     Austen. All three—enclosing walls, settled way of seeing, unified tone—betoken 
                     the exclusive <emph>status</emph> (quite literal) of Austen’s social world. 
                     Features of the landscape as much as features of style, they function as 
                     objective correlatives of the otherwise “unseen formula” or rigid “grammar” 
                     of Austen’s writing, where “improvement is or ought to be improvement” (<title 
                         level="m">Country</title> 116). As William Galperin points out in <title 
                             level="m">Historical Austen</title>, Williams’s approach “assumes that 
                     Austen’s representational technique could only work in one register and to a single 
                     purpose” (Galperin 2). One might add: and from one fixed location and in one tone.</p>
                 <p>The urge to position Austen in terms of something settled, composed, and unified aligns with 
                     Williams’s need for a “point of origin” or, more precisely, a point of departure for critique 
                     (“to be <emph>taken outside the park walls</emph>”). The effort to keep Austen a settled matter 
                     nonetheless produces its own strain and discomposure in Williams’s writing, which 
                     characteristically gravitates toward a mobile and shifting perspective (the escalator), or 
                     toward friction, and unsettledness. I have remarked on the awkward picture of the novelist 
                     “behind . . . <emph>physically</emph> recording”; there is also the “is <emph>or ought to 
                         be</emph>” which snags the neat formula of Austen’s settled view of improvement. 
                     Additionally there are repeated (apologetic?) notes of exceptionalism (“outstanding,” 
                     “remarkable,” “extraordinary”) that jar an account that otherwise assimilates Austen’s work 
                     into a representative, hegemonic, and uniform way of seeing.</p>
            <p>The effort to maintain Austen as a fixed entity—the requisite vanishing point—does begin to wobble 
                later, in <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>. There Williams suggests that Austen’s 
                achieved unity was hardly achieved: “In my view Jane Austen makes a very <emph>strenuous</emph> 
                attempt to unify what was not unifiable” (228; emphasis added). Or achieved only through magic: 
                he calls up a favorite image of the novelist accomplishing the “reconciliation of property and 
                value like a supernatural lawyer.” The supernatural lawyer appears in both <title level="m">The 
                    English Novel</title> and <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>: this third time it 
                feels almost insistent (<title level="m">English Novel</title> 23; <title level="m">Country</title> 
                116; <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 228). Williams’s simile introduces a note of 
                historical impossibility, of fantasy operating in a world he otherwise subjects fully to the 
                protocols of realism. In claiming that her “settlements are an artificial solution” that will 
                provide the “basis for critique” in the work of subsequent novelists, Williams seems not quite to 
                recognize that the manifest artificiality, extraordinariness, and, for lack of a better word, 
                <emph>romance</emph> of these settlements already form a kind of critique (<title level="m">Politics 
                    and Letters</title> 228).<note place="foot" resp="editors">This recognition of the critical force 
                        of romance at work in Austen’s realism animates Galperin’s study, and warrants his revision 
                        of what it means for Austen to be “historical.” In <title level="a">The Illusionist: <title 
                            level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> and Austen’s Uses of Enchantment,</title> Sonia
                                Hofkosh similarly renovates a strain of criticism that pulls Austen’s fiction away 
                                from conventional realism. Williams does indicate that if he had begun his history of 
                                the English novel in the 1790s, “I think this would have yielded a different 
                                perspective on Jane Austen” (225). His comments suggest that the fiction of the 
                                1790s (e.g., Godwin’s) had to be suppressed after the turn of the century and did 
                                not resurface until the 1830s. Presumably Austen would for Williams mark suppression 
                                or reaction, not continuation of earlier Gothic and romance impulses.</note> Quietly, 
                slightly, something begins to shift and move in the way he speaks of Austen. After pages spent 
                fending off the stringent objections of his interlocutors on the topic of Austen’s fiction, objections 
                which seem to stand in for a discussion of tradition and literature <emph>per se</emph>, Williams 
                turns an unforeseen corner. What had been assumed “understandably” in <title level="m">The Country 
                    and the City</title> now needs to be investigated: “In Austen’s case, I would now say that two 
                special conditions of her ideological stance were decisive: She was doubly marginalized in relation 
                to her class, as a dependent within it, and as a woman” (<title level="m">Politics and 
                    Letters</title> 230). The ground shifts, sending Austen to a more precarious position on the 
                margins of the propertied class. To which Williams’s interlocutors respond, “Turning to 
                Dickens . . .” (230).</p>

           <div type="section">
             <p>Williams makes the observations above in a 1983 essay on film history, but what he says here could easily 
                 carry over to a history of the novel or of Romanticism, or indeed, his own line-drawing around that 
                 “subject” of attention and emphasis, Jane Austen. Even as <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title> appeared in print, Williams was immersing himself in the new discipline of communications; 
                 his <title level="m">Television: Technology and Cultural Form</title> appeared a year later, in 1974. 
                 Williams’s encounter with the study of new media appears to have made him more emphatic about 
                 destabilizing the subjects and “unitary” narratives of the “fixed and enclosed forms of established 
                 culture” (<title level="m">What I Came to Say</title> 138, 136).<note place="foot" resp="editors">These 
                     phrases are taken from <title level="a">The Future of English Literature,</title> the essay

                     reform for the university course in English literature. The two essays follow a similar 
                     method.</note> It seems plausible, indeed faithful to Williams’s
                    insights, to engage Austen anew through the more mobile, multistranded and
                    contentious mode that Williams developed for his histories of film and
                    television, media forms which have amply welcomed Jane Austen—her fiction and
                    her fictionalized life. Features that had hardened into familiarity, the park
                    walls drawn around that “subject,” are set in motion when television, film, and
                    a range of digital media testify that the “areas of common life” denominated by
                    “Jane Austen” extend now—and have in fact extended for a century—well beyond an
                    English countryside, and indeed beyond an English or even literary tradition,
                    and well beyond the enclosure of a unified style.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Claudia Johnson’s 
                        work (<title level="a">The Divine Miss Jane</title>; <title level="m">Jane Austen’s Cults and
                                Cultures</title>) has paved the way to a sophisticated recognition of various “Jane 
                        Austens” travelling since the mid-1800s throughout Anglo-American popular culture and well into 
                        subcultures.</note> Two concerns emerge with this change of approach. First, the terms Williams 
                 develops to speak of new media—television especially—help us perceive how deeply Austen’s fiction is 
                 informed and vexed by questions of motion, temporality, and tempo (rather than the questions of vision 
                 and space raised by Williams’s earlier work). Of course motion has a place in all Austen’s fiction (think 
                 only of Catherine Morley’s carriage ride with John Thorpe, or Elizabeth Bennett’s muddy walk); but motion 
                 (along with stasis) is subject to severe scrutiny in her later work: <title level="m">Emma</title>, <title 
                     level="m">Mansfield Park</title>, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, and <title 
                         level="m">Sanditon</title>. Second, Williams’s analysis also suggests that in grasping this aspect 
                 of Austen’s work, new media risk exploiting and sanitizing it, smoothing its
                    vexations into harmonious and continual “flow.” In short, Williams’s writing on
                    media reveals the limitations of both his early work on Austen’s novels and the
                    later adaptation of those novels by new media. If Austen led him to translate
                    reading to a mode of seeing, new media lead him to worry about reading converted
                    to a mode of watching.</p>
            <p>With the move to the study of media comes a heightened attention in Williams’s method to multiple lines of 
                development (no single tradition or <emph>telos</emph>) as well as a reconsideration of the appeal of 
                mobility. He finds for instance that <emph>independent of narrative content</emph>, the medium of film 
                provides “experiences of mobility, dislocation and alienation, but also intense curiosity 
                <emph>about</emph> movement and newly possible dynamic forms” (142; emphasis added). The emphasis extends 
                to his reflections on television, which offers not just a curiosity about mobility but—and again, 
                independent of specific content—a newly mobile way of viewing: the “primary processes of the technology 
                [of television],” he explains, promote a new “kind of attention,” “an experience of visual mobility, of 
                contrast of angle, of variation of focus, which is often very beautiful” (<title level="m">Television</title> 
                74–75). In both film and television the movement associated with the technology and an individual’s 
                experience of that movement form part of a “whole social experience . . . of greater physical and social 
                mobility” (87–88). Television makes Williams’s figure of the escalator (strained to begin with) unusable: 
                motion expands almost infinitely even as it becomes more recursive and constraining. Wary of the greater 
                mobility of new media, Williams’s analyses discard the spatialized, perspectival vision that informs <title 
                    level="m">The Country and the City</title>, working instead with temporal markers of rhythm and tempo, 
                as well as sonic qualities of dissonance and silence.</p>
            <p>What preoccupies Williams about television especially (and his “television” powerfully anticipates 
                subsequent new media) is the “concept of flow,” a reformulation of sequence and interval without 
                interruption, where rhythmic and seemingly “natural breaks” foster “the impulse to go on watching”—not 
                unlike, perhaps, the experience of reading serialized novels in print. Yet “watching” directs itself at no 
                particular content, but simply an undifferentiated, horizonless, and ever-streaming “television,” quite 
                distinct from the topographical model of seeing/reading promoted in <title level="m">The Country and the 
                    City</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the continuing relevance of Williams’s <title

                                contemporary tools of the long revolution towards an educated and
                                participatory democracy, and of the recovery of effective

                subordinate to a certain tempo and movement captured by the liquid “flow” of ceaseless programming. 
                Williams searches for both revolutionary and counterrevolutionary impulses in the phenomenon, 
                but <title level="m">Television</title> ends on this dystopian note:
                <quote>Under cover of talk about choice and competition, a few

                    individual and collective response to many different kinds of experience and
                    problem became almost limited to choice between their programmed possibilities.
                    (151)</quote>
                In contrast to older and, as Williams sees it, more
                    “static” notions of programming (in conventional modes of entertainment and
                    education), “the flow [of new media] is always accessible, in many simultaneous
                    and alternative sequences, at the flick of a switch”—or, we might now say, at
                    the touch of a button or utterance of a command. “Both internally, in its
                    immediate organization, and as a generally available experience,” “flow”
                    indicates a mobile, primarily <emph>temporal</emph> mode of experience, inflected but not broken or 
                divided by individual activity (95). As one scholar put it, Williams finds in the “flow” of television 
                the theater of capitalism—and an apt image for capitalism’s principle of utter fungibility and 
                exchangeability.<note place="foot" resp="editors">John Hartley, quoted on the back cover of the

             <p>What would happen if we understood Jane Austen within that flow, continuously available “at the flick of 
                 a switch” in multiple, simultaneously streaming manifestations? And what might Austen know of flow? A 
                 concept of flow might be one way of reconsidering the recursive everydayness of a novel like <title 
                     level="m">Emma</title> and its investigation of how choice—even for the privileged heroine—resides 
                 only in “programmed possibilities.” More specifically, such an approach would suggest how and to what 
                 extent <title level="m">Emma</title>’s creation of a fictional everyday—praised by Walter Scott for its 
                 seamless fusion with the reader’s “own social habits” such that “the youthful wanderer may return from 
                 his promenade to the ordinary business of life, without any chance of having his head turned by the 
                 recollection of the scene through which he has been wandering”—might coincide with the ordinary business 
                 and ongoing flow of new media (68). (In addition to several film versions, “Clueless” [1995] adapted 
                 from <title level="m">Emma</title> and translated to Beverly Hills, spawned a TV series, <title 
                     level="a">Clueless</title> [1996–1999] and the video blog, <title level="a">Emma Approved,</title> all 
                 of which are continuously flowing through online media services. “Stream Anytime,” Amazon advises.) In the 
                 space that remains, though, I follow “flow” and the attendant qualities of tempo and silence in another 
                 direction, using the case of Austen’s last novel, <title level="m">Persuasion</title>,
                    and its televised 1996 remediation directed by Roger Michell (later turned into

                        were made in Britain, beginning in 1960. The most recent was in 2007 for ITV1. The 1995 miniseries 
                        was subsequently released as a film in the United States, following the success of Ang Lee and Emma 
                        Thompson’s <title level="m">Sense and Sensibility</title> (1996).</note> In <title 
                            level="m">Persuasion</title>, punctual event, threat, and work itself (domestic and military) 
                 promote competing and sometimes irreconcilable rhythms and temporalities, resolved uncertainly by what 
                 the last page of the novel calls “the tax of quick alarm.” These competing tempos provide part of the 
                 historical and critical force of the novel. But they are absorbed by the televised version and, as 
                 Williams guides us to see, channeled via transnational capitalism into a more harmonious flow.</p>
              <p>It will be obvious to most Austen readers that <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, the one novel of hers 
                   that Williams cites, however sparingly, is also the novel least stabilized by the economies of the park wall 
                   and the landed gentry. <title level="m">Persuasion</title> is Austen’s most aqueous book, set in motion 
                   by the return of naval officers. Sir Walter Elliott must move to leased housing in Bath and rent his family 
                   estate; his renter is Admiral Croft, flush with prize money and newly returned from the Navy in 1814, the 
                   year of the so-called false peace (in this novel Austen <emph>does</emph> work carefully to bring together 
                   the upending events of the Napoleonic Wars with the unsettling social reality of the home front). Social 
                   instability is newly, baldly evident in <title level="m">Persuasion</title> in the figures of the scheming
                   widow Mrs. Clay, the gossiping invalid Mrs. Smith, and the wounded officer, Captain Harville (the
                    mobility of the latter two seriously, physically impeded). A disturbing sense of
                    flux lurks in unelaborated memories of the sailors’ years at sea and in the
                    visit the protagonists make to Lyme Regis, where they walk upsetting promenades
                    at the water’s edge. A pervasive unease makes itself heard, moreover, in the
                    unprecedented bitterness of the narrator’s ironies and “lapses” of tone: a
                    report, for instance, on “the large, fat sighings” of a mother recalling the
                    death of her son, “whom alive nobody had cared for” (68).<note place="foot" resp="editors">D. A. Miller 
                        is an acute reader of these “lapses” in tone. See Miller, <title level="a">Austen’s 
                            Attitude.</title></note> Not only in characters, locations, and tone, but also in felt experiences 
                   that are new to Austen’s fiction, agitation asserts itself. In the various falls, faints, and dizziness that 
                   beset its characters and organize its plot, mobility-as-dislocation signals more than an economic and social 
                   experience, and more than an occasion for moral improvement. They penetrate now somatically and affectively, 
                   revealing “what escapes or seems to escape from the fixed and the explicit and the known”—revealing, that is, 
                   what Williams names a “structure of feeling.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">I gave a reading of these 
                       falls and faintings in <title level="m">War at a Distance</title>. See also Pinch and Wiltshire.</note></p>
            <p>The 1995 television adaptation of the novel contains this sense of liquid <emph>flux</emph> and translates it 
                to <emph>flow</emph> in several ways, not least when it has Anne Elliott and Captain Bewick recite together 
                (by the seaside) these lines from Scott’s <title level="m">Lady of the Lake</title>, canto 3:
                <quote>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Like the dew on the mountain,</l>
                    <l>Like the foam on the river,</l>
                    <l>Like the bubble on the fountain,</l>
                    <l>Thou art gone, and forever! (lines 390–93).</l>
                    </lg>
                </quote>
               Whatever loss the lines might register is pacified by repetition (the flowing sequence of exchangeable similes, 
               the feminine rhyme, the easy concord of the reciters) as well as the excerptability of the lines, their ready 
               portability from one story to another and another. More formally, the TV series opens and closes with scenes shot 
               on water. An extraordinary underwater shot, all blue flow—beautiful in the way Williams identifies the contentless 
               visual mobility of television—is the first thing to appear on screen, the camera then surfacing to the steady, 
               diagetic pulse of oars (with extradiegetic harpsichord) as rowers ferry Admiral Croft to his ship. The abstraction 
               of the initial image and the cadence of the oars together defuse any turbulence an underwater view might portend 
               to the men of the Royal Navy. The film ends, again at sea, with another wordless scene Austen did not imagine: 
               now married to Captain Wentworth, Anne Elliott stands with him on the deck of a ship he commands as sailors go 
               about their daily chores (swabbing the deck, etc.). The camera pulls back to display the man-of-war floating 
               serenely westward, then  silhouetted against a glorious sunset. Like the first underwater shot, the final image 
               surrenders depth to undulation across a two-dimensional surface. A swelling orchestral arrangement gives way to 
               the piano, which closes the film in simple descending chords. The two final shots of the film, the naval vessel 
               moving west and then poised on the horizon, were taken from footage of the film <title level="m">The
                   Bounty</title>, a 1984 remake of <title level="m">The Mutiny on the
                Bounty</title> and the latest of five film versions (Parrill 156). A ready portability from one story to 
                another and another.</p>
            <p>From one image of the British Navy, a mutiny in the South Pacific in 1789, to this peaceably unmappable picture 
                of married contentment (perhaps post-Waterloo: the novel and miniseries are pointedly set in 1814, but we have no 
                idea when Wentworth is sent back to sea with Anne nor if, as in 1815, Britain is again at war), the movement of 
                this footage from film to television is itself made possible by flow—in this case, the flow of capital funding 
                for <title level="m">Persuasion</title>. What began as a BBC project became a global enterprise via partnership 
                with station WGBH in Boston, sponsored in turn by the Mobile Oil Corporation,  backer of WGBH’s popular 
                Masterpiece Theater program, and joined ultimately with Millésime Productions, a French company. (The TV 
                miniseries–turned–feature film was distributed by Sony Classics beginning in 1997). With this boost of funding, 
                the project moved from a chamber piece set primarily indoors to a much more ambitious historical romance, with 
                the ability to film outdoors on location (in Bath and Lyme) and to purchase footage from the American-British-New 
                Zealand product <title level="m">The Bounty</title> (starring the Australian Mel Gibson and Welsh actor Anthony 
                Hopkins). Expanding what might be considered the world of the novel, taking it well beyond the park walls, the 
                scenes at sea also participate materially and thematically in the concept of flow as Williams defines it.</p>
            <p>Such transnational enterprises have marked Austen’s entry into film and television for decades, and effectively 
                made of Jane Austen a brand that circulates the globe. This is not news. But the concept of flow and its 
                soothing rhythms, which so thoroughly inhabit the 1995 television adaptation of <title 
                    level="m">Persuasion</title>, set in relief the less steady motions, the discordant tempos of the novel. 
                If, in closing, we return to the novel not looking at its topography, nor pacified
                    by memory of the flowing films, but with an ear for its own distinctive tempos,
                    we can hear its enduring, unsettled dissonances more sharply.</p>
            <p>On the largest scale we might point to the difference between Anne’s domesticating rhythms and those of the 
                military enterprise that employs Wentworth and his fellow sailors. But such differences can be registered on 
                smaller scales as well. The bouts of dizziness, for instance, that punctuate <title 
                    level="m">Persuasion</title>—like the several falls, evidence of unsteady and erratic movement as well 
                as historical instability—are mostly filtered through a free indirect discourse tied to Anne. Her 
                consciousness is “bombarded,” as A. Walton Litz puts it, leaving her to endure private, interior waves of 
                turbulence (228). That internal rhythm is juxtaposed to an exterior tempo embodied by Wentworth. As John 
                Wilshire has remarked, Captain Wentworth serves as an agent of speed and suddenness: he is described often 
                in motion, moving “in an instant” with a “quicker step,” often threatening Anne’s equilibrium (Wiltshire 171). 
                The two rhythms, of inner turbulence and outer impetuousness, are so starkly opposed that they seem impossible 
                to harmonize—until they do, magically, when Anne and Wentworth finally manage to be alone together. But the 
                deep discord of those competing rhythms rumbles in the last lines of the novel, where the narrator relays that 
                <quote>[h]is profession was all that could ever make her friends
                    wish [Anne’s] tenderness less; the dread of a future war all that could dim her
                    sunshine. She gloried in being a sailor’s wife, but she must pay the tax of
                    quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more
                    distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance. (<title 
                        level="m">Persuasion</title> 252)</quote>
                It’s a foreboding resolution, to say the least, the
                    repeated “all” of the opening sentence hardly sounding settled or promising
                    stability. And who thinks “if possible”: Anne? The narrator? Social consensus?
                    There is no firm ground; point of view—that is, <emph>perspective</emph>—feels impossible 
                to secure. Reading instead for tempo (“all that could
                    make . . . all that could dim”), what strikes me now is the odd phrase, “must
                    pay the tax of quick alarm.” The phrasing is rhythmic and precise, a small
                    shadow neatly tucked under the sunny smile of “she gloried.” In contrast to the
                    preceding sentences, its monosyllables offer something simple, matter-of-fact,
                    and almost proverbial. Yet “quick alarm” worries in part because of its seeming
                    redundancy: the novel has been full of quick alarms, but this phrase raises the
                    possibility of slow alarms we have not registered.</p>
             <p>In these irreconcilable tempos, the novel here and elsewhere works with and against the concept 
                 of flow. “Paying the tax of quick alarm” yokes Anne’s emotional state to the coffers of the state, 
                 which had routinely, and more aggressively in the decades since Napoleon’s rise, proliferated modes of 
                 taxation so as to fund the wars with France (William Pitt introduced, among other funding schemes, the 
                 first individual income tax) (Brewer 110–11). But it is not clear what relation between our heroine’s 
                 emotional life and the state economy is suggested by the phrase. Had the author of <title 
                     level="m">Keywords</title> included “tax” in his vocabulary of society and culture, he would have 
                 noted the slow turn away from the etymological link between “tax” and an obligatory “task” or job, and 
                 toward its current association with money exacted by government authorities. He might have noted as well 
                 the way taxes can coordinate individual activity (e.g., labor) with the demands of a larger sociopolitical 
                 entity through the medium of money. Austen’s language insists on tax as payment. But in what sense must 
                 Anne <emph>pay</emph> taxes? And is paying the tax a consequence of her “profession,” understood less as 
                 work (task) than as a mode of being (<emph>glorying</emph> and exhibiting “domestic virtues”)? Or is paying 
                 tax  a <emph>duty</emph> (another word for tax) evenly distributed across the
                    populace? I wonder whether the tax she must pay is a one-time offering or part
                    of a general pattern, a periodic or indeed continuous demand. “Tax” hints that
                    some species of slow alarm subtends the quick alarms so crisply forecast.</p>
            <p>In any case, the notion of payment proposes to regulate feeling: paying a tax helps to pace Anne’s 
                undifferentiated dread into smaller installments of quick alarm. Paying the tax furthermore recycles 
                alarm—quietly, with no need for Anne to say a word—into the hands of the state, where it can flow out to 
                support future military endeavors. All that could make, all that could dim, all channeled into paying the 
                tax. And yet the resolution proposed here for coordinating Anne’s interior state with the workings of a 
                militarized state can hardly be read as smoothly reassuring. Rather, it exposes and questions the 
                mechanisms by which such resolutions are engineered.</p>
            <p>Written by the sister of naval officers, <title level="m">Persuasion</title> understands paying attention as 
                paying a tax, funneling one’s private, emotional turbulence into the ongoing operations of the British Navy 
                and the empire it will maintain. In <title level="m">Persuasion</title>, a militarized state anticipates the 
                “para-national corporations, with their attendant states and agencies,” that “could further reach into our 
                lives, at every level from news to psycho-drama” (Williams, <title level="m">Television</title> 151). When 
                Williams meditates on “the concept of flow,” and studies how new media like television ask us simply and 
                continually “to watch,” he is updating a Romantic phenomenon that Lily Gurton-Wachter, in her <title 
                    level="m">Watchwords</title>, has illuminated so well—and that Austen fully grasps.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">This paragraph owes a debt to Gurton-Wachter’s important analysis of the culture 
                        of alarm and attentiveness in Romantic-era Britain.</note> The friction she generates in <title 
                            level="m">Persuasion</title> offers proleptic resistance to that flow Williams locates in the 
                theater of capitalism. Watching, she might say, can be taxing.</p>
               <p>It should not surprise us that television cannot admit such taxation. The 1995 television adaptation 
                   of <title level="m">Persuasion</title> eliminates the dread, the tax, and the quick alarm. It
                    does not wrestle to coordinate Anne’s domesticating rhythms with those of the
                    man of war; she enters his world fully and wordlessly. The two stand together on
                    the deck of a battleship, smile at each other, and look out placidly, watching,
                    watching the empty ocean. A ship floats in silhouette on the flowing water.
                    Everything is externalized, and everyone at sea.</p>
