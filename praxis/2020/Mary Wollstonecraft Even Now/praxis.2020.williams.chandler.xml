            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This essay begins by considering the place of the Romantic period in Williams’s
                    various accounts of pivotal historical moments. It goes on, however, to address two
                    interrelated questions about Williams’s changing relation to the category of
                    Romanticism, from his account of the “Romantic Artist” and the “Creative
                    Imagination” around 1960 through his more systematic work on the sociology of
                    literature in the 1970s and after. One question is about how the Romantic period
                    matters to the history of genres that Williams, as a critic who worked across
                    genres, came to elaborate in some detail. He came to believe that the period was
                    important for any account of genres, but not, like other critics, for its
                    prioritization of lyric poetry. The second question is about Williams’s relation to
                    the enterprise of practical criticism at Cambridge, especially his challenge to the
                    project of I. A. Richards, which was of course determined in large part by its focus
                    on reading the lyric. Williams challenged Richards with an emphasis on drama, out of
                    which he developed his notion of the “structure of feeling.” And it was in his
                    somewhat underappreciated book of 1965, <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, that
                    a kind of turning point is reached in Williams’s thinking about Romanticism, which
                    recedes markedly in the later work.</p>

            <p>Raymond Williams was, in most of his writings, a narrative thinker. Examples of this
                tendency can be found all across his extensive oeuvre. One can see it in the very
                titles of two books, respectively, about drama and fiction: <title level="m">Drama:
                    From Ibsen to Eliot</title> (1952) (later revised as <title level="m">Drama from
                        Ibsen to Brecht</title>) and <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to
                    Lawrence</title> (1970). One can see it as well in the organization of two of the
                big books he published around 1960: <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                (1958) and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> (1961). The individual
                chapters in both books may be essayistic in form, but they are also in both cases
                ordered in such a way as to trace a certain arc over time. Williams closes his
                introduction to <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> by noting that it
                completes a body of work that includes not only <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>—for which it is clearly a companion volume—but also his first
                novel, <title level="m">Border Country</title> (1960), which was published in the year
                between them. That a work of fiction could be placed in such close relationship with
                two critical books seems to reinforce a certain sense of narrative overlap among
                them.</p>
            <p>The tendency to rely on narrative as a default mode continues to show up in
                Williams’s important works of the 1970s, though here narrative is complimented by
                something like a stratigraphic tendency, as mapped in <title level="m">Marxism and
                    Literature</title> (1974), with its much-cited schema of residual, dominant, and
                emergent cultural formations. <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> itself,
                though presented as a work of theory, unfolds as its own kind of conceptual
                narrative, with problems and solutions in the history of Marxist literary analysis
                succeeding each other in linked intellectual episodes. The overall organization of
                <title level="m">Keywords</title>, by contrast, is not narrative but explicitly
                and emphatically alphabetical. Nonetheless, in a kind of inversion of the pattern of
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>, the individual entries in <title level="m">Keywords</title> are
                themselves narratively structured, each telling the history of a particular semantic
                transformation. <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, with its announced
                emphasis on location over narrative, space over time, is a partial exception to this
                overall tendency, one to which I recur more than once in what follows.</p>
            <p>It will be clear from these scattered examples that Williams is willing to start and
                stop his literary and cultural narratives at many different historical junctures
                and, more importantly for my purposes here, able to find pivotal moments in many
                times and places. Ibsen’s great plays of the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s certainly
                represent one kind of pivotal moment for Williams, but so does the year 1848, on
                which he focuses in <title level="m">The English Novel from Dickens to
                    Lawrence</title>. In <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1966), Williams
                declares that “since 1917, we have been living in a world of successful social
                revolutions” and that this particular date is “probably decisive in all our
                thinking,” certainly in all our thinking about revolution and tragedy, his twin
                themes in that book (73). Taken as a whole, these narratives have so many pivot
                points, one might say, that the very idea of a pivot seems to lose its force and
                purchase. </p>
             <p>This last point is not lost on Williams himself. Early on in <title level="m">The
                    Country and the City</title>, Williams waxes uncharacteristically playful in a
                little game about how to date the disappearance of “organic community,” the
                supplanting of <foreign xml:lang="de">Gemeinschaft</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="de">
                    Gesellschaft</foreign>. Beginning close to home with
                 <title level="m">Culture and Environment</title> (1932), a book
                coauthored by his teacher at Cambridge F. R. Leavis, Williams notes that for Leavis
                “the change is very recent indeed”
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 9). Yet this view, he goes on,
                was based on the books by one George Sturt, which were published between 1907 and
                1923. And then, as Williams puts it, “what seemed like an escalator began to move,”
                for Sturt located this break as early as the enclosures of 1861
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 9). Thomas Hardy’s novels
                pushed things back to the 1830s. And Richard Jefferies, writing in the 1870s, spoke
                of the decisive change as having occurred in the last half century. But then, with
                William Cobbett, John Clare, George Crabbe, and Oliver Goldsmith, Williams is soon
                pointing to a still earlier break in the mid-eighteenth century. Before long, he
                feels bound to reach all the way back to the pastoral nostalgia of, <foreign 
                    xml:lang="la">inter alia</foreign>, Thomas More’s <title level="m">Utopia</title> and
                 William Langland’s <title level="m">Piers Plowman</title>. It can, Williams shows, be
                a tricky business to pin down such pivotal moments in social and cultural
                narratives, especially when “literature” is the medium of evidence.</p></div>

            <p>It is a commonplace that historians of all kinds, including literary historians, tend
                to think of the period they study as decisive for change over time. And students of
                the Romantic period tend, among all specialists, to make particularly bold claims
                for the age on which they focus. Evidence for these claims is not so hard to find or
                to marshal, and this evidence was not unknown to the writers of that moment.
                Powerful “causes unknown to former times,” wrote Wordsworth in the Preface to <title 
                    level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title>, were radically altering culture and society,
                literature and taste, at the turn of the nineteenth century (Wordsworth 128). In
                addition to the major political revolutions in America and France, we must number
                among these causes the beginning of England’s Industrial Revolution—with its
                “accumulation of men in cities” and new forms of monotonous work (Wordsworth
                128)—which Williams’s himself conveniently dates to roughly the life of William
                Blake (1757–1827). These are familiar facts and no one knows them better than
                Williams himself. No surprise then that, in several of his books at least, the
                decisive historical moment seems to fall around the turn of the nineteenth
                century.</p>
            <p> This happens, for example, in both of the important early books with which I began:
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>. Both books establish their points of departure in late
                eighteenth-century Britain. Both also devote early framing chapters to discussion of
                matters that most scholars of Romanticism have regarded as central to their
                understanding of that subject: “The Romantic Artist” in the case of <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title> and “The Creative Mind” in the case of
                <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. When he focuses on such topics in
                this way, Williams shows himself capable of making claims about the decisive
                importance of the Romantic moment in literary and cultural history that would
                satisfy the field pride of the most aggressive Romanticists now working. Elsewhere,
                however, he is less inclined to do so. For example, in his survey of the social
                origins of British writers over several centuries of literary history, divided into
                50-year segments, no particular pivot point is indicated with either of the Romantic
                generations (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title>). It is not always clear when
                Romanticism matters for him and when it does not.</p>
            <p>In what follows, then, I wish to address a couple of basic questions. What are the
                narrative contexts that lead Williams to cast the Romantic period in a decisive
                historical role? And, in a critical project that evolved as much as Williams’s did
                over time, is it possible to mark some changes in the way Williams accounts for the
                Romantic era and its movements? To put this second question another way, which
                involves an implicit narrative of my own, what happens to Romanticism as Williams’s
                frame of reference shifts from “culture and society” to “Marxism and
                literature”?</p>
                <p> In retrospect, Williams’s early chapters on Romanticism in both <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title> depict
                the Romantic poets and their social-political circumstances in ways that we have
                perhaps come to take for granted but that were anything but commonplace in Romantic
                studies six decades ago. Prominent American work on the Romantic poets in the 1950s
                included Earl Wasserman’s close reading of Keats in <title level="m">The Finer
                    Tone</title> (1953) and Robert Langbaum’s study of the Romantic origins of the
                    dramatic monologue in <title level="m">The Poetry of Experience</title> (1957), both
                    of which appeared before <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. David Ferry’s
                    elegant appreciation of Wordsworth’s major lyrics in <title level="m">The Limits of
                    Mortality</title> (1959) and Harold Bloom’s Buberian interpretation of Shelley in
                    <title level="m">Shelley’s Mythmaking</title> (1959) appeared the
                year after Williams’s book. In England an exemplary work from this period is John
                Jones’s “history of Wordsworth’s imagination” in <title level="m">The Egotistical
                    Sublime</title> (1954). At Cambridge, Williams’s colleague Frank Kermode
                    published <title level="m">Romantic Image</title> (1957), which
                    anticipates <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> in that it offers a
                century-and-a-half narrative history that begins with the figure of “the artist in
                isolation,” but this is about as far as the resemblance goes, for Kermode gives very
                little account of what the artist might be isolated from or against (1). When
                history is invoked in work of the postwar period of Romantic criticism, as it is in
                such major books as Walter Jackson Bate’s <title level="m">From Classic to
                    Romantic</title> (1946), Northrop Frye’s <title level="m">Fearful Symmetry</title>
                    (1947), or M. H. Abrams’s <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title> (1953), it
                tends to be in the mode of the history of ideas (as in Frye’s invocation of Locke),
                or the history of aesthetics (as in Bate’s book), or both (as in Abrams’s).</p>
             <p>It already matters to Williams’s handling of Romanticism in <title level="m">Culture 
                 and Society</title> that “The Romantic Artist” is actually the <emph>second</emph> 
                 chapter in the book (30). Williams begins with the pairing of two 
                 actively political figures—Burke and Cobbett—best known for their
                writings on society more broadly. When Williams turns to the poets in his second
                chapter, his first move is to stress that “the poets from Blake and Wordsworth to
                Shelley and Keats” were among the generations of poets most “deeply interested 
                and . . . involved in study and criticism of the society of their day” (<title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title> 30). This observation leads him to puzzle 
                 over the “popular and general conception” of these same poets as “indifferent to the 
                 crude worldliness and materialism of politics and social affairs” (<title 
                     level="m">Culture and Society</title> 30). For Williams in this book, the figure 
                 of the “Romantic Artist” is something to be seriously queried, if not quite ultimately
                debunked.</p>
            <p>Williams was by no means the first commentator to emphasize the relationship of these
                poets to such political events as the French Revolution. But no one had explored, as
                he was to do in this book and its many sequels, their relation to the Industrial
                Revolution. Moreover, he emphasized that the transformations it effected—though
                “slower, wider, less observable” than those of the political revolution—were part of
                what he could come to call the lived experience of the time:
            <quote>The changes that we receive as record were experienced, in these years, on the
                senses: hunger, suffering, conflict, dislocation; hope, energy, vision, dedication.
                The pattern of change was not background, as we may now be inclined to study it; it
                was, rather, the mould in which general experience was cast.
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 31)</quote>
               If one didn’t know the case to be otherwise, one could almost imagine that the
                cultural moment of the early Industrial Revolution and its manifestations in the
                work of the Romantic poets constituted the inaugural context for Williams’s
                signature notion of a “structure of feeling.”<note place="foot"

                            feeling was first developed by Williams and Orrom in <title

                would go on in this chapter to apply that notion to some of the various challenges 
                to convention that writers made in this period: “changes in convention only occur when 
                there are radical changes in the general structure of feeling”
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 39). Out of such
                “first apprehensions of the essential significance of the Industrial Revolution,”
                Williams’s argues, grew the roots of “the idea of culture” itself: accompanying the
                political, economic, and social changes came “a radical change also in ideas of art,
                of the artist, and of their place in society”
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 31–32). The figure
                of the “Romantic Artist” was one encapsulation of these altered ideas.</p>
             <p>Returning to some of these questions in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>,
                 Williams produces a proto-<title level="m">Keywords</title> sort of history of the
                word “creative” in its various forms, which he says “carries a . . . consistently
                positive reference,” more so than any other word in English (3). As we might expect,
                the pivotal moment for the history of this word comes in the Romantic period. And
                Williams lays out the history of the relationship between ordinary and artistic
                “seeing” in the following schema:

                Williams refers neither to Bate’s <title level="m">From Classic to Romantic</title> nor
                to Abrams’s <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title> in these two books, but
                his account has corrective implications for each. Against Bate’s position, Williams
                argues that Classic and Romantic critical orientations are not so much opposed to
                each other as they are aligned against a third aesthetic: naturalism. Against
                Abrams’s position, Williams suggests that the relationship of imitation—the
                mirror—to creativity is a vexed one. In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>,
                the argument goes like this:
            <quote>The tendency of Romanticism is towards . . . a claim which all good classical theory
                would have recognized: the claim that the artist’s business is to “read the open
                secret of the universe” . . . In fact, the doctrines of “the genius” (the autonomous
                creative artist) and of the “superior reality of art” (penetration to a sphere of
                universal truth) were in Romantic thinking two sides of the same claim.
                (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 39)<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">See also James Naremore’s invocation of Williams’s point 
                    in a parallel discussion of how imitative and expressionist styles of film 
                    acting likewise amount to two sides of the same coin (59–60).</note></quote>
               In <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, Williams wrote that “the long and
                often bitter dialogue between these contrasted positions leads now, not to a taking
                of sides, but to a rejection of the premises which both parties share”—that is, that
                the genius has powers to penetrate to a higher reality
                (<title level="m">Long Revolution</title> 19). What makes both
                corrections possible, even necessary, is Williams’s insistence on seeing the posture
                of the Romantic Artist as deriving, on the part of the writers who assumed it, from
                the felt realities of the Industrial Revolution. In this sense, Romanticism comes to
                be understood as just one way of responding to the transformations unfolding in the
                world’s first industrial nation in the decades straddling the turn of the nineteenth
                century. And <emph>that</emph> recognition in turn enables us to begin to
                answer the first question I posed about what sort of narrative might lead Williams
                to see Romanticism as a kind of pivot point. The answer would seem to be something
                like a history of the poet’s role in society.</p>
             <p>Of course, both <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The
                    Long Revolution</title> build accounts that run over a far longer period than the
                Romantic period, and, from the start, both address many more developments than the
                rubric of “Romanticism” could encompass. They also address a wide variety of genres
                beyond poetry: <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, for example, includes
                prose nonfiction, fiction, drama, and criticism among its objects of study,
                beginning as it does with Burke and Cobbett and ending with Richards and Leavis. As
                Williams’s thinking evolved beyond this pair of early books, indeed, two
                interrelated issues already incipient in them began more and more to occupy his
                attention. One is the broader question of genres, what he calls the “multiplicity of
                writing,” especially what happened to genre discrimination around the turn of the
                nineteenth century, the historical starting point for <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. The other is the
                question of his involvement in the project of practical criticism. I will address
                each of these two questions in turn.</p>

            <head>III</head>
             <p>Late in his career, in <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>, Williams
                revisited the Romantic period in a new key as part of his account of the “complex
                process” in which, over many decades, a system of fairly settled classical
                classification was subjected to a “bourgeois drawing and redrawing of all these
                lines” (147). This remapping of the genres, he argued, took place in keeping with
                tendencies to secularization, rationalization, and ultimately popularization, and
                the upshot of this process was the (for Williams) problematic distinction between
                “literary” and “non-literary” kinds of writing. He is careful to assert, however,
                that this distinction developed by stages. First there was the formation of certain
                disciplinary practices (in history, philosophy, and social and scientific
                description) in which “new kinds of distinction about forms and method of writing
                were radically connected with new kinds of distinction about intention.” Thus in
                certain fields, older values such as “elevation” or “dignity” gave way to new values
                such as practicality, effectiveness, and accuracy
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). For a time—and here
                Williams is probably thinking of, among others, the Scottish school of rhetoric and
                belles lettres associated with Adam Smith and Hugh Blair—the idea of “‘Literature’
                as a body of ‘polite learning’” could still function to unite these increasingly
                diverse intentions (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). But
                then came the real crisis, which Williams dates to the Romantic period.</p>
            <p>“Under pressure,” he writes, “especially in the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth
                centuries, this broke down” (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). It is at this moment in
                the account that Williams produces a new conceptualization, now in the register of
                the sociology of literature, of the Romantic moment described at the start of <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long
                    Revolution</title>: “‘Literature’ became either the conceded or the contemptuous
                alternative—the sphere of imagination or fancy, or of emotional substance and
                effect—or, at the insistence of its practitioners, the relatively removed but again
                ‘higher’ dimension—the creative as distinguished from the rational or the practical”
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147). We can note that the
                figure of the lyric poet as “Romantic Artist” is not privileged in this new
                formulation. On the contrary, when Williams goes on to spell out the implications of
                this shift in the new framework of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title>,
                other genres and forms are emphasized:
            <quote>In this complex interaction it is of course significant that the separated literature
                itself changed, in many of its immediate forms. In the “realist” novel, especially
                in its distinction from “romance,” in the new drama (socially extended, secular and
                contemporary), and in the new special forms of biography and autobiography, many of
                the same secular, rational, or popular impulses changed particular forms of writing
                from the inside, or created new literary forms.
                (<title level="m">Marxism</title> 147)</quote>
             From his late sociological perspective, we might say, Williams came to see that the
                era we call Romantic not only separated “literature” in its subsequent sense from
                other kinds of writing, but also developed further, fractal distinctions of the same
                kind within that category, such as the distinction between “romance” and “realism.”
                To superimpose this new account of the turn of the nineteenth century on the account
                given in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, then, is to see the
                foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet-as-Artist less in portrait scale, with a
                historical landscape visible in the background, and more on the scale of a crowded
                historical painting populated with other moving and changing images.</p>

            <head>IV</head>
            <p>The second issue that occupies Williams’s attention in the years beyond 1960, though
                in truth it is an issue that is with him from the start, is how to grapple with the
                legacy of Cambridge English (especially in the persons of I. A. Richards and F. R.
                Leavis, who are paired in a late chapter of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title>), which had been so formative on his early work and thought. This
                difficult struggle with practical criticism also mattered to his relationship to
                Romanticism, especially to the once-foregrounded figure of the Romantic Poet. Toward
                the end of his career, Williams provided some late reflections on the role of
                practical criticism in his early work that illuminate the evolution of his thinking.
                Looking back from 1977, when he cooperated in a book-length series of interviews for
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> about his long career, Williams was
                especially self-critical about his approach to reading and interpretation in <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title>. In these interviews, he acknowledges
                that his approach to the writings he discusses was too immersive, too much given to
                reproducing the views of the authors he discusses and too little given to
                maintaining critical distance. He blamed this tendency on a habit of reading he had
                acquired at Cambridge under the aegis of “practical criticism.” The fuller story of
                Williams’s long struggle with these two figures is too complicated to rehearse
                here.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Chandler, <title level="a">I. A. 
                    Richards and Raymond Williams.</title></note> But in
                brief one might sum it up in three steps, even if it was not quite so clear-cut in
                the working out.</p>
            <p>The first step is Williams’s determination that Leavis’s version of practical
                criticism was not only a less estimable affair than Richards’s, but also that it
                indeed represented an ideological capture of Richards’s project on two counts: where
                Richards’s practical criticism was grounded in rigorous theory, Leavis insisted on
                practice as opposed to theory, <emph>and</emph> Leavis debased the best
                elements of Richards’s program by substituting excerpts from novels in place of
                integral poetic texts. The second step is that, seeing this much, Williams was able
                to recognize the greatness of Richards’s reformation in criticism—especially its
                debunking of Oxbridge class privilege in the encounter with literature—but also to
                admit its damaging limitations. These limitations called for the third step:
                Williams would have to build a major critical alternative to practical criticism,
                something that he indeed labored at for years and that issued in his great books of
                the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <p>But what does the question of practical criticism have to do with Romanticism? Not
                the least of the problems in Richards’s influential program, as Williams came to
                see, was precisely the focus on the integral lyric poem in its Romantic incarnation,
                which entailed a certain kind of reading practice closely associated with
                Wordsworth, whose experiments with sensibility of the 1790s closely anticipate those
                of Richards in the 1920s (in ways not difficult to demonstrate). It would be an
                exaggeration to say that Williams’s reading of the figure of the Romantic Artist (in
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>) and the concomitant emergence of the
                “creative mind” (in <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>) was in either case
                an unequivocal endorsement. It is not an exaggeration, however, to say that he came
                to see these readings as too invested in a Wordswortian lyric paradigm that mattered
                so much to Richards. The paradigm, for all its initial sense of empowerment and
                liberation from class prejudice, involved a subtle kind of “servility” to the formal
                technique of close reading the lyric poem, what Williams identified as an
                “active-passivity” in Richards’s Wordsworthian recourse to reading poetry as a
                remedy for cultural crisis.</p>
            <p> The corrective to this narrow focus on immersive reading of integral lyrics, as
                Williams explained things in the late 1970s, was to shift the paradigmatic object of
                critical focus from poetry to drama. This was a move readily available to Williams,
                since drama was the field in which he started his academic work and to which he
                often returned in his writings. His dissertation was on Ibsen, and his appointment
                at Cambridge was actually as professor of drama. In addition to the books on drama
                that I have already mentioned, there are the two short books of 1954, <title 
                    level="m">Preface to Drama</title> and <title level="m">Preface to Film</title> 
                (the latter coauthored with Michael Orrom). Since film, in Williams’s handing, is 
                decidedly a particular
                species of dramatic presentation, both books are really about drama. And it is in
                Williams’s contribution to the latter book that he lays out an understanding of
                “drama-in-performance,” which requires attention not just to the literary text, à la
                Richards, but also to the historical conventions of theatrical production. This
                focus in turn leads at this very early date to Williams’s first articulation of the
                concept—“structures of feeling”—on which he would famously ground the evolving
                critical edifice that should supplant that of Richards.</p>
            <p>That edifice would indeed be a long time in the building, but an interesting moment
                in its construction comes with <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> (1967), a book
                that Williams himself thought well of, though it has not enjoyed the same warmth of
                reception as many of his other books. The book is divided between a series of
                reflective essays in part one, “Tragic Ideas,” and a series of critical essays on
                modern tragic works in part two, almost all of them from the twentieth century. It
                seeks overall to reframe the relationship between tragedy and politics, and it does
                so first by critiquing what Williams calls “the ordinary twentieth-century idea” of
                tragedy, or “the structure of tragedy in our own culture” (<title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title> 62), and then by reading specific tragedies from the new
                perspective he opens up. The ordinary twentieth-century idea of tragedy includes
                components that are meant to be recognized as familiar: the separation of tragedy
                from accident, the focus on the destruction of the hero, the principle of
                irreversible or “irreparable” action, and the emphasis on absolute evil. One
                consequence of the hegemony of this ideology of tragedy, for Williams, is the false
                dichotomy Williams precisely seeks to redress: “Having separated earlier tragic
                systems from their actual societies, we can achieve a similar separation in our own
                time, and can take it for granted that modern tragedy can be discussed without
                reference to the deep social crisis, of war and revolution, through which we have
                all been living” (<hi rend="italic">Modern Tragedy</hi> 62).</p>
             <p><title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> offers an account of how this particular
                separation widened over time. And as with some other narratives we have considered,
                the turn of the nineteenth century marks a crucial turn in a larger story.
                Anticipating the account of the multiplicity of writing in <title level="m">Marxism
                    and Literature</title>, the first essay in part two—<title level="a">From Hero 
                        to Victim: The Making of Liberal Tragedy, to Ibsen and Miller</title>—goes 
                 back in time to consider a key transition (<title level="m">Modern 
                     Tragedy</title> 87). This is the transition from what Williams calls “bourgeois 
                 tragedy” in decline—driven underground “by its own contradictions”—to the 
                 reemergence of its distinctive energy in the form of Romantic tragedy
                 (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94). Williams is well
                aware that in making Romantic tragedy the focus of this particular narrative, he is
                not playing to the strengths of the movement. Romantic drama, certainly in Britain,
                is not on the whole a body of achievement to rival Romantic poetry. Yet it plays its
                part in the longer history of tragedy: “What is quite evident, through all the
                failures of Romantic drama, is a renewal and a renewed assertion of individual
                energy” (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94). More to the
                point for Williams, this new energy follows a course that helps to shape the (deeply
                problematic) modern idea of tragedy. Certain key themes of Romantic tragedy—the
                “impossibility of finding a home in the world, the condemnation to a guilty
                wandering, the dissolution of self and others in a desire that is beyond all
                relationships”—are what Williams calls “an important source of nearly all modern
                tragedy,” especially (one might add) tragedy cast in an existentialist register as
                is the case for many of the plays Williams selects in the mid-twentieth century
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94–95).</p>
            <p>How does the renewal of energy in Romantic drama issue in such dark consequences?
                Williams tells the story this way:
            <quote>The desires of man are again intense and imperative; they reach out and test the
                universe itself. Society is identified as convention, and convention as the enemy of
                desire. The individual rebellion is humanist, at a conscious level. Prometheus and
                Faust, characteristically, are its heroes. But the condition of desire,
                unconsciously, is that it is always forbidden. What then happens is that the forms
                of desire become devious and often perverse, and what looks like revolt is more
                properly a desperate defiance of heaven and hell. There is a related preoccupation
                with remorse: deep, pervasive, and beyond all its nominal causes. For in Romantic
                tragedy man is guilty of the ultimate and nameless crime of being himself.
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 94)</quote>
              Williams’s scope of reference in this passage is broadly European. He notes elsewhere
                that “Romanticism” in the sense that he uses it in this book is a European
                phenomenon, and of course <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> as a whole deals
                with a range of tragic production from the ancient Athenians to Ionesco, Beckett,
                Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams. For the decades straddling the turn of the
                nineteenth century, the expanded scope takes us well beyond the canon of Romanticism
                enumerated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>—“from Blake and Wordsworth
                to Shelley and Keats”—to the European-identified Byron and indeed to Schiller and
                Goethe. And the concentration on drama, with its concomitant expansion of horizons,
                seems to shift focus importantly in Williams’s evolving understanding of Romanticism
                as such.</p>
             <p>Indeed, <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> has the advantage of being perhaps
                unique in Williams’s oeuvre for having a section that bears the heading
                “Romanticism.” This section appears in the culminating chapter of part one, “Tragedy
                and Revolution,” a conjunction of ideas, as he called them, that involved him in
                years of study. Within that chapter, this section appears third in a sequence that
                includes first “Liberalism” and then “Naturalism.” The sequence merits some
                attention for the question of how Romanticism comes to be understood by Williams as
                an aspect of a larger set of pivotal and dialectically related ideological
                developments in that historical moment. It is the moment in which, in the wake of
                the French Revolution, “the idea of tragedy can be seen as in different ways a
                response to a culture in conscious change and movement”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 62). The French
                Revolution itself, on Williams’s account, had marked the moment when the medieval
                idea of rebellion was refashioned into the modern idea of revolution. This modern
                idea of revolution, he explains, had its origins in liberalism, which, over time,
                “eroded the conceptions of a permanent human nature and of a static social order
                with connections to a divine order”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). Out of liberalism’s
                “alternative conception of the possibility of human and social transformation,”
                however, comes not only the new notion of revolution, but also an identification of
                the most important human values “not with the received order but with development,
                progress and change”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). For Williams, then,
                liberalism had the effect of putting the idea of revolution and the idea of tragedy
                at odds: “Revolution asserted the possibility of man altering his condition; tragedy
                showed its impossibility. . . . On that opposition, we are still trying to rest”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68).</p>
            <p>Liberalism, so understood by Williams, spawned two tragic modes that offer stark
                choices which are “essentially a matter of attitudes towards revolution”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 68). The first discussed
                is what he calls <emph>Naturalism</emph>, which <emph>seems</emph> a “true 
                child of the liberal enlightenment, in which the traditional
                ideas of fate, an absolute order, a design beyond human powers, were replaced by a
                confidence in reason and in the possibility of a continually expanding capacity for
                explanation and control”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 69). But this child of
                enlightenment, declares Williams, “finally, is a bastard”:
            <quote>What became naturalism, and what distinguished it from the more important movement of
                realism, was a mechanical description of men as the creatures of their environment,
                which literature recorded as if man and thing were of the same nature. The tragedy
                of naturalism is the tragedy of passive suffering, and the suffering is passive
                because man can only endure and never really change his world. . . . This naturalism
                . . . began in liberalism but ends, ironically, as a grotesque version of the system
                originally challenged by liberalism . . .
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 69)</quote>
               Naturalism and its debased form of tragedy are ultimately associated with the rapidly
                developing theories of political economy and “the theory of administered reform,”
                society in this view amounting to nothing more than “an impersonal process, a
                machine with certain built-in properties” (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>
                70). The naturalist response to liberalism gives us the “mystification” of what
                Williams calls “mechanical materialism” and more specifically “utilitarianism”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71).</p>
            <p>Romanticism is the name that Williams gives to the <emph>second</emph> of
                the two movements that “sought to express the values of liberalism”
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71). If utilitarianism,
                “the most common English form of mechanical materialism, had sought liberal values
                in the reform of civil society,” Romanticism took a seemingly opposite tack, seeking
                “values in the development of the individual,” though this led to a similarly ironic
                impasse.</p>
            <p>In its early stages, Romanticism was profoundly liberating, but, partly because of
                the inadequacy of any corresponding social theory, and partly because of the
                consequent decline from individualism and subjectivism, it ended by denying its own
                deepest impulses, and even reversing them. Almost all our revolutionary language in
                fact comes from the Romantics, and this has been a real hindrance as well as an
                incidental embarrassment. Romanticism is the most important expression in modern
                literature of the first impulse of revolution: a new and absolute image of man.
                Characteristically, it relates this transcendence to an ideal world and an ideal
                human society; it is in Romantic literature that man is first seen as making
                himself. (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71)</p>
            <p>How, exactly, does the promise of Romanticism go so wrong as to deny, even to
                reverse, its own deepest impulses? As Williams says, it has partly to do with the
                inadequacy of any existing social theory in that moment. Liberal political economy
                certainly would not do. Marx famously wrote than human beings make their own history
                but not under conditions of their own choosing. Likewise, when the Romantic project
                of man making himself is “particularised, to social criticism and construction, it
                encounters fundamental obstacles.” The turn is to utopia:
            <quote>It is easier to visualise the ideal in an exotic or fabled community (or an
                historical community transformed by those elements). The existing social world is
                seen as so hostile to what is most deeply human that even what begins as social
                criticism tends to pass into nihilism.
                (<title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> 71)</quote>
              Thus, in the space of a page in <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, does the
                promise of the so-called Romantic movement, now understood in its relation to
                revolution and tragedy, pass from everything to nothing.</p>

             <p>What distinguishes Williams’s treatment of Romanticism in <title level="m">Modern
                    Tragedy</title>, then, is his aggressive formulation of its tendencies within the
                systematic unfolding of a dialectical account in which liberalism opposes the feudal
                order, clearing the way for the modern idea of revolution, but then finds its
                contradictions played out in two apparently rival modes of representation that are
                actually mutually complementary. The dialectical contradictions within each of these
                modes is in turn examined so that each turns against its own most promising drives
                and aspirations. Over the course of <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>, Williams
                ultimately works out, first in theory and then in applied critical practice, how an
                enriched understanding of the relationship between tragedy and revolution can point
                a way forward. In the end, the paradoxical optimism of this book about tragedy is
                perhaps best understood in relation to its distinctive moment in the mid-1960s, a time 
                when Williams was active in movements that provide a flash of hope that, for a time,
                brightened Britain’s social and political prospects.</p>
            <p>The point I wish to emphasize here is that Williams represents Romanticism in his
                study of the history of a dramatic form in a way that feels far less immersive than
                the accounts offered only a few years earlier in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>. Both books work in
                an essayistic mode, but there is a systematicity to the unfolding arguments of <title 
                    level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> that is far more pronounced than anything in
                those earlier books. <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title> indeed anticipates the
                marked systematicity of <title level="m">Marxism and Literature</title> about a decade
                later. Yet as I have noted, the systematic language in that late book is mainly
                aimed at constructing the critical edifice with which Williams sought to supplant
                the powerful program of Richards. It offers an account of British culture and
                society only incidentally, along the way, with next to nothing about “Romanticism”
                as such. It is thus telling that, in the comments we considered earlier about what
                happens to the “multiplicity of literature” in the “late-eighteenth and early
                nineteenth centuries,” Romanticism never quite gets to hear the sound of its own
                name—though “romance” as a sub-genre does, along with references to the creative
                imagination and other Romantic topics. Likewise, when Williams turned back to
                English literary history and criticism in <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title>, Romanticism as such plays very little role, a point that gains added
                force when one considers how many pages are devoted, say, to Wordsworth. A quick
                search of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> will show that “romantic”
                is nearly always used there in its lowercase form, an everyday descriptor rather
                than a term associated with a particular literary and intellectual movement around
                the turn of the nineteenth century: “romantic love,” “romantic compliment,”
                “romantic lovers,” “romantic wastes,” “romantic strain,” “romantic attachment,”
                “romantic atmosphere,” “romantic destiny” (to name just a few)
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 23, 25, 63, 69, 71, 203, 227, 251).</p>
            <p>It would be wrong to conclude that Williams somehow came to forget about the
                “Romantic movement” in his late work. He even refers to it once in passing, when, in
                making a point about eighteenth-century enclosures, he explains that it “connects
                with that structure of feeling which was beginning to form, from Goldsmith to the
                poets of the Romantic movement, and which is particularly visible in Clare: the loss
                of the ‘old country’” (<title level="m">Country</title> 137). Yet
                this way of gesturing casually to the shared cultural figures and formations of the
                two generations of poets “from Blake and Wordsworth to Shelley and Keats,” as he
                identifies them in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, already marks quite a
                change, if only because names are named only for the period-bracketing figures of
                Goldsmith and Clare.</p>
            <p>Nor should we conclude that the decades around the turn of the nineteenth century in
                Britain ceased to be pivotal for Williams: when he traces the history of the most
                important terms in <title level="m">Keywords</title>, many of the transformations he
                calls decisive (a favorite word of his own) tend to occur in the passage from the
                eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The point is rather that the figures and topoi
                of Romanticism as such, once the starting point in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> and <title level="m">The Long Revolution</title>, and indeed the
                guidelines for Richards’s immersive practical criticism embraced by Williams in his
                early years, had become systematized as far as they could be in the dialectics of
                <title level="m">Modern Tragedy</title>. After that, Romanticism as such held
                diminished interest for his late work on literature, media, and society.</p>
