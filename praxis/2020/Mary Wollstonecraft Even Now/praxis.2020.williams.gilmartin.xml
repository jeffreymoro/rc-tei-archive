                    writers on two sides of the park wall, and argue that the Past Masters volume on
                    Cobbett deserves to be more fully appreciated as a significant late work, both in
                    terms of its historical method and its sense of the significance of the Romantic
                    period, which is strikingly aligned with Williams’s own contingent historical

            <p>In writing a doctoral thesis in English in the late 1980s on the
                radical journalism of William Cobbett, William Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt, I was
                assisted by remarkably supportive dissertation committee, and by the way the New
                Historicism directed attention to literary expression as material practice and to
                texts that were once regarded as nonliterary. At the same time, I was persistently
                reminded of resistance within Romantic studies, particularly in North America, to
                the literary study of nonfiction prose that had little to do with poetry and
                fiction, and that first appeared in ephemeral newspapers and magazines. In
                retrospect, a proposed but never written chapter on Percy Shelley became a
                placeholder for a more direct engagement with the Romantic canon, in a dissertation
                that wound up instead arguing for the richness and complexity of radical expression
                on its own terms. While Hazlitt and Hunt had acquired ancillary status through their
                critical and personal relationships with the major Romantic poets, Cobbett was the
                real outlier and a source of difficulty as the dissertation project developed. To be
                sure, there were developments within Romantic studies that encouraged attention to
                Cobbett and the radical press, notably Marilyn Butler’s <title level="m">Romantics,
                    Rebels, and Reactionaries</title> (1982) and Jon Klancher’s <title level="m">The
                    Making of English Reading Audiences</title> (1987). But through the earliest
                conceptions of the project, my interest in regarding Cobbett as a matter of 
                <emph>literary</emph> history was shaped by the work of Raymond Williams.
                Where Romantic studies typically restricted Cobbett to footnotes, as a source of
                inert historical fact or distorted polemic, <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> offers a very different critical account of Cobbett, in the company
                of other major literary figures. In a revealing opening contrast with Edmund Burke,
                followed by a related pairing of Robert Southey with Robert Owen, Williams situates
                Cobbett at the head of a strand of cultural discourse that emerges in response to
                the economic, social, and political changes that shaped modern Britain. Given the
                limited attention Romanticists then paid to nonfiction prose, the treatment of
                Burke, Cobbett, Southey, and Owen within a tradition that ran forward through
                Carlyle, Newman, Arnold, Ruskin, and Morris was remarkable in itself.</p>
             <p>In a casual remark on Orwell in the <title level="m">Politics
                    and Letters</title> interview collection, Williams identifies Cobbett as “a case I
                often return to” (387). And return he did, across a range of topics—politics,
                economics, agriculture, education, communication—in nearly all his major historical
                studies and essay collections, beginning with <title level="m">Culture in
                    Society</title> (1958), and continuing through <title level="m">The Long
                        Revolution</title> (1961), <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> (1973),
                 <title level="m">Keywords</title> (1976), <title level="m">Problems in
                     Materialism and Culture</title> (1980), <title level="m">Writing in Society</title>
                 (1983), and <title level="m">Resources of Hope</title> (1989). Yet the occasional note
                struck by the sense of a case to which one returns does not capture the way in which
                Cobbett came increasingly to serve as a key figure—arguably <emph>the</emph> key 
                figure—connecting Williams and his readers back to the vexed early
                phase of a long revolution in politics, economics, and communication that shaped
                British cultural modernity. Williams’s abiding concern for rural life and
                agricultural experience heightened the affinity, as did a sense of late
                twentieth-century postwar crisis that echoed back through the experience of the
                aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. Over the course of his life, the account of
                Cobbett developed in ways that register a growing appreciation for a body of writing
                that is at once personal and communal, descriptive and imaginative. This line of
                response culminated in the 1983 Past Masters volume, <title level="m">Cobbett</title>,
                where what could have been a brief primer on the career of an early
                nineteenth-century journalist becomes instead a more expansive meditation on
                essential problems of historical method and contemporary argument, evident in
                Williams’s searching reflections on what it means to attend closely to a voice from
                the past and to witness change across two centuries.</p>
            <p>My aim in tracking this critical engagement with Cobbett is in
                part to provide a sense of development, but also to demonstrate just how fully
                Cobbett figured in some of Williams’s most significant contributions to literary and
                cultural studies. Notable here is his rethinking of the literary and the aesthetic
                in ways that reconfigure the canon of course, but also open up new ways of thinking
                about transmission and continuity in literary history, in part by considering
                writing as a material practice that shapes even as it is shaped by social and
                economic change. As an agrarian countryman who advocated subsistence farming even as
                he wrote to support himself, Cobbett was distinctively positioned to reveal some of
                the contradictions at work in early industrial society. At issue here are ways of
                thinking historically about class, and these will be particularly evident in
                Williams’s paired treatment of Cobbett and Austen in <title level="m">The Country
                    and the City</title>. But while that discussion has often been noticed because it
                seems to diminish Austen and restrict her social vision, for Williams it is part of
                a larger attempt to come to terms with elements of early nineteenth-century society
                that can challenge some of his own Marxist and socialist conceptions of historical
                change. And it is finally the willingness to rethink his own historical position and
                expectations with Cobbett, through the pivotal transitions of early
                nineteenth-century industrial society, that shapes the Past Masters volume, whose
                final phases are as provocative and experimental as anything in Williams’s critical
                prose, particularly as the writer searches for new ways of thinking historically
                about the literature of the past with respect to the present.</p>

            <head>Literary Tradition and Industrial Transformation</head>
            <p>We can begin as so often for Williams with language. In
                assessing the difficulty of “history” as a critical and interpretive term, David
                Simpson has suggested that <title level="m">Keywords</title> offers less a definition
                than a “compromise,” in which “the urgency of history” lies not in wholeness or
                totality but rather in “its immediate applicability to a range of options for
                reading the past and projecting the future” (9). He cites a sentence from the close
                of the <title level="m">Keywords</title> entry on “history,” after Williams explores
                the way that “organized knowledge of the past” came from the eighteenth century to
                acquire a more general association with “human self-development” through “continuous
                and connected process,” so that “history” potentially lost its “exclusive
                association with the past” and became “connected not only to the present but also to
                the future.” Noting that “it is . . . not easy to say which sense of <emph>history</emph> 
                is currently dominant,” Williams closes by
                contrasting the specificity of such variants as “historian” and “historical” with
                the wider scope of the root term: “History itself retains its whole range, and
                still, in different hands, <emph>teaches</emph> or <emph>shows</emph> us most 
                kinds of knowable past and almost every kind of imaginable
                future” (146–48). One aim of this essay is to demonstrate that this sense of
                instruction and demonstration is increasingly evident in Williams’s writing about
                Cobbett as he comes to wrestle with problems of perception and voice across time, so
                as to bring a knowable past to bear upon an uncertain but imaginable future. An
                astute and materially engaged observer, an engaging communicator, and a forceful
                critic of economic dispossession through the critical early phase of industrial
                capitalism, the figure of Cobbett as fully developed in the Past Masters volume is
                also a profoundly important <emph>historical</emph> figure in Williams’s
                fullest sense, a guide to the past whose expectations about a future that is now
                past can also shape our own future expectations and projections.</p>
             <p>Given Cobbett’s presence in <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> as part of a preliminary set of contrasts, it is not surprising
                that the discussion there is schematic, unfolding through a sequence of extracts
                with minimal commentary. In a retrospective introduction, Williams observes that the
                writers treated in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> had not “been seen as
                connected in this way” before, and in some sense the case for Cobbett develops over
                the course of the book as he becomes a “touchstone,” and his perspective returns in
                discussions of Coleridge, Mill, Carlyle, Dickens, Disraeli, Eliot, Morris, Lawrence,
                and Leavis (x, 105).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The term “touchstone” appears 
                    in a discussion of George Eliot, and for Cobbett with respect to other 
                    writers mentioned here see <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 56, 58, 
                    78, 96, 99, 150.</note> That said, the initial discussion does involve some
                strikingly dismissive observations, notably that Cobbett “had nothing of Burke’s
                depth of mind” and that his “relative indifference to ideas” meant that he was
                “often simply a Philistine” (12–13, 18). While this was not revoked in Williams’s
                later work, the tone shifts considerably, to the point where Simpson convincingly
                charges Williams with having “failed to hear the uglier voices in Cobbett” (12)—the
                sensationalism, the personal invective, the racism, the misogyny, the
                    anti-Semitism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This critique connects with 
                        Edward Said’s critique of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> for 
                        its “failure to deal with the imperial experience at all” (65). Cornel West 
                        suggests that while “Williams provides indispensable analytical tools and historical
                            sensibilities for reflections on empire, race, color, gender and sexual
                            orientation, the relative silences in his work on these issues bear the
                            stamp of his own intellectual and existential formation” (8).</note> In 
                    exploring Williams’s writing on Cobbett, it is worth
                acknowledging Simpson’s point at the outset: there is a consistent filtering out of
                what W. D. Rubinstein has termed “the dark side” of British radical populism (339).
                In <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, the sense of Cobbett as a writer
                impervious to ideas aligns what is valuable about his prose with impression and
                feeling rather than thought, with a “sureness of instinct” evident above all in his
                rural and agricultural writing. The perspective of the “countryman” enabled a
                critical response to industrialization, as Cobbett witnessed the development of a
                “new class system” that sharply divided laborer and landowner, rich and poor (14).
                In revising earlier individualist conceptions of property through an insistence that
                the working poor possessed a property in their labor, Cobbett extended property
                rights to “a whole new class” (17) and provided a radically new framework for class
                conflict and collective action that fundamentally disrupted the existing order.</p>
            <p>Beyond these and other convictions that Williams tracks
                primarily through the <title level="m">Political Register</title>, it is worth
                identifying two features of the treatment of Cobbett in <title level="m">Culture
                    and Society</title> that he develops more fully in his later work. First is a
                matter of historical method that at this point runs primarily from present to past
                in the form of a potential misrecognition that tests our retrospective assumptions:
                “The terms of Cobbett’s social criticism so much resemble later and more organized
                critiques that it is easy to forget the basis of experience from which he worked,
                and the values by which he judged” (14). While a claim for the distinctiveness of
                Cobbett’s experience is clear enough, Williams does not attempt to account for the
                remarkable resemblance to later social criticism, nor does he say much about the
                value (or the limitations) of a relatively unformed and disorganized early
                nineteenth-century perspective. Again, much rests here on assigning Cobbett’s own
                critical responses to instinct and experience rather than intellect or coherent
                analysis, and this indicates a second strand of <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> that extends through Williams’s later writing, the tendency to
                value Cobbett’s instinct and experience rather than his intellect. While Williams
                does insist that “the sureness of instinct was no accident—it was rather, vital and
                impregnable, a genuine embodiment of value,” the contrast with Burke is in this
                respect clearly diminishing (13). Where this gets mitigated is through a
                countervailing insistence that Burke’s value also lies in feeling and experience.
                What we learn from the author of the <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution
                    in France</title> (1790), notably through his insistence on social complexity and
                historical community, has less to do “with his position than his manner of
                thinking,” a manner that Williams suggests is not even “thinking” in the usual sense
                but rather “a special immediacy of experience, which works itself out, in depth, to
                a particularly embodiment of ideas” (<title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                4–5). In this way the contrast between instinct and intellect softens, and Burke
                meets Cobbett on the common ground of personal experience and expression: “Burke’s
                writing is an articulated experience, and as such it has a validity which can
                survive even the demolition of its general conclusions. . . . It is, finally, a
                personal experience become landmark” (5).</p>
            <p>With Crabbe, Hardy, Lawrence, and Wordsworth, Cobbett is among
                the most frequently cited writers in <title level="m">The Country and the
                City</title>, and his role in the unfolding argument of the book is more fluid and less
                narrowly defined than in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>. The value of
                Cobbett’s experience as a “countryman” and a farmer is amplified as Williams infuses
                the book with the perspective of his own Welsh village upbringing. While there are
                continuities of principle and method from <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>
                to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, it is clear that Williams’s
                thinking has shifted in ways that shape the treatment of Cobbett. Among other
                things, what came between the two books were developments in the British New Left,
                notably Williams’s role in the 1967 <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>, which
                expressed disenchantment with the rightward movement of the British Labour 
                Party.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Williams
                    and the <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>, see Chun
                    86–87.</note> A line of argument that Williams developed in <title level="a">The
                British Left,</title> a 1965 <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article reprinted in
                the volume <title level="m">Resources of Hope</title> (1989), is particularly
                instructive. Here, an assessment of “the state of the Left in Britain” begins with
                an assessment of the Labour Party. The integrity of the party as “a mass party and a
                permanently potential government, based primarily on the most organized sections of
                the working class,” can help account for its strengths and weaknesses, notably its
                limited effectiveness as an “instrument of socialist change.” But Williams insists
                on looking beyond the framework of a parliamentary party (as he did in the <title 
                    level="m">May Day Manifesto</title>), and beyond the 1960s, to “the complicated
                intellectual and structural traditions of other kinds of social criticism and
                opposition,” in particular, “the origins of the British working-class movement, in
                the years 1790–1835” (<title level="m">Resources</title> 133). While he and E. P.
                Thompson disagreed within the <title level="m">May Day Manifesto</title> on the role
                of the Labour Party in bringing about social change through parliamentary politics,
                with Williams no longer expecting Labour to advance socialism (Chun 86), in the 1965
                <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article on the British left Williams
                invokes in his own support of <title level="m">The Making of the English Working
                    Class</title>, which appeared just two years earlier and manifestly shapes the
                ensuing discussion.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title level="j">NLR</title> 
                    interviews collected in <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>, Williams
                            asserts that he and Thompson were “not in contact with each other” about
                            their work in these years. He acknowledges that “if I had read <title 
                                level="m">The Making of the English Working Class</title> when I
                                was writing <title level="m">Culture in Society</title>, it would have
                            been a very different book,” and specifically indicates a desire to have
                            written about “the extraordinary transposition of varieties of
                            radicalism that occurred between 1790 and 1840—which I never mentioned
                            in the book” (108). Given Cobbett’s prominent role in <title 
                                level="m">Making</title>, the “very different book” Williams posits 
                    would likely have involved a very different figure of William
                    Cobbett.</note> Taken in conjunction with subsequent developments, the
                early decades of British working-class radicalism (where Cobbett is an anticipatory
                figure) help account for tensions in the relationship between trade union
                organization and radical political initiative, and for strengths and weaknesses in
                “the inherited system of ideas” that shape the British left (<title 
                    level="m">Resources</title> 135). While an enduring commitment to trade union 
                solidarity may blunt social and political ambition, according to Williams it also sustains a
                characteristic “inward-turning loyalty” that fosters working-class resilience
                through periods of economic adversity and political defeat.</p>
             <p>In the <title level="j">New Left Review</title> article Williams
                proceeds to trace this resilience to union organization but also to “certain
                pre-political values” (we might consider Cobbett’s instincts) and a “self-generating
                tradition” that has found expression in “the moral critique of industrial
                capitalism,” and that “has been paralleled throughout by a literary tradition of
                comparable importance” (<title level="m">Resources</title> 136). The figures in this
                 tradition are familiar from <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, yet here
                Williams more fully asserts a distinctively working-class commitment to the life of
                the imagination and human fulfillment despite the corrosive effects of industrial
                capitalism. The alignment of “moral critique” with “literary tradition” tells us
                much about how Williams worked to introduce Cobbett to the literary canon and even,
                as we will see, to Romanticism’s visionary company. Cobbett’s profile rises further
                as Williams looks past the Labour Party and past his own present crisis to identify
                forces that have shaped radical social change. While he acknowledges the
                contribution of religious nonconformity to working-class values, Williams turns to
                literary tradition for an ethos that is more emancipatory and less restrictive than
                puritan tradition:
            <quote>There has been an important tradition of ideas and feelings which is not puritan, and
                which in my view lies just as deeply in the moral consciousness. The claims of
                Cobbett, Ruskin, William Morris—to name three of the most influential writers—were
                no more puritan than the novels of Dickens. What is asserted in this tradition is
                the claim to life, against the distortion of humanity by the priorities and
                disciplines of industrial capitalism. . . . If we actually look at British
                working-class life, rather than at the stereotypes provided for political analysis
                and export, we find this, again pre-political, emphasis breaking out again and
                again. It is often anarchic, in its immediate forms, but in its insistence on
                satisfaction and excitement it is a moral challenge of no less weight than that of
                puritanism. (<title level="m">Resources</title> 136–37)</quote>
               Along with the decisive identification of Cobbett with <emph>literary</emph> 
                 tradition,<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Keywords</title> Williams both
                            traced and interrogated “the attempted and often successful
                            specialization of <hi rend="bold">literature</hi> to certain kinds of
                            writing,” and particularly “within the basic assumptions of Romanticism”
                            to “<emph>imaginative writing</emph>” (185–86). His own work
                            is what he identifies as a challenge to the narrowing sense of
                            literature “by concepts of <emph>writing</emph> and 
                     <emph>communication</emph> which seek to recover the most
                            active and general senses which the extreme specialization had seemed to
                            include” (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 187). At the same time, his
                            practice retained “literature” and the “literary” in broad senses, and
                            in the <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> interview on <title 
                                level="m">The Country and the City</title>, the interviewer
                            identifies a range of conceptions of literature, from a “record of human
                            experience” and “a response” to “a dramatization of values” (303).</note> there 
                 is a shift here from the “instinct” of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> 
                 to the richer possibilities of a “moral
                consciousness,” where the “moral critique” meets “literary tradition.” As a result,
                the author of <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> (1830) takes on some of the
                visionary proportions that Romantic studies has typically associated with Blake and
                Shelley, though at this point Williams still looks ahead—itself a tribute to
                Cobbett, who becomes the sole forebear of a distinguished nineteenth- and early
                twentieth-century tradition. Assessing this tradition, he writes: “Cobbett, Dickens,
                Ruskin, Morris, Lawrence: all these in their lifetimes fought utilitarianism, and
                all except Ruskin fought the kind of moral paternalism which was the other main line
                of reform. What they claimed, positively, was man’s absolute priority as a creative
                and independent being. From this creativity and independence came cooperation and a
                good society” (<title level="m">Resources</title> 137). To be sure, there may be a
                return by way of a more structural Williams to the early sense of “instinct” in the
                claim that the “important tradition of ideas and feelings which is not puritan” and
                which ran through literature and through “British working-class life” was
                “pre-political.” What does it mean to identify “values” (136) or a “level” (137) as
                “pre-political,” within an essay that involves a concerted and intensively situated
                argument about political action and organization? And yet the account here of a
                resilient and persistently anarchic working-class tradition, allowing for its
                imprecision, does register the emergence in Williams’s work of a more positive way
                of thinking about the relatively disorganized critique of capitalism associated with
                Cobbett and others in the decades before a fully developed socialism. If the early
                Williams challenged Cobbett’s reliance on instinct, the later Williams was
                challenged by the insight Cobbett offered into a pre-socialist challenge to
                industrial capitalism that was no more fully developed than the economic system it
                confronted.</p>
             <p>This is reinforced in a <title level="j">New Left Review</title> interview on <title 
                    level="m">Culture and Society</title>, conducted in 1977 and published in the
                    <title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> collection, where Williams compares
                the English tradition surveyed in the book with continental sociology and asserts
                that “the very rapid and brutal experience of industrialization” in England
                triggered a particularly critical response, again in the years from 1790 through the
                1830s. “The thinking about the process of industrial transformation that was done in
                the period between Blake and Wordsworth and Southey and the young Carlyle, although
                it is very early and confused, still seems to me absolutely crucial. Some of the
                questions then asked, more persistently by Cobbett than by anyone else, about the
                whole nature of the industrial project and the consequences for social relations,
                still have to be answered today” (115).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Blackburn 
                    for the observation that “the generosity of Williams’s approach to pre-socialist, 
                    or even anti-socialist, traditions was disconcerting to critics on the Left”
                            (14).</note> The positive emphasis on Cobbett as against his
                 more canonical contemporaries is a striking shift from the tone of <title 
                     level="m">Culture and Society</title>, and the insistence that the questions posed 
                 in the early years of industrialization—however “confused” they may now seem—have “still
                have to be answered today” registers a challenge from the past to the present that
                Williams continued to explore through his later career. In a sense the imperfect
                formation of Cobbett’s social and economic critique accounts for its compelling
                present relevance, as any radical movement must acknowledge an imperfect
                understanding of the future it wants to shape.</p>
            <p>In historicizing misapprehensions within the New Left, Williams finds himself looking
                back with more respect to an earlier era of writers who were similarly coming to
                terms with a crisis of uncertain outcome, in ways that belie the more assured
                critical and historical perspective of <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>.
                As evidence of the way history can challenge socialist theory, he observes that “the
                characteristic rhetoric” of Marxism in the 1930s would have anticipated the failure
                of capitalism and the triumph of Soviet productivity, whereas the postwar period
                instead ushered in “the new kind of productive explosion that capitalism had in
                store.” Unanticipated historical experience motivates the sympathetic return to an
                early and essentially presocialist struggle to contest industrial capitalism.
                Williams writes, “It was then that the questions posed by Blake or Cobbett acquired
                their force for me” (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 115). The acutely
                disorienting postwar experience, and the attendant return for critical understanding
                to an earlier era, frames the transition from <title level="m">Culture and
                    Society</title> to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>. Williams leaves
                no doubt that the questions posed by Romantic period writers, and “more persistently
                by Cobbett than by anyone else,” were at the front of his mind in the early 1970s:
                “<title level="m">The Country and the City</title> was written very much in
                response to them” (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title> 115). In this sense,
                the fragmented and unsystematic critique associated with an early phase of
                industrialization becomes less a liability to be overcome through corrective
                historical analysis than an opportunity for salutary self-recognition across two
                centuries of profound social and economic change. No wonder then that Cobbett’s
                instinct, far from being insufficiently thought through, becomes an imaginatively
                vital and anarchic insistence on the whole range of individual and collective human
                experience.</p>

                            framed in terms of “knowable community,” and where Austen’s limited
                            social range is brought out through a comparison with George Eliot
                            (14–18, 24–26).</note> White becomes a two-page coda at the end
                of the chapter, and while he does importantly register the emergence of “a natural
                order” that “could now be separated from man,” for my purposes the central contrast
                is between Cobbett and Austen (119). Following on a historical treatment of
                enclosure and property rights, Williams develops the chapter in terms of the
                response to historical change. With “the economic system of landlord, tenant and
                labourer” now “in explicit and assertive control,” rural communities were forced to
                adapt in order to survive (107). What Simpson has termed Williams’s “appetite for
                immediacy” is fully evident (22), as Cobbett appears in the familiar guise of close
                observer and careful recorder—though now without Burke casting the invidious shadow
                of intellectual deprivation, and with Austen and White as fellow observers. The
                questioning presence of Cobbett in the <title level="j">New Left Review</title>
                interview is also pertinent, as interrogation supplements observation and
                description: “What Cobbett gives us is detailed social observation, from the point
                of view of the condition of the majority of men. He combined Arthur Young’s
                attention to the detailed practice of a working agriculture with a more persistent
                social questioning and observation” (<title level="m">Politics and Letters</title>
                109).</p>
            <p>While Cobbett’s willingness to identify with the condition of the laborer offers a
                fundamental shift in perspective, it is his capacity for observation—to have “looked
                very carefully” (110) and registered a “visible disturbance” (111)—that occasions
                Williams’s most developed account yet of the role of the rural rider in a 
                <emph>literary</emph> tradition that typically involves imaginative
                writing. Where the eighteenth-century poetry of Goldsmith and Crabbe provided moral
                caution of a kind that Williams explores in previous chapters of <title 
                    level="m">The Country and the City</title>, the more fully developed capitalism of 
                the early nineteenth century demanded organized action and resistance, of a kind that prior
                literary conventions could not provide. Under these conditions, Cobbett becomes “the
                outrider” of “a new kind of country writing” that sustains description and
                reflection while accounting for “action,” in both its own communicative effects and
                what it witnessed among the working poor. Cobbett “described and campaigned”, and in
                doing so set the terms for developments in prose fiction that made social realism a
                prevailing form of the mid-nineteenth century novel (<title level="m">Country</title>
                112). The line of development from Goldsmith to Cobbett to Dickens can seem
                counterintuitive, running as it does from country to city, and from poetry through
                nonfiction prose to the novel, but Williams insists upon tracing this line in order
                to register in literary history what he often noted in economic history: that
                capitalism transformed the English countryside through the reorganization of
                agricultural production well in advance of urban industrialization.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">See, for example, <title level="m">Cobbett</title> 68–69.</note> No
                surprise then that Cobbett the radical journalist would be in a position to pick up
                on observations about rural social change indicated earlier in poetry as a matter of
                meditation, and then transmit his own activist disposition ahead to a socially
                committed fiction. It is through the paired treatment of Austen and Cobbett that we
                can appreciate Williams’s own effort to think historically about class as he worked
                back through the early phases of industrial society.</p>
            <p>Williams’s ironic recasting of the famous opening sentence of <title level="m">Pride 
                and Prejudice</title> as part of the initial development of his account of
                Austen is among the chapter’s more frequently noticed gestures:
            <quote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that Jane Austen chose to ignore the decisive
                historical events of her time. Where, it is still asked, are the Napoleonic wars:
                the real current of history? But history has many currents, and the social history
                of the landed families, at that time in England, was among the most important. As we
                sense its real processes, we find that they are quite central and structural in
                Austen’s novels. (<title level="m">Country</title> 113)</quote>
               Readers of Austen can be protective of their author, so it is not surprising that the
               discussion in <title level="m">The Country and the City</title> has raised objections
                and spirited critical response. Yet given that the whole point of this passage is to
                show that Austen was in fact engaged in the “the real current of history,” once we
                acknowledge social as well as political and military history, it is surprising that
                Williams has been taken to task here for “a classic statement of the view that Jane
                Austen the novelist repudiates any serious concern with larger social and political
                events” (Crary 145). Fortunately, Devoney Looser’s observation that Williams is
                writing “facetiously” and that he goes on to argue “to the contrary” is more
                characteristic of the way historicist critics have responded (216). And yet the
                recognition that Williams considers Austen to be a historically engaged novelist may
                miss a more subtle point about the argument of <title level="m">The Country and the
                    City</title>, one that gets obscured by the way the chapter vividly reopens, as it
                were, through this allusion to the opening of <title level="m">Pride and
                    Prejudice</title>. For this is not the transition from Cobbett to Austen. That
                comes in the previous paragraph, as part of a stark contrast between the perspective
                of the two writers that follows directly from the argument about the author of the
                <title level="m">Rural Rides</title> as an “outrider” for literary developments
                that are more fully realized in Victorian fiction:
            <quote>But this change in the novel did not happen in Cobbett’s time. Through his middle
                years, while the social changes were happening, Jane Austen was writing from a very
                different point of view, from inside the houses that Cobbett was passing on the
                road. When he was writing about the disappearance of the small gentry he was riding
                through Hampshire, not far from Chawton. It was also in Hampshire that he made his
                list of the new owners of country-houses and estates, from nabobs to stock-jobbers.
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 112)</quote>
              This claim about a difference in perspective despite a shared affinity for close
                observation becomes a key strand in the ensuing discussion of Austen, even as the
                movement forward and back again in time (a method that is characteristic, yet
                somehow intensified when Williams writes about Cobbett) highlights the sense of
                “action” with respect to a campaigning journalist who recognized and endorsed
                working-class organization against capitalist transformations of the countryside.
                For Williams, Cobbett’s “newly typical action” is another dimension of the contrast
                with Austen, and it is accentuated by the preliminary glance ahead to “a new kind of
                novel, which was to become, from the 1830s, the dominant literary form” (112). Put
                in Williams’s own terms, Cobbett provides what the later Gaskell or Dickens cannot,
                a strand of literary history that indicated how even Austen’s celebrated powers of
                observation would become residual.</p>
            <p>The sharp distinction that places the domestic novelist “on the other side of the
                park wall” from the rural rider has also occasioned spirited response in Austen
                criticism (113), particularly as it gets reworked towards the end of the chapter,
                where Williams once again switches temporal registers, speculating that if Austen
                had ventured “outside the park walls, into a very different social experience,” her
                writing would have “become not a moral but a social criticism” of the kind found
                later in George Eliot:
            <quote>We must emphasize here again the importance of Cobbett. What he names, riding past on
                the road, are classes. Jane Austen, from inside the houses, can never see that, for
                all the intricacy of her social description. All her discrimination is,
                understandably, internal and exclusive. She is concerned with the conduct of people
                who, in the complications of improvement, are repeatedly trying to make themselves
                into a class. But where only one class is seen, no classes are seen. (117)</quote>
               It is important to acknowledge that subsequent work on Austen, sensitive to gender,
                commerce, domesticity, sociability, and public and private spheres, demonstrates
                that the catalog of what Williams himself fails to see, on both sides of the park
                wall, is as lengthy as it is troubling. A vivid case in point would be Adela Pinch’s
                wonderful reading of the scene in <title level="m">Emma</title> where the heroine
                breaks away from her friend Harriet’s distracted shopping to look out the door of
                Ford’s shop, observing and envisioning a range of characters from within and beyond
                the plot of the novel. Expecting perhaps the apothecary Mr. Perry, the lawyer
                William Cox “letting himself in at the office door,” and the carriage horses of the
                newly genteel tradesman Mr. Cole, along with “a stray letter-boy on an obstinate
                mule,” she is not disappointed “when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his
                tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs
                quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker’s
                little bow­window eyeing the gingerbread” (Austen 183). The liminal perspective, at
                the door of a shop looking out over a village high street, is itself suggestive with
                respect to Williams’s impermeable park wall, and so too is Pinch’s insistence that
                for all the “gritty everydayness” (xxiv) of the scene there is evidence of an
                important shift in literary history:
            <quote>Austen is doing something quite revolutionary in presenting to us a woman standing in
                a shop door. It is hard for us to find this ordinary image revolutionary, but in
                fact what is revolutionary is that a woman loitering in a shop door in England in
                1815 seems ordinary. It is an image we cannot imagine finding in a novel before this
                moment. Emma’s activity is new, and so is the kind of contemplation Austen
                represents Emma as practicing. (xxiii)</quote>
               Pinch is alert to the role of commerce and “the consumption of fashionable goods” in
                the novel, and to patterns of circulation between London and Highbury, and she
                insists that “this scene must be seen in its entirety as a shopping scene.” But she
                also draws a comparison with Burney’s <title level="m">Camilla</title> to refine our
                sense of what is at stake when Emma takes a moment to pause and reflect. Highbury
                suddenly appears to be a “considerably less orderly” village, and we are made aware
                that even a realistically rendered social world recedes beyond apprehension and
                suggests “glimpses of the inexhaustibly unknown” (xxii–xxiv).</p>
            <p>There is much about this close attention to a historically situated female
                experience—transpiring outside the home, in a world of circulating goods and
                traveling persons—that belies Williams’s narrow and reductive schema of outside and
                inside, of traveling on the park road as against settlement behind the park wall.
                Williams acknowledges little of what Austen and Pinch render so vividly, and his
                vision was no doubt restricted by his interest in sharing Cobbett’s perspective and
                listening closely to Cobbett’s voice. While Pinch does not reference <title 
                    level="m">The Country and the City</title>, others have. Helena Kelly
                acknowledges in Williams a “necessary corrective to Jane’s genteel comedy of
                manners,” but reminds us that many “pivotal scenes in [her] novels take place
                outdoors,” and that even when indoors “we’re not invariably ‘inside the houses.’
                Sometimes we’re in inns, assembly buildings, hotels, cramped rented rooms” (225–26).
                In bringing Austen and her characters out from behind the park wall and onto the
                road, Kelly invokes another episode in <title level="m">Emma</title>, where Harriet
                Smith walks out with a friend on “the Richmond road,” an excursion that is
                “apparently public enough for safety” but ends nevertheless in a terrified encounter
                with “a party of gipsies” and rescue at the hands of Frank Churchill (Austen
                    261).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a compelling treatment of property

                        Houghton-Walker 155–85.</note> The conventional device of male rescue only
                heightens the extent to which Austen knew and rendered what Williams overlooks in
                his easy contrast between Cobbett “riding past on the road” and Austen writing “from
                inside the houses”: the male privilege at work in the relative freedom from
                geographical restriction and threat of assault enjoyed by Cobbett throughout 
                the <title level="m">Rural Rides</title>.</p>
            <p>As a narrative of mistaking and then finding one’s social place, the Harriet Smith
                subplot in <title level="m">Emma</title> indicates the range of Austen’s social
                vision. A village boarding schoolgirl of uncertain parentage, Harriet is raised to
                genteel company at Highbury by a misguided Emma and eventually aspires to marry Mr.
                Knightly, only to return through the process by which the novel disciplines the
                heroine’s imagination to a more suitable marriage with Knightley’s tenant farmer,
                Mr. Martin, which terminates any special intimacy with Emma. The social distinctions
                at issue here and throughout her fiction have led Austen scholars to challenge
                Williams on the question of class. According to Roger Sales, “the wide social
                distance between the aristocratic Mr. Yates and the lower-middle-class Price family”
                in <title level="m">Mansfield Park</title> undermines the “basic thesis that Austen
                only represents one class” (253n10). A consensus about social range in recent Austen
                scholarship is suggested in Juliet McMaster’s compelling chapter on <title 
                    level="a">Class</title> for <title level="m">The Cambridge Companion to Jane 
                        Austen</title>, which sets out from a
                proposition that “class difference was . . . a fact of life for Austen, and an acute
                observation of the fine distinctions between one social level and another was a
                necessary part of her business as a writer of realistic fiction” (111). McMaster
                goes on to provide a complex and dynamic map of status in Austen’s fiction,
                beginning with such titled characters as Lord Osborne (in the fragment <title level="a">The
                Watsons</title>) and Lady Catherine de Bourgh, extending down through the landed gentry,
                gentlemen with incomes, professional men, and those who make or made their money in
                trade (some of whom acquire gentility), and closing with servants and brief glimpses
                of laboring people and the poor.</p>
            <p>Yet before concluding that Williams has been effectively superseded, it is worth
                returning to what he actually says about Austen in <title level="m">The Country and
                    the City</title>. Against the perception that Austen is primarily interested in
                individuals and their “personal relationships,” he insists that her preoccupation is
                with “social <emph>conduct</emph>: a testing and discovery of the
                standards which govern human behaviour in real situations.” And such situations are
                crucially dynamic and uncertain, a matter of “changing fortunes” rather than any
                “settled ‘traditional’ world” (113). This leads directly to a recognition of the
                social range and complexity that Austen scholars are inclined to invoke against him,
                as Williams surveys a range of characters with respect to property, income, and
                manners, including Sir Thomas Bertram, the Crawfords, Darcy, Mr. Knightley, Mr.
                Martin, the Coles, and Catherine Moreland. Change and motion are again keynotes: “It
                must be clear that it is no single, settled society, it is an active, complicated,
                sharply speculative process. It is indeed that most difficult world to describe, in
                English social history: an acquisitive, high bourgeois society at the point of its
                most evident interlocking with an agrarian capitalism that is itself mediated by
                inherited titles and the making of family names.” Given the difficulty of even
                describing this world, Williams marvels at Austen’s ability to maintain “a unity of
                tone, of a settled and remarkably confident way of seeing and judging, in the
                chronicle of confusion and change” (<title level="m">Country</title> 115). The point
                is important, and gets at the complexity and indeed the <emph>necessity</emph> of 
                irony as a way for Austen to write about class: if Emma
                misleads Harriet into misunderstanding her own social status and destiny, their
                mutual confusion is in many respects more interesting and revealing than the
                denouement that divides them and returns them to their proper places. In this sense,
                Emma’s apparently misguided plotting reveals what the resolution of the novel
                conceals.</p>
            <p>Yet Williams returns, with a bracing consistency, to a sense of Austen’s
                limitations. His assessment of her paradoxical achievement follows directly from the
                observation that “she is more exact about income, which is disposable, than about
                acres, which have to be worked” (<title level="m">Country</title> 115), and involves
                an interlocking set of distinctions, familiar to readers of <title 
                    level="m">Keywords</title>, within contemporary senses of the terms “improvement” and
                “cultivation” (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 92–93, 160–61).<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">The observation about income as against acres is consistent with 
                    Edward Copeland’s assertion that “<emph>money</emph>, especially
                            money as spendable income, is the love-tipped arrow aimed at the hearts
                            of Jane Austen’s heroines and her readers” (128).</note> There
                was improvement in working agriculture, and improvement in parks and artificial
                landscapes; there was cultivation of the soil, and cultivation in polite society. In
                both cases, the revenue from the first could be applied to the second. In writing
                about “an active, complicated, sharply speculative process,” Austen achieved her
                remarkable consistency of tone in part by overlooking “working” improvement and
                cultivation while seeing “social” improvement and cultivation “very clearly indeed”
                (<title level="m">Country</title> 116).<note place="foot" resp="editors">I do not 
                    share William Galperin’s sense that Williams regards Austen as a writer 
                    who resists change and is “regulatory” in “discriminating among improvements” 
                    (27–28).</note> For those troubled by the crudeness of the distinction between
                Cobbett “riding past on the road” and Austen writing “from inside the houses,” I
                would offer this more subtle distinction as a redeeming corrective. To be sure,
                there are grounds for contesting Williams’s assessment, notably in <title 
                    level="m">Emma</title>, in the scene where Mr. Knightley meets his brother John at Highbury
                and speaks “as a farmer,” as the two men share an interest in plans around draining
                and fencing, the removal of a tree, “and the destination of every acre for wheat,
                turnips, or spring corn” (Austen 81). And yet Williams’s larger point stands, and
                has been reinforced in a recent chapter on agriculture in the volume <title 
                    level="m">Jane Austen in Context</title>. Here Robert Clark and Gerry Dutton
                propose the striking absence “to the historian’s eye” of farmers and farm workers in
                film and television versions of Austen, and then trace that conspicuous absence to
                the fiction itself: “Only the relatively minor character of Robert Martin 
                in <title level="m">Emma</title> [serves] to represent the most numerous social 
                orders in a period when even the King was affectionately known as ‘Farmer 
                George’” (185).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The chapter
                            draws on the surviving letters of Austen’s parents to portray a
                            household deeply involved in farming and the social and economic changes
                            it involved.</note></p>
            <p>In any case, just as the allusive quip about a prevailing view of Austen does not
                mean that Williams considered her fiction out of touch with history, so too his
                positioning of the domestic novelist and the rural rider on opposite sides of a park
                wall does not involve a reductive, still less static, account of her fiction.<note

                            that the offense may lie instead in a contaminating lack of distinction,
                            and in the leveling audacity that would discuss Austen and Cobbett in
                            the same breath and reach this conclusion: “Cobbett and Jane Austen mark
                            two ways of seeing, contrasted viewpoints, within the same county” (<title 
                                level="m">Country</title> 118). See, for example, Jonathan Bate’s
                    discussion of Austen (with Hardy) in the opening chapter of <title level="m">Song 
                        of the Earth</title>, which comes, by way of
                            Williams, to the geographical proximity of Austen and Cobbett, but
                            immediately works to distinguish the two on the grounds of the bluntness
                            and aggressiveness of Cobbett’s distinction between “a 
                            resident <emph>native</emph> gentry” and those who profit from the soil
                            at a distance: 
                    <quote>Jane Austen explores exactly
                            the same distinction between good stewardship and absenteeism, though by
                            example and not by polemic. And she is more discriminating in her
                            judgements: where Cobbett flails indiscriminately at all the
                            representatives of new money—financial speculators, nabobs and
                            negro-drivers, generals and admirals—Austen is more doubtful about some
                            (Sir Thomas Bertram, the bad father who has bought Mansfield Park on the
                            proceeds of his sugar plantations in Antigua) but robustly defensive of
                            others (admiral Croft, the good husband who in <title

                            successes during the Napoleonic Wars). Knightley is her prime example of
                            the “resident <emph>native</emph> gentry, attached to the

                            extremes of Cobbett’s invective, and allow a romance reader’s affection
                            for the likes of Knightley and Mr. Darcy, while still appreciating
                            Williams’s insistence that we consider the perspective and condition of
                            ordinary English laborers and in doing so recognize the dispossession,
                            condescension, and dehumanization that is embedded in the very idea of a
                            virtuous “resident <emph>native</emph> gentry,” regardless of
                            whether it is politely or crudely conceived.</note> In
                assessing what he meant by restricting her vision to “one class,” we can begin with
                what he did <emph>not</emph> mean, and with another Austen scholar who has
                taken exception to <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>. In the
                introduction to <title level="m">Jane Austen and the Fiction of Her Time</title>, Mary
                Waldron promises to avoid the distorting effects of “a sort of historical criticism”
                that threatens “to damage the coherence of a novel” by prioritizing “what we think
                was important over the perceptions of the author working within the cultural
                parameters of his/her time.” Waldron associates Williams with this kind of
                historicism:
            <quote>Cultural historians like Raymond Williams may be right in their terms to see Austen’s
                fictional world as essentially class-based, but “class” in the Marxist sense that
                they use did not exist in Austen’s lifetime; her society was only just emerging from
                a semi-feudal situation. It is interesting to identify foreshadowings in the novels
                of what were to become elements in the adversarial world of Marx—bourgeois versus
                proletarian—but they tell us nothing about the world within which Austen’s
                characters interact, the world which she and they assume. (11–12)<note 
                    place="foot" resp="editors">I have omitted the opening of the first sentence, 
                    in which Arnold Kettle is included with Williams.</note></quote>
              It is hard to know where to begin in contesting these two sentences. While
                “semi-feudal” elements of English society certainly persisted in Austen’s lifetime
                and beyond, and Williams himself provided most powerful interpretive language for
                thinking about this, to claim that England in the early decades of the nineteenth
                century “was only just emerging from a semi-feudal situation” is to ignore the
                massive changes in agriculture, commerce, industry, and empire that had shaped
                England for centuries, supplementing and replacing “feudal” authority with a complex
                interlocking urban and rural and imperial network of titled, landed, agricultural,
                commercial, professional, and political elites, and leaving the common people with a
                complex array of potential relationships with their superiors. It is difficult to
                say what an account of Austen as a novelist representing a world “only just emerging
                from a semi-feudal situation” would look like, but it would certainly be reductive
                and distorting. The claim about what Austen and her characters “assume” reduces to a
                claim about what Austen herself assumes, and it is certainly true that Williams does
                not want his readers to be confined to those assumptions and to that world. But his
                approach is not to impose elements of his own world on the past. Rather, he draws
                the contrast with Cobbett in part to show that others in the period saw the world
                differently, and did so in part by attending with all of Austen’s fine
                discrimination to other elements of the world. Far from telling “us nothing about
                the world within which Austen’s characters interact,” Cobbett’s perception of a
                world antagonistically divided between rich and poor tells us something important
                about the world of Jane Austen, whether or not it is visible in her novels. And far
                from complacently affirming a Marxist vision of “bourgeois versus proletarian,” the
                process by which Cobbett became increasingly important to Williams was a consequence
                of his recognition of the value of ways of thinking critically about economic and
                social change in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that do not
                easily align with later socialist terms.</p>
            <p>To understand what Williams meant in asserting that Austen saw only one class, we
                need to appreciate the importance of Cobbett’s emerging sense that interlocking
                economic, political, and social systems were effectively creating two classes with
                antithetical interests and experiences—rich and poor, consumers and producers,
                masters and slaves. I have already mentioned Williams’s account of “the new class
                system” in <title level="m">Culture and Society</title>, where he cites an April 1821
                article in the <title level="j">Political Register</title> that finds Cobbett accusing
                an opponent of wanting to reduce “the community to two classes: <emph>Masters</emph> 
                and <emph>Slaves</emph>” (15). Cobbett figures again in
                the <title level="m">Keywords</title> entry on class, as Williams distinguishes a
                sense of class as “precise descriptive grouping” from a newer usage in the early
                nineteenth century that involves “basic relationship,” and particularly “basic
                economic relationships (as between employers and employed, propertied and
                propertyless).” Cobbett’s 1825 observation “that there is one class of society
                united to oppose another” is cited for the latter, along with an 1805 assertion by
                Charles Hall that, while there may be many different orders in “a civilized state,”
                for the purposes of assessing well-being “they need only be divided into two
                classes, viz. the rich and the poor.” Williams suggests that the ambiguity of the
                term has led to “persistent but confused arguments between those who, using 
                <hi rend="bold">class</hi> in the sense of basic relationship, propose two or three
                basic <hi rend="bold">classes</hi>, and those who, trying to use it for descriptive
                groupings, find they have to break these divisions down into smaller and smaller
                categories” (<title level="m">Keywords</title> 66–67).<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">What distinguishes Marxist conceptions of class in this 
                    historical analysis is less essential economic relationship or social 
                    antagonism than the decided shift from two or three basic classes to two, 
                    “the <emph>bourgeoisie</emph> and the <emph>proletariat</emph>” (67).</note> Some 
                of this ambiguity and confusion seems to be at work
                when Austen scholars object to Williams’s claim that Austen failed to see classes
                because she saw only one class: they are committed to the fine social and economic
                distinctions at work in her fiction. Williams recognizes these, but wants to
                disclose through Cobbett an emerging sense of essential economic division that she
                overlooked, working as she did overwhelmingly on one side of the question—in
                Cobbett’s terms, on the side of the rich and the consumers and the masters.</p>
            <p>Of course none of this indicates that Cobbett was correct about a world being reduced
                to two classes with antithetical interests and experiences, any more than <title 
                    level="m">Emma</title> demonstrates that differences between the likes of Emma
                and Mrs. Elton represent a particularly significant moral or social divide in early
                nineteenth-century England. And Williams certainly takes for granted that Cobbett
                witnessed the development of class divisions that became increasingly important
                features of English society over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth
                centuries. But what Williams does show, through Cobbett, is that we cannot simply
                say that Austen failed to represent class, in the sense of basic economic
                relationship, because no one in the period had such a perception. Waldron
                notwithstanding, Williams knew well that “bourgeois versus proletarian” were not
                operative categories in Austen’s time, and he worked as hard as anyone to 
                think <emph>historically</emph> about class. In doing so, he showed that some of
                Austen’s contemporaries <emph>were</emph> coming to think about a society
                fundamentally divided between adversarial classes. For all we may commend Austen’s
                extraordinary precision, her social range was meaningfully limited. By drawing a
                line from Goldsmith and Crabbe through Cobbett to Dickens and Eliot, Williams
                contends that by the early nineteenth century we have reached a point in English
                social history where failing to represent ordinary working men and women risks
                essential oversight.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, there is something haunting about the way Emma seems to approach
                the shop door of Ford’s expecting that she will primarily see other characters named
                in the novel (Mr. Perry, Mr. William Cox, Mr. Cole) only to then observe nameless
                figures (a butcher, an old woman, a group of children) who have no part in the
                narrative, and in that sense function as setting rather than agent. It is as if the
                novel fleetingly defies its own expectations, as registered by the heroine. Emma is
                unperturbed—“she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough” (Austen 183)—but
                the reader can be forgiven for a sense of surprise at the abrupt appearance of the
                sort of nameless common people not typically encountered in an Austen novel. And
                that surprise could foster a recognition of the extent to which reading Jane Austen
                can be a matter of internalizing her oversights as well as her insights.</p>

                    O’Connor, Eldridge and Eldridge, and Inglis.></note> In some sense this is
                unsurprising, given that <title level="m">Cobbett</title> was published in an Oxford
                University Press series associated with elementary introductions to a life and
                works. And yet the book is interpretively ambitious and original. Certainly if
                Williams had produced a study with similar claims about Blake or Wordsworth, there
                would be wider notice in Romantic studies. My aim here will not be to offer a
                comprehensive reading of the volume, but instead pick up on a key strand of my
                discussion so far: how in writing about Cobbett as a key figure in the early
                response to industrial capitalism Williams developed particular ways of thinking
                historically about the literature of the past with respect to the present. The
                challenge is something Williams confronted as early as 1969, in an introduction to
                the second volume of <title level="m">The Pelican Book of English Prose</title> that
                was revised and reprinted in <title level="m">Writing in Society</title> as <title

                stress on continuity is worth making at the beginning. The two centuries since 1780
                are the making of modern Britain. But the connections and the gaps between some of
                the early and some of the later stages are significant. There are moments when we
                know Coleridge or Cobbett or Paine or Jane Austen as ancestors: as connected with us
                in a land and through a language, but across an evident gap of historical time.
                There are also moments when in a thing seen, a thing said, a thing written in a
                particular way, we feel not distance but closeness: a man or a woman; a writer; a
                known experience or idea; a known country. (<title level="m">Writing in

               It was through Cobbett more than any other writer from this “early” period,
                essentially the Romantic period, that Williams explored this problem of distance and
                familiarity, of reading across a historical “gap” that presented acute challenges of
                recognition and understanding. In this sense Cobbett was for Williams the most
                compelling writer of the Romantic period.</p>
            <p>The book opens inauspiciously, with a requisite biographical chapter that recalls
                <title level="m">Culture and Society</title> in the way it reduces to excerpts and
                condensed commentary, here, under the heading of years or ranges of years in
                Cobbett’s life. Williams does introduce “a problem of perspective” that returns
                throughout, as when he remarks that some of the best-known publications (<title 
                    level="m">A Year’s Residence in the United States of America</title>, <title 
                        level="m">A Grammar of the English Language</title>) were from a period of
                exile, 1817 through 1819, when Cobbett returned to America to evade prosecution at
                home. In their “vigorous plain style” and their sense of an “irrepressible
                personality,” these texts engage modern readers, yet they are written at a distance
                from the political crisis that shaped Cobbett even as it was shaped by his prose.
                “Cobbett wrote the books,” Williams observes, “but also these years of exposure and
                practice wrote Cobbett” (19). In the second part of the volume, “Themes,” the
                challenge of moving back and forth in time become increasingly evident. Cobbett’s
                claims about property in labor and the right of combination were “cast in
                conventional terms” and yet pressed to “subversive” conclusions, so as to produce
                “shock (certainly then; and in some places still)” (32–33). His commitment to a
                reform of parliament and the poor laws was consistent with “the radicalism of the
                period,” though it found Cobbett “at the edge of his thinking, moving beyond these
                kinds of change,” notably in “his practical affiliation to the great majority of
                working and poor people” for whom these reforms would eventually prove inadequate
                (34). In practice Cobbett “was prefiguring the later movement” in working-class
                activism but he “did not in fact reach its characteristic shaping ideas,” notably in
                his failure to engage “the new kinds of co-operative and collective social
                provision” that were evident in the work of Paine and Owen (34–35). His “hatred of
                the great proprietors and manufacturers” fostered his sympathy for emerging labor
                organization, yet he still adhered to “an old an idealized social model” that had “a
                limited understanding of the new forces and relations of industrial production”
                (37). The Cobbett of Past Masters can be as socially and historically blinkered as
                the Austen of <title level="m">The Country and the City</title>, and this last insight
                about his animosities and sympathies yields the paradoxical assertion that what
                limited Cobbett in his own time somehow releases him in our own: “This is one of
                several instances where Cobbett’s older kind of radicalism . . . is at once limited
                and partial in his own day yet, in broader terms, still relevant and even prophetic”
                (37).</p>
             <p>Where the intermediate <title level="a">Themes</title> portion of the volume offers 
                 brief topical surveys of Cobbett’s writing on economics, politics, and education, the 
                 third and final part, <title level="a">Issues,</title> is more interpretively and 
                 analytically comprehensive, bringing together matters that Williams himself returned 
                 to throughout his career: “the rural economy in its relation both to a developing 
                 industrialism and to the capitalist system and the state” (28). An opening paragraph 
                 recasts the problem of historical method as a matter of style and voice:
            <quote><p rend="noCount">One sense of history requires that we see Cobbett in his time: “in his period.” We
                then study his campaigns in relation to the immediate conditions and events that
                provoked them. We study his ideas within the thinking and prejudices of his day. We
                applaud and apologise within his time-bound perspective.</p>
             <p rend="noCount">One sense of writing requires that we see Cobbett both in his time and in ours. His
                use of language belongs to his time: the condition of English in the early
                nineteenth century; the social relations within which he developed particular
                uses—those distinctive combinations of formality and colloquial polemic . . . It is
                in the grafting of colloquial phrases and oral emphases on to the still formal
                strengths of the consciously public address of his period that his most distinctive
                practice can be recognized and defined. Pointing forward, this combination is still
                extraordinarily readable. Much of his writing still directly engages us: never
                irrespective of his time but not bound by it either. There are different
                preferences: for the rural rider; for the democratic pamphleteer; for the practical
                countryman. Yet all these as a writer: the writing outlasting its occasions.
                (54–55)</p></quote>
               Again and again in the final phase of the volume, Cobbett is released from the early
                nineteenth century, even as Williams the cultural critic is released, with
                kaleidoscopic effect, from writing about the early nineteenth century. Some of this
                has to do with what the critic regards as valuable about his author. The voice, to
                be sure, and the way his ideas “jump at us from his pages” so that “we can hear him
                speaking them, in his usual plain and simple and decided way” (44). Yet if this
                betrays something uncritical about Williams, what Simpson terms his “appetite for
                immediacy,” much of what is best about the analysis of Cobbett from the opening
                pages of the volume undermines simple presence through an exploration of bewildering
                historical contradiction and inconsistency.</p>
            <p>Thus Williams expresses a preference not for Cobbett the farmer and landholder at
                Botley, but rather for the work of the 1820s, after the loss of the Botley farm and
                the writer’s establishment of a more “commercial base” at Kensington. Here he set
                about promulgating subsistence in <title level="m">Cottage Economy</title>, even as he
                undid such tenets in own commercial practice as a seed farmer and purveyor of
                nursery trees, and in his authorial practice as a publisher of books mediating any
                return to the land. As Williams writes of the volume, “It is at once a consciously
                examined renewal of the elements of a subsistence economy, and yet in the practice
                and in the writing an enterprise beyond subsistence” (24). Williams foregrounds
                these contradictions and embraces a similar paradox about the <title level="m">Rural 
                    Rides</title>, which record Cobbett “riding out on business, whether in
                politics or in one of his commercial enterprises” even as he sought “to look, and
                listen” in ways that evince “the whole man, with whole interests” (<title 
                    level="m">Cobbett</title> 24–25). In Blakean fashion, this “whole man” under early
                capitalism is a riven and contradictory figure, his radical agrarian principles
                extending out through metropolitan commercial and communicative circuits. The
                opening of the third and final part of the volume finds Williams acknowledging
                “different preferences” among different readers of Cobbett, while insisting that the
                man cannot simply be read “in his period” since “the writing outlasts it occasions.”</p>
             <p>Where the <title level="a">Notes on English Prose</title> numbered Coleridge, 
                 Cobbett, Paine, and Austen among the Romantic period writers who “remain connected 
                 with us,” Cobbett was for Williams the most sustained connection, one he was 
                 determined to make available again to his own readers. To achieve this there is a 
                 need to exceed the one sense of history” and the “one sense of writing” sketched 
                 above:
            <quote>These are reasonable senses of both history and writing. But there are other senses,
                which ought now to be explored. There is a sense of history as connecting rather
                than separating his time and ours. Not then this period and that, but a common
                country, in an actual succession, inheritance, of lives. And not then writing as
                style: the critical or textual study; but writing as a practice, within this country
                and inheritance: the giving and taking of energy, in this durable form, to attempt
                or actually to make new kinds of relationship. William Cobbett as contributing, in
                this continuing life. (<title level="m">Cobbett</title> 55)</quote>
               To be sure, the sense of “a common country” and “an actual succession” may give
                pause, in its geographical restriction, and this early twenty-first century American
                reader wonders whether Williams’s point may be exclusionary. At the same time, the
                very inclusion of Cobbett in a Past Masters series that favors the world historical
                figure, running as it does from Homer, Confucius, Plato, and Jesus through Mohammed,
                Shakespeare, Marx, and Tolstoy, indicates something provocative about the claim for
                the local and the immediate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the gendered 
                    restrictions of the Past Masters series—“all these men were written about by 
                    men”—see Delamont 157.</note></p>
            <p>It is worth closing with a consideration of the meaning, in terms of Williams’s own
                critical and interpretive practice, of a “sense of history” that would understand
                Cobbett “in his time and in ours,” and would connect rather than separate the times
                in a shared succession and inheritance. There are some extraordinary claims in a
                section on <title level="a">Cobbett and the New England</title> that follows 
                directly on <title level="a">Cobbett and the Old England.</title> The rural rider 
                experienced “a transforming history” that we tend to
                package and label as “‘Modern England’; ‘Industrial England’; ‘Industrial-Capitalist
                England’; ‘Imperial England’” (<title level="m">Cobbett</title> 57). These are some of
                the terms that counterhistoricist advocates of aesthetic integrity charge Williams
                with injecting into the era of Cobbett and Austen. But he disavows them here,
                aligning all such labeling with a subsequent sense “of an achieved state,” which can
                only regard Cobbett as a “good old chap” who was for all his virtues “not on our
                road” (57). Rather than fixing Cobbett historically, Williams proposes that we share
                with him an ongoing experience of a crisis extending from his time to our own:
            <quote>So there can be no indulgent trailing after Cobbett’s ghost; no lifting of his bones.
                What we can actually learn from him is different, and less flattering: what it is
                like to be living through a time when an old social order is visibly breaking up but
                when we do not have the advantage of hindsight to show us the new social order that
                is succeeding it. This uncertain and restless condition is very characteristic of
                the most concerned and most passionate men of Cobbett’s own day. It is marked,
                paradoxically, by intense radical convictions: of the evils of the time, of the
                depths of its disturbances; of the new thing that must happen, the new life that is
                coming through. In Cobbett and Blake, in Shelley and Carlyle, for all their
                individual differences, there is this characteristic intensity and denunciation of
                what is happening in their world, and also this characteristic confidence that these
                evils cannot last, that something radically new must come. Yet what came as new,
                whatever else may be said of it, was not within their line of vision at all; indeed
                was in many of its elements only an intensification of what they had denounced.
                    (58)<note place="foot" resp="editors">The “lifting of his bones” is an 
                        allusion to Cobbett’s disinterment of the remains of Tom Paine, which Williams 
                        discusses earlier in the book (20–21).</note></quote>
               For literary readers, the company of Blake, Shelley, and Carlyle seems to raise
                Cobbett’s stature, so it is worth insisting again that Williams proceeds from quite
                different assumptions. Cobbett was in fact the leading figure among a group of
                Romantic-period visionaries who contested without fully comprehending the early
                impact of industrial capitalism.</p>
            <p>Williams’s recognition, towards the end of his life, that his own understanding of
                the situation in the 1980s looking ahead might be no better than Cobbett’s in the
                1820s is as poignant as it is bracing. And yet that is not his final point. Rather,
                he stresses shared historical experience and expectation across the centuries:
            <quote>But if we have any sense of history we cannot . . . forget the picture we have been
                given: of those earlier people who were struggling, bravely enough, with forces they
                did not understand. We may suppose we can exempt ourselves from this likely
                deficiency. Indeed that vanity is often the condition of hope. But what we can not
                reasonably do is miss the community of situation: an old order breaking up;
                uncertainty and restlessness, but in these men radical convictions, that certain new
                things must happen. (59)</quote>
               The later pages of the <title level="m">Cobbett</title> volume are remarkable for the
                way they draw on this acknowledgment in order to freely read, analyze, and engage
                “in his time and in ours,” through a series of searching critical explorations that
                escape period restriction, with William Cobbett everywhere in evidence as a
                challenging yet affirming presence. Thus an account of the amplification of “the
                organizing and organized labour movement” in the later nineteenth century leads into
                a consideration of the uneven development of socialism, and of the “complacency”
                with which new movements often regard an earlier history, confident that social and
                economic relations are about to be improved and harmonized, somehow transforming the
                “Great Britain Ltd” of the twentieth century into “Great Britain, the Modern and
                Caring Society.” Instead, persistent crisis yields a current situation where cynical
                voices “speak of the forced ‘de-industrialisation’ of Britain.” Meanwhile disruptive
                economic change continues unabated and “Great Britain in either of its versions
                exports capital and imports weapons of mass destruction, while settling to an
                apparently unending period of widespread unemployment and redundancy” (71). The
                insistence, which becomes a kind of refrain, that it “cannot be Cobbett who shows us
                any way out of this deep failure” is less a critique of his limitations than a bleak
                reflection on our own. To my mind, the third part of <title level="m">Cobbett</title>
                is as compelling as anything in Williams’s later prose. And the problem in
                overlooking Williams’s writing on Cobbett is less what we fail to learn about
                Cobbett than what we miss about Raymond Williams.</p>
