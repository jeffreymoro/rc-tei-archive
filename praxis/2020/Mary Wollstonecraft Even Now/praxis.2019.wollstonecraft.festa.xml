                    as duty—a form of rational, voluntary obligation that entails reciprocal relations, including 
                    rights—Wollstonecraft recasts the ostensibly apolitical obligations of women as the <emph>actions</emph> of the

                    Wollstonecraft ties rights to the realization of one’s human capacities rather than status (wealth, rank, sex, or 
                    even humanity as mere species membership). She thereby creates the basis for a revolutionary political order that 
                    does not simply extend the prerogatives of an unjust status quo to new claimants but overturns the very structures 
                    that disbar women from exercising their rights.</p>

              <p>I take my title from Jacques Rancière’s <title level="m">The Philosopher and his Poor</title>, which asks how 
                 those systematically excluded from philosophy and from politics—the poor, the worker, the disenfranchised, the 
                 enslaved, what he calls the “non-part”—come to take their rightful part or share in the world.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">For Rancière, “the poor” includes not just the “economically disadvantaged part of the 
                     population,” but also “the people who do not count, who have no entitlement to exercise the power of the 
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">archê</foreign>, none for which they might be counted” (Rancière, “Ten Theses” 
                     32).</note> Drawing on the Platonic insistence that no man can have more than one occupation—a shoemaker 
                 must only be a shoemaker and nothing more—Rancière shows how the strict division of labor elaborated in Plato’s 
                 <title level="m">Republic</title> institutes an unjust order that cancels out the place of the poor, not least by 
                 securing the philosopher’s monopoly on thought. By aligning individuals and their purported abilities with fixed 
                 roles, this division codifies an essential character—an inalterable identity—that naturalizes a hierarchical order. 
                 Indeed, the shoemaker’s labor involves less the production of shoes than the reproduction of that order, for in 
                 doing only one thing, “the thing that marks him off and serves to put him in his place,” the shoemaker “does nothing 
                 but accredit, even at the cost of lying, the declared lie that puts him in his place” 
                 (<title level="m">Philosopher</title> 22, 29).<note place="foot" resp="editors">If one’s place in the order of 
                     things exhausts one’s identity, then there is no surplus, no room to maneuver, no means to reallocate, power, 
                     resources, or speech within what Rancière calls the “distribution or partition of the sensible.” On the 
                     distribution, see <title level="m">The Politics of Aesthetics</title>, especially pp. 9–45.</note> On what terms, 
                 Rancière asks, can this declared lie—this fundamental wrong in the construction of the political order—be corrected, 
                 enabling those who do not have rights to become subjects able to assert or enact these rights? How “can those whose 
                 business is not thinking assume the authority to think and thereby constitute themselves as thinking subjects?” 
                 (<title level="m">Philosopher</title> xxvi). How are those excluded from philosophy and from politics to claim a 
                 place within the world?</p>
              <p>Inasmuch as the exclusion of what Rancière calls the “non-part” from the whole is not a reflection of the political 
                 order, but <emph>constitutive</emph> of it, the question of the poor or the “non-part” is not a challenge to the 
                 status quo that arises from the margins; it is intrinsic to the very structure of politics. Setting aside for the 
                 moment the slippage between literal and metaphorical uses of poverty in Rancière’s discussion, I want to think about 
                 the way questions of right and of rights issue from the wrongful exclusion of certain parties. The unequal 
                 distribution of rights in Rancière’s account is “not just the class struggle, internal dissension to be overcome by 
                 giving the city its principle of unity”; it is rather “the constitutive wrong or torsion of politics as such” 
                 (<title level="m">Disagreement</title> 13, 14). That is, politics is not simply the relations that emerge from an 
                 anterior distribution of right (or rights) in a given order; instead, it is the manifestation of a fundamental wrong 
                 that unleashes the insurgent efforts of the non-part to take (its) equal part. “The struggle between the rich and the 
                 poor is not social reality, which politics then has to deal with,” Rancière contends. “It is the actual institution 
                 of politics itself” (<title level="m">Disagreement</title> 11). On these terms, a constitutive wrong is always 
                 already internal to our discourses of right.</p>
              <p>In what follows, I want to use Rancière to address the way the revolutionary philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft thought 
                 about <emph>her</emph> poor—a group that, in eighteenth-century Britain and its empire, included not only the 
                 economically impoverished and the politically disenfranchised, but also women of all ranks, classes, and degrees of 
                 power. Like Rancière, Wollstonecraft places wrongs anterior to rights, recognizing how the unequal constitution of 
                 the political order comes before and lies behind the injustices done to women. Patriarchal domination is not the 
                 unrecognized backdrop in debates over the rights of man, but integral to the political order; women are active 
                 participants both in the oppressive status quo and in the revolutionary struggle against it, not passive bystanders 
                 upon whom prerogatives may be arbitrarily conferred. The struggle between men and women is not a social reality, 
                 which politics then has to deal with, but the actual institution of politics itself. On these terms, the wrongs done 
                 to women cannot simply be righted by expanding the numbers included in the status quo (by extending the franchise or 
                 giving select women power, for example), because the extension of the prerogatives of an unjust order to new 
                 claimants (whether the poor or women) leaves the underlying distribution of power, of visibility, intact. The 
                 extension of rights to new claimants will not suffice; the very terms on which rights are understood to exist must 
                 change.<note place="foot" resp="editors">When we attribute rights to certain individuals, and then enlarge the sphere 
                     of rights-bearing persons one by one, as Etienne Balibar has pointed out, we are not really working with a 
                     universal; instead, we are reinscribing the initial division within an ever-growing class. That is, if human 
                     rights start with two individuals made equal and then expand outwards, then we must always grapple with the 
                     inequality between the initial two and the rest. See Balibar.</note> </p> 
              <p>In reading Wollstonecraft with (and against) Rancière, I want to consider how his understanding of wrongs can help us 
                 grasp the terms of her reclamation of rights. Although gender is not a privileged category of analysis for Rancière 
                 (he does not single out women’s oppression as a special case, but treats it as yet another instantiation of 
                 injustice), the nigh-universal exclusion of women—half of the human race—from early political theory 
                 exemplifies his contention that politics emerge from a fundamental 
                 exclusion from the recognized order: an anterior distribution that decides who has power and who does not, who can 
                 speak and who can be heard. Enlarging an unjust political order does not produce justice; rather, the very basis for 
                 the distribution of rights must be revolutionized. It is for this reason, I argue, that Wollstonecraft asserts rights 
                 not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror image of the dominant order), but as the 
                 necessary correlative of duties.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“In eighteenth-century British political thought, 
                     rights such as freedom of conscience were often paired with duties such as religious tolerance. In such moral 
                     pairings, rights were understood as correlative, or reflexive and relational. Such correlative rights served as 
                     a kind of practical shorthand for abstract moral principles that defined ethical human relationships and 
                     obligations to one another within political communities” 
                     (Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft</title> 31).</note> By formulating women’s toil as duty—a form of 
                 rational, voluntary obligation that entails reciprocal relations, including rights—Wollstonecraft shows how the 
                 existing status of women already harbors within it the grounds for women’s title to rights.</p>
              <p>Since Wollstonecraft insists that only human beings can have duties, the description of women’s activities as duty 
                 also implies a species classification, one that draws women into the compass of the revolutionary rights of man. 
                 Indeed, inasmuch as duties as ongoing actions constitute the subject who performs them, they enable new individuals 
                 and groups to join the circle of beings who possess what Hannah Arendt calls the “right to have rights,” by making 
                 human capacities and actions rather than property or inherited status into the basis for political personhood 
                 (<title level="m">Origins</title> 296). Because duty is an ongoing activity intrinsic to the realization of one’s 
                 human purpose, the rights with which it is coupled cannot be static possessions that some parties have and others 
                 lack. Duty creates what might be called rights-enacting rather than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft 
                 to circumvent the sharp division between human and political rights that has bedeviled philosophers from Edmund 
                 Burke to Hannah Arendt and Jacques Rancière. In insisting that “rights and duties are inseparable,” Wollstonecraft 
                 not only creates a space for those excluded a priori from the rights-bearing community, she also uses duty to 
                 reveal that women are <emph>already</emph> a part of the political order (266). By recasting the ostensibly 
                 apolitical obligations of women as the actions of political subjects, Wollstonecraft leverages the performance of 
                 duty into a reclamation of rights.</p>
              <p>At first glance, rights play a strangely marginal role in Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre, notwithstanding their titular 
                 centrality to both <title level="m">Vindications</title>. Many critics have observed that Wollstonecraft’s 
                 emphasis on duty, education, and virtue seems like a deflection from the incendiary question of rights (ask not 
                 what you can do for women, but what women can do for you). Eileen Botting points to the fact that the <title 
                     level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> features “the term ‘rights’ thirty-two times,” while the 
                 word “duties” appears “three times as often” (78); Virginia Sapiro notes that Wollstonecraft’s stress on “virtue” 
                 marks her commitment to a civic republican tradition rather than to a Lockean discourse of rights and contract. 
                 Barbara Taylor, Susan James, and Sandrine Bergès, among others, have given pride of place to Wollstonecraft’s 
                 interest in education, prioritizing interdependence over the autonomy that holds sway over proprietary models 
                 of rights.<note place="foot" resp="editors">James notes that Wollstonecraft sees “our rights as powers that are 
                     created by the institutional and personal relations between many embodied individuals. . . . Locating our 
                     rights or powers to act in individuals is a sort of shorthand. . . . If we want to concentrate rights . . . 
                     in individual hands . . . we need to start, as Wollstonecraft does, from the recognition of our mutual 
                     dependence” (159–60).</note> Inasmuch as duty, virtue, and education create rational, moral free agents, 
                 they enable women to realize the humanity that makes one a rights-bearing subject. Wollstonecraft’s emphasis 
                 on duty places not the bare necessities of life but the exercise of human capacities at the heart of women’s 
                 claim to rights.</p>
              <p>Wollstonecraft’s commitment to human capacities and obligations as the basis for rights famously pits her 
                 against her contemporary Edmund Burke, who derides the “rights of man” as an airy metaphysical abstraction in 
                 his <title level="m">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title>. Rights established through mere human 
                 being have no force for Burke. “In proportion as they are metaphysically true,” he asserts, “they are morally 
                 or politically false” (153). Custom, property, and reverence for authority—“the super-added ideas, furnished 
                 from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns, and the understanding ratifies, as necessary 
                 to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature”—secure the political order in Burke’s account. Without 
                 these collectively held fictions, “a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal; 
                 and an animal not of the highest order” (171). Humanity here is not the basis of a common title to rights, 
                 but a residue left when the trappings of rank and tradition have been stripped away.</p>
              <p>Wollstonecraft excoriates Burke’s worship of the “demon of property” and the “pestiferous purple” both in 
                 her response to the <title level="m">Reflections</title>, the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights 
                     of Men</title>, and in the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                 (<title level="m">VRM</title> 9; <title level="m">VRW</title> 87). Devoted to “the unnatural customs, which 
                 ignorance and mistaken self-interest have consolidated,” Burke fails to recognize the way inherited privilege 
                 and the interests (national and private) of the propertied deform human nature: “The Briton takes the place 
                 of the man, and the image of God is lost in the citizen!” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 10, 15). Whereas 
                 classical theories of political rights derive the possibility of equality from the supplanting of (unequal, 
                 because differently endowed) men by the fictive equality of the person (the man, the citizen), Wollstonecraft 
                 argues that the unequal distribution of political personhood introduces inequality within a community of 
                 otherwise equally entitled human beings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For Arendt, “we are not born 
                     equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves 
                     mutually equal rights” (Arendt 301).</note> In her account, the replacement of the man by the citizen 
                 is a self-serving alibi for the degradation of one’s fellows to the status of beasts, as unjust prerogatives 
                 blind the privileged to the anterior claims of their fellows: “The man [is] changed into an artificial monster 
                 by the station in which he was born” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 10). Burke rates the poor as little better 
                 than beasts. “Your respect for rank,” Wollstonecraft rages, “has swallowed up the common feelings of humanity; 
                 you seem to consider the poor as only the livestock of an estate, the feather of hereditary nobility” 
                 (<title level="m">VRM</title> 17). Lacking the institutions (the state, the law, property) that would enable 
                 them to assert rights, the poor are at best entitled to compassion “extorted from a mixed feeling of disgust 
                 and animal sympathy” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 11). Like Burke’s denuded queen, that animal “not of the 
                 highest order,” the poor are instances of bare shivering humanity, whose defenseless plight substantiates 
                 Burke’s claim that the “abstract perfection” of natural rights “is their practical defect,” for such rights 
                 can be enforced only “<emph>by a power out of themselves</emph>” (151).</p>
              <p>Burke’s treatise anticipates elements of Hannah Arendt’s influential description of the impotence of human 
                 rights in her account of the plight of stateless populations in the wake of World War I (to which, importantly 
                 for my purposes, Rancière responds). Indeed, Arendt invokes Burke’s pragmatic insistence that “the rights which 
                 we enjoy spring ‘from within the nation’” (<title level="m">Origins</title> 299). Although the inalienable 
                 “rights of man” ostensibly require “no special law . . . to protect them because all laws were supposed to 
                 rest upon them,” Arendt notes, they cannot uphold themselves (291). Once “human beings lacked their own 
                 government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them and no 
                 institution was willing to guarantee them” (292). Nationless refugees thus found themselves reduced to what 
                 Arendt famously called “the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human” (300). Stripped of “the protecting 
                 mask of a legal personality,” the mere human being is “without rights and duties, . . . outside the range of 
                 the law and the body politic of the citizens, as for instance a slave—but certainly a politically irrelevant 
                 being” (<title level="m">Revolution</title> 108, 107). On these terms, the human rights granted to refugees 
                 and others are, for Arendt, empty—rights in name only, bestowed upon subjects bereft of the powers to wield 
                 them.</p>
              <p>The stark division between human and political rights that resides at the heart of Wollstonecraft’s struggle 
                 with Burke is likewise central to Rancière’s critique of Arendt’s description of human rights. Both Burke and 
                 Arendt see political rights as belonging to specific designated parties (for Burke the king, the propertied, 
                 authorities sanctioned by time and tradition; for Arendt citizens, or politically recognized “persons”). Yet 
                 if the community of rights-bearers is always already designated, how are the rightless to attain the rights 
                 from which they are categorically barred? Both Burke’s and Arendt’s accounts create an impasse in which, as 
                 Rancière has contended, “either the rights of the citizen are the rights of man—but the rights of man are the 
                 rights of the unpoliticized person; they are the rights of those who have no rights” <emph>or</emph> “the 
                 rights of man are the rights of the citizen . . . [which] means that they are the rights of those who have 
                 rights, which amounts to a tautology” (“Who?” 302). To treat only of political rights (or to treat human 
                 rights as if they can only be addressed in terms of preexisting political rights) is to accept the terms of 
                 a rigged system. That is, by creating a sharp line between the political and the nonpolitical subject, Arendt 
                 misrecognizes that it is precisely the drawing of this line—the exclusions made in the very constitution of 
                 the political—that is <emph>the</emph> political question par excellence. How, Rancière asks, can this line 
                 be redrawn?</p>
              <p>Rancière uses the human to relitigate this division, leveraging the ability to exercise human capacities to 
                 open up an exclusionary order, blurring the thresholds between the political and the nonpolitical, citizen 
                 and human. Describing the rights of man in deliberately paradoxical terms as “the rights of those who have not 
                 the rights that they have and who have the rights that they have not,” Rancière argues that rights are not 
                 “predicates belonging to definite subjects”—nominal possessions that some humans “have” and others do not—but 
                 generative principles that entitle their claimants to “a sphere of implementation of these predicates” (302, 
                 303, 303). Rights, that is, create the “opening of an interval for political subjectivization,” in which 
                 subjects use rights that they do not (yet) possess (304). This seemingly contradictory formulation creates a 
                 kind of no-man’s (no-woman’s) land (or a not-yet-someone’s land) that tests the borders of inclusion and 
                 exclusion. In this paradoxical space in which one has and doesn’t have rights at one and the same time, those 
                 excluded from the political order can convert themselves from a “non-part” to a part (302).</p>
              <p>Inasmuch as “political predicates are open predicates,” Rancière argues, “they open up a dispute about what 
                 they exactly entail and whom they concern in which cases” (303). It is apt for my purposes that the example 
                 Rancière uses to illustrate this “dispute” is a statement made by another female revolutionary: not 
                 Wollstonecraft, but Olympe de Gouges, author of the <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of 
                     Woman</title>, who insisted that “if women are entitled to go to the scaffold, they are entitled to go 
                 to the assembly” (303). That the revolutionary government executes women, Rancière points out, reveals that 
                 their bare ostensibly apolitical lives are in fact always already political, for if women may be killed by 
                 the state, then they are recognized as subjects within it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It is worth 
                     noting that Arendt registers this argument in <title level="m">Origins</title>. Stateless people are 
                     deprived of legality in a way that leaves them worse off than criminals: “It seems to be easier to 
                     deprive a completely innocent person of legality than someone who has committed an offence. . . . The 
                     deprivation of legality, <emph>i.e.</emph>, of <emph>all</emph> rights, no longer has a connection 
                     with specific crimes” (295). Wollstonecraft notes that women are “denied all political privileges, 
                     and [are] not allowed, as married women, excepting in criminal cases, a civil existence” 
                     (<title level="m">VRW</title> 256). The law only acts to protect women when the violation is 
                     materialized as physical violence: “The laws of this country—if women have a country—afford her no 
                     protection or redress from the oppressor, unless she has the plea of bodily fear” 
                     (<title level="m">Maria</title> 92).</note> Gouges’s claim to a right is not, Rancière points out, 
                 asserted directly or positively; it is instead “enacted in the process of a wrong,” in the construction of 
                 what Rancière calls a dissensus, which reveals the intractable contradictions at the heart of the social 
                 and political order by “putting two worlds”—in this case, the political life of the assembly 
                 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">bios</foreign>) and the “bare life” of the scaffold 
                 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">zoe</foreign>)—“in one and the same world” (304).</p>
              <p>Wollstonecraft likewise sought to create a dispute or dissensus that would carve out a place for 
                 <emph>her</emph> poor (that is, for women), not by extracting the possibility of a right from a wrong, but 
                 through her insistence on the inseparability of rights and duties.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">Wollstonecraft recognizes the connection between sexual and economic oppression, even 
                     as she distinguishes between them. Lena Halldenius argues that what distinguishes the oppressed state 
                     of women from that of the poor for Wollstonecraft is not any intrinsic difference in their oppression, 
                     but the addition of “a ‘false morality’ identifying a woman’s virtue with subjugation and passivity” 
                     (Halldenius, <title level="a">Primacy</title> 78).</note> By shifting focus from the entitlement to 
                 rights to the performance of duty, Wollstonecraft grounds political participation in capacities for action 
                 rather than status (wealth, rank, sex, or even humanity as mere species membership). If, in Wollstonecraft’s 
                 account, the duties of women already exist, so too must the rights—even if they are yet to be acknowledged. 
                 If Olympe de Gouges insists that women’s presence on the scaffold entitles them to a seat in the assembly, 
                 Wollstonecraft argues that the performance of female domestic duties creates women’s title to political 
                 rights—not least because maternal duty entails what might be deemed the most political act of all: the 
                 reproduction and education of individuals who are considered to be citizens.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">On Wollstonecraft and maternal duty, see Sapiro, 154–61. Wollstonecraft states that 
                     women’s first duty is “to themselves as rational creatures, and the next, in point of importance, as 
                     citizens, is that, which includes so many, of a mother” (VRW 216). If duty is a form of 
                     subject-constituting labor that for women involves the reproduction of others, to what degree is 
                     that labor absorbed by the self? Wollstonecraft’s model of maternal duty intersects with questions 
                     of property and the rights understood to issue from such claims. In a 1794 letter, Wollstonecraft 
                     uses Locke’s model of labor to stake a claim to women’s propriety over children: “Considering the 
                     care and anxiety a woman must have about a child before it comes into the world, it seems to me, by 
                     a <emph>natural right</emph>, to belong to her” (qtd. in Sapiro 157). Yet Wollstonecraft elsewhere 
                     pits herself against Lockean models of ownership as the basis for rights, as Lena Halldenius has 
                     argued, questioning the assimilation of the fruits of workers’ labor into the masters’ property 
                     and—by extension—the notion that parental labor grants similar rights over children 
                     (<title level="a">Feminist Critique</title>).</note> </p>
              <p>In advancing this line of argument, Wollstonecraft exposes the contradiction between the rightless female 
                 body that produces subjects and the rights-bearing subjects that women bear, thus revealing the relations 
                 that Burke and Arendt would characterize as not-political to reside at the heart of politics. Her claim for 
                 women’s rights rests not on political personhood, but on maternal duty and the relations it posits 
                 <emph>between</emph> human beings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">She thereby changes the basis for rights 
                     claims so as to circumvent what Wendy Brown describes as one of the key paradoxes of rights. Since 
                     masculinist rights discourse “presumes an ontologically autonomous, self-sufficient, unencumbered 
                     subject,” Brown argues, early feminists like Wollstonecraft “were arguing for something that could 
                     not be produced without simultaneously demanding a transformation in the nature of what they were 
                     arguing for, namely, the ‘rights of man’ for women. . . . Women both require access to the existence 
                     of this fictional subject and are systematically excluded from it by the gendered terms of 
                     liberalism” (431).</note> By making duty the basis of the right to have rights, Wollstonecraft 
                 reconfigures the very terms on which the subject can claim them. That is, she produces a title to political 
                 being grounded not in the fact of belonging to a specific subset (the rich, the propertied, the autonomous 
                 self-possessed subject), but predicated on the performance of actions that realize one’s humanity—on 
                 Rancière’s implementation of a political predicate.</p>
              <p>Inasmuch as duty, virtue, and education create rational, moral free agents, they enable women to achieve the 
                 humanity that <emph>makes</emph> one a rights-bearing subject. It is for this reason that Alexandre Lefebvre 
                 has argued that Wollstonecraft is interested less in the role of human rights “in protecting people” than in 
                 their “potential . . . to transform people . . . [by] modify[ing] the relation we have to ourselves” (182). 
                 For Wollstonecraft, Lefebvre claims, human rights are an aspirational mirror, the instruments of rational 
                 self-actualization, “educational in and of themselves” in that they enable women “to view themselves in the 
                 image of human rights, for example, <emph>as</emph> self-determining agents free of spurious needs and 
                 passions, and <emph>as</emph> human rather than female beings” (184).<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">Lefebvre’s account affords a way out of the circular logic that haunts Wollstonecraft’s 
                     text, in which the realization of subjectivity can start to seem like a form of autopoeisis. Each 
                     component of Wollstonecraft’s virtue-duty-reason nexus appears to depend upon the others: if, as 
                     Wollstonecraft affirms,  “every being may become virtuous by the exercise of its own reason,” but 
                     virtue depends upon duty, and duty requires reason, what comes first (<title level="m">VRW</title> 90)? 
                     In order to escape from this circular logic, Wollstonecraft construes politics not as a sphere but as 
                     a process by which subjects are constituted in an ongoing fashion.</note> Serving “as the very content 
                 and medium of instruction,” human rights spur on the actualization of one’s human being (184). While for 
                 Lefebvre, rights anticipate the human subjects who will come to exercise them, duty, I want to argue, offers 
                 the means and immediacy of a present enactment, materializing virtue in practice by revealing that the 
                 subject is already the being she strives to be. If Rancière’s subjects “have the rights they do not have,” 
                 Wollstonecraft’s subjects have the virtue they do not have, realized through the enactment of duty that 
                 performs and creates the subjectivity that does not (yet) have rights. Duty thus does not de facto 
                 reproduce an oppressive division of labor; it entails forms of self-transformation that alter the very 
                 constitution of the political order. On these terms, duty precedes the acknowledgment of rights claims 
                 (if not the rights themselves), as humans perform subject-constituting activities in anticipation of legal 
                 and philosophical recognition of the human prerogatives they <emph>already</emph> possess.</p>
              <p>Duty creates rights-enacting rather than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft to get around 
                 the sharp division between human and political rights that (as we saw above) Rancière condemns in Arendt’s 
                 account. Because duty is an ongoing activity intrinsic to the realization of one’s human purpose, the 
                 rights with which it is coupled cannot be static possessions that some parties have and others lack. For 
                 Wollstonecraft, capacities and actions rather than property or inherited status thus become the basis for 
                 rights. Put another way, neither men nor women “have” rights, for to “have” a right is to operate 
                 precisely according to a logic of possession that treats the class of rights-bearers as an already 
                 established fact. Instead, women and men <emph>perform</emph> the duties that show them to be—and enable 
                 them to become—rights-enacting subjects. Wollstonecraft thus uses duty to transform rights from something 
                 one has or owns into active principles acquired and wielded through virtuous action. As a result, rights 
                 may both be gained—and forfeited. As Wollstonecraft points out, those who fail to perform their duty—the 
                 idle rich who neglect their moral and political obligations—relinquish their rights: “A right always 
                 includes a duty,” Wollstonecraft notes, “and I think it may, likewise, fairly be inferred, that they 
                 forfeit the right, who do not fulfill the duty” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 227). Prerogatives exercised 
                 without the counterweight of duty, Wollstonecraft insists, are not rights but tyrannical powers.</p>
              <p>At first glance Wollstonecraft’s insistence on duty may seem to reinstate a sexual division of labor that 
                 reinforces separate and unequal spheres. Even as Rancière’s shoemaker must stick to his last, so too are 
                 Wollstonecraft’s women seemingly enjoined to perform the very duties that trap them in patriarchal 
                 structures. Indeed, Wollstonecraft is careful to avoid intimating that she wishes to annihilate women’s 
                 customary obligations: “When I treat of the peculiar duties of women, as I should treat of the peculiar 
                 duties of a citizen or father, it will be found that I do not mean to insinuate that they should be taken 
                 out of their families, speaking of the majority” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 132). Yet by placing 
                 women’s duties alongside the obligations of men as citizens and fathers, Wollstonecraft reclassifies 
                 women’s domestic labors as themselves political, and throughout the text, she harnesses the performance 
                 of domestic duties to a grander trajectory of human self-realization: “Connected with man as daughters, 
                 wives, and mothers,” she writes, “their moral character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling 
                 these simple duties: but the end, the grand end of their exertions should be to unfold their own faculties 
                 and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 95). The duties with which men 
                 and women are charged are not outwardly imposed, circumscribed tasks, but subject-constituting activities, 
                 driven by an active imperative for human self-realization.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Women are 
                     “human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed upon this earth to unfold their faculties” 
                     (<title level="m">VRW</title> 74), and thus have, as Botting puts it, a “duty to develop their moral 
                     and intellectual potential as rational creatures of God.” Humanity furnishes a “naturalistic 
                     foundation” for rights claims prior to the institution of a social order able to assert normative 
                     standards (<title level="m">Wollstonecraft</title> 51, 74). Her version of humanity is grounded in 
                     god-given capacities, a theological model that embraces perfectibility in a future 
                     orientation.</note> </p>
              <p>Although the tasks of individuals may diverge depending on occupation, sex, rank, 
                 bodily strength, and skill, the principles that govern duty apply equally to all human beings. “I allow,” 
                 Wollstonecraft notes, that women “may have different duties to fulfil; but they are <emph>human</emph> 
                 duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them . . . must be the same” 
                 (<title level="m">VRW</title> 120). Notably, Wollstonecraft does not lean on a common “humanity” to 
                 justify women’s claims; instead, she treats “the human” as a modifier, a qualifier of an action rather 
                 than a noun: these are “<emph>human</emph> duties”—things that those who are to be considered human do. 
                 The humanity that for Wollstonecraft grounds a claim to human rights is not on these terms a simple 
                 matter of species belonging (in her account, women are often degraded to the status of prattling 
                 creatures, pets, birds). Rather, it involves the acquisition and exercise of reason and virtue (both 
                 qualities that distinguish humans from animals) through education and the performance of duty. “Reason,” 
                 Wollstonecraft insists, “is absolutely necessary to enable a woman to perform any duty properly,” for 
                 “it is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own 
                 reason” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 133, 90). Duties are “not the blind impulse of unerring instinct” 
                 that drives beasts (<title level="m">VRM</title> 31). It is the knowing performance of a moral 
                 obligation that distinguishes duty from slavish toil in obedience to a command.</p>
              <p>Indeed, so fundamental is duty to Wollstonecraft’s understanding of humanity that those who thwart women 
                 in performing duties prevent them from realizing their human being, magnifying “their inferiority till 
                 women are almost sunk below the standard of rational creatures” and creating the “doubt whether she is 
                 a moral agent, or the link which unites men with brutes” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 104). To prevent women 
                 from performing their duty is to strip them of the virtue that “can only be acquired by the discharge of 
                 relative duties,” reducing them to “mere animals” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 211, 76). It is on these 
                 terms, as Lena Halldenius argues, that we can argue that Wollstonecraft’s 
                 <title level="m">Vindication</title> “is <emph>primarily</emph> about rights: a right to the circumstances 
                 in which we can legitimately be expected to perform the duty of virtue” (<title level="a">Primacy</title> 80).</p>
              <p>It is because Wollstonecraft wishes for women to have rights in a just order, rather than powers in an 
                 unjust one, that she focuses on the reciprocal relationship of rights and duties rather than grounding 
                 her arguments for rights solely on the wrongs suffered by women. Whereas Olympe de Gouges uses wrongs 
                 to claim rights, as we saw above, Wollstonecraft fears that a claim to rights based on wrongs will 
                 reproduce the structural principles that perpetuate injustice: a politics that is premised on wrongs 
                 rather than duty cannot escape or revise the structures that have produced an unjust status quo. The 
                 reversal of a wrong does not a priori yield a symmetrical right, nor does the negation of one term offer 
                 a clear portrait of what its opposite might entail. While correlative theories entail the reflexive 
                 relation of rights and duties, the seeming symmetry of rights and wrongs entails a reversal in which 
                 the injury defines the nature of the right and the subject called into being is defined through a harm. 
                 As Wendy Brown has argued, “ideals of freedom ordinarily emerge to vanquish their imagined immediate 
                 enemies, but in this move they frequently recycle and reinstate rather than transform the terms of 
                 domination that generated them . . . without addressing the <emph>subject constitution that domination 
                     effects</emph>” (7). Discussions of rights that focus on the adjudication of wrongs recognize only 
                 sensibility (a property shared by animals) rather than reason or virtue (human qualities), 
                 recapitulating the structural disenfranchisement that casts women as victims (and thus as unqualified 
                 to become subjects of rights).</p> 
              <p>Alleviating suffering palliates the overt injury, while leaving intact the <emph>real</emph> wrong (the 
                 anterior injustice, the lack of right, the underlying exclusion that constructs the political order). 
                 Thus, for example, men’s kindness to women, like their “tenderness for their humble dumb domestics,” 
                 reflects men’s duty to treat women gently, not an acknowledgement of women’s rights, while charity to 
                 the impoverished, Wollstonecraft observes, is condescension, not justice: “If the poor are in distress,” 
                 she notes, the rich “will make some benevolent exertions to assist them; they will confer obligations, 
                 but not do justice” (<title level="m">VRW</title> 243; <title level="m">VRM</title> 52). Rather than 
                 recognizing rights, the empowered confer—indeed, create—obligations. The act of “righting wrongs” thus 
                 installs certain parties as “the dispenser[s] of these rights,” as Gayatri Spivak has argued, confirming 
                 the existing monopoly on power by upholding the subordination of the weak to the 
                 empowered protectors or defenders of rights (524). Women and the poor are invited to feast on the crumbs 
                 dropped from the table rather than being offered a spot at it. It is in order to avoid this slippage from 
                 justice to benevolence that Wollstonecraft so insistently turns from the disempowering binary of right 
                 and wrong to the empowering reciprocity of rights and duties—a slippage also apparent in the elision of 
                 human rights and humanitarianism in our own day.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Indeed, the 
                     compassionate treatment of women or the poor is distressingly close to the treatment Wollstonecraft 
                     advocates for animals. For Wollstonecraft, kindness to animals is a human duty, not an animal right, 
                     for the correlative theory of duties and rights does not extend to beasts: “While humans had a duty 
                     to respect sentient life,” Botting notes, “animals did not have a corresponding right to be free from 
                     abuse by humans.” The claim that something should not be harmed (the recognition that it may be 
                     wronged) does not entail rights—nor does it acknowledge the humanity of the victims 
                     (Botting, <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft</title> 94). On Wollstonecraft’s view of the human 
                     distinction from animals, see Ruston 28–62 and Seeber; on Wollstonecraft and slavery, see 
                     Brace.</note> </p>
              <p>Yet Wollstonecraft also cannily exploits this reduction of women to suffering objects in order 
                 to vindicate her claims, ruthlessly compelling her reader to follow through on the logic of the 
                 present system in an all-or-nothing gambit. If rights and duties are the god-given birthright of 
                 <emph>all</emph> human beings (not concessions made by the dominant class to the poor), the only 
                 argument that justifies their denial is the categorical reclassification of the claimant as an animal: 
                 “Let women share the rights and she will emulate the virtues of man; for she must [either] grow more 
                 perfect when emancipated, or justify the authority that chains such a weak being to her duty.—If the 
                 latter, it will be expedient to open a fresh trade with Russia for [the] whips . . . [used by a husband 
                 or father to] reign, wielding this scepter, sole master of his house, because he is the only being in 
                 it who has reason” (266). Either the work that constitutes women’s duty is the activity of a rational 
                 (human) creature, in which case it demands the recognition of rights—or it is not, in which case women 
                 should be classed as animals.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Should it appear,” Wollstonecraft 
                     observes, “that like the brutes, [women] were principally created for the use of man, he will let 
                     them patiently bite the bridle, or should their rationality be proved he will not impede their 
                     improvement merely to gratify his sexual appetites” (104).</note> “Allowing this position,” 
                 Wollstonecraft continues, “women have not any inherent rights to claim; and by the same rule, their 
                 duties vanish, for rights and duties are inseparable” (266). In daring readers to try to do without 
                 the duties women already perform, Wollstonecraft raises the stakes even higher, exposing the centrality 
                 of women’s work to the reproduction of the very order upon which all alike depend.</p>
              <p>Wollstonecraft’s implacable logic creates precisely the kind of dissensus that Rancière identifies at 
                 the heart of Olympe de Gouges’s claim to women’s rights, but she does so not through wrongs, but 
                 through duties. If women are not rights-bearing entities, they have no duties; if they have duties, 
                 they must be rights-bearing entities.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“If you do not respect people’s 
                     rights,” as Halldenius puts it, “you are not entitled to expect them to perform duties, for the 
                     simple reason that they do not have any” (<title level="a">Primacy</title> 90). By grounding 
                     rights not in property but human reason, she allows the excluded to accede to the title; her 
                     emphasis on education offers us a subject that doesn’t already exist but can come to 
                     be.</note> Either women are not human and should be treated as animals, or they are human and must 
                 be treated as such—in which case, the rights that are the necessary correlative of duty must 
                 accompany its fulfillment. Wollstonecraft thus exposes the dependence of the rights of man upon 
                 the toil of woman. Indeed, the rights of men are enacted <emph>as</emph> and <emph>through</emph> 
                 the wrongs of women.</p>
              <p>Yet Wollstonecraft’s theory is not wholly exempt from the modes of exploitation she condemns. The 
                 line she seeks to draw between elective duty and the rightless toil that reduces women to beasts of 
                 burden presupposes an independence from necessity that allows tasks to be freely chosen—a version of 
                 work largely unavailable to the poor. Wollstonecraft’s celebration of the dignity of duty obscures the 
                 imperatives that constrain actual labor and the ways unremitting toil degrades the worker, male and 
                 female alike. Indeed, even as Wollstonecraft turns “impatiently to the poor, to look for man 
                 undebauched by riches or power,” she discovers that privation and a lack of education have left him 
                 “scarcely above the brutes, over which he tyrannized; a broken spirit, worn- out body, and all those 
                 gross vices which the example of the rich, rudely copied, could produce” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 
                 58). Hard labor proves to be a material impediment to reflection or to revolutionary critique: “The 
                 vulgar have not the power of emptying their mind of the only ideas they imbibed whilst their hands 
                 were employed” (<title level="m">VRM</title> 16–17). Unable to attain the disinterested stance of the 
                 philosopher necessary to critique the system, the “vulgar” swallow ideas decanted into them from above. 
                 The theoretical tools required to dismantle the master’s house cannot be fashioned by the poor 
                 themselves. Wollstonecraft’s theory, like that of Rancière’s philosopher, confines the shoemaker to 
                 his—or her—place.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In a material sense, eighteenth-century Englishwomen 
                     of course could not readily become shoemakers, which is one of the reasons Wollstonecraft gives 
                     such centrality to women’s right to work, on the one hand, and to the right to keep the fruit of 
                     one’s labors as opposed to property, on the other. “A man with half my industry, and, I may say, 
                     abilities, could have procured a decent livelihood, and discharged some of the duties which knit 
                     mankind together,” the abused servant Jemima charges in <title level="m">Maria</title>, “whilst 
                     I, who had acquired a taste for the rational, nay, in honest pride let me assert it, the virtuous 
                     enjoyments of life, was cast aside as the filth of society” (49). The capacity to support oneself 
                     here becomes the basis for belonging to the social and political community. Deprived of the 
                     ability to work, Jemima cannot gain the basic necessities required to perform her civic 
                     duty.</note> </p> 
              <p>If the title of my essay, “The Philosopher and Her Poor,” takes the woman philosopher as a fait 
                 accompli, it also thereby dodges the question of <emph>how</emph> she attains a prerogative over 
                 thought in the first place—and at whose expense. Even as Wollstonecraft shares in the wrongs of 
                 women, she is the beneficiary of a division of intellectual labor that secures her monopoly over 
                 thought. The form of the philosophical text does not redistribute the authority to speak and the right 
                 to be heard; it leaves Rancière’s “partition of the sensible” intact—which is perhaps why 
                 Wollstonecraft, in her late political writings, turns to the novel to express the nature of these 
                 wrongs. Even as Rancière’s titular philosopher arrogates the right to speak for and about 
                 <emph>his</emph> poor, so too does Wollstonecraft assume a proprietary position of exteriority 
                 vis-à-vis <emph>her</emph> poor: the disenfranchised women whose rights she asserts.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">The uneasy relation Wollstonecraft takes to “the poor” on whose behalf she 
                     (intermittently) speaks is evident in her pronoun usage throughout the <title 
                         level="m">Vindication</title>, where she shifts from the first person “I” to an inclusive 
                     “we” to a third-person characterization of women. If at times she identifies herself as a woman 
                     (“my own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures”), at others she 
                     separates herself from the disenfranchised category of “woman” she claims to represent (“I do 
                     not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves”) (<title level="m">VRW</title> 
                     75, 131). The economically impoverished—the literal rather than the metaphorical poor—are 
                     described by Wollstonecraft in the third person, typically en masse as the collective poor. 
                     Wollstonecraft’s philosophical voice thus claims a monopoly on discourse, reinscribing the 
                     fundamental political wrong that excludes the non-part from its rightful place.</note> The 
                 exclusions that secure philosophical freedom through the subordination of others haunt 
                 Wollstonecraft’s text, leaving the fate of “her” poor—and the prerogatives they might claim beyond 
                 the rights and duties Wollstonecraft stakes out—an open question.</p>
