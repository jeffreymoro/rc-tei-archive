               “Latin America’s 'Chiaroscuro' Byron”
               explores the ways in which Latin America and English Romanticism clashed and overlapped
               during the nineteenth century in their portrayals of Lord Byron. Offering a glimpse
               into the fervid Byromania spreading among young intellectuals in the Southern Cone,
               this essay traces how Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the
               novelist José Mármol and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvarez de Azevedo.
               Ultimately, Byron’s image was viewed in Latin America through a diversifying chiaroscuro
               effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was luminous and ethereal, but Brazil’s Byron was
               dark and brooding. But this influence exerted by Byron was not unidirectional. The
               essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar served as an inspiration
               for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p>

               <p>In this essay we intend to edge towards an understanding of the ways in which Latin
                  America and English Romanticism—as epitomized by its most influential figure, Lord
                  Byron (1788–1824)—clashed and overlapped during the long nineteenth century. This
                  coming-together took a variety of forms: Lord Byron for example, had a profound influence
                  on a number of nineteenth-century Latin American writers, including the Argentine
                  novelist, José Mármol (1818–1871) who has a scene in his novel, <em>Amalia</em> (1851), based on the reading of Byron’s poems, and the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio
                  Álvares de Azevedo (1831–1852) whose work exudes Byromania. But the influence was
                  not only one way. In the concluding section of our essay, we point to how the celebrated
                  figure of Latin America’s independence, Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), encouraged Byron
                  in his pursuit of not only literary but also political freedom.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is well-known that Byron’s reputation abroad often eclipsed his stature in his
                     homeland, where his morality was rejected by many as “questionable”—he was accused
                     of sodomy while at school in Harrow, at university in Cambridge, and in the Mediterranean
                     while completing his Grand Tour, and of committing incest with his half-sister, Augusta
                     Leigh—and for this reason Dean Ireland refused to accept his body for burial in Westminster
                     Abbey when it arrived from Greece in the spring of 1824.

                     </div> Seen as a hero in Greece, as a result of his struggles on behalf of Greek independence
                     in the early 1820s (Trayiannoudi), Byron was also admired as the principal figure
                     of Romanticism in a number of European countries, including France (Wilkes and Cochran),
                     Switzerland (Giddey), Italy (Zuccato and Iamartino), Spain (Flitter and Cardwell),
                     Portugal (Machado de Souza), Romania (Anghelescu), Germany (Pointner &amp; Geisenhanslüke),
                     Holland (D’haen), the Czech Republic (Procházka), Poland (Modrzewska), Hungary (Rákai),
                     Russia (Diakonova &amp; Vatsuro), Bulgaria (Kostadinova), Denmark (Nielsen), Norway (Tysdahl),
                     Sweden (Elam), Armenia (Bekaryan), Georgia (Merabishvili) and Turkey (Demata). One
                     of the aims of this essay is to provide some sense of the influence created in Latin
                     America by Byron to complement Richard’s Cardwell two-volume study of <em>The Reception of Byron in Europe</em> (2004). In Europe, as Cardwell suggests, Byron represented a “counterweight to the
                     political aims of Europe’s rulers in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era” (
                     “Introduction”
                      1); he stood for “the struggle for the liberty of oppressed peoples and the struggle
                     to define a new artistic language for the expression of that desire for freedom, social
                     and individual” (
                     “Introduction”
                      1–2). To quote Cardwell once more, each recipient of Byron “adopted and adapted Byron
                     to their needs; each individual writer employed Byron as a mirror to his own personal
                     obsessions. Each nation used him to create their own literary history” (
                     “Introduction”
                      4). While no country in Latin America experienced Byromania as intensely as Spain
                     did through the person of José de Espronceda (Churchman; Pujals; Flitter 138–41),
                     Byron’s ideas, particularly his “revolt against Christian and rationalist belief”
                     (Cardwell, 
                     “Introduction”
                      2), had a definitive impact on various Latin American countries, and he became an
                     icon standing for political as well as artistic freedom. That impact was not experienced,
                     though, in a uniform way across Latin America; while Argentina’s Byron was luminous
                     and ethereal, Brazil’s was dark and brooding. This was part and parcel, as we shall
                     see, of Byron’s “chiaroscuro” effect in Latin America.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Indeed, on one specific count, Latin America’s Byron was sharply distinct from the
                     European prototype. As we explore in the third section of this essay, Byron not only
                     produced a concrete impact on writers across Latin America, he was also himself influenced
                     in a number of crucial ways by one of Latin America’s most iconic figures, Simón Bolívar.
                     This fact allows us to argue, as far as one of the iconic figures of English Romanticism
                     is concerned, that Latin America was not simply a receptor of the “obliterating glare
                     of Byronic light” (Barton 291),

                     ideas and new activities. The pendulum swinging between English Romanticism (as typified
                     by Byron) and Latin America led to a chiaroscuro effect in which Latin America reflected
                     back as much as it soaked up the “brilliance” and “light” emanating from England’s
                     Romanticism.

                  <p>Though it is generally conceded that the two most important national forms of Romanticism
                     that impacted Latin America were French (mainly in Río de la Plata) and Spanish Romanticism
                     (above all in Mexico, Peru and Colombia; Carilla I: 42–45), English Romantic writers
                     were also influential in Latin America. Carilla provides us with a list of the European
                     writers who had the greatest impact in Spanish America in the Romantic period, and
                     Byron—along with Walter Scott—is on that list.

                     </div> We find some clear evidence of the esteem in which Byron’s work was held in Argentina,
                     for example, in Part III, Chapter VIII of José Mármol’s novel <em>Amalia</em> (1851), entitled 
                     “Preámbulo de un drama.”
                      The main drama portrayed in Mármol’s novel is the struggle between the “Unitarios”
                     and the “Federales” which tore Argentina apart in the years immediately following
                     Argentina’s independence. The “Federales” were backed by the dictator José Manuel
                     Rosas, and the Unitarian faction favored establishing and enhancing links with Europe
                     in commercial as well as cultural terms, and <em>Amalia</em> was a book that fiercely defended the position of the Unitarian camp. Little surprise,
                     therefore, that at one juncture in the novel, the 
                     “Preamble of a Drama,”
                      we see the two main Unitarian protagonists, Amalia and Eduardo, who are Romantic lovers,
                     enraptured in their reading and translation of Byron’s poetry: <span class="quote">‘Eran las cinco de una tarde fría y nebulosa, y al lado de la chimenea, sentado en
                        un pequeño taburete a los pies de Amalia, Eduardo le traducía uno de los más bellos
                        pasajes del <em>Manfredo</em>, de Byron; y Amalia, reclinado su brazo sobre el hombre de Eduardo y rozando con
                        sus rizos de seda su alta y pálida frente, lo oía, enajenada, más por la que llegaba
                        hasta su corazón, que por los bellos raptos de la imaginación del poeta; y de cuando
                        en cuando Eduardo levantaba su cabeza para buscar en los ojos de su Amalia un raudal
                        mayor de poesía que el que brotaban los pensamientos del águila de los poetas del
                        siglo XIX. (Mármol 199)’</span> A number of points deserve mentioning about this scene. The excerpt suggests that
                     the musings of Byron’s imagination had transfused Latin America’s Romantic imagination,
                     normalizing the integration of his <em>Manfred</em> in an Argentine setting. Eduardo is depicted as translating <em>Manfred</em> for Amalia, and Amalia is “enajenada” (“deranged,” lit. “out of herself”) as a result
                     of listening to the “raptures” of the poet’s imagination. Byron is here seen as an
                     icon offering access to authentic Romantic love, since Eduardo uses his recitation
                     of Byron’s poetry as a pathway to finding a source of poetry that is even deeper than
                     Byron’s poetry—within Amalia’s eyes. The esteem in which Byron was held in Argentina
                     is suggested by the fact that he is described in this passage as “the eagle of nineteenth-century
                     poets.” Byron’s work could be co-opted into a political project. For, while Amalia
                     and Eduardo love poetry, their main aim is to destroy Rosas and, as the novel demonstrates,
                     it is a political struggle in which they will one day lose their lives.</p>

                  <p>Further indication of the importance of Byron’s work in the Unitarian literary circles
                     of Buenos Aires is the following scene in which their accomplice, Daniel, arrives

                        <p class="noCount">“Ah, Byron! Eso no tomaba café, por la razón de que era la bebida favorita de Napoleón;
                           porque has de saber, mi Amalia, que Byron no aborrecía a Napoleón, pero tenía celos
                           de su gloria, por cuanto sabía el taimado inglés que con él y con Napoleón debían
                           morir las dos grandes glorias de su siglo, y con toda su alma hubiese querido que

                     </blockquote> That Napoleon and Byron are portrayed as tripping simultaneously off Daniel’s tongue
                     as—between them—the “two great glories of their century” points once more to the lofty
                     esteem that Byron’s work enjoyed in Argentina’s literary circles throughout the nineteenth
                     century. As we see, Byron’s impact in Latin America elicited political as well as
                     literary structures of feeling.</p>

                        tinha por destino inexorável copiar ou traduzir o bardo inglês. . . . Assim é que
                        nunca passei de algumas peças ligeiras, das quais não me figurava herói e nem mesmo
                        autor, pois me divertia escrevê-las com o nome de Byron, Hugo, ou Lamartine nas paredes
                        do meu aposento à Rua de Santa Teresa. . . . Era um desacato aos ilustres poetas atribuir-lhes
                        versos de confecção minha. . . Que satisfação não íntima não tive eu, quando um estudante
                        . . . releu com entusiasmo uma dessas poesias, seduzido sem dúvida pelo nome do pseudo-autor.
                        (Qtd. in Magalhães Júnior 39) ’</span> The members, for example, of the Epicurus Society had a penchant for Byron-inspired
                     and alcohol-fuelled sessions involving desecration in graveyards, black magic, Satanism,
                     and orgies lasting a fortnight (Freire 26–50; Magalhães Júnior 45–54), and the most
                     prominent Byromaniac of all was Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo. The critic Ronald
                     de Carvalho once called Álvares de Azevedo’s poetry “Byronesque” (“byroniana”; Pacheco
                     Jordão 3) and the name stuck. While studying at the Colégio Pedro II, Álvares de Azevedo
                     read the great names of the European Romantic movement—the likes of <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_de_Musset">Alfred de Musset</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_de_Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>—but Byron was his idol. He translated <em>Parisina</em> into Portuguese and, in much of his poetry, he takes on Byron’s persona.

                     </blockquote> The Brazilian poet, as this poem demonstrates, used Byron as a poetic lens through
                     which he could survey his life, his emotions and the inhabitants of São Paolo. This
                     type of bracketing of his experience within, as it were, Byron’s algorithm is also
                     evident in Álvares de Azevedo’s frequent use of quotations drawn from Byron’s work
                     as epigraphs for his poems (see Álvares de Azevedo 171, 233, 279, 319, 328, 390, 396,
                     412, 419, 450). He was clearly obsessed with Byron, referring to him on numerous occasions
                     in his Speech of Acceptance into Brazil’s Academic Society given on 9 May 1850 (Álvares
                     de Azevedo 760–66), and he even at one stage began writing letters in English to his
                     Portuguese-speaking mother (Álvares de Azevedo 775–76; 
                     “My Cousin Inácio has been very bad with a gathering in his ear and has had leeches
                     applied”
                      776). For Álvares de Azevedo, “Byron, sob seu manto negro de Don Juan, guardava no
                     peito uma chaga dorida e funda” (Álvares de Azevedo 700). In his citation, bracketing
                     and re-working of Byron’s work, Álvares de Azevedo focused on the gloomy, gothic and
                     satanic side of the great English Romantic at the expense of that lighter side which
                     had attracted Argentine readers.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Bolívar and Byron</span></h2>
               <p>Simón Bolívar never met Lord Byron but there were enough similarities in their lives
                  to justify comparison. Their dates almost overlap—their respective birth-dates differing
                  by five years (Bolívar was the older) and their deaths by just six years (Byron died
                  in 1824, Bolívar in 1830)—and both were seen by their contemporaries as great men
                  of their time. Unlike Byron, who gained his fame as one of the leading lights of English
                  Romanticism, Bolívar forged his career as a soldier and a politician, and he single-handedly
                  liberated half of the Sub-Continent of South America. In 1815, he published <em>La carta de Jamaica</em> (<em>The Jamaican Letter</em>) which eloquently made the case for Spanish America’s Independence from Spain. In
                  the summer of 1816, Bolívar declared the freedom of slaves in the Americas (Lynch
                  109). The Congress of Angostura held in February 1819 solidified Bolívar’s place as
                  supreme leader of the new Republic of Venezuela (Bushnell, <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 96), while his decisive victory against Spain’s royalist troops at Boyacá in August
                  1819 led to the Independence of New Granada and the creation of Colombia (Bushnell,
                  <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 108–11). Bolívar was committed to the independence as well as union of the newly-formed
                  states of Spanish America, and—while it was still unpopular to do so in many parts
                  of the Sub-Continent—he was unconditionally opposed to the existence of slavery and
                  racism in the New World. He explicitly rejected the use of race as a divide among
                  the different populations from which he sought to forge one unified nation (see Aguilar
                  Rivera). But for all his idealism, Bolívar was a pragmatist, and he knew his dreams
                  would be hard to achieve. As he pointed out in <em>La carta de Jamaica</em>: <span class="quote">‘No somos indios ni europeos, sino una especie media entre los legítimos propietarios
                     del país y los usrpadores españoles; en suma, siendo nosotros amerianos por nacimiento
                     y nuestros derechos los de Europa, tenemos que disputar éstos a los del país y que
                     mantenernos en él contra la invasión de los invasores; así nos hallamos en el caso
                     más extroardinario y complicado. (Bolívar 46) ’</span> Self-determination and a mixed population went hand in glove in Bolívar’s proposed
                  blueprint for an independent and free nation. The great Venezuelan leader “proposed
                  a unitary state, with a life-president and a system of indirect election of some officials,”
                  characterized by a “moral power” which would be exercised by censors who would “oversee
                  the operation of the school system, the behavior of individuals, the protection of
                  the constitution, and the rights of the people” (Fitzgerald 8). One striking feature
                  of Bolívar’s proposed system was that he “felt that England should ally itself with
                  the Spanish-American countries” (Fitzgerald 8). Indeed, it was no secret that Bolívar
                  admired British parliamentarianism (Bushnell, 
                  “Introduction”
                  xlii), and this would have caught the eye of a Member of the House of Lords, as Byron
                  was at this time. Indeed, from a young age, Byron had been intent on a career in politics
                  with poetry initially being only a secondary interest. In the first speech he gave
                  to the House of Lords, in 1812, he expressed his opposition to the heavy hand of social
                  control by arguing against the bill calling for the punishment by death of “Luddites”
                  who were destroying industrial machinery; his belief in freedom even at the expense
                  of the authority of the State and the Church was unusual for the time.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Perhaps even more significant, Bolívar and Byron could both trace back their political
                     awakening to an admiration of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was during the period 1804–1806
                     that Bolívar, living in Europe at the time, experienced a political awakening that
                     was caused by Napoleon’s ascension to power (Lynch 24–25; 44–45).

                     misery” (Blackstone 187)—is fused with the poem’s narrator, for the despair oozing
                     from his is “our” despair. Byron sympathized with Napoleon as the tragic hero and
                     saw in him a version of the complicated syntax of his own life.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As his biographer Bernard Blackstone points outs, Byron, by the end of 1819—that is,
                     precisely when Bolívar’s star was rising in the New World—was growing tired of his
                     life in Europe (“an outworn portion of the globe,” as he called it), and, by October
                     1819, he was actively making plans to emigrate to Venezuela (Blackstone 308). As Byron
                     wrote in a letter to John Cam Hobhouse from Venice, dated October 3, 1819: <span class="quote">‘My South American project, of which I believe I spoke to you (as you mention it)—was
                        this. I perceived by the enclosed paragraphs [newspaper cuttings] that advantageous
                        offers were—or are to be held out to settlers in the Venezuela territory. My affairs
                        in England are nearly settled or in prospect of settlement; in Italy I have no debts,
                        and I could leave it when I choose. The Anglo-Americans are a little too coarse for
                        me, and their climate too cold, and I should prefer the others. I could soon grapple
                        with the Spanish language. Ellice or others would get me letters to Bolivar and his
                        government, and if men of little, or no property are encouraged there, surely with
                        present income, and—if I could sell Rochdale—with some capital, I might be suffered
                        as a landholder there, or at least a tenant, and if possible, and legal—a Citizen.
                        I wish you would speak to <em>Perry of the M[orning] C[hronicle]</em>—who is their Gazetteer—about this, and ask like Jeremy Diddler—not for eighteen pence—but
                        information on the subject. I assure you that I am very <em>serious</em> in the idea, and that the notion has been about me for a long time, as you will see
                        by the worn state of the advertisement. I should go there with my natural daughter,
                        Allegra—now nearly three years old, and with me here,—and pitch my tent for good and
                        all. (Howarth 275–76)’</span> Byron was clearly excited by the news arriving from the New World about Bolívar’s
                     adventures, and it is fitting, therefore, that he should have named an instrument
                     of his own adventures after the great Venezuelan. In January 1822, Byron found himself
                     in northern Italy with a fellow Englishman, Shelley, and they decided that they would
                     each buy a boat to entertain themselves in between writing their poetic works.

                     </div> Ernest Hartley Coleridge takes up the story for us: <span class="quote">‘At the beginning of the New Year, Byron and Shelley turned their thoughts to the sea.
                        Two of the Pisa friends, Trelawny and Williams, were accomplished seamen, and, acting
                        on their advice and recommendation, Byron commissioned a certain Captain Roberts,
                        who was an authority on boat-building, to build an open boat for Shelley, and large
                        decked one for his own use. In due course, a schooner, the <em>Bolivar</em>, was built for Byron, and Shelley was provided with a boat thirty feet long, which
                        Trelawny christened <em>Don Juan</em>, but the owner insisted on re-naming the <em>Ariel</em>. To be near, Shelley had taken a villa on the Gulf of Spezia. (Hartley Coleridge
                        xlvi)’</span> In January 1822—when Byron named his boat after Bolívar—the Venezuelan was already
                     planning his next decisive attack on Quito (Bushnell, <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 124–26), from where, once consolidated, he would then strike at the heart of Spain’s
                     control-post in Latin America, Lima.

                              de San Martín, and had in effect banished him from future influence in the liberation
                              of Spanish America (Lynch 172–75). And, then, on December 1824 Bolívar’s troops, at
                              the Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru’s principal Andean city, had defeated Spain’s royalist
                              army, leading to the unconditional surrender of all of Spain’s forces in Peru and
                              Upper Peru, and thereby made Spanish America free from Spain’s control (Lynch 193–95).
                              In August 1825 a new country was created, and named after Bolívar, Bolivia (Lynch

                     </div> Byron had expressed admiration for other freedom causes in the past—he once sympathized
                     with France’s cause, as expressed in Napoleon Bonaparte’s ambitions, as mentioned
                     above, and he had expressed support for Italian freedom by supporting the Carbonari
                     (Blackstone 309)—but it was Bolívar’s fight for independence, its temerity and the
                     seeming hopelessness of the quest, that struck a chord in Byron’s soul.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Byron’s decision to buy a boat along with Shelley was, as it turned out, an ill-fated
                  event—on July 7, 1822 Shelley drowned in a tragic accident while sailing in the <em>Ariel</em> with Williams in the Gulf of Spezia. The bodies of Shelley and Williams were discovered
                  not far from the beach at Viareggio, and Byron and his companion, Leigh Hunt, decided
                  to conduct a proper funeral for them on the lake-shore (Hartley Coleridge xlvi–xlvii).
                  As Byron wrote in a letter to Moore dated August 27, 1822: <span class="quote">‘We have been burning the bodies of Shelley and Williams on the sea-shore, to render
                     them fit for removal and regular interment. You can have no idea what an extraordinary
                     effect such a funeral pile has on a desolate shore, with mountains in the back-ground
                     and the sea before, and the singular appearance the salt and frankincense gave to
                     the flame. All of Shelley was consumed except his <em>heart</em>, which would not take the flame, and is now preserved in spirits of wine. (Barzun
                     235)’</span> Byron even swam out to see his own boat, the <em>Bolivar</em>, which was moored nearby to the beach while Shelley’s body was being consumed by
                  the flames: “The other day at Viareggio, I thought proper to swim off to my schooner
                  (the Bolivar) in the offing, and thence to shore again—about three miles, or better,
                  in all” (Barzun 234). Byron appears to have experienced extreme and contradictory
                  emotions as a result of Shelley’s untimely death, and, perhaps understandably, Shelley
                  became something of a “troubling presence” in the collection of poems Byron was composing
                  at that time, <em>Don Juan</em> (Bloom 24).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is surely no coincidence that Byron decided—just fourteen months after naming his
                     boat the <em>Bolivar</em>—to embrace the cause of Greek Independence and journey to Greece in order to save
                     it from tyranny. Byron had been contacted by the “Greek Committee,” based in London
                     and consisting of Jeremy Bentham, Lord Erskine, Sir James Mackintosh, and J.C. Hobhouse,
                     and unanimously made a member of that committee which was fighting on behalf of Greece’s
                     Independence.

                     </div> The vote occurred on March 14, 1822, and, as Byron suggested to Thomas Moore in a
                     letter dated August 27, 1822: “I had, and still have, thoughts of South America, but
                     am fluctuating between it and Greece. I should have gone, long ago, to one of them,
                     but for my liaison with the Countess G.; for love, in these days, is little compatible
                     with glory” (Barzun). The important point to be drawn from this extract is that Byron
                     saw South America and Greece, in the summer of 1822, as offering alternative routes
                     to a similar end.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By the end of the summer, as he told Trelawny, Byron was “at last determined to go
                  to Greece” (Hartley Coleridge li). He subsequently sold the <em>Bolivar</em> and he bought a bigger ship, the <em>Hercules</em>. He then sailed to the west coast of Cephalonia, recruited a small army, and initiated
                  high-level diplomatic negotiations in preparation for an attack on the mainland. As
                  Byron informed J.C. Hobhouse, in a letter dated April 7, 1823, he had “even offered
                  to go up to the Levant in July, if the Greek provisional government think that I could
                  be of any use” (Barzun 240). As he wrote to Augusta Leigh on October 12, 1823: <span class="quote">‘You ask me why I came up amongst the Greeks? It was stated to me that my so doing
                     might tend to their advantage in some measure in their present struggle for independence,
                     both as an individual and as a member for the Committee now in England. How far this
                     may be realized I cannot pretend to anticipate, but I am willing to do what I can.
                     (Barzun 250) ’</span> It was while Byron was getting ready for the attack that, as so often in his life,
                  he turned to his poetry as an outlet for mulling over his actions. And thus we find
                  that, even while he was bent on liberating Greece, Bolívar was still in his thoughts.
                  Byron began <em>The Age of Bronze</em> in December 1822 and he finished it on January 10, 1823, and in this collection of
                  poems the Liberator is portrayed as a modern-day titan, part of the political thunder
                  and lightning that created freedom in the New World, emerging first in the Northern
                  hemisphere and then spreading to the Sub-Continent: </p>

               <p> The important point here, as far as Byron was concerned, was that the recently founded

               <p> Clearly the example of the liberation of the New World was inspirational for Byron
                  in those crucial years from 1819 onwards when he was contemplating how to implement
                  greater freedom in the world. Though Bolívar was not a major figure in Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em>, nevertheless the political rebellion of Peru is recalled: Cadiz is described as
                  the “mart of the colonial trade (…) before Peru learned to rebel” (<em>Don Juan</em>, Canto II, Chapter V; Hartley Coleridge 805).</p>
               <p>With the benefit of hindsight we can see Byron’s mission to liberate Greece as doomed
                  from the start, for Byron was attempting to re-create Bolívar’s “criollo”-backed independence
                  movement in a diametrically opposed political environment. Byron’s journey to Greece
                  in 1823 is redolent in a sense of Che Guevara’s ill-fated mission to Bolivia in 1967,
                  which sought to make the Revolution happen in a place it couldn’t happen. As the letters
                  penned during this period demonstrate, Byron was having all sorts of problems in Messalonghi,
                  including dealing with internal dissension among the Greek factions, bouts of illness
                  (apoplexy or epilepsy), enormous debts, earthquakes, and narrow escapes from the Turks
                  (Howarth 456–61). Before he had even mustered sufficient forces to launch an attack
                  on the mainland, Byron was struck down by fever, and he died off the shores of Greece
                  on April 19, 1824. As Hartley Coleridge notes: “The Greeks were heartbroken at the
                  death of their hero” (Hartley Coleridge lv). To this day, Greeks see Byron’s death
                  as a personal tragedy for the Greek nation (Trayiannoudi).</p>
               <p>Byron’s relationship with the world outside the British Isles, as portrayed in the
                  excellent two-volume book on <em>The Reception of Byron in Europe</em> (ed. Richard Cardwell), demonstrates how Byronism took on “local colors” in different
                  parts of the world. Our own study of Latin America’s Byron has investigated a similar
                  range of receptivities to Byromania in different countries—ranging from the brooding
                  and dark Byron in Brazil to the ethereal and uplifting one in Argentina—but it has
                  also uncovered something unique about the relationship between Byron and Latin America,
                  namely, that his “light” travelled not, as elsewhere, as if obeying a one-way system
                  but that it produced a “chiaroscuro” effect when it arrived in Latin America. The
                  Latin American prism was suddenly transformed into a mirror capable of bouncing Byron’s
                  light back to its source. Bolívar’s military as well as political successes, as noted
                  above, clearly had an impact on Byron between 1819 and his premature death in 1824;
                  these events persuaded the great English poet to grasp the nettle of the independence
                  movement in Greece, lay down his pen, and take up his sword. It was not all in vain,
                  though, for those “whom the Gods love die young” (<em>Don Juan</em>, Canto IV, Chapter IV; Hartley Coleridge 844).</p>

               de San Martín, and had in effect banished him from future influence in the liberation
               of Spanish America (Lynch 172–75). And, then, on December 1824 Bolívar’s troops, at
               the Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru’s principal Andean city, had defeated Spain’s royalist
               army, leading to the unconditional surrender of all of Spain’s forces in Peru and
               Upper Peru, and thereby made Spanish America free from Spain’s control (Lynch 193–95).
               In August 1825 a new country was created, and named after Bolívar, Bolivia (Lynch
