            <p class="noCount">It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of English Romanticism. However,
               authors from Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo to Julio Cortázar have innovatively
               transformed the works of the British Romantics through purposeful misreadings and
               adaptations, forging links of aesthetic closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate
               for their chronological and geographical separation. The transformations of Byron,
               Shelley, and Keats by Hispanophone and Lusophone writers are marked by authority,
               whimsy, and adventure, often evoking a sense of playful irreverence. Afterlives from
               these perspectives help to decenter the Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study, helping
               to mitigate the exclusivity of a field that centers an entire literary and cultural
               universe within a span of fifty years on the British Isles. In essays by Stephen and
               Jordan Hart, Juan Jesús Payan, Omar Miranda, Gabriel Insausti, Marco Ramírez Rojas,
               and Olivia Loksing Moy, one common strand that emerges is how these authors confront
               questions of cultural marginality and belatedness. The various transformations of
               the major British Romantic poets studied in these contributions conjure up new figures
               with which to populate our familiar canon: an alternately dour or ethereal Byron (Mármol
               / Antônio Álvares de Azevedo); a more pragmatic Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and
               virile Keats (Cortázar).</p>

               <p>In 1886, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo composed an invocation to Byron in Portuguese,
                  posing the fashionable English lord as his muse. Byromania had spread amongst the
                  literary coteries of Brazil, where, “at the University of São Paolo, everyone wanted
                  to be like Byron” (Stephen and Jordan Hart, 
                  “Latin America’s Byron”
                  ). In the 1940s, while in exile in Cambridge during the Spanish Civil War, Luis Cernuda
                  looked to Percy Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1840) to better understand his own role in society as a poet, questioning how he
                  might alleviate the suffering of man in the practical world. In 1972, Jorge Luis Borges
                  sang to Keats in a sonnet invoking his Grecian urn, echoing the song of the nightingale
                  from Keats’s 1819 ode.</p>
               <p>It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of English Romanticism. Despite
                  the long and influential relations between the British Empire and the countries of
                  South and Central America, it is surprising that instead of multiple cultural bridges,
                  there appear only a few scattered paths linking Romantic writers to the Latin American
                  intellectual tradition. England not only played a fundamental role in the independence
                  of countries like Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, but also exerted a fundamental
                  influence in the process of industrialization and modernization throughout the continent,
                  including certain territories in Brazil. Throughout the nineteenth century, railroads
                  in Latin America were built by British companies, industries were created under the
                  supervision and much to the profit of English investors, and market networks were
                  developed to facilitate the circulation of capital across the Atlantic. Similarly,
                  waves of immigration brought considerable numbers of British citizens to settle in
                  major developing cities, as well as in rural areas that needed to be industrially
                  developed. How is it possible, then, that this tremendous economic, social, and political
                  impact was not readily reflected in the Luso-Hispanic literary productions of the
                  time?</p>
               <p>In this volume, we examine a selection of prominent writers and works framed within
                  the lines of British-Luso-Hispanic dialogues. In the essays that follow, Romanticist
                  and Hispanophone scholars trace the reception of the British Romantics in Latin America
                  and Spain through circulation, translation, and adaptation. Each of these studies
                  highlights major obstacles that have historically impeded the transmission of English
                  Romantic works into a language that is, for historical and geographic reasons, a very
                  important neighbor. In many cases, the research offered by the scholars here exposes
                  a surprising dearth in transmission—a paucity of references, or the surprisingly late
                  date of published translations. They also challenge the assumption that Latin American
                  nations would automatically identify with Romantic revolutionary ideals, superimposing
                  these upon their own political contexts and paving the way for plentiful adaptations.
                  Hispanophone authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries do not necessarily
                  adopt a tone of identification with English cultural or political paradigms, but,
                  rather, engage in critical readings and creative adaptations. Despite these rich connections,
                  the historical trajectory for Latin American afterlives of the English Romantics is
                  one of surprising scarcity and belatedness. This collection aims to recuperate some
                  of the research, long overdue, along this line of transatlantic and translinguistic
                  conversation.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Comparative Romanticist studies have long privileged the languages of German, French,
                     and Italian. British Romanticism’s indebtedness to German philosophy, literature,
                     and art has yielded a dominant stronghold within the field; the historical impetus
                     of the French Revolution has made French an essential area for serious comparativist
                     work; while Shelley’s and Keats’s years in Rome have established a strong Italian
                     connection.

                              French, and Japanese. But of the major European languages, Spanish has received the
                              least critical attention in reception studies.</span></div>
                     </div> Yet the critical history of the Romantics’ reception in Spanish, both in Europe and
                     in Latin America, has not garnered serious critical attention until the last decade.
                     Gabriel Insausti attributes this partly to the fact that “Spanish Romanticism had
                     historically been very weak and had not left behind any noteworthy poet,” throwing
                     Spanish writers into a condition of a “sort of late-yielding fruit” (
                     “Toward Unity”
                     ). This volume investigates the afterlives of British Romantic poets in the Hispanophone
                     world with an emphasis on Latin American authors. Reframing the outdated model of
                     a European center and a New World periphery, we ask the following questions: To what
                     extent has translation shaped or impeded the dissemination of otherwise global Romantic
                     texts throughout countries like Argentina, Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela? How do Latin
                     American reinterpretations of Romantic texts assume or elide the colonial burdens
                     of influence from English works, as compared to those imposed by continental Spanish
                     texts? How do Latin American writers negotiate their position in relation to a European
                     literary and cultural canon? And in what ways do these Anglo-Latino interactions differ
                     from those recently explored in transatlantic studies, of North America, the West
                     Indies and the Black Atlantic?</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Major critical advances tracing Hispanophone connections to British Romanticism have
                     been spearheaded by Joselyn Almeida-Beveridge, whose <em>Reimagining the Transatlantic, 1780–1890</em> (Ashgate 2011) identifies the pan-Atlantic as an integral force in Britain during
                     the Age of the Revolutions. The pan-Atlantic, a public sphere of exchange, prominently
                     shaped the shared political ideals of Britain, Africa, and the non-Anglophone Americas
                     in mutual ways, with Spain and Latin American forces influencing English Romantic
                     ideals of humanity, nation, and freedom. Almeida-Beveridge’s 2010 collection of essays, <em>Romanticism and the Anglo-Hispanic Imaginary</em>, reveals the continued presence of South and Central American culture within the
                     British canon and the English literary imagination, particularly in the context of
                     the Peninsular War and the Wars of Latin American Independence. These studies chart
                     the dialogues of Latin American and Spanish intellectuals that took place in British
                     territory during the crucial years of Latin American independence movements.

                     fighters like Thomas Cochrane, whose active revolutionary role left an impact on Chile,
                     Peru, Brazil, and Colombia (Fulford, 
                     “El diablo and El Ángel del Cielo”

                     writings, with studies tracing the valorization of Spain within the English cultural
                     imagination. These essays map the influence of exilic figures like Joseph Blanco White
                     and Valentín de Llanos, also locating representations of Spain within specific literary
                     traditions, including Gothic fiction and Romantic women’s writing.

               <p>This volume traces such influences but in the opposite direction, often working through
                  lines of transmission in Spain but focusing primarily on authors from Latin America.
                  We explore how Hispanophone writers received, reworked, and incorporated the works
                  of the English poets into their own literary traditions. Often, these authors faced
                  a linguistic barrier, immersing themselves in British literature while improving their
                  English language skills through work as translators. The essays we have included analyze
                  how Anglophone Romantic sources have been read, questioned, and adapted to their own
                  local realities. Building upon Almeida-Beveridge’s and Saglia and Haywood’s collections
                  that explore eighteenth- and nineteenth-century exchanges, we investigate how these
                  interactions extend through the twentieth century and recalibrate the cultural balance
                  between the Hispanic and the Anglophone spheres.</p>
               <p>Featuring paired essays on Byron, Shelley, and Keats, we trace afterlives anchored
                  around the three major second-generation poets. Their points of connection with the
                  Luso-Hispanic world are prominent writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
                  whose intellectual curiosity and cosmopolitanism bridge the British Isles with Central
                  and South America, as well as with Spain. The following studies compose a collection
                  of echoes, reflections, and translations of the English Romantics in Spanish and Portuguese.
                  The works of José Marmol, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, Martín Zapata, Luis Cernuda,
                  Alejo Carpentier, Jorge Luis Borges, and Julio Cortázar constitute the tiles of this
                  multicolored mosaic.</p>
               <p>Given the historical asymmetry of the political and historical relations between Spain,
                  Latin America, and the British Empire, one common strand that emerges among the articles
                  is how these authors confront questions of cultural marginality and belatedness. Contrary
                  to the assumptions of most Anglophone readers, the theme of marginality in the Latin
                  American afterlives of English Romantic writers is not necessarily one of Eurocentric
                  exclusion or rejection. The Latin American works studied in these essays are defined
                  neither by imitative idolatry nor a sense of colonial anxiety. On the contrary, they
                  present different strategies of cultural negotiation that allow them to contest assumptions
                  of subordination or respectful deference. The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and
                  Keats by Hispanophone authors are marked by authority, whimsy, and adventure, often
                  evoking a sense of playful irreverence. These authors innovatively transform the works
                  of their predecessors through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links
                  of aesthetic closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their chronological
                  separation. Major figures like Borges, Cortázar, and Carpentier also function as savvy
                  critics of the English Romantic tradition; they conscientiously position their writings
                  within two literary traditions with a full understanding of their historical, national,
                  and generic repercussions. Afterlives from these perspectives help to decenter the
                  Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study, helping to mitigate the exclusivity of a
                  field that centers an entire literary and cultural universe within a span of fifty
                  years on the British Isles. The various transformations of the major British Romantic
                  poets studied in these contributions conjure up new figures with which to populate
                  our familiar canon: an alternately dour or ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares
                  de Azevedo); a more pragmatic Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats (Cortázar).</p>
               <p>Our overdue recognition of the Latin-American reception of English Romantics comes
                  at a timely moment, particularly within the current political climate of the United
                  States, where the rhetoric is increasingly one of insular nationalism and discrimination
                  toward our Spanish-speaking neighbors. The imperative to “speak English!” and only
                  English in schools and public spaces runs counter to the Romantic spirit of openness,
                  imagination, and respect for the rights of the individual. With this volume, we wish
                  to demonstrate the obvious: that the ability to work in neighboring languages only
                  enriches our research in the academy and injects life into our Anglophone canon. Moreover,
                  the work we value and make visible through publications and teaching should recognize
                  too the fundamental role that Latin American, including Brazilian, authors played
                  in the global production of Romantic literary legacies. This rings especially true
                  when an increasingly diverse professoriate and graduate cohorts include many talented
                  bilingual scholars of Latin American descent. Beginning with the content of our research,
                  we envision an academia in which fluency in Spanish is viewed as an asset in comparative
                  Romantic studies on an equal plane with proficiency in German, French, and Italian.</p>
               <p>While developments in World Literature studies have called for a shift away from an
                  assumed Anglocentrism, made evident in manifestos such as Aamar Mufti’s <em>Forget English!</em>, we suggest that these sentiments apply, ever so counterintuitively, to the field
                  of British Romantic studies. To propose that English Romanticists might turn away
                  from English is not an unfounded proposition. As C.C. Wharram asked in his 2014 preface,
                  
                  “Objects of Translation(s),”
                  “Why do we decide in advance that ‘British’ necessarily entails the elimination of
                  all voices not originating in British and in English?” Suh-Reen Han’s <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> volume on <em>English Romanticism in East Asia</em> answers this call, extending Romantic studies to a global scale, showcasing the skills
                  of bilingual scholars who engage deeply in historical study and close readings in
                  Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. These essays help studies in “foreign” languages find
                  a home under the aegis of our discipline. Special issues of <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> and <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> on the Black Atlantic and Black Romanticism, as well as the <em>European Romantic Review</em> issue on the 
                  “Literature of Abolition,”
                  do the important postcolonial work of pushing British Romanticism into regions that
                  force recognition of the most uncomfortable corners of our literary tradition (Youngquist
                  and Pace; Youngquist and Botkin; Chander and Matthew). This courageous scholarship
                  transcends geographic, national, and racial borders with an ear bent towards historical
                  justice. It demonstrates that Romantic studies need not remain divorced from efforts
                  in modernist, Americanist, and medieval literary studies to resist an exclusive and
                  exclusionary Anglocentric impetus—that Romanticism’s privileging of the Big Six need
                  not preclude global scholarship. We now raise this challenge to scholars who might
                  combine the transatlantic <em>and</em> the translingual, encouraging multilingual researchers who can help locate the legacy
                  of Romanticism today in what used to be unforeseen pockets of the globe. This collection
                  serves as an invitation for further research into Latin American afterlives of the
                  Romantic writers, promoting the scholarship of yet undiscovered translations, adaptations,
                  and responses that will continue to expand the transatlantic canon.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">* * *</span></h2>
               <p>The first essay of the volume begins broadly and on a celebratory note, exploring
                  ideas of Romantic celebrity and the international circulation of personality in the
                  southern hemisphere. In 
                  “Latin America’s Byron,”
                  Stephen and Jordan Hart explore ways in which Latin America and English Romanticism
                  “clashed and overlapped during the nineteenth century” in their portrayals of Lord
                  Byron. They trace how Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the
                  novelist José Mármol, who recontextualized the character of Manfred in an Argentine
                  setting, and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, who projects
                  a Don Juan figure in his Portuguese poems. This study offers a glimpse into the fervid
                  Byromania spreading amongst young intellectuals in the Southern Cone. Hart and Hart
                  propose that Byron’s image was ultimately viewed in Latin America through a diversifying
                  <em>chiaroscuro</em> effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was “luminous and ethereal,” while Brazil’s Byron
                  was “dark and brooding.” But this influence exerted by Byron was not unidirectional.
                  Indeed, the essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar served as an
                  inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p>
               <p>We continue tracing Byron’s afterlives with a translation study by Juan Jesús Payán,
                  who bypasses the more obvious Hispanic connections of <em>Don Juan</em> to focus on the lingering imprint of Byron’s Gothic valences instead. 
                  “Translative Vampires: Martín Zapata and the Early Fate of <em>The Giaour</em>”
                  explores the often unfaithful translations of Byron’s <em>The Giaour</em> into Spanish, especially in light of their prosification and importation across genres.
                  Focusing on a short narrative adaptation by the Argentine writer and politician Martín
                  Zapata, Payán shows how the very choice of <em>The Giaour</em> as his source material, in the context of Argentine intellectual and political tensions,
                  was a daring statement unto itself. Comparing this to previous renderings of Byron’s
                  works into the Spanish language—both in Spain and in Latin America—Payán highlights
                  the exceptionality of Zapata’s version, pointing out that the Argentine was the first
                  to provide a direct adaptation from the original text, and also the only one to truly
                  preserve the vampiric elements of the plot. Performing a political reading, Payán
                  understands Zapata’s translation as an element of disruption that challenges the divisions
                  between “Civilization” and “Barbarism” upheld by his contemporary, Domingo Faustino
                  Sarmiento. Complicating the Orientalist paradigm because it “focalizes through the
                  perspective of the traditional Other,” <em>El Giaur</em> (sic) shows Zapata challenging the binary categorizations of good/evil, East/West,
                  and modernity/backwardness in the context of nineteenth-century Argentina.</p>
               <p>We move from translation to adaptation in Omar F. Miranda’s 
                  “<em>Prometeo Desencadenado</em>: The Translation of Percy Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in the Spanish-American Tradition.”
                  This essay unpacks the Shelleyan inspiration and thematic echoes in a well-known classic
                  by the Cuban novelist, Alejo Carpentier. In his reevaluation of <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, Miranda traces the Hispanophone afterlife of one of Shelley’s more difficult works.
                  Revivified in the postmodern imagination of Carpentier, the drama of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is recast in New York City, Caracas, and the South American jungle, combining elements
                  of mystical settings, lyric, dramatic style, and philosophic attempts at “reversing
                  human error.” This novel, written in Venezuela in 1950 and considered a precursor
                  to magical realism, is, Miranda argues, “perhaps one of the most earnest and profound
                  engagements with Shelley’s text since the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth
                  century.” This statement is supported by the relative dearth of Spanish-language receptions
                  of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, in both Spain and Latin America, which for nearly two centuries has only seen partial
                  translations and even fewer adaptations. Miranda contextualizes his analysis of <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> by turning to an article from 1922 in the radical Venezuelan newspaper <em>El Universal</em>, which commemorates the centenary of Shelley’s death. This column, written by Edouard
                  Herriot, who eventually became prime minister of France, praises <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and venerates Shelley for his “current” and “eternal” poetic ideals. Besides these
                  two homages by Herriot and Carpentier, Latin American afterlives of this closet drama
                  are sparse. Adding to the fact that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was not translated in full into Spanish until 1994, Miranda’s research reaffirms
                  the surprising belatedness of the Hispanophone reception of Shelley’s text.</p>
               <p>In the fourth essay of this volume, 
                  “Toward Unity: Cernuda and English Romanticism,”
                  Gabriel Insausti presents a capacious study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and
                  his poetic appropriation of the English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A member
                  of the Generation of '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War
                  to deliver lectures at Oxford and Cambridge; he traveled to Glasgow, Cambridge, and
                  London through 1947; and finally settled in Mexico, never to return to Spain. As an
                  exile in Scotland and England, his writing, criticism, and translations felt the influence
                  of Shakespeare, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Browning, and Eliot.
                  In his essay, Insausti pinpoints a Cernudian reading of Romanticism that raises problems
                  unique to his geographical positioning and literary historical moment: The Spanish
                  poet encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the era, negotiating
                  questions of poetry’s ethical value and pertinence during an era of modern warfare.
                  Reading <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and echoing Shelley a century later, Cernuda asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not
                  only useful,” he decides, “but also has certain social effects.” A poet and translator
                  himself, Insausti offers an encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity
                  in his own poetics, negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing
                  his Romantic interests against contemporary Modernist pressures.</p>
               <p>Our volume ends with two contributions featuring the afterlife of John Keats in Latin
                  America. Marco Ramírez Rojas focuses on the poet’s reception and critical influence
                  through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar, two great giants of Argentine
                  letters. In 
                  “Keatsians in Argentina: Borges’s Nightingale and Cortázar’s Chameleon,”
                  Ramírez argues that both writers depicted and identified Keats as a misunderstood
                  figure who needed to be rescued by their intervention. In this vein, they seek to
                  integrate Keats as a member of their own intellectual community, regarding him “not
                  as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” This focus on Argentina as a major site of
                  literary transmission for Keats is historically interesting, considering the high
                  rates of European immigration to the country in the nineteenth century and the accompanying
                  nostalgia for British literature, encouraged by a “sort of pro-British snobbery” that
                  pervaded Buenos Aires high society. Ramírez’s reading of Borges’s 1952 essay 
                  “Keats’s Nightingale”
                  stages, through a philosophical defense of Keats, a petition for appropriating Keats
                  into a Latin American space that is presented as more suitable for understanding the
                  Romantic poet. The second half of this essay explores the lengthy creative treatise
                  titled <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> by Cortázar, in which Ramírez theorizes the role of the biographer as a chameleon
                  figure. Through his deep identification and sense of camaraderie with Keats, Cortázar
                  overlaps temporalities with the poet and meets him in a shared “Latin American time”
                  with strong political implications. Cortázar’s connection to Keats emulates the ideas
                  of Negative Capability and the chameleon figure, mirroring a state of poetic annihilation
                  and self-identification.</p>
               <p>The final essay of the collection, by Olivia Loksing Moy, offers a closer look at
                  <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>, Cortázar’s literary biography from the 1950s. 
                  “To Carry Keats in Your Pocket: Julio Cortázar’s Everyman Poet”
                  explores the amphibious nature of a book that oscillates between a rigorous work of
                  criticism and a playful work of fiction that defies all traditional classifications.
                  Borrowing from Cortázar’s short fiction, Moy uses the models of playing hopscotch
                  and blowing up photos to explain the work of a poet-critic that has been rendered
                  inaccessible to scholarship due to two defining characteristics: its transtemporality
                  and generic hybridity. It is her contention that the “merging of time and epochs”
                  which brings Keats, Shelley, and Hunt together with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine
                  intellectuals is a clever strategy, proposing a defiant sense of timeless contemporaneity.
                  Building upon the two models of playing “hopscotch” and “blow-up,” drawn from the
                  titles of two of Cortázar’s most acclaimed works, Moy shows how the narrative of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> skips around from year to year, while also lingering and zooming in on key moments
                  for biographical exegesis. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for the
                  biographer to stage a direct dialogue with Keats and to personally inhabit a Romantic
                  universality, rendering the poet accessible to the Latin American “everyman.” Stylistically
                  and structurally, <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> also constitutes a novelty. Its “unprecedented merging of fictional and non-fiction
                  genres” includes the dense intertwining of poetic devices, passages of free association
                  and automatic writing, and an overarching narrative structure. For Moy, the textual
                  complexity of this biography reflects a generic hybridity that draws from two lines
                  of national influence: Romantic poetry and the Latin American surrealist short story.
                  Cortázar consciously combines these two traditions without any anxiety of influence.
                  As he both showed and stated, Latin American literature, though arriving a bit late,
                  could “burst onto the literary scene” and enter modernity “without all the baggage”
                  of European literature (<em>Literature Class</em> 31). By clarifying these aspects of transtemporality and generic hybridity, Moy clears
                  the path for further investigations of <em>Imagen</em>. Previously unavailable in English translation, excerpts of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> have now been published as a volume of Lost &amp; Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative.
                  <em>Julio y John, caminando y conversando: Selections from <em>Imagen de John Keats</em></em> (2019) was edited and translated by Moy and Rojas, who are completing a full critical
                  translation of the text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Each of the essays in this volume present a reworking of Bloomian influence that has
                     traditionally guided landmark transatlantic studies, such as Robert Weisbuch’s <em>Atlantic Double-Cross</em>. Earlier models of influence theory unwittingly undergird binaries of an original
                     and inferior copy, which in the context of artists working across lines of race and
                     nation can also reinforce racist rationales of canonicity. These essays all consider
                     binaries, but ultimately explode or complicate them: Hart and Hart’s engagement of
                     light and dark, or <em>chiaroscuro</em>; Payán’s with “Civilization and Barbarism”; Miranda’s with notions of the city and

Wharram, explores comparativist studies in German, Hebrew, French,
               and Japanese. But of the major European languages, Spanish has received the least
