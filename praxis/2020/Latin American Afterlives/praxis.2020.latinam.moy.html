            <p class="noCount">This essay explores the generic hybridity and transtemporality of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>, Julio Cortázar’s literary biography from the 1950s. An amphibious text that oscillates
               between a rigorous work of criticism and a playful work of fiction, it follows two
               lines of national influence: the Latin American surrealist short story and Romantic
               poetry. Moreover, in staging a sense of timeless contemporaneity by strategically
               merging literary-historical events, the book brings together Keats, Shelley, and Hunt
               with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine friends and intellectuals. This rippling of
               chronologies makes it possible for Cortázar to personally inhabit a Romantic universality,
               rendering Keats accessible to the Latin American “everyman.”</p>

               <p>In the 1950s, the Argentinian author Julio Cortázar (1914–1984) composed an ambitious
                  work—a “life and letters” of his favorite Romantic poet. The result was <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>, a six-hundred-page collage of Keats’s poems and letters, Cortázar’s own prose, and
                  a myriad of references to Latin American, Spanish, German, French, and British authors.
                  This little-known masterpiece covers the entirety of Keats’s adult life and works,
                  beginning with <em>Sleep and Poetry</em> and ending with his lesser-known dramas and posthumous works. Inspired by Cortázar’s
                  Spanish translation of Richard Monckton Milnes’s <em>The Life and Letters of John Keats</em>, published in Madrid in 1955, it far exceeds Lord Houghton’s efforts in its geographical
                  and generic scope.</p>
               <p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> opens with a gust of brightness and momentum, its initial sentence announcing participation
                  in the Romantic tradition by calling upon Nature, Imagination, and an Aeolian breeze:
                  “This is a Romantic book, driven by its impulse towards its theme with the focus and
                  faithfulness of a sunflower” (15). Playful and ambulatory, Cortázar’s text meanders
                  in and out of the modes of biography, literary criticism, personal essay, and artistic
                  memoir. It functions as a Keats anthology tailored for the Latin American reader,
                  as well as a collection of Cortázar’s annotated translations and original poems. The
                  methodological declarations, personal effusions, and literary references culminate
                  in what Victor Zonana terms a “generic hybrid” and the work of a “poet-critic” who,
                  rather than composing an erudite and academic study, traces the process of a poetry
                  “in the making” (57). But while it oscillates between various genres, <em>Imagen</em> is presented as one organic structure, its formidable 
                  “Table of Contents”
                  offering a roadmap for the thirteen chapters and eighty-five subsections that follow.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Published posthumously by Alfaguara in 1996, <em>Imagen</em> has garnered scant attention from Keats scholars and appears but briefly even in criticism

                     </div> The relative obscurity of such a monumental work begs the question of what has made
                     this text so inaccessible to both Anglophone and Hispanophone readers. Especially
                     given Cortázar’s recognition as a global author of the Latin American Boom movement,
                     that <em>Imagen</em> has eluded critical attention cannot solely be attributed to the fact that the work
                     has not yet been fully translated into English.

                              completing a critical English translation of Imagen de John Keats. Selected excerpts

                     </div> In addition to any language barrier, Cortázar’s text presents a difficult challenge
                     to Latin Americanists and Romanticists alike, due to its ahistorical approach and
                     its hybrid style. This essay introduces Cortázar’s <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> to unfamiliar readers by elucidating its genre and methodology. Attending to important
                     parallels between Cortázar’s and Keats’s literary circles, I then situate the work
                     within Cortázar’s own statements on the transcultural transmission of English Romantic
                     works to a Latin American audience.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is unique among Latin American afterlives of the English Romantic poets in two significant
                     ways. First, it is a truly transtemporal work, jumping timelines and collapsing eras
                     within one literary plane. Cortázar creates a dynamic field that accommodates a motley
                     crew of ancient Greek, Renaissance, Romantic, and modern Hispanophone figures. This
                     differs from typical neoromantic interactions of twentieth-century writers who might
                     simply import and repurpose familiar motifs of Wordsworth or Shelley in a postmodern
                     context. Instead, throughout <em>Imagen</em>, Cortázar inhabits the same time and locales as Keats. What we witness is a contemporaneous
                     overlapping of two literary circles: Cortázar and his fellow writers of the Boom era
                     are superimposed upon the world of Hunt, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Blake. These figures
                     intermingle in pages redolent of Cortázar’s signature style, featuring the crossing
                     of paths of a seemingly listless flaneur. While <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is one of Cortázar’s non-fiction works, its cast of characters occupies a fiction-like
                     space projected onto an epic scale. In this essay, I draw upon the imagery of playing
                     hopscotch and “blowing up” (expanding) an image—borrowed from two of Cortázar’s most
                     famous works, <em>Hopscotch</em> (1963) and 
                     “Blow-up”
                      (1967)—to explore the experimentation he employs throughout his innovative treatise
                     on Keats.

                     </div> In so doing, I seek to restore the lost reception of <em>Imagen</em> by untangling the two factors most problematic to the text’s transmission: periodization

                     “Preludes,”
                      Cortázar announces the scope of his project in teasingly lofty and legal language,
                     calling his opening a “Sworn Statement.” At other points, as in the chapter 
                     “Sleep and Poetry,”
                      he shifts into a confiding voice, assuming the mode of personal essay or of casual
                     biography. His reportage of Keats’s life in the section titled 
                     “Romanticism”
                      feels at times flippant and comical:

                              the friends: Cowden, Clarke, Haydon, Hunt, and Reynolds. For him, Hampstead (an Adrogué
                              of London) contains all of Greek mythology. Under this sky, John begins to raise the

                     </blockquote> As we see in this passage, Cortázar regards Keats with a sense of camaraderie that
                     borders upon self-identification. He speaks authoritatively and on behalf of Keats,
                     as if present throughout the poet’s early years. The reference to Adrogué, a small
                     town in the suburbs of Buenos Aires with cobble-stoned streets and town squares, familiarizes
                     the foreignness of Hampstead through analogy and geographic translation. Rather than
                     glossing an Argentinian reference for the benefit of an English audience, Cortázar
                     naturally reverses the Anglocentric orientation, catering to his ideal Latin American
                     reader. Ultimately, it is Cortázar who invites Keats for an exploratory stroll, not
                     the other way around. His physical metaphor for companionship, of walking side by
                     side, serves as a leitmotif throughout the text, proposing a relation of friendship
                     and equality rather than one of idolatry or infatuation. This becomes an enduring
                     theme in the structure, spirit, and timescale that is central to Cortázar’s treatise
                     on Keats.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Taking after Samuel Johnson’s <em>Lives of the Poets</em> in its biographical homage, and emulating the personal accounts from Hazlitt’s 
                  “My First Acquaintance with Poets,”
                  <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> incorporates personal anecdotes with stylistic critique, whether offering its cultural
                  commentary on nineteenth-century England or twentieth-century Buenos Aires. The work
                  exhibits a comfortable mastery over figures in British literature, offhandedly alluding
                  to lines of Spenser, Herbert, Wordsworth, and Coleridge as if they were close friends.
                  Cortázar’s invocation of these authors is casual but not disrespectful; he gestures
                  toward these canonical figures with disarming hospitality and a gracious informality.
                  In an intriguing balance between admiration and sauciness, Cortázar conjures up a
                  living community populated by Shelley, Byron, “John,” “Bob Burns,” George and Tom,
                  and even “Mom and Dad”: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <p class="noCount">… John was born in autumn—the 31st of October, 1795—the year and the season in which
                     Wordsworth and Coleridge met, with illustrious consequences. It was the year of the
                     guillotine in the front shores of France…[Then] another star: William Blake, a <em>nova</em> of nineteen years-old, another space of ignorance of ice cold, black air that separated
                     his light and that of Keats. And to think that, in 1795, he had already written the
                     <em>Songs of Innocence and Experience</em>. John was barely crawling when Bob Burns, drowning in alcohol and ballads, after
                     confusing immortality with a snowy night, was dying up in the north. Shelley was three
                     years old, Byron seven. What a nursery!</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">Mom and Dad were just common people. There’s an obscure side in the family life of
                     Keats that gave him such a proclivity to psychoanalysis. He comes afloat after a confusing
                     childhood, closely tied to his two brothers, George and Tom, (both of them younger
                     than him), and also to Fanny, the flip-flop of the household, who very early in his
                     life bestowed upon Keats’ a predestined name.</p> 
                  <p class="noCount">(<em>Imagen</em> 29)</p>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Here, Cortázar is at ease, mapping out the baby steps and first literary strides
                  of William Blake and Robert Burns. He converts the publication timelines of Romantic
                  literary geniuses into anecdote and caricature, pure baby stuff: “What a nursery!”
                  He inserts himself into the scene of “John’s” infancy, bearing witness by inviting
                  himself into the Keats family household and into the childhood playpens of the Big
                  Six as well. Freely working on a first-name basis, he flits in and out as a welcome
                  member of the clan with carefree familiarity. This quick movement from a grand historical
                  scale to such individual intimacy characterizes much of the lengthy book and lends
                  a dynamic rhythm to the long stretches of prose. Cortázar often zooms in at a rapid
                  pace, “blowing up” meaningful moments to notice the possibility of unrealized, fantastic
                  detail behind the mundane. This zooming in and out is an important device that breathes
                  magic into the ending of Cortázar’s surrealist short story <em>Blow-Up,</em> in which the expanded print of a camera snapshot, scrutinized in the photographer’s
                  studio after the moment of capture, reveals a chain of unforeseen possibilities and
                  traumas. It allows the past to become present, locked in a dynamic stasis and primed
                  for revelation and analysis. Such is the process of “blowing up” and developing the
                  “image” of John Keats, opening up possibilities for alternative representations of
                  the poet we thought we knew.</p>
               <p>Blowing up images allows for a mode of discovery that curates moments and transcends
                  chronological time. In his literary practice of merging times and epochs, Cortázar
                  intimately enters the Romantic past and brings the coterie of the Keats-Shelley circle
                  to life, communing with Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, Haydon, and Hunt; but he also shows
                  how these spirits have come to life in his own day. He recognizes them in the works
                  of contemporary Latin-American poets and translators, such as Ricardo Molinari, Francisco
                  Luis Bernárdez and Miguel Cané (22). In many passages, Cortázar keeps the text humming
                  with experimental punctuation and an irregular distribution of paragraphs that is
                  particularly vivacious and poetic. </p>

                     A pocket is the house for the essential and the portable for every man; you must choose

               </blockquote>
               <p> Here, we are introduced to a confluence of journalists (Cané), poets (Arrieta), politicians
                  (Roca), musicologists and literary critics (Devoto), and Classics professors (Mascialino).
                  These are the Argentine writers who sustained the bustling afterlife of Keats in 1950s
                  Buenos Aires, bonded through a common physical token of recognition: walking together,
                  carrying an “essential” edition of Keats in their pocket: “Y cuánto muchacho habrá
                  que anda con el tomito de la <em>Everyman</em> en el bosillo, para leer a John en la calle, al aire libre, bajo los parasoles verdes
                  de las plazas” (23). Referring to the Everyman’s Library Pocket Poets series, this
                  notion of a “pocket Keats” establishes the poet’s universality, accessibility, and
                  portability. Through it, Keats is available to the Latin American everyman or <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">fulano de tal</span>. It claims Keats as a working-class poet for young men living out in the world, walking
                  and reading outdoors in town squares. He is not a bust to be worshipped upon the bookshelves
                  of musty offices and libraries, alongside Coleridge and Eliot. Keats’s poems are a
                  practical necessity and an item to be used daily, palpably, by this troupe of Latin
                  American writers. Cané, Arrieta, and Devoto exist within the same chapters and street
                  corners as “John,” in Paris, Buenos Aires, Teignmouth, and Hampstead. It is this Romantic
                  element of timeless universality and ubiquity that appeals to Cortázar, more so than
                  the fractured images offered by the Modernists; it lends him a space of contemporaneity
                  and freedom. More importantly, it offers him the ability to create a unified, unbroken
                  image, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">una imagen de John Keats</span> that is singular and not plural.</p>
               <p>What happens in the final lines of the passage above is jarring: in almost cinematic
                  fashion, Cortázar draws parallels between the everyman’s daily ambles and a moment
                  of high Romantic tragedy. Through this transition, he pans out from the pockets of
                  the young Argentine men in 1950s to the pocket of a young Percy Shelley—drowned and
                  washed up ashore in the Gulf of Spezia on July 8, 1822. The zooming out of the camera
                  lens is a strategic narrative movement that affords a dramatic sense of identification
                  between distant parties. This potential for immediate transport—physically, temporally,
                  and historically—is seminal to Cortázar’s early writing and becomes absolutely definitive
                  of his later works.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Critics such as Ana Martínez Santa have read <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> as a compositional training ground for Cortázar, who after the 1960s would emerge
                     onto the world literary scene in full force (195). As we can see, Cortázar does not
                     simply borrow themes from Keats and transplant them within a Latin American setting.
                     Instead, <em>Imagen</em> enacts a unique experiment in flattening timescales, providing in each chapter a series
                     of permeable wormholes through which the reader and author can embark on literary
                     time travel, spanning from 1816 to 1959. This does not follow the model of a two-dimensional
                     timeline but rather inhabits a three-dimensional field, an all-encompassing space
                     that plays host to otherwise impossible interactions.

                     </div> Such fluid mobility, hopping from point to point, is fundamental to Cortázar, whose
                     experimentations with novelistic structure became his principle claim to fame. Considered
                     by Alfred McAdam as the novel that marked the beginning of the Latin American Boom
                     movement, <em>Hopscotch</em> (originally <em>Rayuela</em>) presents readers with an innovative set of instructions in the 
                     “Table of Contents”
                      from which to choose different reading paths, to read sequentially or skip around
                     in an erratic sequence (Donald Shaw, 
                     “Which Was the First Novel of the Boom?”
                      360). The suggested trajectory for readers begins, for instance, not at Chapter 1,
                     but Chapters “73-1-2-116-3-84-4-71...” (<em>Hopscotch</em> v). Much more than simply summon the reader to jump from section to section and experience
                     the fluctuation of page numbers along a linear scale, Cortázar invites the reader
                     to become immersed in jarringly different environments, transporting suddenly from
                     a conversation with the enchanting Gekrepten in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos
                     Aires to a walk along the Quai de Conti in Paris with a different woman, La Maga.
                     We can thus see how the seed of timelessness in <em>Imagen</em>, which would later explode in <em>Hopscotch</em>, also mirrored the transcontinental, back-and-forth movements between “el lado de
                     acá” and “el lado de allá.” This penchant for dynamic movement, for a truly bodily
                     experience of transport, fuels the “contemporaneous” intimacy that makes for the indissoluble
                     personal bond, physically choreographed, between Cortázar and Keats.</p>

               <p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is a project predicated upon forging a strong individual connection between Cortázar
                  and Keats, but it also traces lines of affinity and overlap between their literary
                  circles. The attentive reader will easily notice parallels between the Leigh Hunt
                  circle and the Latin American Boom writers of the 1960s and 1970s. Both consisted
                  of young men spurred to publication in response to the political turmoil and threat
                  of censorship during their time, the former provoked by the Peterloo Massacre, and
                  the latter by the violence of repressive authoritarian governments and dictatorships
                  in Latin America. The rise of military regimes in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua,
                  and Peru in the second half of the twentieth century ultimately brought together many
                  Hispanic authors across Spain and Latin America. Their political fervor and leftist
                  ideological lineage earned the Boom authors an international audience of young readers
                  who opposed the climate of censorship and the threats to human rights, themes featured
                  in many of the Latin American novels produced during those years.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Cortázar left his university post at the National University of Cuyo in 1946 as a
                     result of his opposition to the regime of General Juan Perón. In many ways, the period
                     of censorship and intellectual repression preceding the Dirty War in Argentina became
                     for Cortázar what Peterloo was for Keats. Nicholas Roe’s <em>Keats and the Culture of Dissent</em> and Jeffrey Cox’s <em>Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School</em> have showcased how the liberal convictions of Leigh Hunt and the Cockney School shaped
                     Keats in a stronger vein than has been previously recognized. Much like Keats, Cortázar
                     was sympathetic to the political urgencies shared by other Boom writers. He protested
                     the impending presidency of Perón, leaving his teaching position and his country shortly
                     after. He would travel to Cuba numerous times, first in 1963, but his enthusiasm for
                     the revolution quickly dissolved when the poet Heberto Padilla was arrested and jailed
                     by the Castro regime in 1971. Relying on his own voice, Cortázar eventually withdrew
                     from the Cuban cause, just as Keats had eventually distanced himself from the Hunt
                     circle, though he would always remain strongly supportive of the political left throughout
                     his life. Still, it is important not to impose exact parallels upon the political
                     situations of both authors, nor to assume that a Latin American author would automatically
                     cleave to Romantic literature for its revolutionary echoes. This is simply not the
                     case, and despite resonances between the Latin American Boom writers and the Keats-Hunt
                     circle, <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is not a politically motivated work.

               <p>Scholars of the Latin American Boom typically trace any European influence to the
                  French and British modernists, including Proust, Joyce, and the surrealists; or by
                  way of Latin American <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">modernismo</span> authors at the fin de siècle, such as Rubén Darío, José Martí, and José Asunción
                  Silva, who followed the French Parnassians and Symbolists. For a young Cortázar to
                  align himself with John Keats rather than a figure like James Joyce was thus a marked
                  departure from others within his literary circle, which was dominated at the time
                  by French intellectualism. As Peter Standish attests, Cortázar “was in many respects
                  a romantic, the prime source of his romanticism being English poetry of the nineteenth
                  century” (14–15). Borges, who was also a great reader of English literature, delivered
                  a series of lectures that included twenty-five classes from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, with four classes devoted to Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Blake (
                  “Professor Borges: A Course on English Literature”
                  ). Cortázar avoids such strict chronological self-positioning: Rather than performing
                  a historical survey, covering the breadth of the English canon, he plunged deeply
                  into the works of a few Anglophone authors he admired, including Defoe, Poe, and Keats.</p>

                     an imperialistic tradition (c.f. Ramirez, 
                     “Keatsians in Argentina”
                     ). At the same time, the English-Spanish language difference both presents an obstacle
                     and spares them from the anxieties surrounding a colonizing language. For Cortázar,
                     despite recognizing British literature as a central cultural force, his position on
                     the periphery of this somewhat distant tradition is neither one of adulation nor of
                     marginalization. So, what jagged line of influence can be traced through the lens
                     of this cosmopolitan reader? Again, Cortázar’s model of ambulation or meandering comes
                     to play, emulating Montaigne’s impetus to <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">essayer</span>, try out new paths, or <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">dar un paseo</span>. In 1980, he lectured to a seminar of university students in the United States: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">It has been asserted many times that Latin American literature in general enters modernity
                        without all the baggage—and the confidence that comes with it—of a slow past and a
                        slow evolution, as European literature has. We went from the Spanish Conquest to colonization
                        and then independence in a stretch of time that, compared with the development of
                        the great literary cultures of the West, is tiny, a mere instant. This means that
                        when Latin American writers began to write, and write autonomously in each of our
                        countries, they might have unconsciously felt the absence of a slow evolution of which
                        they were the last link in a long chain. Suddenly they found themselves confronting
                        a modern culture, and a language that could be used in all its expressive potential.

                     </blockquote> Here, in Cortázar’s assessment, Latin American authors enjoy the possibility of writing
                     autonomously. The evolution of their literature is not a slow buildup across generations
                     but a sudden moment in time, a “mere instant.” Its potential is thus explosive and
                     optimistic rather than burdened by any “baggage” of periodization. Indeed, the “tiny,”
                     “mere instant” of Latin American inspiration is not so much diminutive as it is liberating
                     through its ahistoricity. It is important to recognize here that Cortázar’s trilingualism
                     and worldliness afforded him the access and confidence to foray the European scene.
                     Born in Brussels in 1914, he settled in Paris in the 1950s, traveling also to Cuba,
                     America, Spain, and Egypt.

                     of “automatic writing” that Cortázar and other surrealist writers would come to champion.
                     He describes and enacts this autonomous, improvisatory process here in <em>Imagen</em>:

                           better for me. It seems as if the ink pen was collecting energy inside my pocket:</p>

                           my hand, and I let it become entangled in the little-speaking-stick. And there they
                           go, and I see them, while I sip my delicious <em>mate</em> where a tiny forest wafts its fragrance towards me.</p>

                           and there, because look—this is what happens: here, I am talking about the past with

                           to lose faith with <em>everyone</em> in the Republic of Letters. Only his own friends understood him, and this is very
                           helpful in avoiding the temptation of taking the easy way out, sticking to one-sided

                     “Methodology”
                      section at the beginning of the book, Cortázar already proffers a disclaimer of his
                     timelessness—that the old and young, those of the past and future, will very likely
                     reject his work, which lives only in the present.

                  <p>Cortázar insistently refuses historicity, even as he enumerates Keats’s literary forebears.
                     This confidence in seizing the present and shrugging off the past is professedly a
                     tactic he learned from and shared with Keats. Just as Cortázar does not owe his inspiration
                     to Keats, Keats is not beholden to his predecessors. Neither feels the weight of the
                     English canon upon him. Cortázar explains: 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="wrapper">
                           <p>This is how Keats always felt, and if it is literally impossible to say that he cleared
                              the slate of the past, we will see that his adherence to this past is neither born
                              out of a nostalgia nor a sentiment of reverence in the Manriquean mode. On the contrary,
                              in his own poetic dimension, he lives so deeply in the past that he does not feel
                              the need to profess about it, and this abolishes divisions of chronology. From 1814
                              to 1816, he was trapped by the magic of Spenser’s <em>The Faerie Queene</em>. Later on, it is Shakespeare and Milton who enchant him. But can we really speak
                              about the past—in the sense that Ortega understands it—when we are talking about Shakespeare
                              and Milton <em>in</em> England? When Keats feels the need to escape Spenser’s charms—and that was truly a
                              temporal contemplation of a long-gone past—, John remains squarely within the same
                              temporal dimension of Milton and, above all, of Shakespeare. They are not “models
                              or norms”: they are the poetry at the level that Keats is striving so willfully to
                              reach. In regards to Greece, where he finds all the imagery of <em>Endymion</em>, all the pathos of <em>Lamia</em>, and the instant purity of 
                              “Ode on a Grecian Urn,”
                               his talent is not that of a historian. For John, his world of Hampstead and Greece
                              are the very same reality where nature and man coexist in an alternate plane of direct
                              contemplation and mythological symbology. He does not feel the nostalgia of Greece;
                              his overwhelming joy weaves the tapestry of pagan images in his poetry. He does not
                              see any reason to deplore the passing of time. The <em>eternal</em> world is within reach of his hand, and what his eyes see in an oak tree is the same
                              thing that Virgil saw. What would be the purpose of remembering the snows of yesteryear

                     point” that Cortázar recognizes as fundamentally Romantic are a central structural
                     component of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>. They are also, I argue, what defines his major works, especially <em>Hopscotch</em>. This passage, excerpted from a section titled 
                     “Circumstance and Choice,”
                      celebrates Keats’s creative autonomy despite being informed by Milton, Shakespeare,
                     and Virgil. In this shared reality, Hampstead is Greece; Keats sees the very same
                     oak tree that Virgil saw. Any literary resemblances are not a matter of historical
                     eventuality but of taste and happenstance of the present. In turn, Cortázar clears
                     his own “slate of the past,” “abolishes the divisions of chronology,” and can draw
                     on Keats without “nostalgia nor a sentiment of reverence.” This lends him, too, complete
                     autonomy from any anxiety of historical influence, within or across national traditions.
                     Both authors are free to shrug off any deferential indebtedness to their literary
                     ancestors.</p>

                  freedom—the possibility of ending up anywhere, in any time signature or any key—is
                  reminiscent of the twist endings and perspectival changes that mark the endings to
                  so many short stories of the surrealist and Latin American Boom movements. In this
                  sense, the interaction of different genres at play adds great interest to <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>—a novel-length work, based on British poetry, that invokes definitive narrative techniques

                     characters. Instead, it is a text brimming with facts and details, despite presenting
                     this informational content within a semi-fictional and poetic framework. How do we

                  <p>Cortázar provides us with the semblance of an answer when he broaches this question
                     of genre himself. Answering questions posed by students at the University of California,
                     Berkeley, he addresses why Latin America produced so many short-story writers: “In
                     Latin America, the short story is so popular and is of such high quality that it can
                     be considered among the best to be imagined or written in the world….Short stories
                     and short-story writers appear in Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, and follow the aesthetic
                     trends that at the time were coming fundamentally from Europe. So, when Romanticism
                     arrives in Latin America, like a kind of enormous deluge, many stories and many novels
                     are written that have Romantic characteristics, but the subjects are already Latin
                     American…” (30–33).

                              many frames or puzzle pieces eventually deliver a finished story to the viewer, as
                              in a novel. A photograph, on the other hand, presupposes limitations. It is one immobile
                              frame of a single significant piece to a puzzle, a fragment of reality to which the
                              viewer must supply the remaining pieces, as in a short story. The short story, therefore,
                              is an ‘opening up’ of a reality that is much greater than that of the actual tale:

                  Shelley, and occasionally, a rare poem or two of Cortázar’s own, inspired by Keats.
                  Combining poetic elements with novelistic structures and components of the short story,

                     of Moore, of Milton, and of Leigh Hunt. But my tastes are more of my own time, and
                     I see John as one in my own time</p>

               </blockquote>
               <p>Keats’s omnipresent timelessness is embodied in the improvisatory movements of Cortázar’s
                  seemingly erratic, free-flowing hops and skips around sentences, stanzas, and chapters.
                  In this poetic world in which there are neither birth dates nor death dates, 
                  “Julio y John”
                  take turns leading one another. At the beginning of this article, Cortázar invited
                  Keats for a stroll, placing him in his pocket. Here, he again initiates, but agrees
                  to follow. We see Cortázar inverting the neoromantic impetus of a 1950s writer wishing
                  he lived in the 1810s. Instead, he claims Keats as contemporary, emphasizing both
                  the portability of a pocket Keats and the transportability of all authors into one
                  another’s worlds. This poses a new kind of relationship between British Romanticism
                  and Latin American postmodernist writing, one based on two Cortazarian models: “hopscotch,”
                  which allows us to jump discreetly from point to point within a field that precludes
                  strict sequencing; and “blow-up,” the zooming in up close to a single image, uncovering
                  new life, movement, and action as in a film before panning out. Cortázar shows that
                  the “time traveling” of <em>Hopscotch</em> and up-close reading experiences of 
                  “Blow-up”
                  are not learned <em>from</em> Keats, but <em>with</em> him, as they go forward together, collapsing distance, overlapping time scales, and
                  merging genres.</p>
               <p>From the beginning to the end of a long work that never truly feels sequential in
                  its narrative, Cortázar cultivates a purposeful simultaneity and universality that
                  allows him to commune eternally with Keats. Indeed, throughout <em>Imagen</em>, time overlaps on various levels: in the metric time of poetry, the historical timelines
                  of biography, and the narrative horizontal direction of chapters progressing within
                  a novel. Genres overlap as we see the novel and short story overlaid upon the smaller
                  poetic building blocks of alliteration, metaphor, and anaphora. Ultimately, a thoughtful
                  reading of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is not an exercise in noticing the many parallels between two worlds, two times,
                  and three genres; nor is it simply an occasion to trace lines of inheritance. Rather,
                  it is recognizing the vision of a lively constellation within a single shared space
                  of three-dimensionality, a dynamic collage that choreographs participation in a shared
                  “reality.”</p>
               <p>Cortázar’s book depicts the accessibility of the “everyman” Keats for all readers,
                  inclusive of a Latin American and Hispanophone audience, from the 1950s to today.
                  His games of “hopscotch” and “blow-up” depict a dynamic image of Keats not otherwise
                  afforded to us in chronological memoirs, biography, or literary criticism. And while
                  this formal ambiguity may have been the very reason for the omission of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> from Keats’s critical lineage thus far, it is a work to be rediscovered and honored—to
                  be preciously placed in our pockets—as a model that resists traditional patterns of
                  Latin American afterlives through its insistent contemporaneity.</p>

               as paragraph. A movie has an open order, a detailed and rounded structure in which
               many frames or puzzle pieces eventually deliver a finished story to the viewer, as
               in a novel. A photograph, on the other hand, presupposes limitations. It is one immobile
               frame of a single significant piece to a puzzle, a fragment of reality to which the
               viewer must supply the remaining pieces, as in a short story. The short story, therefore,
               is an ‘opening up’ of a reality that is much greater than that of the actual tale:
               ‘that fabulous opening of the minute onto the gigantic, of that which is individual
               and circumscribed onto the very essence of the human condition.’” (Picon Garfield
