            <p class="noCount">This essay explores the often unfaithful translations of Byron’s <em><em>The Giaour</em></em> into Spanish, especially in light of their prosification and importation across genres.
               Focusing on an adaptation by the Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, it
               contextualizes this afterlife within Argentine intellectual and political tensions.
               Zapata was the first to provide a direct adaptation from the original text, and also
               the only adaptor to truly preserve the vampiric elements of the plot. When read through
               a postcolonial and anti-orientalist lens, <em><em>The Giaour</em></em> shows Zapata challenging the binary categorizations of good/evil, East/West, and
               modernity/backwardness in the context of nineteenth-century Argentina.</p>

                  <p>Vampires arrived late to the feast of Romanticism in Latin America. As they roamed
                     the Old World, few echoes of their presence reached the shores of the New World.

                              “The Bride of Corinth”
                              (1797) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1829, as the first example of vampire

                     Fuentes. The twentieth century saw the consecration of vampire literature in Latin
                     America. However, this acclimatization could not have been possible without the role
                     carried out by translators during the nineteenth century. “Translation” in the context
                     of this discussion recovers its etymological meaning, since it not only conveys the
                     transference between languages, but also of spatial dissemination, as an import “transferred”
                     or “carried out” from one place to another, from Europe to the Americas.

                              or the teyollohcuani, which, only in hindsight, have been linked to the vampire tradition
                              (Maberry 277, Kallen 23–24, Doan, 138–139; Martín del Campo, 108–109).</span></div>

               <p>Current critical assessments have tended to overlook translations as part of the output
                  of vampiric literature, leading to an incomplete picture of its growth in the Hispanic
                  context. However, even in studies where translations are noted as progressive steps
                  in its adoption by Latin American authors, the absence of Spanish translations of
                  George Gordon, Lord Byron, is striking. Considering the central role of Byron in the
                  vampiric craze during the Romantic era, stemming both from the association of his
                  public persona to this mythical monster and the long-lasting misattribution of John
                  Polidori’s canonical tale, a proper study of translations of Byron seems necessary
                  to articulate a more comprehensive and accurate historicization of early stages of
                  this subgenre in Latin America. This article aims at correcting this lacuna by analyzing
                  the significance of the first available Spanish translation of <em>The Giaour</em> by the Argentine politician Martín Zapata Coria (1811–1861).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">

                              differentiate between references to his translation and those to Lord Byron’s original.</span></div>
                     </div> I will start by exposing the many challenges that the original source (and vampire
                     literature in general) had to face in its transfer to a Latin American context. Subsequently,
                     I will analyze the most significant features and stylistic choices of the translator’s
                     rendition. Finally, I will argue why Zapata’s contribution can be interpreted as a
                     counter-discourse to Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s formulation of 
                     “Civilization and Barbarism.”
                      As important as his role as a translator was, no less fascinating is Zapata’s implicit
                     position in narratives of progress and modernity that characterized the political
                     arena of nineteenth-century Argentina. As James Cisneros hints in passing, Byron’s
                     worldview contrasted greatly with the most dogmatic formulations of 
                     “Civilization and Barbarism”
                      (251), which presented a black-and-white agenda for progress in Argentina. By bringing
                     to the fore a text that strayed beyond socially-prescribed boundaries concerning morals
                     and modernity, Zapata forced his readers to question the simple binaries so fervently
                     sustained at the time.</p>

                  <p>Before delving into the historical coordinates that informed Byron translations prior
                     to Zapata’s rendition, it is worth reviewing the plot and main features of <em>The Giaour</em>. T.S. Eliot provides an insightful summary of the poem: <span class="quote">‘A Christian, presumably a Greek, has managed, by some means of which we are not told,
                        to scrape acquaintance with a young woman who belonged to the harem, or was perhaps
                        the favorite wife of a Moslem named Hassan. In the endeavor to escape with her Christian
                        lover, Leila is recaptured and killed; in due course the Christian with some of his
                        friends ambushes and kills Hassan. We subsequently discover that the story of this
                        vendetta—or part of it—is being told by the Giaour himself to an elderly priest, by
                        way of making his confession. (227–28) ’</span> Eliot efficiently outlines the story here; however, in what would become a classic
                     move in frequent receptions of the text in the Hispanic world, he significantly skips
                     any mention of the vampire subplot.

                     </div> As the Christian protagonist kills Hassan, the latter invokes a curse upon him that
                     prophesies the ultimate transformation of the protagonist into a vampire. This episode
                     is limited to thirty lines, and runs, depending on the edition, from approximately
                     line 755 to line 786. Due to its length, I provide here the most substantial excerpt

                     encapsulates the only explicit contribution by Byron to this Gothic theme.

                              linked to his image as a leading cultivator of the sublime (135). Interestingly, the
                              association between the English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly
                              in the Spanish language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of
                              Byron in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the first
                              Peninsular translation of Polidori’s The Vampire to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian
                              editorial house of Librería Americana, this misattribution reoccurs in 1829, consolidating
                              th…</span></div>
                     </div> From that celebrated encounter at Villa Diodati where John Polidori, Mary Shelley,
                     Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Clair Clairmont gathered in Geneva during the Year Without
                     Summer of 1816, only one text by Byron has survived—
                     “The Fragment of a Novel,”
                      later included in the publication of <em>Mazeppa</em> in 1819 (Aquilina, 27–30; Glantz 5). Yet, considering the inchoate and truncated nature
                     of this narrative, it would be arguable to consider it within the canon of vampire
                     literature at all. Furthermore, Byron would later (in most likelihood embittered by
                     the attribution of Polidori’s tale) forcibly remove himself from any association with
                     those iconic bloodsucking monsters: “I have . . . a personal dislike to ‘Vampires,’
                     and the little acquaintance I have with them would by no means induce me to divulge
                     their secrets” (
                     “Letter of Lord Byron”
                      151). In brief, despite the strong association between Byron and the vampiric theme,
                     the aforementioned passage in <em>The Giaour</em> remains his sole explicit contribution to this lineage.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Among the varied facets deserving attention in this narrative poem, I would like to
                  briefly highlight some key aspects of the original that are useful in measuring the
                  worth of Martín Zapata’s translation. To begin, <em>The Giaour</em> offers an intriguing complication of the orientalist paradigm, as it casts the Christian
                  lover through Eastern eyes. By framing the main character as a representation of the
                  West, as a <em>Gavur</em> or “infidel,” the poem takes the perspective of the traditional Other. The protagonist
                  is framed by the gaze of the East. As the text shifts the focus from comfortable exoticization
                  of the oriental subject to a matter of perspective, it could be argued that Byron
                  problematizes, to some extent, the “geographical binaries” that legitimized European
                  colonialism (Rangarajan 55). In <em>The Giaour</em>, it is precisely the representation of the West that is continuously subjected to
                  scrutiny and suspicion. Certainly, as postcolonial critic Padma Rangarajan has pointed
                  out, this inversion of perspectives is limited to “an audacious moment of colonial
                  ventriloquism,” characteristic of some forward-thinking romantics (55). Yet this textual
                  stance must have been deemed necessarily problematic by some audiences, especially
                  in emergent Latin American republics such as Argentina, where models of modernity
                  led to the excision of any non-Western elements as signs of presumed backwardness.
                  In choosing <em>The Giaour</em>, Martín Zapata was implicitly placing himself in a singular position among his intellectual
                  peers.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Adding to the complication of the orientalist paradigm, we must add the uncharacteristic
                     portrayal of the doomed-to-be vampire protagonist. As a quintessential Byronic hero, <em>The Giaour</em> is a somewhat sympathetic Gothic villain doomed by fate to carry out death and destruction
                     upon his loved ones against his will (Thorslev 150–151). Departing from the otherness
                     inherently attached to some of the most recognizable vampires in literary tradition
                     (such as Sheridan Le Fanu’s <em>Carmilla</em> or Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula</em>), Byron’s cursed Giaour evinces a complex character, neither entirely innocent nor
                     completely guilty. Therefore, the text elicits the monster within us all, the vampire
                     we might become when touched by ill fate and the unbridled thirst of vengeance.

                  <p>Hispanic resistance towards Gothic horror and fantastic supernaturalism adds an additional
                     key to appreciating Zapata’s initiative as a translator. According to José María Martínez,
                     the institutional demands of the emergent Latin American republics enforced a social-political
                     inflection to Romantic ideals that, along with the reawakening of the enlightened
                     instrumentalization of imagination, led most writers to postpone the use of fantastic
                     aesthetics (55–56). Until the end of the 1850s, and especially after 1860 (with the
                     later impact of Edgar Allan Poe), is it difficult to trace a quantitative and qualitatively
                     stronger corpus of supernatural tales in Latin America.

                              is that the consolidation of the genre occurred in the last third of the nineteenth
                              century. This context would place Zapata’s translation over a decade ahead of the

                  <p>In contrast to Sarmiento’s current relevance in Latin American studies, very little
                     is known nowadays of lawyer and politician Martín Zapata. By the mid-nineteenth century,
                     he was recognized as one of the leading promoters of the Constitution of 1853, which,
                     incidentally, is still the base of the current Argentine juridical system (Lorenzo
                     220, 227). Through brief and scattered political notes of the period, it is possible
                     to place Zapata among the liberal intellectuals who opposed José Manuel de Rosas,
                     the dictator who ruled Argentina between 1835 and 1852. Within this context, Zapata’s
                     path closely follows the steps of members of the “1837 Generation” such as Juan Bautista
                     Alberdi, Esteban Echeverría, or Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.

                              1839 and Argirópolis, 1850) and by Zapata, via Byron. For Echeverría and Sarmiento,
                              the fantastic appears through visions and it is used either as a moral or political
                              allegory (Abraham 91–99, 135–142).</span></div>

                     of disbandment. Later political differences seem to have broken the friendship between
                     Sarmiento and Zapata soon after. Nevertheless, by 1849, their relation must have remained
                     strong. That year, in an editorial headlined by Sarmiento’s confidant and son-in-law,
                     Julio Belín, Zapata published <em>El Giaur</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>o el infiel: Fragmento de un cuento turco</em>.</p>

                     Early transmission of Byron’s works could not be understood without the role of the
                     Parisian publisher Librería Americana-Decourchant. It was originally from France that
                     the first major wave of his Spanish translations were made possible.

                              records by scholars Ernest Coleridge and Richard Churchman led to a long-lasting confusion
                              about what titles were actually translated into Spanish and which ones were merely

                     </div> During this phase, thirteen titles were published: <em>The Corsair</em> (1827), <em>The Bride of Abydos</em> (1828), <em>The Giaour</em> (1828), <em>Lara</em> (1828), <em>Mazeppa</em> (1828), <em>The Siege of Corinth</em> (1828), <em>Don Juan</em> (1829), <em>Beppo</em> (1830), <em>Manfred</em> (1830), <em>The Prisoner of Chillon</em> (1830), <em>Oscar de Alba</em> (1830), <em>Parisina</em> (1830), and <em>Odes to Napoleon</em> (1830). Leaving aside the fragmentary renditions by Spanish-speaking intellectuals
                     who lived in England during their time in exile (such as José María Heredia or Andrés
                     Bello), early translations of Byron were made accessible through second-hand French
                     versions, where taking extreme poetic license was a common practice. It is worth noting
                     that <em>The Giaour</em> appears during this timeframe among Byron texts that traveled through Spain to some
                     territories in Latin America. However, interest in this narrative poem would decline
                     during the nineteenth century, as is demonstrated by the delay with which a second
                     translation of the work would be undertaken by Zapata. Twenty years separated the
                     first Spanish edition of <em>The Giaour</em> in Paris (1828) and the first Latin American one in Chile (1849).

                  <p>We must nuance Zapata’s initial stance as a faithful translator, as his praxis is
                     still rooted in the tradition of prosification, frequently carried out in the Romantic
                     era. It is important to remember that, in the early stages of reception, Byron’s narrative
                     poems were predominantly rendered into prose. Not by chance, Spanish translations
                     of the period are commonly labeled as “novelas” (“novels”) or even “cuentos poéticos”
                     (“poetic tales”). As a result, this practice of prosification significantly altered
                     the horizon of expectations of the initial Spanish-speaking readership (Montesinos
                     64; Pegenaute 
                     “La época romántica”
                      337, 343; Medina Calzada 148). Lord Byron’s works were mostly associated in these
                     early stages with the productions of a novel writer or even those of a playwright.
                     Despite the poetic recreations by José María Heredia, Henrique de Vedia, or Manuel
                     Cañete, translations in verse were exceptions, undertaken only by a small number of
                     daring authors during the first half of the nineteenth century.

                  attention of modernist poets such as T.S. Eliot in the twentieth century (fragmentation,
                  elusiveness, disarticulation) must have been perceived as a source of disorientation
                  by audiences of the time. A similar scenario must have occurred within the Spanish-speaking
                  readership. Zapata likely feared the risk of confusing his audience with the meandering
                  structure of the original. To guide his readership, he devoted individual chapters
                  to specific parts of the narrative poem. The addition of subtitles is another of the
                  strategies used by the Argentine to further his clarification of the plot. In Zapata’s

                     This chapter could be considered in itself one of the first explorations of vampire
                     literature in a Hispanic context. The famous passage of vampirism by Byron quoted

                                 </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>With the exception of accentuation, I keep the original orthography.</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> This excerpt exemplifies Zapata’s approach as a translator. Unable to produce the
                     rhythmic cadence of Byron’s pentameter and the alliteration of English nasal and occlusive
                     consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), he opts for a different palette of sounds, but with the
                     same effect in mind: horror. For this purpose, Zapata makes a forceful, combined use
                     of the alveolar trill /r/ and nasal consonants (/m/, /n/) throughout the passage.
                     These are some of the clearest examples of alliteration: <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">arrancado, convertido, raza, arrancarás, corriente, horrorice, alimentar, cadáver,
                        espirar, reconocerán, flor, cárdenos, rabiarás, porque, infernales, horrorizados</span>. These abundant examples illustrate the intentionality of the author. The taps and
                     trills, so characteristic of the Spanish /r/, help provide this scene with a sense
                     of urgency and aggression, while the nasal sounds provide a background tension that
                     suitably convenes the tremendous curse invoked upon the protagonist.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Since Zapata does not count with the power of meter that emphasizes the fateful metric
                  <em>ostinato</em> of the original, he has to supply other means to this end. The use of polysyndeton
                  in relatively long sentences contribute to exacerbate the tension until its climatic
                  resolution, with the curse of the protagonist: “<em>I</em> tus crujientes dientes <em>y</em> cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos, <em>i</em> volviéndote a tu oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios
                  infernales huirán de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos” (21; emphases
                  added). As if these formal means of expression were not sufficient, Zapata resorts
                  to a hyperbolic use of punctuation. The translator not only multiplies the exclamation
                  marks of the original, but also inserts two complete lines of periods or suspension
                  points. Whether these signs are a representation of an unutterable horror or a sudden
                  break of the narrative is open to interpretation. What remains clear is Zapata’s effective
                  intention of producing an intense shock in his audience. Despite its brevity and translative
                  character, this chapter of <em>El Giaur</em> represents one of the wildest and more explicit expressions of Gothic sensibility
                  in nineteenth-century Latin American literature.</p>
               <p>In the context of Argentine political discussions, the timing of Zapata’s translation
                  makes his production particularly intriguing. By the 1830s, Byron was certainly deemed
                  by the Argentine intellectual establishment (Esteban Echeverría, José Mármol, and
                  Juan Bautista Alberdi) a cornerstone of the Romantic pantheon of foreign authors.
                  However, by the 1840s, these sentiments were starting to recede, and discussions about
                  the pertinence of Romanticism would be abundant. It is therefore surprising to note
                  how Zapata’s publication straddles the fence of the first two extremely influential
                  editions of Sarmiento’s <em>Facundo: Civilization y Barbarie</em> (1845, 1851).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In its most basic tenets, <em>Facundo</em> aims at fostering a model of Western progress though critical representations of backwardness,
                     embodied in the portrayal of gaucho leader Juan Facundo Quiroga. Along the way, Sarmiento
                     delineates a clear-cut opposition between two antithetical cultural realities: the
                     presumed signifiers of barbarism (indigenous peoples, <em>gauchos</em> or mixed-race cowboys, and Spaniards); and those of Western Modernity (associated
                     with the US, UK and France). Furthermore, he does not hesitate to equate the <em>gauchos</em>’ uncivilized character with nomadic subjects of the Middle East. His “otherizing”
                     exoticism is unabashedly grounded in racist prejudice: <span class="quote">‘It would not be useless to remind [the reader] the notable likenesses that are drawn
                        among Argentines and Arabs… Many of our customs reveal the contact of our fathers
                        with the Moors from Andalusia. Let’s not even talk about physiognomies: I have met
                        some Arabs who I swear I have seen in my country. (<em>Facundo</em> 28 n. without number; my translation)’</span> <span class="quote">‘[The attitudes of the <em>gaucho</em> people] have the same explanation in the planes as in Arab countries. Life in the
                        desert … is one of privation, poverty, and monotony…The barbarian is bodily insensitive,
                        as he is <em>less prompt to reflection, which is the faculty that dominates in the educated man</em>. (274–75, my translation, emphases added)’</span> <span class="quote">‘It is necessary to see those closed-bearded faces, those grave and serious countenances,
                        such as in the Asian Arabs, to judge the compassionate disdain that inspires their
                        contemplation of the sedentary man of the cities. (14, my translation) ’</span> Sarmiento’s depiction of countrymen and that of Orientalized subjects are one and
                     the same. Within his social imaginary, Arabs and <em>gaucho</em> people represent closed-mindedness (“less prompt to reflection”) and non-urban backwardness.
                     Certainly, Sarmiento’s internal contradictions deserve a more complex analysis than
                     I am able to provide here.

                     </div> Yet, for the interests of my argument on the innovative character of <em>El Giaur</em>, it is striking that Zapata decided to publish and translate a story where those
                     precise boundaries (Good-Evil, East-West) were forcibly blurred and problematized.
                     Within the context of Sarmiento’s binary ideology, Zapata provides an indication of
                     a more complex worldview, one in which the lines dividing <em>Civilization and Barbarism</em> are harder to grasp. Considering the later disagreements between both writers, Sarmiento
                     and Zapata, it is possible to see in the publication of <em>El Giaur</em> a foreshadowing of their later differences.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">III. After Martín Zapata</span></h2>
               <p>The consecration of <em>The Giaour</em> in the Spanish-speaking world as a major text in the Byronic canon would take time.
                  Byron’s first Oriental poem was not translated again into Spanish until 1864, after
                  almost another twenty years. Continuing the interest awakened by Zapata’s translation,
                  Argentine poet Pedro Espinosa, known as “Espinillo,” took the responsibility of being
                  the first to provide a versified rendition of <em>The Giaour</em>. Unfortunately, the little booklet did not achieve much attention and currently sits
                  in the National Library of Buenos Aires, a testimony to the ephemeral attraction that
                  this poem had in Argentina during the nineteenth century. From this point forward,
                  interest in <em>The Giaour</em> would spark in other geographies. After a second translation in verse by José Núñez
                  de Prado y Fernández (1824–1894) included in <em>Lord Byron: tres poemas puestos en verso castellano</em> (Spain, 1885), the tragic parable of the Greek Christian lover transformed into a
                  vampire would resume his journey to Perú and Cuba. Almost concomitantly, two notable
                  translators, José Arnaldo Márquez (Peru, 1832–1903) and Francisco Sellén (Cuba,1836–1907)
                  issued the most notable renditions in verse to date of <em>The Giaour</em>. The individual efforts of Núñez, Márquez, and Sellén draw a new afterlife of the
                  Byronic text, one in which translations from the original English source are conveyed
                  through classical diction and meter (such as combinations of seven- and eleven-syllable
                  lines), but with an unmistakable Gothic flair.</p>
               <p>As Vicente Quirarte beautifully reminds us, “The Vampire cannot enter / unless we
                  open the window” (
                  “Elogio del vampiro”
                  , lines 4–5; my translation). In the discontinuous life of <em>The Giaour</em> in the Spanish language, Martín Zapata signaled a moment of openness that not only
                  spread a more comprehensive understanding of Lord Byron’s works, but also led to the
                  acclimatization of the vampire and prose poetry in Latin America. Before the powerful
                  vampiric stories by Horacio Quiroga, Rubén Darío, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes,
                  there was once <em>El Giaur o el infiel</em>, fathered by an almost forgotten Argentine writer. With the broad historical perspective
                  that we hold today, we can see how Zapata’s rendition put in motion the interest in
                  <em>The Giaour</em> and planted the seeds for the current cultivation of the vampire theme in contemporary
                  Spanish and Latin American fiction. This article aimed at doing justice to his contribution,
                  while underlining the subversiveness implicit in the timing of his publication. Within
                  the stark coordinates of Argentine debates of the period, where little tolerance was
                  given to ambiguity, Zapata’s choice carries a strong political stance. Today, as we
                  read <em>El Giaur</em>, the same delightful chill that readers felt at the time comes back to us, to excite
                  our fear and confront us with our prejudices once again.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">The overall consensus on this point is exemplified by Sardiñas, Glantz, Gordillo,
               and Martínez Díaz. We can deem José María Heredia’s translation of 
               “The Bride of Corinth”
               (1797) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1829, as the first example of vampire
               literature in Latin America.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">It must be noted that in this article, I deal with Romantic representations of vampires
               in the Modern era. I do not take into consideration pre-Colombian motifs such as <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">tlahuelpuchi</span> or the <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">teyollohcuani</span>, which, only in hindsight, have been linked to the vampire tradition (Maberry 277,
               Kallen 23–24, Doan, 138–139; Martín del Campo, 108–109).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Throughout this article we will keep Zapata’s misspelling of the title (<em>Giaur</em>) to differentiate between references to his translation and those to Lord Byron’s
               original.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">This move could be attributed to a wide range of reasons, including the relatively
               independent character of the supernatural episode within the rest of the poem.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">As Derek Flitter points out, the Romantic fervor about Byron’s works was initially
               linked to his image as a leading cultivator of the sublime (135). Interestingly, the
               association between the English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly
               in the Spanish language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of
               Byron in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the first
               Peninsular translation of Polidori’s <em>The Vampire</em> to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian editorial house of Librería Americana, this misattribution
               reoccurs in 1829, consolidating the vampiric mark as one of the main features of Byron’s
               writing during the first process of reception of his works.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">It must be noted that <em>The Giaour</em>’s vampiric transformation is merely shown though a prophecy and not in action. Its
               vagueness forces the audience to determine, by the end of the story, whether Hassan’s
               curse is or is not to blame for the unnamed sins admitted in confession later on by
               the protagonist.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Following in the steps of Óscar Hahn, scholars of the fantastic considered 
               “Gaspar Blondín”
               (1858) by Juan Montalvo the first original supernatural tale in Latin America. Although
               this position has been increasingly revised (Sandoval 13; López, XI–XXXIX, 3–30; Morales,
               XXI; Martínez 55, n.41, 56–57; Abraham 35–37, 55–59, 60–106), the overall consensus
               is that the consolidation of the genre occurred in the last third of the nineteenth
               century. This context would place Zapata’s translation over a decade ahead of the
               peak of the fantastic trend.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">It is worth noting the different approach to the fantastic by both Echeverría (
               “Elvira y la novia del Plata,”
               1832; <em>Mefistófeles</em>, 1833), and Sarmiento (
               “La pirámide,”
               1839 and <em>Argirópolis</em>, 1850) and by Zapata, via Byron. For Echeverría and Sarmiento, the fantastic appears
               through visions and it is used either as a moral or political allegory (Abraham 91–99,
               135–142).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">This relation is confirmed in letters of both authors, published in <em>The Complete Works</em> of Sarmiento (volumes XIII and XV).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Zapata in his translation follows the new phonetic orthography proposed by Sarmiento.
               Among its features, <em>i</em> is written instead of <em>y</em>, <em>j</em> instead of <em>g</em>, the silent <em>h</em> is eliminated, and new rules of accentuation are applied.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Here I provide a careful record of the actual census of Byron’s translations into
               Spanish. As Daniel G. Samuel pointed out, the first complete and contradictory bibliographical
               records by scholars Ernest Coleridge and Richard Churchman led to a long-lasting confusion
               about what titles were actually translated into Spanish and which ones were merely
               advertised, but never published. Fortunately, proper systemization of records and
               recent digitalization of texts provide me with enough direct access and cross-references
               to establish a more accurate evaluation of the processes of reception and translation
               of Byron’s works.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Between the editions of Paris and Santiago de Chile, there were no translations of
               <em>The Giaour</em>. Byron’s poem was rendered in neither the Spanish Romantic journal <em>El Europeo</em> nor the historical novel <em>Los bandos de Castilla</em> (<em>The Bans of Castille</em>) by Ramón López Soler, as was once stated. Instead of proper translations, during
               this period we witness bastardized versions of the characters and main plot of <em>The Giaour</em> in Spain. The historical novel <em>Kar-Osman, Memorias de la Casa de Silva</em> (<em>Kar-Osman, Memories of the House of Silva</em>) by Ramón López Soler from 1832 (Picoche 91), and the poetic diptych 
               “El infiel”
               by Juan Arolas from 1849 are examples of symbolic vampirization of the original source.
               Remarkably, both writers obliterate any reference to the preternatural curse and vampiric
               transformation of the protagonist. It is within this context that Martín Zapata’s
               first Latin American rendition of <em>The Giaour</em> in 1849 becomes a relevant <em>tour de force</em>, since it unapologetically brings back the vampiric element of the original story.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">This article makes use of the catalogue of Byron’s translations into Spanish in the
               nineteenth century that I am currently developing. For this project, I consult editions
               available in the National Library of Spain, Paris, Mexico and Buenos Aires, as well
               as the World Cat database. As part of a work in-progress, evaluation of the references
               stated herein are subject to revision.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">In the Hispanic Americas, the path to Romantic Byronism was led by Cuban poet José
               María Heredia during his years of residence in Mexico. His impulse would soon be followed
               by Basque diplomat Henrique de Vedia (“Parisina”) in the Argentine journal <em>La Moda</em>, and later by Andrés Bello and Antonio María Vizcayno. Still, by the mid century,
               translations of Byron in Latin America were significantly scarce.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               was posthumously published in 1842, only seven years before Zapata’s translation of
               Byron (Friebert and Young, 17–21).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
