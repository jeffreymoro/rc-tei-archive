                <p rend="noCount"><title level="a">Latin America’s 'Chiaroscuro' Byron</title> explores the ways
                    in which Latin America and English Romanticism clashed and overlapped during the nineteenth
                    century in their portrayals of Lord Byron. Offering a glimpse into the fervid Byromania
                    spreading among young intellectuals in the Southern Cone, this essay traces how Byronic figures
                    were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José Mármol and by the Brazilian poet
                    Manuel Antônio Álvarez de Azevedo. Ultimately, Byron’s image was viewed in Latin America
                    through a diversifying chiaroscuro effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was luminous and
                    ethereal, but Brazil’s Byron was dark and brooding. But this influence exerted by Byron
                    was not unidirectional. The essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar
                    served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p>

            <p>In this essay we intend to edge towards an understanding of the ways in which Latin
                America and English Romanticism&#8212;as epitomized by its most influential figure, Lord
                Byron (1788–1824)&#8212;clashed and overlapped during the long nineteenth century. This
                coming-together took a variety of forms: Lord Byron for example, had a profound
                influence on a number of nineteenth-century Latin American writers, including the
                Argentine novelist, José Mármol (1818–1871) who has a scene in his novel,
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> (1851), based on the reading of
                Byron’s poems, and the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo (1831–1852)
                whose work exudes Byromania. But the influence was not only one way. In the
                concluding section of our essay, we point to how the celebrated figure of Latin
                America’s independence, Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), encouraged Byron in his pursuit
                of not only literary but also political freedom.</p>
            <p> It is well-known that Byron’s reputation abroad often eclipsed his stature in his
                homeland, where his morality was rejected by many as “questionable”&#8212;he was accused
                of sodomy while at school in Harrow, at university in Cambridge, and in the
                Mediterranean while completing his Grand Tour, and of committing incest with his
                half-sister, Augusta Leigh&#8212;and for this reason Dean Ireland refused to accept his
                body for burial in Westminster Abbey when it arrived from Greece in the spring of
                1824.<note place="foot" resp="author">Byron was subsequently buried in the Church
                    of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</note> Seen as a hero in
                Greece, as a result of his struggles on behalf of Greek
                independence in the early 1820s (Trayiannoudi), Byron was also admired as the
                principal figure of Romanticism in a number of European countries, including France
                (Wilkes and Cochran), Switzerland (Giddey), Italy (Zuccato and Iamartino), Spain
                (Flitter and Cardwell), Portugal (Machado de Souza), Romania (Anghelescu), Germany
                (Pointner &amp; Geisenhanslüke), Holland (D’haen), the Czech Republic (Procházka),
                Poland (Modrzewska), Hungary (Rákai), Russia (Diakonova &amp; Vatsuro), Bulgaria
                (Kostadinova), Denmark (Nielsen), Norway (Tysdahl), Sweden (Elam), Armenia
                (Bekaryan), Georgia (Merabishvili) and Turkey (Demata). One of the aims of this
                essay is to provide some sense of the influence created in Latin America by Byron to
                complement Richard’s Cardwell two-volume study of
                <title level="m">The Reception of Byron in Europe</title> (2004).
                In Europe, as Cardwell suggests, Byron represented a “counterweight to the political
                aims of Europe’s rulers in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era” (<title 
                level="a">Introduction</title> 1);
                he stood for “the struggle for the liberty of oppressed peoples and the struggle to
                define a new artistic language for the expression of that desire for freedom, social
                and individual” (<title level="a">Introduction</title> 1–2). To quote Cardwell once more, each recipient of
                Byron “adopted and adapted Byron to their needs; each individual writer employed
                Byron as a mirror to his own personal obsessions. Each nation used him to create
                their own literary history” (<title level="a">Introduction</title> 4). While no country in Latin America
                experienced Byromania as intensely as Spain did through the person of José de
                Espronceda (Churchman; Pujals; Flitter 138–41), Byron’s ideas, particularly his
                “revolt against Christian and rationalist belief” (Cardwell, <title level="a">Introduction</title> 2), had
                a definitive impact on various Latin American countries, and he became an icon
                standing for political as well as artistic freedom. That impact was not experienced,
                though, in a uniform way across Latin America; while Argentina’s Byron was luminous
                and ethereal, Brazil’s was dark and brooding. This was part and parcel, as we shall
                see, of Byron’s “chiaroscuro” effect in Latin America. </p>
            <p>Indeed, on one specific count, Latin America’s Byron was sharply distinct from the
                European prototype. As we explore in the third section of this essay, Byron not only
                produced a concrete impact on writers across Latin America, he was also himself
                influenced in a number of crucial ways by one of Latin America’s most iconic
                figures, Simón Bolívar. This fact allows us to argue, as far as one of the iconic
                figures of English Romanticism is concerned, that Latin America was not simply a
                receptor of the “obliterating glare of Byronic light” (Barton 291),<note
                    place="foot" resp="author">Barton uses this phrase in the context of her
                            discussion of how Barrett Browning was able to “negotiate” the
                            “obliterating glare of Byronic light” (Barton 291), and the same might
                            be argued of Latin America.</note> as occurred in a number of
                European countries, but was instead the catalyst for new ideas and new activities.
                The pendulum swinging between English Romanticism (as typified by Byron) and Latin
                America led to a chiaroscuro effect in which Latin America reflected back as much as
                it soaked up the “brilliance” and “light” emanating from England’s Romanticism.<note

            <head>Byron and Mármol</head>
            <p>Though it is generally conceded that the two most important national forms of
                Romanticism that impacted Latin America were French (mainly in Río de la Plata) and
                Spanish Romanticism (above all in Mexico, Peru and Colombia; Carilla I: 42–45),
                English Romantic writers were also influential in Latin America. Carilla provides us
                with a list of the European writers who had the greatest impact in Spanish America
                in the Romantic period, and Byron&#8212;along with Walter Scott&#8212;is on that list.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author">Carilla mentions Hugo, Byron, Chateaubriand,
                            Walter Scott, Larra, and Espronceda (Carilla 1: 59).</note> We find
                some clear evidence of the esteem in which Byron’s work was
                held in Argentina, for example, in Part III, Chapter VIII of José Mármol’s novel
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> (1851), entitled <title level="a">Preámbulo de un drama.</title> The main
                drama portrayed in Mármol’s novel is the struggle between the “Unitarios” and the
                “Federales” which tore Argentina apart in the years immediately following
                Argentina’s independence. The “Federales” were backed by the dictator José Manuel
                Rosas, and the Unitarian faction favored establishing and enhancing links with
                Europe in commercial as well as cultural terms, and
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> was a book that fiercely defended
                the position of the Unitarian camp. Little surprise, therefore, that at one juncture
                in the novel, the <title level="a">Preamble of a Drama,</title> we see the two main Unitarian protagonists,
                Amalia and Eduardo, who are Romantic lovers, enraptured in their reading and
                translation of Byron’s poetry:
                <quote>
                Eran las cinco de una tarde fría y nebulosa, y al lado de la chimenea, sentado en un
                pequeño taburete a los pies de Amalia, Eduardo le traducía uno de los más bellos
                pasajes del <title level="m">Manfredo</title>, de Byron; y Amalia, reclinado su brazo
                sobre el hombre de Eduardo y rozando con sus rizos de seda su alta y pálida frente,
                lo oía, enajenada, más por la que llegaba hasta su corazón, que por los bellos
                raptos de la imaginación del poeta; y de cuando en cuando Eduardo levantaba su
                cabeza para buscar en los ojos de su Amalia un raudal mayor de poesía que el que
                brotaban los pensamientos del águila de los poetas del siglo XIX. (Mármol 199)
                </quote>
            A number of points deserve mentioning about this scene. The excerpt suggests that the
                musings of Byron’s imagination had transfused Latin America’s Romantic imagination,
                normalizing the integration of his
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> in an Argentine setting. Eduardo
                is depicted as translating <title level="m">Manfred</title> for
                Amalia, and Amalia is “enajenada” (“deranged,” lit. “out of herself”) as a result of
                listening to the “raptures” of the poet’s imagination. Byron is here seen as an icon
                offering access to authentic Romantic love, since Eduardo uses his recitation of
                Byron’s poetry as a pathway to finding a source of poetry that is even deeper than
                Byron’s poetry&#8212;within Amalia’s eyes. The esteem in which Byron was held in Argentina
                is suggested by the fact that he is described in this passage as “the eagle of
                nineteenth-century poets.” Byron’s work could be co-opted into a political project.
                For, while Amalia and Eduardo love poetry, their main aim is to destroy Rosas and,
                as the novel demonstrates, it is a political struggle in which they will one day

                Napoleón; porque has de saber, mi Amalia, que Byron no aborrecía a Napoleón, pero
                tenía celos de su gloria, por cuanto sabía el taimado inglés que con él y con
                Napoleón debían morir las dos grandes glorias de su siglo, y con toda su alma

                lofty esteem that Byron’s work enjoyed in Argentina’s literary circles throughout
                the nineteenth century. As we see, Byron’s impact in Latin America elicited

            <p>The literary coteries of Brazil in the early to mid-nineteenth century were,
                according to a number of accounts, packed to the rafters with poets who suffered
                from acute Byromania. As the Brazilian novelist José de Alencar recalls, when he was
                a student in the Law Faculty of the University of São Paolo, everyone wanted to be
                like Byron:

                The members, for example, of the Epicurus Society had a penchant for Byron-inspired
                and alcohol-fuelled sessions involving desecration in graveyards, black magic,
                Satanism, and orgies lasting a fortnight (Freire 26–50; Magalhães Júnior 45–54), and
                the most prominent Byromaniac of all was Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo. The
                critic Ronald de Carvalho once called Álvares de Azevedo’s poetry “Byronesque”
                (“byroniana”; Pacheco Jordão 3) and the name stuck. While studying at the Colégio

            The Brazilian poet, as this poem demonstrates, used Byron as a poetic lens through
                which he could survey his life, his emotions and the inhabitants of São Paolo. This
                type of bracketing of his experience within, as it were, Byron’s algorithm is also
                evident in Álvares de Azevedo’s frequent use of quotations drawn from Byron’s work
                as epigraphs for his poems (see Álvares de Azevedo 171, 233, 279, 319, 328, 390,
                396, 412, 419, 450). He was clearly obsessed with Byron, referring to him on
                numerous occasions in his Speech of Acceptance into Brazil’s Academic Society given
                on 9 May 1850 (Álvares de Azevedo 760–66), and he even at one stage began writing
                letters in English to his Portuguese-speaking mother (Álvares de Azevedo 775–76; <title level="a">My
                Cousin Inácio has been very bad with a gathering in his ear and has had leeches
                applied</title> 776). For Álvares de Azevedo, “Byron, sob seu manto negro de Don Juan,
                guardava no peito uma chaga dorida e funda” (Álvares de Azevedo 700). In his
                citation, bracketing and re-working of Byron’s work, Álvares de Azevedo focused on
                the gloomy, gothic and satanic side of the great English Romantic at the expense of
                that lighter side which had attracted Argentine readers.</p>

            <head>Bolívar and Byron</head>
            <p> Simón Bolívar never met Lord Byron but there were enough similarities in their lives
                to justify comparison. Their dates almost overlap&#8212;their respective birth-dates
                differing by five years (Bolívar was the older) and their deaths by just six years
                (Byron died in 1824, Bolívar in 1830)&#8212;and both were seen by their contemporaries as
                great men of their time. Unlike Byron, who gained his fame as one of the leading
                lights of English Romanticism, Bolívar forged his career as a soldier and a
                politician, and he single-handedly liberated half of the Sub-Continent of South
                America. In 1815, he published <title level="m">La carta de Jamaica</title> (<title level="m">The Jamaican
                Letter</title>) which eloquently made the case for Spanish America’s Independence from
                Spain. In the summer of 1816, Bolívar declared the freedom of slaves in the Americas
                (Lynch 109). The Congress of Angostura held in February 1819 solidified Bolívar’s
                place as supreme leader of the new Republic of Venezuela (Bushnell,
                <title level="m">Simón Bolívar</title> 96), while his decisive victory against Spain’s
                royalist troops at Boyacá in August 1819 led to the Independence of New Granada and
                the creation of Colombia (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón Bolívar</title> 108–11).
                Bolívar was committed to the independence as well as union of the newly-formed
                states of Spanish America, and&#8212;while it was still unpopular to do so in many parts
                of the Sub-Continent&#8212;he was unconditionally opposed to the existence of slavery and
                racism in the New World. He explicitly rejected the use of race as a divide among
                the different populations from which he sought to forge one unified nation (see
                Aguilar Rivera). But for all his idealism, Bolívar was a pragmatist, and he knew his
                dreams would be hard to achieve. As he pointed out in <title level="m">La carta de
                    Jamaica</title>:
                <quote>
                No somos indios ni europeos, sino una especie media entre los legítimos propietarios
                del país y los usrpadores españoles; en suma, siendo nosotros amerianos por
                nacimiento y nuestros derechos los de Europa, tenemos que disputar éstos a los del
                país y que mantenernos en él contra la invasión de los invasores; así nos hallamos
                en el caso más extroardinario y complicado. (Bolívar 46)
                </quote>
                Self-determination and a mixed population went hand in glove in Bolívar’s proposed
                blueprint for an independent and free nation. The great Venezuelan leader “proposed
                a unitary state, with a life-president and a system of indirect election of some
                officials,” characterized by a “moral power” which would be exercised by censors who
                would “oversee the operation of the school system, the behavior of individuals, the
                protection of the constitution, and the rights of the people” (Fitzgerald 8). One
                striking feature of Bolívar’s proposed system was that he “felt that England should
                ally itself with the Spanish-American countries” (Fitzgerald 8). Indeed, it was no
                secret that Bolívar admired British parliamentarianism (Bushnell, <title level="a">Introduction</title>
                xlii), and this would have caught the eye of a Member of the House of Lords, as
                Byron was at this time. Indeed, from a young age, Byron had been intent on a career
                in politics with poetry initially being only a secondary interest. In the first
                speech he gave to the House of Lords, in 1812, he expressed his opposition to the
                heavy hand of social control by arguing against the bill calling for the punishment
                by death of “Luddites” who were destroying industrial machinery; his belief in
                freedom even at the expense of the authority of the State and the Church was unusual
                for the time. </p>
            <p> Perhaps even more significant, Bolívar and Byron could both trace back their
                political awakening to an admiration of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was during the period
                1804–1806 that Bolívar, living in Europe at the time, experienced a political
                awakening that was caused by Napoleon’s ascension to power (Lynch 24–25;
                    44–45).<note place="foot" resp="author">Bushnell notes that Bolívar was
                        “captivated by, and frankly admired, the cult of glory that was so
                        important a trait of the French leader and that Bolívar would not
                        hesitate to imitate in due course” (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón
                            Bolívar</title> 11).</note> Byron, for his part, had

            The figure of Napoleon here&#8212;as one critic has noted, “extreme in both grandeur and

                from his is “our” despair. Byron sympathized with Napoleon as the tragic hero and
                saw in him a version of the complicated syntax of his own life.</p>
            <p>As his biographer Bernard Blackstone points outs, Byron, by the end of 1819&#8212;that is,
                precisely when Bolívar’s star was rising in the New World&#8212;was growing tired of his
                life in Europe (“an outworn portion of the globe,” as he called it), and, by October
                1819, he was actively making plans to emigrate to Venezuela (Blackstone 308). As
                Byron wrote in a letter to John Cam Hobhouse from Venice, dated October 3, 1819:
                <quote>
                My South American project, of which I believe I spoke to you (as you mention it)&#8212;was

                offers were&#8212;or are to be held out to settlers in the Venezuela territory. My affairs
                in England are nearly settled or in prospect of settlement; in Italy I have no
                debts, and I could leave it when I choose. The Anglo-Americans are a little too
                coarse for me, and their climate too cold, and I should prefer the others. I could
                soon grapple with the Spanish language. Ellice or others would get me letters to
                Bolivar and his government, and if men of little, or no property are encouraged
                there, surely with present income, and&#8212;if I could sell Rochdale&#8212;with some capital, I
                might be suffered as a landholder there, or at least a tenant, and if possible, and

                Byron was clearly excited by the news arriving from the New World about Bolívar’s
                adventures, and it is fitting, therefore, that he should have named an instrument of
                his own adventures after the great Venezuelan. In January 1822, Byron found himself
                in northern Italy with a fellow Englishman, Shelley, and they decided that they
                would each buy a boat to entertain themselves in between writing their poetic
                    works.<note place="foot" resp="author">Byron was working on
                        <title level="m">Don Juan</title> at this time.</note>
                Ernest Hartley Coleridge takes up the story for us:
                <quote>
                At the beginning of the New Year, Byron and Shelley turned their thoughts to the sea.
                Two of the Pisa friends, Trelawny and Williams, were accomplished seamen, and,
                acting on their advice and recommendation, Byron commissioned a certain Captain
                Roberts, who was an authority on boat-building, to build an open boat for Shelley,
                and large decked one for his own use. In due course, a schooner, the
                    <title level="m">Bolivar</title>, was built for Byron, and Shelley was provided with a
                boat thirty feet long, which Trelawny christened <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,
                but the owner insisted on re-naming the <title level="m">Ariel</title>. To be near,
                Shelley had taken a villa on the Gulf of Spezia. (Hartley Coleridge xlvi)
                </quote>
                In January 1822&#8212;when Byron named his boat after Bolívar&#8212;the Venezuelan was already
                planning his next decisive attack on Quito (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón
                    Bolívar</title> 124–26), from where, once consolidated, he would then strike at the
                heart of Spain’s control-post in Latin America, Lima.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">In July 1822 Bolívar had met with the other great
                            Liberator of Spanish America, José de San Martín, and had in effect
                            banished him from future influence in the liberation of Spanish America
                            (Lynch 172–75). And, then, on December 1824 Bolívar’s troops, at the
                            Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru’s principal Andean city, had defeated
                            Spain’s royalist army, leading to the unconditional surrender of all of
                            Spain’s forces in Peru and Upper Peru, and thereby made Spanish America
                            free from Spain’s control (Lynch 193–95). In August 1825 a new country
                            was created, and named after Bolívar, Bolivia (Lynch
                    198–200).</note> Byron had expressed admiration for other freedom
                causes in the past&#8212;he once sympathized with France’s cause, as expressed in Napoleon
                Bonaparte’s ambitions, as mentioned above, and he had expressed support for Italian
                freedom by supporting the Carbonari (Blackstone 309)&#8212;but it was Bolívar’s fight for
                independence, its temerity and the seeming hopelessness of the quest, that struck a
                chord in Byron’s soul.</p>
            <p>Byron’s decision to buy a boat along with Shelley was, as it turned out, an
                ill-fated event&#8212;on July 7, 1822 Shelley drowned in a tragic accident while sailing
                in the <title level="m">Ariel</title> with Williams in the Gulf
                of Spezia. The bodies of Shelley and Williams were discovered not far from the beach
                at Viareggio, and Byron and his companion, Leigh Hunt, decided to conduct a proper
                funeral for them on the lake-shore (Hartley Coleridge xlvi–xlvii). As Byron wrote in
                a letter to Moore dated August 27, 1822:
                <quote>
                We have been burning the bodies of Shelley and Williams on the sea-shore, to render
                them fit for removal and regular interment. You can have no idea what an
                extraordinary effect such a funeral pile has on a desolate shore, with mountains in
                the back-ground and the sea before, and the singular appearance the salt and
                frankincense gave to the flame. All of Shelley was consumed except his
                <emph>heart</emph>, which would not take the flame, and is now preserved
                in spirits of wine. (Barzun 235)
                </quote>
                Byron even swam out to see his own boat, the <title level="m">Bolivar</title>, which
                was moored nearby to the beach while Shelley’s body was being consumed by the
                flames: “The other day at Viareggio, I thought proper to swim off to my schooner
                (the Bolivar) in the offing, and thence to shore again&#8212;about three miles, or better,
                in all” (Barzun 234). Byron appears to have experienced extreme and contradictory
                emotions as a result of Shelley’s untimely death, and, perhaps understandably,
                Shelley became something of a “troubling presence” in the collection of poems Byron
                was composing at that time, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (Bloom 24).</p>
            <p>It is surely no coincidence that Byron decided&#8212;just fourteen months after naming his
                boat the <title level="m">Bolivar</title>&#8212;to embrace the cause of Greek Independence
                and journey to Greece in order to save it from tyranny. Byron had been contacted by
                the “Greek Committee,” based in London and consisting of Jeremy Bentham, Lord
                Erskine, Sir James Mackintosh, and J.C. Hobhouse, and unanimously made a member of
                that committee which was fighting on behalf of Greece’s Independence.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author">For a discussion of the connections between
                            Bentham and Bolívar, see Hart 336.</note> The vote occurred on
                March 14, 1822, and, as Byron suggested to Thomas Moore in a letter dated August 27,
                1822: “I had, and still have, thoughts of South America, but am fluctuating between
                it and Greece. I should have gone, long ago, to one of them, but for my liaison with
                the Countess G.; for love, in these days, is little compatible with glory” (Barzun).
                The important point to be drawn from this extract is that Byron saw South America
                and Greece, in the summer of 1822, as offering alternative routes to a similar end.</p>
            <p>By the end of the summer, as he told Trelawny, Byron was “at last determined to go
                to Greece” (Hartley Coleridge li). He subsequently sold the
                <title level="m">Bolivar</title> and he bought a bigger ship, the
                <title level="m">Hercules</title>. He then sailed to the west
                coast of Cephalonia, recruited a small army, and initiated high-level diplomatic
                negotiations in preparation for an attack on the mainland. As Byron informed J.C.
                Hobhouse, in a letter dated April 7, 1823, he had “even offered to go up to the
                Levant in July, if the Greek provisional government think that I could be of any
                use” (Barzun 240). As he wrote to Augusta Leigh on October 12, 1823:
                <quote>
                You ask me why I came up amongst the Greeks? It was stated to me that my so doing
                might tend to their advantage in some measure in their present struggle for
                independence, both as an individual and as a member for the Committee now in
                England. How far this may be realized I cannot pretend to anticipate, but I am
                willing to do what I can. (Barzun 250)
                </quote>
                It was while Byron was getting ready for the attack that, as so often in his life, he
                turned to his poetry as an outlet for mulling over his actions. And thus we find
                that, even while he was bent on liberating Greece, Bolívar was still in his
                thoughts. Byron began <title level="m">The Age of Bronze</title> in December 1822 and
                he finished it on January 10, 1823, and in this collection of poems the Liberator is
                portrayed as a modern-day titan, part of the political thunder and lightning that
                created freedom in the New World, emerging first in the Northern hemisphere and then
                spreading to the Sub-Continent:

            It was this spark of the “good old days,” as Byron goes on to suggest, that was
                behind the breath of fresh air ushering in freedom in the Atlantic nations:

                </quote>
            The important point here, as far as Byron was concerned, was that the recently
                founded nations of the New World could breathe new life into the veins of a Europe
                that was tired (“outworn,” he says), and had lost its way:

            Clearly the example of the liberation of the New World was inspirational for Byron in
                those crucial years from 1819 onwards when he was contemplating how to implement
                greater freedom in the world. Though Bolívar was not a major figure in Byron’s
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, nevertheless the political rebellion of Peru is
                recalled: Cadiz is described as the “mart of the colonial trade (…) before Peru
                learned to rebel” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Canto II, Chapter V; Hartley
                Coleridge 805).</p>
            <p>With the benefit of hindsight we can see Byron’s mission to liberate Greece as
                doomed from the start, for Byron was attempting to re-create Bolívar’s
                “criollo”-backed independence movement in a diametrically opposed political
                environment. Byron’s journey to Greece in 1823 is redolent in a sense of Che
                Guevara’s ill-fated mission to Bolivia in 1967, which sought to make the Revolution
                happen in a place it couldn’t happen. As the letters penned during this period
                demonstrate, Byron was having all sorts of problems in Messalonghi, including
                dealing with internal dissension among the Greek factions, bouts of illness
                (apoplexy or epilepsy), enormous debts, earthquakes, and narrow escapes from the
                Turks (Howarth 456–61). Before he had even mustered sufficient forces to launch an
                attack on the mainland, Byron was struck down by fever, and he died off the shores
                of Greece on April 19, 1824. As Hartley Coleridge notes: “The Greeks were
                heartbroken at the death of their hero” (Hartley Coleridge lv). To this day, Greeks
                see Byron’s death as a personal tragedy for the Greek nation (Trayiannoudi).</p>
            <p>Byron’s relationship with the world outside the British Isles, as portrayed in the
                excellent two-volume book on <title level="m">The Reception of Byron in Europe</title>
                (ed. Richard Cardwell), demonstrates how Byronism took on “local colors” in
                different parts of the world. Our own study of Latin America’s Byron has
                investigated a similar range of receptivities to Byromania in different
                countries&#8212;ranging from the brooding and dark Byron in Brazil to the ethereal and
                uplifting one in Argentina&#8212;but it has also uncovered something unique about the
                relationship between Byron and Latin America, namely, that his “light” travelled
                not, as elsewhere, as if obeying a one-way system but that it produced a
                “chiaroscuro” effect when it arrived in Latin America. The Latin American prism was
                suddenly transformed into a mirror capable of bouncing Byron’s light back to its
                source. Bolívar’s military as well as political successes, as noted above, clearly
                had an impact on Byron between 1819 and his premature death in 1824; these events
                persuaded the great English poet to grasp the nettle of the independence movement in
                Greece, lay down his pen, and take up his sword. It was not all in vain, though, for
                those “whom the Gods love die young” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Canto IV,
                Chapter IV; Hartley Coleridge 844).</p>
