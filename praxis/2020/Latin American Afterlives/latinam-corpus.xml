               <head>About this Volume</head>
               <p rend="noCount">This volume investigates the afterlives of British Romantic poets
                    in the Hispanophone world with an emphasis on Latin American authors. Reframing
                    the outdated model of a European center and a New World periphery, we ask the
                    following questions: To what extent has translation shaped or impeded the
                    dissemination of otherwise global Romantic texts throughout countries like
                    Argentina, Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela? How do Latin American
                    reinterpretations of Romantic texts assume or elide the colonial burdens of
                    influence from English works, as compared to those imposed by continental
                    Spanish texts? How do Latin American writers negotiate their position in
                    relation to a European literary and cultural canon? And in what ways do these
                    Anglo-Latino interactions differ from those recently explored in transatlantic
                    studies, of North America, the West Indies and the Black Atlantic?</p>
               <p rend="noCount">Featuring
                    paired essays on Byron, Shelley, and Keats, we trace afterlives anchored around
                    the three major second-generation poets. Their points of connection with the
                    Luso-Hispanic world are prominent writers of the nineteenth and twentieth
                    centuries whose intellectual curiosity and cosmopolitanism bridge the British
                    Isles with Central and South America, as well as with Spain. The following
                    studies compose a collection of echoes, reflections, and translations of the
                    English Romantics in Spanish and Portuguese. The works of José Marmol, Manuel
                    Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, Martín Zapata, Luis Cernuda, Alejo Carpentier, Jorge
                    Luis Borges, and Julio Cortázar constitute the tiles of this multicolored
                    mosaic. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This volume was designed and encoded at the University of
                    Colorado, Boulder by Site Manager Cayla Eagon and Technical Editor Dave
                    Rettenmaier at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. The initial
                    transformation from WORD Doc to TEI P5 was made using the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/#">OxGarage</ref> tool, with further
                    TEI markup modifications according to RC house style. TEI renders text in
                    archival quality for better preservation and future access. Laura Mandell and
                    Dave Rettenmaier developed the modified versions of the XSLT transforms provided
                    by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</ref> that were used to
                    convert the TEI files into HTML. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> The <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> is
                    devoted to using computer technologies for the contemporary critical
                    investigation of the languages, cultures, histories, and theories of
                    Romanticism. Tracking the circulation of Romanticism within these interrelated
                    domains of knowledge, <title level="j">RCPS</title> recognizes as its conceptual
                    terrain a world where Romanticism has, on the one hand, dissolved as a period
                    and an idea into a plurality of discourses and, on the other, retained a
                    vigorous, recognizable hold on the intellectual and theoretical discussions of
                    today. <title level="j">RCPS</title> is committed to mapping out this terrain
                    with the best and most exciting critical writing of contemporary Romanticist
                    scholarship.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of
                    English Romanticism. However, authors from Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo to
                    Julio Cortázar have innovatively transformed the works of the British Romantics
                    through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links of aesthetic
                    closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their chronological and
                    geographical separation. The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and Keats by
                    Hispanophone and Lusophone writers are marked by authority, whimsy, and
                    adventure, often evoking a sense of playful irreverence. Afterlives from these
                    perspectives help to decenter the Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study,
                    helping to mitigate the exclusivity of a field that centers an entire literary
                    and cultural universe within a span of fifty years on the British Isles. In
                    essays by Stephen and Jordan Hart, Juan Jesús Payan, Omar Miranda, Gabriel
                    Insausti, Marco Ramírez Rojas, and Olivia Loksing Moy, one common strand that
                    emerges is how these authors confront questions of cultural marginality and
                    belatedness. The various transformations of the major British Romantic poets
                    studied in these contributions conjure up new figures with which to populate our
                    familiar canon: an alternately dour or ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares
                    de Azevedo); a more pragmatic Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats
                    (Cortázar).</p>

                  <p>In 1886, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo composed an invocation to Byron in
                        Portuguese, posing the fashionable English lord as his muse. Byromania had
                        spread amongst the literary coteries of Brazil, where, “at the University of
                        São Paolo, everyone wanted to be like Byron” (Stephen and Jordan Hart,
                            <title level="a">Latin America’s Byron</title>). In the 1940s, while in
                        exile in Cambridge during the Spanish Civil War, Luis Cernuda looked to
                        Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (1840) to
                        better understand his own role in society as a poet, questioning how he
                        might alleviate the suffering of man in the practical world. In 1972, Jorge
                        Luis Borges sang to Keats in a sonnet invoking his Grecian urn, echoing the
                        song of the nightingale from Keats’s 1819 ode.</p>
                  <p>It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of English
                        Romanticism. Despite the long and influential relations between the British
                        Empire and the countries of South and Central America, it is surprising that
                        instead of multiple cultural bridges, there appear only a few scattered
                        paths linking Romantic writers to the Latin American intellectual tradition.
                        England not only played a fundamental role in the independence of countries
                        like Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, but also exerted a fundamental
                        influence in the process of industrialization and modernization throughout
                        the continent, including certain territories in Brazil. Throughout the
                        nineteenth century, railroads in Latin America were built by British
                        companies, industries were created under the supervision and much to the
                        profit of English investors, and market networks were developed to
                        facilitate the circulation of capital across the Atlantic. Similarly, waves
                        of immigration brought considerable numbers of British citizens to settle in
                        major developing cities, as well as in rural areas that needed to be
                        industrially developed. How is it possible, then, that this tremendous
                        economic, social, and political impact was not readily reflected in the
                        Luso-Hispanic literary productions of the time?</p>
                  <p>In this volume, we examine a selection of prominent writers and works framed
                        within the lines of British-Luso-Hispanic dialogues. In the essays that
                        follow, Romanticist and Hispanophone scholars trace the reception of the
                        British Romantics in Latin America and Spain through circulation,
                        translation, and adaptation. Each of these studies highlights major
                        obstacles that have historically impeded the transmission of English
                        Romantic works into a language that is, for historical and geographic
                        reasons, a very important neighbor. In many cases, the research offered by
                        the scholars here exposes a surprising dearth in transmission—a paucity of
                        references, or the surprisingly late date of published translations. They
                        also challenge the assumption that Latin American nations would
                        automatically identify with Romantic revolutionary ideals, superimposing
                        these upon their own political contexts and paving the way for plentiful
                        adaptations. Hispanophone authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
                        do not necessarily adopt a tone of identification with English cultural or
                        political paradigms, but, rather, engage in critical readings and creative
                        adaptations. Despite these rich connections, the historical trajectory for
                        Latin American afterlives of the English Romantics is one of surprising
                        scarcity and belatedness. This collection aims to recuperate some of the
                        research, long overdue, along this line of transatlantic and translinguistic
                        conversation.</p>
                  <p>Comparative Romanticist studies have long privileged the languages of German,
                        French, and Italian. British Romanticism’s indebtedness to German
                        philosophy, literature, and art has yielded a dominant stronghold within the
                        field; the historical impetus of the French Revolution has made French an
                        essential area for serious comparativist work; while Shelley’s and Keats’s
                        years in Rome have established a strong Italian connection.<note place="foot" resp="author">The 2016 <title level="j">Romantic Circles

                            comparativist studies in German, Hebrew, French, and Japanese. But of
                            the major European languages, Spanish has received the least critical
                            attention in reception studies.</note> Yet the critical history of the
                        Romantics’ reception in Spanish, both in Europe and in Latin America, has
                        not garnered serious critical attention until the last decade. Gabriel
                        Insausti attributes this partly to the fact that “Spanish Romanticism had
                        historically been very weak and had not left behind any noteworthy poet,”
                        throwing Spanish writers into a condition of a “sort of late-yielding fruit”
                            (<title level="a">Toward Unity</title>). This volume investigates the
                        afterlives of British Romantic poets in the Hispanophone world with an
                        emphasis on Latin American authors. Reframing the outdated model of a
                        European center and a New World periphery, we ask the following questions:
                        To what extent has translation shaped or impeded the dissemination of
                        otherwise global Romantic texts throughout countries like Argentina, Cuba,
                        Colombia, and Venezuela? How do Latin American reinterpretations of Romantic
                        texts assume or elide the colonial burdens of influence from English works,
                        as compared to those imposed by continental Spanish texts? How do Latin
                        American writers negotiate their position in relation to a European literary
                        and cultural canon? And in what ways do these Anglo-Latino interactions
                        differ from those recently explored in transatlantic studies, of North
                        America, the West Indies and the Black Atlantic?</p>
                  <p>Major critical advances tracing Hispanophone connections to British
                        Romanticism have been spearheaded by Joselyn Almeida-Beveridge, whose <title level="m">Reimagining the Transatlantic, 1780–1890</title> (Ashgate
                        2011) identifies the pan-Atlantic as an integral force in Britain during the
                        Age of the Revolutions. The pan-Atlantic, a public sphere of exchange,
                        prominently shaped the shared political ideals of Britain, Africa, and the
                        non-Anglophone Americas in mutual ways, with Spain and Latin American forces
                        influencing English Romantic ideals of humanity, nation, and freedom.
                        Almeida-Beveridge’s 2010 collection of essays, <title level="m">Romanticism
                            and the Anglo-Hispanic Imaginary</title>, reveals the continued presence
                        of South and Central American culture within the British canon and the
                        English literary imagination, particularly in the context of the Peninsular
                        War and the Wars of Latin American Independence. These studies chart the
                        dialogues of Latin American and Spanish intellectuals that took place in
                        British territory during the crucial years of Latin American independence
                            movements.<note place="foot" resp="author">See <title level="a">Esa gran

                        Thomas Cochrane, whose active revolutionary role left an impact on Chile,

                        tracing the valorization of Spain within the English cultural imagination.

                  <p>This volume traces such influences but in the opposite direction, often
                        working through lines of transmission in Spain but focusing primarily on
                        authors from Latin America. We explore how Hispanophone writers received,
                        reworked, and incorporated the works of the English poets into their own
                        literary traditions. Often, these authors faced a linguistic barrier,
                        immersing themselves in British literature while improving their English
                        language skills through work as translators. The essays we have included
                        analyze how Anglophone Romantic sources have been read, questioned, and
                        adapted to their own local realities. Building upon Almeida-Beveridge’s and
                        Saglia and Haywood’s collections that explore eighteenth- and
                        nineteenth-century exchanges, we investigate how these interactions extend
                        through the twentieth century and recalibrate the cultural balance between
                        the Hispanic and the Anglophone spheres.</p>
                  <p>Featuring paired essays on Byron, Shelley, and Keats, we trace afterlives
                        anchored around the three major second-generation poets. Their points of
                        connection with the Luso-Hispanic world are prominent writers of the
                        nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose intellectual curiosity and
                        cosmopolitanism bridge the British Isles with Central and South America, as
                        well as with Spain. The following studies compose a collection of echoes,
                        reflections, and translations of the English Romantics in Spanish and
                        Portuguese. The works of José Marmol, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo,
                        Martín Zapata, Luis Cernuda, Alejo Carpentier, Jorge Luis Borges, and Julio
                        Cortázar constitute the tiles of this multicolored mosaic.</p>
                  <p>Given the historical asymmetry of the political and historical relations
                        between Spain, Latin America, and the British Empire, one common strand that
                        emerges among the articles is how these authors confront questions of
                        cultural marginality and belatedness. Contrary to the assumptions of most
                        Anglophone readers, the theme of marginality in the Latin American
                        afterlives of English Romantic writers is not necessarily one of Eurocentric
                        exclusion or rejection. The Latin American works studied in these essays are
                        defined neither by imitative idolatry nor a sense of colonial anxiety. On
                        the contrary, they present different strategies of cultural negotiation that
                        allow them to contest assumptions of subordination or respectful deference.
                        The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and Keats by Hispanophone authors are
                        marked by authority, whimsy, and adventure, often evoking a sense of playful
                        irreverence. These authors innovatively transform the works of their
                        predecessors through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links
                        of aesthetic closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their
                        chronological separation. Major figures like Borges, Cortázar, and
                        Carpentier also function as savvy critics of the English Romantic tradition;
                        they conscientiously position their writings within two literary traditions
                        with a full understanding of their historical, national, and generic
                        repercussions. Afterlives from these perspectives help to decenter the
                        Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study, helping to mitigate the exclusivity
                        of a field that centers an entire literary and cultural universe within a
                        span of fifty years on the British Isles. The various transformations of the
                        major British Romantic poets studied in these contributions conjure up new
                        figures with which to populate our familiar canon: an alternately dour or
                        ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares de Azevedo); a more pragmatic
                        Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats (Cortázar).</p>
                  <p>Our overdue recognition of the Latin-American reception of English Romantics
                        comes at a timely moment, particularly within the current political climate
                        of the United States, where the rhetoric is increasingly one of insular
                        nationalism and discrimination toward our Spanish-speaking neighbors. The
                        imperative to “speak English!” and only English in schools and public spaces
                        runs counter to the Romantic spirit of openness, imagination, and respect
                        for the rights of the individual. With this volume, we wish to demonstrate
                        the obvious: that the ability to work in neighboring languages only enriches
                        our research in the academy and injects life into our Anglophone canon.
                        Moreover, the work we value and make visible through publications and
                        teaching should recognize too the fundamental role that Latin American,
                        including Brazilian, authors played in the global production of Romantic
                        literary legacies. This rings especially true when an increasingly diverse
                        professoriate and graduate cohorts include many talented bilingual scholars
                        of Latin American descent. Beginning with the content of our research, we
                        envision an academia in which fluency in Spanish is viewed as an asset in
                        comparative Romantic studies on an equal plane with proficiency in German,
                        French, and Italian.</p>
                  <p>While developments in World Literature studies have called for a shift away
                        from an assumed Anglocentrism, made evident in manifestos such as Aamar
                        Mufti’s <title level="m">Forget English!</title>, we suggest that these
                        sentiments apply, ever so counterintuitively, to the field of British
                        Romantic studies. To propose that English Romanticists might turn away from
                        English is not an unfounded proposition. As C.C. Wharram asked in his 2014
                        preface, <title level="a">Objects of Translation(s),</title> “Why do we
                        decide in advance that ‘British’ necessarily entails the elimination of all
                        voices not originating in British and in English?” Suh-Reen Han’s <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> volume on <title level="m">English Romanticism in East Asia</title> answers this call, extending
                        Romantic studies to a global scale, showcasing the skills of bilingual
                        scholars who engage deeply in historical study and close readings in
                        Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. These essays help studies in “foreign”
                        languages find a home under the aegis of our discipline. Special issues of
                            <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title> and <title level="j">Romantic Circles Praxis</title> on the Black Atlantic and Black
                        Romanticism, as well as the <title level="j">European Romantic
                            Review</title> issue on the <title level="a">Literature of
                            Abolition,</title> do the important postcolonial work of pushing British
                        Romanticism into regions that force recognition of the most uncomfortable
                        corners of our literary tradition (Youngquist and Pace; Youngquist and
                        Botkin; Chander and Matthew). This courageous scholarship transcends
                        geographic, national, and racial borders with an ear bent towards historical
                        justice. It demonstrates that Romantic studies need not remain divorced from
                        efforts in modernist, Americanist, and medieval literary studies to resist
                        an exclusive and exclusionary Anglocentric impetus—that Romanticism’s
                        privileging of the Big Six need not preclude global scholarship. We now
                        raise this challenge to scholars who might combine the transatlantic
                            <emph>and</emph> the translingual, encouraging multilingual researchers
                        who can help locate the legacy of Romanticism today in what used to be
                        unforeseen pockets of the globe. This collection serves as an invitation for
                        further research into Latin American afterlives of the Romantic writers,
                        promoting the scholarship of yet undiscovered translations, adaptations, and
                        responses that will continue to expand the transatlantic canon.</p>

                  <p>The first essay of the volume begins broadly and on a celebratory note,
                        exploring ideas of Romantic celebrity and the international circulation of
                        personality in the southern hemisphere. In <title level="a">Latin America’s
                            Byron,</title> Stephen and Jordan Hart explore ways in which Latin
                        America and English Romanticism “clashed and overlapped during the
                        nineteenth century” in their portrayals of Lord Byron. They trace how
                        Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José
                        Mármol, who recontextualized the character of Manfred in an Argentine
                        setting, and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, who
                        projects a Don Juan figure in his Portuguese poems. This study offers a
                        glimpse into the fervid Byromania spreading amongst young intellectuals in
                        the Southern Cone. Hart and Hart propose that Byron’s image was ultimately
                        viewed in Latin America through a diversifying <emph>chiaroscuro</emph>
                        effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was “luminous and ethereal,” while
                        Brazil’s Byron was “dark and brooding.” But this influence exerted by Byron
                        was not unidirectional. Indeed, the essay concludes by suggesting ways in
                        which Simón Bólivar served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both
                        literary freedom and political independence.</p>
                  <p>We continue tracing Byron’s afterlives with a translation study by Juan Jesús
                        Payán, who bypasses the more obvious Hispanic connections of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> to focus on the lingering imprint of Byron’s
                        Gothic valences instead. <title level="a">Translative Vampires: Martín
                            Zapata and the Early Fate of <title>The Giaour</title>
                     </title> explores
                        the often unfaithful translations of Byron’s <title level="m">The
                            Giaour</title> into Spanish, especially in light of their prosification
                        and importation across genres. Focusing on a short narrative adaptation by
                        the Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, Payán shows how the very
                        choice of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> as his source material, in the
                        context of Argentine intellectual and political tensions, was a daring
                        statement unto itself. Comparing this to previous renderings of Byron’s
                        works into the Spanish language—both in Spain and in Latin
                        America—Payán highlights the exceptionality of Zapata’s version,
                        pointing out that the Argentine was the first to provide a direct adaptation
                        from the original text, and also the only one to truly preserve the vampiric
                        elements of the plot. Performing a political reading, Payán understands
                        Zapata’s translation as an element of disruption that challenges the
                        divisions between “Civilization” and “Barbarism” upheld by his contemporary,
                        Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Complicating the Orientalist paradigm because it
                        “focalizes through the perspective of the traditional Other,” <title level="m">El Giaur</title> (sic) shows Zapata challenging the binary
                        categorizations of good/evil, East/West, and modernity/backwardness in the
                        context of nineteenth-century Argentina.</p>
                  <p>We move from translation to adaptation in Omar F. Miranda’s <title level="a">
                        <title level="m">Prometeo Desencadenado</title>: The Translation of
                            Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> in the
                            Spanish-American Tradition.</title> This essay unpacks the Shelleyan
                        inspiration and thematic echoes in a well-known classic by the Cuban
                        novelist, Alejo Carpentier. In his reevaluation of <title level="m">Los
                            pasos perdidos</title>, Miranda traces the Hispanophone afterlife of one
                        of Shelley’s more difficult works. Revivified in the postmodern imagination
                        of Carpentier, the drama of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is
                        recast in New York City, Caracas, and the South American jungle, combining
                        elements of mystical settings, lyric, dramatic style, and philosophic
                        attempts at “reversing human error.” This novel, written in Venezuela in
                        1950 and considered a precursor to magical realism, is, Miranda argues,
                        “perhaps one of the most earnest and profound engagements with Shelley’s
                        text since the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century.” This
                        statement is supported by the relative dearth of Spanish-language receptions
                        of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, in both Spain and Latin
                        America, which for nearly two centuries has only seen partial translations
                        and even fewer adaptations. Miranda contextualizes his analysis of <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> by turning to an article from 1922
                        in the radical Venezuelan newspaper <title level="j">El Universal</title>,
                        which commemorates the centenary of Shelley’s death. This column, written by
                        Edouard Herriot, who eventually became prime minister of France, praises
                            <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> and venerates Shelley for
                        his “current” and “eternal” poetic ideals. Besides these two homages by
                        Herriot and Carpentier, Latin American afterlives of this closet drama are
                        sparse. Adding to the fact that <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                        was not translated in full into Spanish until 1994, Miranda’s research
                        reaffirms the surprising belatedness of the Hispanophone reception of
                        Shelley’s text.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth essay of this volume, <title level="a">Toward Unity: Cernuda
                            and English Romanticism,</title> Gabriel Insausti presents a capacious
                        study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and his poetic appropriation of the
                        English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A member of the Generation of
                        '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War to deliver
                        lectures at Oxford and Cambridge; he traveled to Glasgow, Cambridge, and
                        London through 1947; and finally settled in Mexico, never to return to
                        Spain. As an exile in Scotland and England, his writing, criticism, and
                        translations felt the influence of Shakespeare, Blake, Wordsworth,
                        Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Browning, and Eliot. In his essay, Insausti
                        pinpoints a Cernudian reading of Romanticism that raises problems unique to
                        his geographical positioning and literary historical moment: The Spanish
                        poet encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the
                        era, negotiating questions of poetry’s ethical value and pertinence during
                        an era of modern warfare. Reading <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry</title> and echoing Shelley a century later, Cernuda asks, “What
                        is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” he decides, “but also has certain
                        social effects.” A poet and translator himself, Insausti offers an
                        encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own
                        poetics, negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while
                        balancing his Romantic interests against contemporary Modernist
                        pressures.</p>
                  <p>Our volume ends with two contributions featuring the afterlife of John Keats
                        in Latin America. Marco Ramírez Rojas focuses on the poet’s reception and
                        critical influence through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar,
                        two great giants of Argentine letters. In <title level="a">Keatsians in
                            Argentina: Borges’s Nightingale and Cortázar’s Chameleon,</title>
                        Ramírez argues that both writers depicted and identified Keats as a
                        misunderstood figure who needed to be rescued by their intervention. In this
                        vein, they seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own intellectual
                        community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” This
                        focus on Argentina as a major site of literary transmission for Keats is
                        historically interesting, considering the high rates of European immigration
                        to the country in the nineteenth century and the accompanying nostalgia for
                        British literature, encouraged by a “sort of pro-British snobbery” that
                        pervaded Buenos Aires high society. Ramírez’s reading of Borges’s 1952 essay
                            <title level="a">Keats’s Nightingale</title> stages, through a
                        philosophical defense of Keats, a petition for appropriating Keats into a
                        Latin American space that is presented as more suitable for understanding
                        the Romantic poet. The second half of this essay explores the lengthy
                        creative treatise titled <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> by
                        Cortázar, in which Ramírez theorizes the role of the biographer as a
                        chameleon figure. Through his deep identification and sense of camaraderie
                        with Keats, Cortázar overlaps temporalities with the poet and meets him in a
                        shared “Latin American time” with strong political implications. Cortázar’s
                        connection to Keats emulates the ideas of Negative Capability and the
                        chameleon figure, mirroring a state of poetic annihilation and
                        self-identification.</p>
                  <p>The final essay of the collection, by Olivia Loksing Moy, offers a closer
                        look at <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, Cortázar’s literary
                        biography from the 1950s. <title level="a">To Carry Keats in Your Pocket:
                            Julio Cortázar’s Everyman Poet</title> explores the amphibious nature of
                        a book that oscillates between a rigorous work of criticism and a playful
                        work of fiction that defies all traditional classifications. Borrowing from
                        Cortázar’s short fiction, Moy uses the models of playing hopscotch and
                        blowing up photos to explain the work of a poet-critic that has been
                        rendered inaccessible to scholarship due to two defining characteristics:
                        its transtemporality and generic hybridity. It is her contention that the
                        “merging of time and epochs” which brings Keats, Shelley, and Hunt together
                        with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine intellectuals is a clever strategy,
                        proposing a defiant sense of timeless contemporaneity. Building upon the two
                        models of playing “hopscotch” and “blow-up,” drawn from the titles of two of
                        Cortázar’s most acclaimed works, Moy shows how the narrative of <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> skips around from year to year,
                        while also lingering and zooming in on key moments for biographical
                        exegesis. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for the biographer
                        to stage a direct dialogue with Keats and to personally inhabit a Romantic
                        universality, rendering the poet accessible to the Latin American
                        “everyman.” Stylistically and structurally, <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> also constitutes a novelty. Its “unprecedented merging of
                        fictional and non-fiction genres” includes the dense intertwining of poetic
                        devices, passages of free association and automatic writing, and an
                        overarching narrative structure. For Moy, the textual complexity of this
                        biography reflects a generic hybridity that draws from two lines of national
                        influence: Romantic poetry and the Latin American surrealist short story.
                        Cortázar consciously combines these two traditions without any anxiety of
                        influence. As he both showed and stated, Latin American literature, though
                        arriving a bit late, could “burst onto the literary scene” and enter
                        modernity “without all the baggage” of European literature (<title level="m">Literature Class</title> 31). By clarifying these aspects of
                        transtemporality and generic hybridity, Moy clears the path for further
                        investigations of <title level="m">Imagen</title>. Previously unavailable in
                        English translation, excerpts of <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> have now been published as a volume of Lost &amp; Found:
                        The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative. <title level="m">Julio y John,
                            caminando y conversando: Selections from <title level="m">Imagen de John
                                Keats</title>
                     </title> (2019) was edited and translated by Moy and
                        Rojas, who are completing a full critical translation of the text.</p>
                  <p>Each of the essays in this volume present a reworking of Bloomian influence
                        that has traditionally guided landmark transatlantic studies, such as Robert
                        Weisbuch’s <title level="m">Atlantic Double-Cross</title>. Earlier models of influence theory
                        unwittingly undergird binaries of an original and inferior copy, which in
                        the context of artists working across lines of race and nation can also
                        reinforce racist rationales of canonicity. These essays all consider
                        binaries, but ultimately explode or complicate them: Hart and Hart’s
                        engagement of light and dark, or <emph>chiaroscuro</emph>; Payán’s with
                        “Civilization and Barbarism”; Miranda’s with notions of the city and jungle;
                        Insausti’s with <foreign xml:lang="sp">la realidad y el deseo</foreign>;
                        Ramírez’s with center and periphery; and Moy’s with past and present,
                        fiction and nonfiction.<note place="foot" resp="author">We thank the

                  <title level="a">Latin America’s 'Chiaroscuro' Byron</title> explores the ways
                    in which Latin America and English Romanticism clashed and overlapped during the nineteenth
                    century in their portrayals of Lord Byron. Offering a glimpse into the fervid Byromania
                    spreading among young intellectuals in the Southern Cone, this essay traces how Byronic figures
                    were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José Mármol and by the Brazilian poet
                    Manuel Antônio Álvarez de Azevedo. Ultimately, Byron’s image was viewed in Latin America
                    through a diversifying chiaroscuro effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was luminous and
                    ethereal, but Brazil’s Byron was dark and brooding. But this influence exerted by Byron
                    was not unidirectional. The essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar
                    served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p>

                  <p>In this essay we intend to edge towards an understanding of the ways in which Latin
                America and English Romanticism—as epitomized by its most influential figure, Lord
                Byron (1788–1824)—clashed and overlapped during the long nineteenth century. This
                coming-together took a variety of forms: Lord Byron for example, had a profound
                influence on a number of nineteenth-century Latin American writers, including the
                Argentine novelist, José Mármol (1818–1871) who has a scene in his novel,
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> (1851), based on the reading of
                Byron’s poems, and the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo (1831–1852)
                whose work exudes Byromania. But the influence was not only one way. In the
                concluding section of our essay, we point to how the celebrated figure of Latin
                America’s independence, Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), encouraged Byron in his pursuit
                of not only literary but also political freedom.</p>
                  <p> It is well-known that Byron’s reputation abroad often eclipsed his stature in his
                homeland, where his morality was rejected by many as “questionable”—he was accused
                of sodomy while at school in Harrow, at university in Cambridge, and in the

                half-sister, Augusta Leigh—and for this reason Dean Ireland refused to accept his
                body for burial in Westminster Abbey when it arrived from Greece in the spring of
                1824.<note place="foot" resp="author">Byron was subsequently buried in the Church
                    of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</note> Seen as a hero in
                Greece, as a result of his struggles on behalf of Greek
                independence in the early 1820s (Trayiannoudi), Byron was also admired as the
                principal figure of Romanticism in a number of European countries, including France
                (Wilkes and Cochran), Switzerland (Giddey), Italy (Zuccato and Iamartino), Spain
                (Flitter and Cardwell), Portugal (Machado de Souza), Romania (Anghelescu), Germany
                (Pointner &amp; Geisenhanslüke), Holland (D’haen), the Czech Republic (Procházka),
                Poland (Modrzewska), Hungary (Rákai), Russia (Diakonova &amp; Vatsuro), Bulgaria
                (Kostadinova), Denmark (Nielsen), Norway (Tysdahl), Sweden (Elam), Armenia
                (Bekaryan), Georgia (Merabishvili) and Turkey (Demata). One of the aims of this
                essay is to provide some sense of the influence created in Latin America by Byron to
                complement Richard’s Cardwell two-volume study of
                <title level="m">The Reception of Byron in Europe</title> (2004).
                In Europe, as Cardwell suggests, Byron represented a “counterweight to the political
                aims of Europe’s rulers in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era” (<title level="a">Introduction</title> 1);
                he stood for “the struggle for the liberty of oppressed peoples and the struggle to
                define a new artistic language for the expression of that desire for freedom, social
                and individual” (<title level="a">Introduction</title> 1–2). To quote Cardwell once more, each recipient of
                Byron “adopted and adapted Byron to their needs; each individual writer employed
                Byron as a mirror to his own personal obsessions. Each nation used him to create
                their own literary history” (<title level="a">Introduction</title> 4). While no country in Latin America
                experienced Byromania as intensely as Spain did through the person of José de
                Espronceda (Churchman; Pujals; Flitter 138–41), Byron’s ideas, particularly his
                “revolt against Christian and rationalist belief” (Cardwell, <title level="a">Introduction</title> 2), had
                a definitive impact on various Latin American countries, and he became an icon
                standing for political as well as artistic freedom. That impact was not experienced,
                though, in a uniform way across Latin America; while Argentina’s Byron was luminous
                and ethereal, Brazil’s was dark and brooding. This was part and parcel, as we shall
                see, of Byron’s “chiaroscuro” effect in Latin America. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, on one specific count, Latin America’s Byron was sharply distinct from the
                European prototype. As we explore in the third section of this essay, Byron not only
                produced a concrete impact on writers across Latin America, he was also himself
                influenced in a number of crucial ways by one of Latin America’s most iconic
                figures, Simón Bolívar. This fact allows us to argue, as far as one of the iconic
                figures of English Romanticism is concerned, that Latin America was not simply a
                receptor of the “obliterating glare of Byronic light” (Barton 291),<note place="foot" resp="author">Barton uses this phrase in the context of her
                            discussion of how Barrett Browning was able to “negotiate” the
                            “obliterating glare of Byronic light” (Barton 291), and the same might
                            be argued of Latin America.</note> as occurred in a number of
                European countries, but was instead the catalyst for new ideas and new activities.
                The pendulum swinging between English Romanticism (as typified by Byron) and Latin
                America led to a chiaroscuro effect in which Latin America reflected back as much as
                it soaked up the “brilliance” and “light” emanating from England’s Romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a discussion of the central role played by

                  <head>Byron and Mármol</head>
                  <p>Though it is generally conceded that the two most important national forms of
                Romanticism that impacted Latin America were French (mainly in Río de la Plata) and
                Spanish Romanticism (above all in Mexico, Peru and Colombia; Carilla I: 42–45),
                English Romantic writers were also influential in Latin America. Carilla provides us
                with a list of the European writers who had the greatest impact in Spanish America
                in the Romantic period, and Byron—along with Walter Scott—is on that list.<note place="foot" resp="author">Carilla mentions Hugo, Byron, Chateaubriand,
                            Walter Scott, Larra, and Espronceda (Carilla 1: 59).</note> We find
                some clear evidence of the esteem in which Byron’s work was
                held in Argentina, for example, in Part III, Chapter VIII of José Mármol’s novel
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> (1851), entitled <title level="a">Preámbulo de un drama.</title> The main
                drama portrayed in Mármol’s novel is the struggle between the “Unitarios” and the
                “Federales” which tore Argentina apart in the years immediately following
                Argentina’s independence. The “Federales” were backed by the dictator José Manuel
                Rosas, and the Unitarian faction favored establishing and enhancing links with
                Europe in commercial as well as cultural terms, and
                <title level="m">Amalia</title> was a book that fiercely defended
                the position of the Unitarian camp. Little surprise, therefore, that at one juncture
                in the novel, the <title level="a">Preamble of a Drama,</title> we see the two main Unitarian protagonists,
                Amalia and Eduardo, who are Romantic lovers, enraptured in their reading and
                translation of Byron’s poetry:
                <quote>
                Eran las cinco de una tarde fría y nebulosa, y al lado de la chimenea, sentado en un
                pequeño taburete a los pies de Amalia, Eduardo le traducía uno de los más bellos
                pasajes del <title level="m">Manfredo</title>, de Byron; y Amalia, reclinado su brazo
                sobre el hombre de Eduardo y rozando con sus rizos de seda su alta y pálida frente,
                lo oía, enajenada, más por la que llegaba hasta su corazón, que por los bellos
                raptos de la imaginación del poeta; y de cuando en cuando Eduardo levantaba su
                cabeza para buscar en los ojos de su Amalia un raudal mayor de poesía que el que
                brotaban los pensamientos del águila de los poetas del siglo XIX. (Mármol 199)
                </quote>
            A number of points deserve mentioning about this scene. The excerpt suggests that the
                musings of Byron’s imagination had transfused Latin America’s Romantic imagination,
                normalizing the integration of his
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> in an Argentine setting. Eduardo
                is depicted as translating <title level="m">Manfred</title> for
                Amalia, and Amalia is “enajenada” (“deranged,” lit. “out of herself”) as a result of
                listening to the “raptures” of the poet’s imagination. Byron is here seen as an icon
                offering access to authentic Romantic love, since Eduardo uses his recitation of
                Byron’s poetry as a pathway to finding a source of poetry that is even deeper than
                Byron’s poetry—within Amalia’s eyes. The esteem in which Byron was held in Argentina
                is suggested by the fact that he is described in this passage as “the eagle of
                nineteenth-century poets.” Byron’s work could be co-opted into a political project.
                For, while Amalia and Eduardo love poetry, their main aim is to destroy Rosas and,
                as the novel demonstrates, it is a political struggle in which they will one day
                lose their lives.</p>
                  <p>Further indication of the importance of Byron’s work in the Unitarian literary
                circles of Buenos Aires is the following scene in which their accomplice, Daniel,
                arrives and asks Amalia and Eduardo what they are reading.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is also significant that Amalia and Eduardo are described as
                    reading the <emph>complete</emph> works of Byron (emphasis added): “Eduardo
                    estaba mostrando los grabados que ilustran las obras completas de lord Byron”;
                    Mármol 199). The interest in Byron was clearly not restricted to a few party-pieces.</note> They
                ask him to guess, and they tease him when he gets it
                wrong—first Daniel says it is Voltaire, then Rousseau, Napoleon, and finally Don
                Pedro de Angelis,<note place="foot" resp="author">Pedro de Angelis was an Argentine
                    political thinker and author of a number of essays, including

                    de los Cesares</title> (1836).</note> before they reveal whose work they are reading:
                <quote>

                hija del poeta.</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">“Ah, Byron! Eso no tomaba café, por la razón de que era la bebida favorita de
                Napoleón; porque has de saber, mi Amalia, que Byron no aborrecía a Napoleón, pero
                tenía celos de su gloria, por cuanto sabía el taimado inglés que con él y con
                Napoleón debían morir las dos grandes glorias de su siglo, y con toda su alma
                hubiese querido que no muriese más gloria que la suya.” (Mármol 199)</p>
                     </quote>
            That Napoleon and Byron are portrayed as tripping simultaneously off Daniel’s tongue
                as—between them—the “two great glories of their century” points once more to the
                lofty esteem that Byron’s work enjoyed in Argentina’s literary circles throughout
                the nineteenth century. As we see, Byron’s impact in Latin America elicited
                political as well as literary structures of feeling.</p>

                a student in the Law Faculty of the University of São Paolo, everyone wanted to be
                like Byron:

                The members, for example, of the Epicurus Society had a penchant for Byron-inspired
                and alcohol-fuelled sessions involving desecration in graveyards, black magic,
                Satanism, and orgies lasting a fortnight (Freire 26–50; Magalhães Júnior 45–54), and
                the most prominent Byromaniac of all was Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo. The
                critic Ronald de Carvalho once called Álvares de Azevedo’s poetry “Byronesque”
                (“byroniana”; Pacheco Jordão 3) and the name stuck. While studying at the Colégio
                Pedro II, Álvares de Azevedo read the great names of the European Romantic
                movement—the likes of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_de_Musset">Alfred de Musset</ref>,

                <title level="m">Parisina</title> into Portuguese and, in much of his poetry, he takes on Byron’s
                    persona.<note place="foot" resp="author">As he wrote to Luis Antônio da Silva Nunes

            The Brazilian poet, as this poem demonstrates, used Byron as a poetic lens through
                which he could survey his life, his emotions and the inhabitants of São Paolo. This
                type of bracketing of his experience within, as it were, Byron’s algorithm is also
                evident in Álvares de Azevedo’s frequent use of quotations drawn from Byron’s work
                as epigraphs for his poems (see Álvares de Azevedo 171, 233, 279, 319, 328, 390,
                396, 412, 419, 450). He was clearly obsessed with Byron, referring to him on
                numerous occasions in his Speech of Acceptance into Brazil’s Academic Society given
                on 9 May 1850 (Álvares de Azevedo 760–66), and he even at one stage began writing
                letters in English to his Portuguese-speaking mother (Álvares de Azevedo 775–76; <title level="a">My
                Cousin Inácio has been very bad with a gathering in his ear and has had leeches
                applied</title> 776). For Álvares de Azevedo, “Byron, sob seu manto negro de Don Juan,
                guardava no peito uma chaga dorida e funda” (Álvares de Azevedo 700). In his
                citation, bracketing and re-working of Byron’s work, Álvares de Azevedo focused on
                the gloomy, gothic and satanic side of the great English Romantic at the expense of
                that lighter side which had attracted Argentine readers.</p>

                  <head>Bolívar and Byron</head>
                  <p> Simón Bolívar never met Lord Byron but there were enough similarities in their lives
                to justify comparison. Their dates almost overlap—their respective birth-dates
                differing by five years (Bolívar was the older) and their deaths by just six years
                (Byron died in 1824, Bolívar in 1830)—and both were seen by their contemporaries as
                great men of their time. Unlike Byron, who gained his fame as one of the leading
                lights of English Romanticism, Bolívar forged his career as a soldier and a
                politician, and he single-handedly liberated half of the Sub-Continent of South
                America. In 1815, he published <title level="m">La carta de Jamaica</title> (<title level="m">The Jamaican
                Letter</title>) which eloquently made the case for Spanish America’s Independence from
                Spain. In the summer of 1816, Bolívar declared the freedom of slaves in the Americas
                (Lynch 109). The Congress of Angostura held in February 1819 solidified Bolívar’s
                place as supreme leader of the new Republic of Venezuela (Bushnell,
                <title level="m">Simón Bolívar</title> 96), while his decisive victory against Spain’s
                royalist troops at Boyacá in August 1819 led to the Independence of New Granada and
                the creation of Colombia (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón Bolívar</title> 108–11).
                Bolívar was committed to the independence as well as union of the newly-formed
                states of Spanish America, and—while it was still unpopular to do so in many parts
                of the Sub-Continent—he was unconditionally opposed to the existence of slavery and
                racism in the New World. He explicitly rejected the use of race as a divide among
                the different populations from which he sought to forge one unified nation (see
                Aguilar Rivera). But for all his idealism, Bolívar was a pragmatist, and he knew his
                dreams would be hard to achieve. As he pointed out in <title level="m">La carta de
                    Jamaica</title>:
                <quote>
                No somos indios ni europeos, sino una especie media entre los legítimos propietarios
                del país y los usrpadores españoles; en suma, siendo nosotros amerianos por
                nacimiento y nuestros derechos los de Europa, tenemos que disputar éstos a los del
                país y que mantenernos en él contra la invasión de los invasores; así nos hallamos
                en el caso más extroardinario y complicado. (Bolívar 46)
                </quote>
                Self-determination and a mixed population went hand in glove in Bolívar’s proposed
                blueprint for an independent and free nation. The great Venezuelan leader “proposed
                a unitary state, with a life-president and a system of indirect election of some
                officials,” characterized by a “moral power” which would be exercised by censors who
                would “oversee the operation of the school system, the behavior of individuals, the
                protection of the constitution, and the rights of the people” (Fitzgerald 8). One
                striking feature of Bolívar’s proposed system was that he “felt that England should
                ally itself with the Spanish-American countries” (Fitzgerald 8). Indeed, it was no
                secret that Bolívar admired British parliamentarianism (Bushnell, <title level="a">Introduction</title>
                xlii), and this would have caught the eye of a Member of the House of Lords, as
                Byron was at this time. Indeed, from a young age, Byron had been intent on a career
                in politics with poetry initially being only a secondary interest. In the first
                speech he gave to the House of Lords, in 1812, he expressed his opposition to the
                heavy hand of social control by arguing against the bill calling for the punishment
                by death of “Luddites” who were destroying industrial machinery; his belief in
                freedom even at the expense of the authority of the State and the Church was unusual
                for the time. </p>
                  <p> Perhaps even more significant, Bolívar and Byron could both trace back their
                political awakening to an admiration of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was during the period
                1804–1806 that Bolívar, living in Europe at the time, experienced a political
                awakening that was caused by Napoleon’s ascension to power (Lynch 24–25;
                    44–45).<note place="foot" resp="author">Bushnell notes that Bolívar was
                        “captivated by, and frankly admired, the cult of glory that was so
                        important a trait of the French leader and that Bolívar would not
                        hesitate to imitate in due course” (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón
                            Bolívar</title> 11).</note> Byron, for his part, had

            The figure of Napoleon here—as one critic has noted, “extreme in both grandeur and
                misery” (Blackstone 187)—is fused with the poem’s narrator, for the despair oozing
                from his is “our” despair. Byron sympathized with Napoleon as the tragic hero and
                saw in him a version of the complicated syntax of his own life.</p>
                  <p>As his biographer Bernard Blackstone points outs, Byron, by the end of 1819—that is,
                precisely when Bolívar’s star was rising in the New World—was growing tired of his
                life in Europe (“an outworn portion of the globe,” as he called it), and, by October
                1819, he was actively making plans to emigrate to Venezuela (Blackstone 308). As
                Byron wrote in a letter to John Cam Hobhouse from Venice, dated October 3, 1819:
                <quote>
                My South American project, of which I believe I spoke to you (as you mention it)—was
                this. I perceived by the enclosed paragraphs [newspaper cuttings] that advantageous
                offers were—or are to be held out to settlers in the Venezuela territory. My affairs
                in England are nearly settled or in prospect of settlement; in Italy I have no
                debts, and I could leave it when I choose. The Anglo-Americans are a little too
                coarse for me, and their climate too cold, and I should prefer the others. I could
                soon grapple with the Spanish language. Ellice or others would get me letters to
                Bolivar and his government, and if men of little, or no property are encouraged
                there, surely with present income, and—if I could sell Rochdale—with some capital, I
                might be suffered as a landholder there, or at least a tenant, and if possible, and
                legal—a Citizen. I wish you would speak to <title level="m">Perry of the M[orning]

                the notion has been about me for a long time, as you will see by the worn state of

                Byron was clearly excited by the news arriving from the New World about Bolívar’s
                adventures, and it is fitting, therefore, that he should have named an instrument of
                his own adventures after the great Venezuelan. In January 1822, Byron found himself
                in northern Italy with a fellow Englishman, Shelley, and they decided that they
                would each buy a boat to entertain themselves in between writing their poetic
                    works.<note place="foot" resp="author">Byron was working on
                        <title level="m">Don Juan</title> at this time.</note>
                Ernest Hartley Coleridge takes up the story for us:
                <quote>
                At the beginning of the New Year, Byron and Shelley turned their thoughts to the sea.
                Two of the Pisa friends, Trelawny and Williams, were accomplished seamen, and,
                acting on their advice and recommendation, Byron commissioned a certain Captain
                Roberts, who was an authority on boat-building, to build an open boat for Shelley,
                and large decked one for his own use. In due course, a schooner, the
                    <title level="m">Bolivar</title>, was built for Byron, and Shelley was provided with a
                boat thirty feet long, which Trelawny christened <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,
                but the owner insisted on re-naming the <title level="m">Ariel</title>. To be near,
                Shelley had taken a villa on the Gulf of Spezia. (Hartley Coleridge xlvi)
                </quote>
                In January 1822—when Byron named his boat after Bolívar—the Venezuelan was already
                planning his next decisive attack on Quito (Bushnell, <title level="m">Simón
                    Bolívar</title> 124–26), from where, once consolidated, he would then strike at the
                heart of Spain’s control-post in Latin America, Lima.<note place="foot" resp="author">In July 1822 Bolívar had met with the other great
                            Liberator of Spanish America, José de San Martín, and had in effect
                            banished him from future influence in the liberation of Spanish America
                            (Lynch 172–75). And, then, on December 1824 Bolívar’s troops, at the
                            Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru’s principal Andean city, had defeated
                            Spain’s royalist army, leading to the unconditional surrender of all of
                            Spain’s forces in Peru and Upper Peru, and thereby made Spanish America
                            free from Spain’s control (Lynch 193–95). In August 1825 a new country
                            was created, and named after Bolívar, Bolivia (Lynch
                    198–200).</note> Byron had expressed admiration for other freedom
                causes in the past—he once sympathized with France’s cause, as expressed in Napoleon
                Bonaparte’s ambitions, as mentioned above, and he had expressed support for Italian
                freedom by supporting the Carbonari (Blackstone 309)—but it was Bolívar’s fight for
                independence, its temerity and the seeming hopelessness of the quest, that struck a
                chord in Byron’s soul.</p>
                  <p>Byron’s decision to buy a boat along with Shelley was, as it turned out, an
                ill-fated event—on July 7, 1822 Shelley drowned in a tragic accident while sailing
                in the <title level="m">Ariel</title> with Williams in the Gulf
                of Spezia. The bodies of Shelley and Williams were discovered not far from the beach
                at Viareggio, and Byron and his companion, Leigh Hunt, decided to conduct a proper
                funeral for them on the lake-shore (Hartley Coleridge xlvi–xlvii). As Byron wrote in
                a letter to Moore dated August 27, 1822:
                <quote>
                We have been burning the bodies of Shelley and Williams on the sea-shore, to render
                them fit for removal and regular interment. You can have no idea what an
                extraordinary effect such a funeral pile has on a desolate shore, with mountains in
                the back-ground and the sea before, and the singular appearance the salt and
                frankincense gave to the flame. All of Shelley was consumed except his
                <emph>heart</emph>, which would not take the flame, and is now preserved
                in spirits of wine. (Barzun 235)
                </quote>
                Byron even swam out to see his own boat, the <title level="m">Bolivar</title>, which
                was moored nearby to the beach while Shelley’s body was being consumed by the
                flames: “The other day at Viareggio, I thought proper to swim off to my schooner
                (the Bolivar) in the offing, and thence to shore again—about three miles, or better,
                in all” (Barzun 234). Byron appears to have experienced extreme and contradictory
                emotions as a result of Shelley’s untimely death, and, perhaps understandably,
                Shelley became something of a “troubling presence” in the collection of poems Byron
                was composing at that time, <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (Bloom 24).</p>
                  <p>It is surely no coincidence that Byron decided—just fourteen months after naming his
                boat the <title level="m">Bolivar</title>—to embrace the cause of Greek Independence
                and journey to Greece in order to save it from tyranny. Byron had been contacted by
                the “Greek Committee,” based in London and consisting of Jeremy Bentham, Lord
                Erskine, Sir James Mackintosh, and J.C. Hobhouse, and unanimously made a member of
                that committee which was fighting on behalf of Greece’s Independence.<note place="foot" resp="author">For a discussion of the connections between
                            Bentham and Bolívar, see Hart 336.</note> The vote occurred on
                March 14, 1822, and, as Byron suggested to Thomas Moore in a letter dated August 27,
                1822: “I had, and still have, thoughts of South America, but am fluctuating between
                it and Greece. I should have gone, long ago, to one of them, but for my liaison with
                the Countess G.; for love, in these days, is little compatible with glory” (Barzun).
                The important point to be drawn from this extract is that Byron saw South America
                and Greece, in the summer of 1822, as offering alternative routes to a similar end.</p>
                  <p>By the end of the summer, as he told Trelawny, Byron was “at last determined to go
                to Greece” (Hartley Coleridge li). He subsequently sold the
                <title level="m">Bolivar</title> and he bought a bigger ship, the
                <title level="m">Hercules</title>. He then sailed to the west
                coast of Cephalonia, recruited a small army, and initiated high-level diplomatic
                negotiations in preparation for an attack on the mainland. As Byron informed J.C.
                Hobhouse, in a letter dated April 7, 1823, he had “even offered to go up to the
                Levant in July, if the Greek provisional government think that I could be of any
                use” (Barzun 240). As he wrote to Augusta Leigh on October 12, 1823:
                <quote>
                You ask me why I came up amongst the Greeks? It was stated to me that my so doing
                might tend to their advantage in some measure in their present struggle for
                independence, both as an individual and as a member for the Committee now in
                England. How far this may be realized I cannot pretend to anticipate, but I am
                willing to do what I can. (Barzun 250)
                </quote>
                It was while Byron was getting ready for the attack that, as so often in his life, he
                turned to his poetry as an outlet for mulling over his actions. And thus we find
                that, even while he was bent on liberating Greece, Bolívar was still in his
                thoughts. Byron began <title level="m">The Age of Bronze</title> in December 1822 and
                he finished it on January 10, 1823, and in this collection of poems the Liberator is
                portrayed as a modern-day titan, part of the political thunder and lightning that
                created freedom in the New World, emerging first in the Northern hemisphere and then
                spreading to the Sub-Continent:

            It was this spark of the “good old days,” as Byron goes on to suggest, that was
                behind the breath of fresh air ushering in freedom in the Atlantic nations:

            The important point here, as far as Byron was concerned, was that the recently
                founded nations of the New World could breathe new life into the veins of a Europe
                that was tired (“outworn,” he says), and had lost its way:

            Clearly the example of the liberation of the New World was inspirational for Byron in
                those crucial years from 1819 onwards when he was contemplating how to implement
                greater freedom in the world. Though Bolívar was not a major figure in Byron’s
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, nevertheless the political rebellion of Peru is
                recalled: Cadiz is described as the “mart of the colonial trade (…) before Peru
                learned to rebel” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Canto II, Chapter V; Hartley
                Coleridge 805).</p>
                  <p>With the benefit of hindsight we can see Byron’s mission to liberate Greece as
                doomed from the start, for Byron was attempting to re-create Bolívar’s
                “criollo”-backed independence movement in a diametrically opposed political
                environment. Byron’s journey to Greece in 1823 is redolent in a sense of Che
                Guevara’s ill-fated mission to Bolivia in 1967, which sought to make the Revolution
                happen in a place it couldn’t happen. As the letters penned during this period
                demonstrate, Byron was having all sorts of problems in Messalonghi, including
                dealing with internal dissension among the Greek factions, bouts of illness
                (apoplexy or epilepsy), enormous debts, earthquakes, and narrow escapes from the
                Turks (Howarth 456–61). Before he had even mustered sufficient forces to launch an
                attack on the mainland, Byron was struck down by fever, and he died off the shores
                of Greece on April 19, 1824. As Hartley Coleridge notes: “The Greeks were
                heartbroken at the death of their hero” (Hartley Coleridge lv). To this day, Greeks
                see Byron’s death as a personal tragedy for the Greek nation (Trayiannoudi).</p>
                  <p>Byron’s relationship with the world outside the British Isles, as portrayed in the
                excellent two-volume book on <title level="m">The Reception of Byron in Europe</title>
                (ed. Richard Cardwell), demonstrates how Byronism took on “local colors” in
                different parts of the world. Our own study of Latin America’s Byron has
                investigated a similar range of receptivities to Byromania in different
                countries—ranging from the brooding and dark Byron in Brazil to the ethereal and
                uplifting one in Argentina—but it has also uncovered something unique about the
                relationship between Byron and Latin America, namely, that his “light” travelled
                not, as elsewhere, as if obeying a one-way system but that it produced a
                “chiaroscuro” effect when it arrived in Latin America. The Latin American prism was
                suddenly transformed into a mirror capable of bouncing Byron’s light back to its
                source. Bolívar’s military as well as political successes, as noted above, clearly
                had an impact on Byron between 1819 and his premature death in 1824; these events
                persuaded the great English poet to grasp the nettle of the independence movement in
                Greece, lay down his pen, and take up his sword. It was not all in vain, though, for
                those “whom the Gods love die young” (<title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Canto IV,
                Chapter IV; Hartley Coleridge 844).</p>

                    prosification and importation across genres. Focusing on an adaptation by the
                    Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, it contextualizes this afterlife
                    within Argentine intellectual and political tensions. Zapata was the first to
                    provide a direct adaptation from the original text, and also the only adaptor
                    to truly preserve the vampiric elements of the plot. When read through a postcolonial
                    and anti-orientalist lens, <title level="m">

                  <p>Vampires arrived late to the feast of
                    Romanticism in Latin America. As they roamed the Old World, few echoes of their
                    presence reached the shores of the New World.<note place="foot" resp="author">The
                        overall consensus on this point is
                            exemplified by Sardiñas, Glantz, Gordillo, and Martínez Díaz. We can
                            deem José María Heredia’s translation of <title level="a">The Bride of Corinth</title> (1797)
                            by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1829, as the first example
                            of vampire literature in Latin America.</note> Only from the turn of the century onward, after
                    <foreign xml:lang="sp">modernismo</foreign>,
                    did vampires become known and feared guests in the pages of influential writers,
                    such Horacio Quiroga and Rubén Darío, or even later with Julio Cortázar and
                    Carlos Fuentes. The twentieth century saw the consecration of vampire literature
                    in Latin America. However, this acclimatization could not have been possible
                    without the role carried out by translators during the nineteenth century.
                    “Translation” in the context of this discussion recovers its etymological
                    meaning, since it not only conveys the transference between languages, but also
                    of spatial dissemination, as an import “transferred” or “carried out” from one
                    place to another, from Europe to the Americas. <note place="foot" resp="author">It
                        must be noted that in this article, I deal with Romantic representations of
                        vampires in the Modern era. I do not take into consideration pre-Colombian
                        motifs such as <foreign xml:lang="sp">tlahuelpuchi</foreign> or the
                        <foreign xml:lang="sp">teyollohcuani</foreign>, which, only in hindsight, have been linked to the
                            vampire tradition (Maberry 277, Kallen 23–24, Doan, 138–139; Martín del
                            Campo, 108–109).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Current critical assessments have tended to overlook translations as part of the output
                of vampiric literature, leading to an incomplete picture of its growth in the Hispanic
                context. However, even in studies where translations are noted as progressive steps in
                its adoption by Latin American authors, the absence of Spanish translations of George
                Gordon, Lord Byron, is striking. Considering the central role of Byron in the vampiric
                craze during the Romantic era, stemming both from the association of his public persona
                to this mythical monster and the long-lasting misattribution of John Polidori’s canonical
                tale, a proper study of translations of Byron seems necessary to articulate a more
                comprehensive and accurate historicization of early stages of this subgenre in Latin
                America. This article aims at correcting this lacuna by analyzing the significance of
                the first available Spanish translation of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                by the Argentine politician Martín Zapata Coria (1811–1861).</p>
                  <p>In order to fully appreciate the innovative nature of <title level="m">El Giaur</title>
                [<emph>sic</emph>] by Zapata,<note place="foot" resp="author">Throughout this article we will keep Zapata’s
                            misspelling of the title (<emph>Giaur</emph>) to differentiate between
                            references to his translation and those to Lord Byron’s original.</note> I will
                start by exposing the many challenges that the original source (and vampire literature in general)
                had to face in its transfer to a Latin American context. Subsequently, I will analyze the most
                significant features and stylistic choices of the translator’s rendition. Finally, I will argue
                why Zapata’s contribution can be interpreted as a counter-discourse to Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s
                formulation of <title level="a">Civilization and Barbarism.</title> As important as his role as a
                translator was, no less fascinating is Zapata’s implicit position in narratives of progress and
                modernity that characterized the political arena of nineteenth-century Argentina. As James Cisneros
                hints in passing, Byron’s worldview contrasted greatly with the most dogmatic formulations of
                <title level="a">Civilization and Barbarism</title> (251), which presented a black-and-white
                agenda for progress in Argentina. By bringing to the fore a text that strayed beyond
                socially-prescribed boundaries concerning morals and modernity, Zapata forced his readers to
                question the simple binaries so fervently sustained at the time.</p>

                  <head>I. <title level="m">The Giaour</title> by Byron: A Challenging Visitor to the Americas</head>
                  <p>Before delving into the historical coordinates that informed Byron translations prior to Zapata’s
                rendition, it is worth reviewing the plot and main features of <title level="m">The
                Giaour</title>. T.S. Eliot provides an insightful summary of the poem:
                <quote>
                    A Christian, presumably a Greek, has
                    managed, by some means of which we are not told, to scrape acquaintance with a
                    young woman who belonged to the harem, or was perhaps the favorite wife of a
                    Moslem named Hassan. In the endeavor to escape with her Christian lover, Leila
                    is recaptured and killed; in due course the Christian with some of his friends
                    ambushes and kills Hassan. We subsequently discover that the story of this
                    vendetta—or part of it—is being told by the Giaour himself to an elderly priest,
                    by way of making his confession. (227–28)
                </quote>
            Eliot efficiently outlines the story here; however, in what would become a classic move in frequent
            receptions of the text in the Hispanic world, he significantly skips any mention of the vampire
                    subplot.<note place="foot" resp="author">This move could
                            be attributed to a wide range of reasons, including the relatively
                            independent character of the supernatural episode within the rest of the
                            poem.</note> As the Christian protagonist kills Hassan, the latter invokes a curse
                upon him that prophesies the ultimate transformation of the protagonist into a vampire. This
                episode is limited to thirty lines, and runs, depending on the edition, from approximately
                line 755 to line 786. Due to its length, I provide here the most substantial excerpt from the full passage:

            Despite early associations between the poet and the literary vampire, this segment
                    encapsulates the only explicit contribution by Byron to this Gothic
                    theme.<note place="foot" resp="author">As Derek Flitter points out, the Romantic
                        fervor about Byron’s works was initially linked to his image as a leading
                        cultivator of the sublime (135). Interestingly, the association between the
                        English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly in the Spanish
                        language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of Byron
                        in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the
                        first Peninsular translation of Polidori’s <title level="m">The
                        Vampire</title> to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian editorial house of Librería
                        Americana, this misattribution reoccurs in 1829, consolidating the vampiric mark
                        as one of the main features of Byron’s writing during the first process of reception
                        of his works.</note> From that celebrated encounter at Villa Diodati where John
                Polidori, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Clair Clairmont gathered in Geneva during
                the Year Without Summer of 1816, only one text by Byron has survived—<title level="a">The
                    Fragment of a Novel,</title> later included in the publication of <title level="m">Mazeppa</title>
                in 1819 (Aquilina, 27–30; Glantz 5). Yet, considering the inchoate and truncated nature of
                this narrative, it would be arguable to consider it within the canon of vampire literature at
                all. Furthermore, Byron would later (in most likelihood embittered by the attribution of
                Polidori’s tale) forcibly remove himself from any association with those iconic bloodsucking
                monsters: “I have . . . a personal dislike to ‘Vampires,’ and the little acquaintance I have
                with them would by no means induce me to divulge their secrets” (<title level="a">Letter of
                    Lord Byron</title> 151). In brief, despite the strong association between Byron and the
                vampiric theme, the aforementioned passage in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> remains his
                sole explicit contribution to this lineage.</p>
                  <p>Among the varied facets deserving attention in this narrative poem, I would like to briefly
                highlight some key aspects of the original that are useful in measuring the worth of Martín
                Zapata’s translation. To begin, <title level="m">The Giaour</title> offers an intriguing
                complication of the orientalist paradigm, as it casts the Christian lover through Eastern
                eyes. By framing the main character as a representation of the West, as a <emph>Gavur</emph>
                or “infidel,” the poem takes the perspective of the traditional Other. The protagonist is
                framed by the gaze of the East. As the text shifts the focus from comfortable exoticization
                of the oriental subject to a matter of perspective, it could be argued that Byron problematizes,
                to some extent, the “geographical binaries” that legitimized European colonialism (Rangarajan 55).
                In <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, it is precisely the representation of the West that is
                continuously subjected to scrutiny and suspicion. Certainly, as postcolonial critic Padma
                Rangarajan has pointed out, this inversion of perspectives is limited to “an audacious moment
                of colonial ventriloquism,” characteristic of some forward-thinking romantics (55). Yet this
                textual stance must have been deemed necessarily problematic by some audiences, especially in
                emergent Latin American republics such as Argentina, where models of modernity led to the
                excision of any non-Western elements as signs of presumed backwardness. In choosing 
                <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, Martín Zapata was implicitly placing himself in a
                    singular position among his intellectual peers.</p>
                  <p>Adding to the complication of the orientalist paradigm,
                    we must add the uncharacteristic portrayal of the doomed-to-be vampire
                    protagonist. As a quintessential Byronic hero, <title level="m">The Giaour</title> is a somewhat
                    sympathetic Gothic villain doomed by fate to carry out death and destruction
                    upon his loved ones against his will (Thorslev 150–151). Departing from the
                    otherness inherently attached to some of the most recognizable vampires in
                    literary tradition (such as Sheridan Le Fanu’s <title level="m">Carmilla</title>
                or Bram Stoker’s <title level="m">Dracula</title>), Byron’s cursed Giaour evinces a complex character,
                    neither entirely innocent nor completely guilty. Therefore, the text elicits the
                    monster within us all, the vampire we might become when touched by ill fate and
                    the unbridled thirst of vengeance.<note place="foot" resp="author">It must be noted
                        that <title level="m">The Giaour</title>’s vampiric
                            transformation is merely shown though a prophecy and not in action. Its
                            vagueness forces the audience to determine, by the end of the story,
                            whether Hassan’s curse is or is not to blame for the unnamed sins
                            admitted in confession later on by the protagonist.</note> Again, as
                we will see, the moral ambiguity of Byron’s original could hardly fit well within
                the clear-cut distinctions aimed by progressive intellectuals such as Domingo
                Faustino Sarmiento (1811–1874), the future president of Argentina.</p>
                  <p>Hispanic resistance towards Gothic horror and fantastic
                    supernaturalism adds an additional key to appreciating Zapata’s initiative as a
                    translator. According to José María Martínez, the institutional demands of the
                    emergent Latin American republics enforced a social-political inflection to
                    Romantic ideals that, along with the reawakening of the enlightened
                    instrumentalization of imagination, led most writers to postpone the use of
                    fantastic aesthetics (55–56). Until the end of the 1850s, and especially after
                    1860 (with the later impact of Edgar Allan Poe), is it difficult to trace a
                    quantitative and qualitatively stronger corpus of supernatural tales in Latin
                    America.<note place="foot" resp="author">Following in the steps of Óscar Hahn,
                        scholars of the fantastic considered <title level="a">Gaspar Blondín</title>
                        (1858) by Juan Montalvo the first original supernatural tale in Latin America.
                        Although this position has been increasingly revised (Sandoval 13; López,
                        XI–XXXIX, 3–30; Morales, XXI; Martínez 55, n.41, 56–57; Abraham 35–37, 55–59,
                        60–106), the overall consensus is that the consolidation of the genre occurred
                        in the last third of the nineteenth century. This context would place Zapata’s
                        translation over a decade ahead of the peak of the fantastic trend.</note>

                  <head>II. Martín Zapata, Translator of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                  </head>
                  <p>In contrast to Sarmiento’s current
                    relevance in Latin American studies, very little is known nowadays of lawyer and
                    politician Martín Zapata. By the mid-nineteenth century, he was recognized as
                    one of the leading promoters of the Constitution of 1853, which, incidentally,
                    is still the base of the current Argentine juridical system (Lorenzo 220, 227).
                    Through brief and scattered political notes of the period, it is possible to
                    place Zapata among the liberal intellectuals who opposed José Manuel de Rosas,
                    the dictator who ruled Argentina between 1835 and 1852. Within this context,
                    Zapata’s path closely follows the steps of members of the “1837 Generation” such
                    as Juan Bautista Alberdi, Esteban Echeverría, or Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is worth noting the different approach to the fantastic by both
                        Echeverría (<title level="a">Elvira y la novia del Plata,</title> 1832;
                        <title level="m">Mefistófeles</title>, 1833), and Sarmiento (<title level="a">La
                            pirámide,</title> 1839 and <title level="m">Argirópolis</title>, 1850) and by
                        Zapata, via Byron. For Echeverría and Sarmiento, the fantastic appears through
                        visions and it is used either as a moral or political allegory (Abraham 91–99,
                        135–142).</note> Along with these notable writers, Martín Zapata would live as
                an exile in Chile and participate in frequent gatherings held in the capital, Santiago.</p>
                  <p>In the years that preceded the translation of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, Sarmiento
                and Zapata had a close relationship,<note place="foot" resp="author">This relation is
                    confirmed in letters of both authors, published in <title level="m">The Complete
                        Works</title> of Sarmiento (volumes XIII and XV).</note> as evidenced by their
                collaboration in <title level="m">Crónica Contemporánea de Sud-América</title>, a journal
                that led the opposition against Argentine dictator de Rosas. Despite its short run, with
                only four issues in 1841, <title level="m">Crónica</title> played a significant role in
                providing cohesion to a liberal unitarian party in risk of disbandment. Later political differences seem
                    to have broken the friendship between Sarmiento and Zapata soon after.
                    Nevertheless, by 1849, their relation must have remained strong. That year, in
                    an editorial headlined by Sarmiento’s confidant and son-in-law, Julio Belín,
                    Zapata published <title level="m">El Giaur</title> [<emph>sic</emph>] <title level="m">o el infiel: Fragmento de un cuento turco</title>.</p>
                  <p>Starting with the title, <title level="m">El Giaur o el infiel</title> opens with a statement of
                his purpose of faithfulness: “Traducción literal del orijinal [<emph>sic</emph>] inglés.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Zapata in his translation follows the new phonetic
                    orthography proposed by Sarmiento. Among its features, <emph>i</emph> is written
                    instead of <emph>y</emph>, <emph>j</emph> instead of <emph>g</emph>, the
                        silent <emph>h</emph> is eliminated, and new rules of accentuation are
                    applied.</note> Zapata presents his work as a literal translation from the English
                original, and, consequently, positions himself critically against previous undertakings
                of the work, elaborated solely from French sources and characterized by extreme poetic
                liberties. Early transmission of Byron’s works could not be understood without the role
                of the Parisian publisher Librería Americana-Decourchant. It was originally from France
                that the first major wave of his Spanish translations were made possible.<note place="foot" resp="author">Here I provide a careful record of the actual
                            census of Byron’s translations into Spanish. As Daniel G. Samuel pointed
                            out, the first complete and contradictory bibliographical records by
                            scholars Ernest Coleridge and Richard Churchman led to a long-lasting
                            confusion about what titles were actually translated into Spanish and
                            which ones were merely advertised, but never published. Fortunately,
                            proper systemization of records and recent digitalization of texts
                            provide me with enough direct access and cross-references to establish a
                            more accurate evaluation of the processes of reception and translation
                            of Byron’s works.</note> During this phase, thirteen titles were published:
                            <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (1827), <title level="m">The Bride of
                    Abydos</title> (1828), <title level="m">The Giaour</title> (1828), <title level="m">Lara</title>
                (1828), <title level="m">Mazeppa</title> (1828), <title level="m">The Siege of
                    Corinth</title> (1828), <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1829), <title level="m">Beppo</title>
                (1830), <title level="m">Manfred</title> (1830), <title level="m">The Prisoner of
                    Chillon</title> (1830), <title level="m">Oscar de
                    Alba</title> (1830), <title level="m">Parisina</title> (1830), and <title level="m">Odes to
                    Napoleon</title> (1830). Leaving aside the fragmentary renditions by Spanish-speaking intellectuals
                who lived in England during their time in exile (such as José María Heredia or Andrés Bello), early
                translations of Byron were made accessible through second-hand French versions, where taking extreme
                poetic license was a common practice. It is worth noting that <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                appears during this timeframe among Byron texts that traveled through Spain to some territories in
                Latin America. However, interest in this narrative poem would decline during the nineteenth century,
                as is demonstrated by the delay with which a second translation of the work would be undertaken by
                Zapata. Twenty years separated the first Spanish edition of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                in Paris (1828) and the first Latin American one in Chile
                    (1849).<note place="foot" resp="author">Between the editions of Paris and Santiago de Chile,
                        there were no translations of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Byron’s poem was rendered
                        in neither the Spanish Romantic journal <title level="j">El Europeo</title> nor the historical novel
                        <title level="m">Los bandos de Castilla</title> (<title level="m">The Bans of Castille</title>) by
                        Ramón López Soler, as was once stated. Instead of proper translations, during this period we
                        witness bastardized versions of the characters and main plot of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                        in Spain. The historical novel <title level="m">Kar-Osman, Memorias de la Casa de Silva</title>
                        (<title level="m">Kar-Osman, Memories of the House of Silva</title>) by Ramón López Soler from
                        1832 (Picoche 91), and the poetic diptych <title level="a">El infiel</title> by Juan Arolas from
                        1849 are examples of symbolic vampirization of the original source. Remarkably, both writers
                        obliterate any reference to the preternatural curse and vampiric transformation of the protagonist.
                        It is within this context that Martín Zapata’s first Latin American rendition of <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title> in 1849 becomes a relevant <emph>tour de force</emph>, since it unapologetically
                        brings back the vampiric element of the original story.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must nuance Zapata’s initial stance as a faithful
                    translator, as his praxis is still rooted in the tradition of prosification,
                    frequently carried out in the Romantic era. It is important to remember that, in
                    the early stages of reception, Byron’s narrative poems were predominantly
                    rendered into prose. Not by chance, Spanish translations of the period are
                    commonly labeled as “novelas” (“novels”) or even “cuentos poéticos” (“poetic
                    tales”). As a result, this practice of prosification significantly altered the
                    horizon of expectations of the initial Spanish-speaking readership (Montesinos
                    64; Pegenaute <title level="a">La época romántica</title> 337, 343; Medina Calzada 148). Lord Byron’s
                    works were mostly associated in these early stages with the productions of a
                    novel writer or even those of a playwright. Despite the poetic recreations by
                    José María Heredia, Henrique de Vedia, or Manuel Cañete, translations in verse
                    were exceptions, undertaken only by a small number of daring authors during the
                    first half of the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="author">This article
                        makes use of the catalogue of Byron’s translations into Spanish in the nineteenth
                        century that I am currently developing. For this project, I consult editions
                        available in the National Library of Spain, Paris, Mexico and Buenos Aires, as
                        well as the World Cat database. As part of a work in-progress, evaluation of
                        the references stated herein are subject to revision.</note> Subsequently,

                  <p>Zapata does not diverge from the practice of literary prosification, and in this particular
                aspect he does not stand out as a particularly original writer. However, in contrast to
                previous translations of Byron,<note place="foot" resp="author">In the Hispanic Americas,
                    the path to Romantic Byronism was led by Cuban poet José María Heredia during his years
                    of residence in Mexico. His impulse would soon be followed by Basque diplomat Henrique
                    de Vedia (“Parisina”) in the Argentine journal <title level="j">La Moda</title>, and
                    later by Andrés Bello and Antonio María Vizcayno. Still, by the mid century, translations
                    of Byron in Latin America were significantly scarce.</note> he seems especially guided by
                an impulse to better convey Byron’s lexical choices and poetry. It could be argued that the
                malleability of prose allows him to provide more accurate correspondences to the original,
                avoiding customary manipulations. The translator seems aware of the sacrifices that result
                from his decision, and compensates for the loss of rhyme and meter through a wise implementation
                of rhythm, which approximates his rendition to the formal experiments of prose poetry as
                practiced in France.<note place="foot" resp="author">To contextualize, <title level="m">Gaspar
                    de la nuit</title> by Aloysius Bertrand, a milestone in the
                            introduction of prose poetry in France, was posthumously published in
                            1842, only seven years before Zapata’s translation of Byron (Friebert
                            and Young, 17–21).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Zapata also opts to organize <title level="m">El Giaur</title> in clear-cut chapters or sections. Instead of reproducing
                    the mosaic of mingling and interrupted perspectives of the original, he made use
                    of an explicit external structure. It is reasonable to suppose that the same
                    aspects that would attract the attention of modernist poets such as T.S. Eliot
                    in the twentieth century (fragmentation, elusiveness, disarticulation) must have
                    been perceived as a source of disorientation by audiences of the time. A similar
                    scenario must have occurred within the Spanish-speaking readership. Zapata
                    likely feared the risk of confusing his audience with the meandering
                    structure of the original. To guide his readership, he devoted individual
                    chapters to specific parts of the narrative poem. The addition of subtitles is
                    another of the strategies used by the Argentine to further his clarification of
                    the plot. In Zapata’s rendition, the story is divided into twelve chapters.</p>
                  <p>Particularly relevant to our study of the
                    vampire theme is Chapter IX, <title level="a">The Curse</title> (20–21). There, Zapata compresses the
                    supernatural transformation of the protagonist. This chapter could be considered
                    in itself one of the first explorations of vampire literature in a Hispanic
                    context. The famous passage of vampirism by Byron quoted above reads this way in
                    Zapata’s translation:
                    <quote>
                    Tu cuerpo arrancado de su tumba i convertido en vampiro, habitará cual espectro
                    en tu tierra nativa i beberá la sangre de toda tu propia raza: allí, en la oscuridad
                    de la medianoche, arrancarás a tu hija, a tu esposa i a tu hermana la corriente de la
                    vida; i aunque te horrorice tu asquerosa bebida has de alimentar con ella tu lívido
                    cadáver. - Tus víctimas, antes de espirar, reconocerán al demonio por su deudo: i
                    maldiciéndote i maldecidos por ti, perecerán en la flor de su edad esos seres que te
                    son tan queridos. Pero una de ellas, la más joven, la más querida de todos, te llamará
                    con el nombre <emph>padre</emph>, i
                    esta palabra sagrada te destrozará el corazón…I tus crujientes dientes y
                    cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos, i volviéndote a tu
                    oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales
                    huirán de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos . . .

                     </quote>
                    This excerpt exemplifies Zapata’s approach as a translator. Unable to
                    produce the rhythmic cadence of Byron’s pentameter and the alliteration
                    of English nasal and occlusive consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), he opts for a
                    different palette of sounds, but with the same effect in mind: horror.
                    For this purpose, Zapata makes a forceful, combined use of the alveolar
                    trill /r/ and nasal consonants (/m/, /n/) throughout the passage. These
                    are some of the clearest examples of alliteration: <foreign xml:lang="sp">arrancado, convertido,
                    raza, arrancarás, corriente, horrorice, alimentar, cadáver,
                    espirar, reconocerán, flor, cárdenos, rabiarás, porque,
                    infernales, horrorizados</foreign>. These abundant examples illustrate the
                intentionality of the author. The taps and trills, so characteristic of the Spanish
                /r/, help provide this scene with a sense of urgency and aggression, while the nasal
                sounds provide a background tension that suitably convenes the tremendous curse
                invoked upon the protagonist.</p>
                  <p>Since Zapata does not count with the power of meter that emphasizes the fateful metric
            <emph>ostinato</emph> of the original, he has to supply other means to this end. The use
                of polysyndeton in relatively long sentences contribute to exacerbate the tension
                until its climatic resolution, with the curse of the protagonist:
                “<emph>I</emph> tus crujientes dientes <emph>y</emph>
                cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos,
                <emph>i</emph> volviéndote a tu oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás
                desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales huirán
                de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos”
                (21; emphases added). As if these formal means of expression were
                not sufficient, Zapata resorts to a hyperbolic use of punctuation.
                The translator not only multiplies the exclamation marks of the
                original, but also inserts two complete lines of periods or suspension
                points. Whether these signs are a representation of an unutterable
                horror or a sudden break of the narrative is open to interpretation.
                What remains clear is Zapata’s effective intention of producing an
                intense shock in his audience. Despite its brevity and translative
                character, this chapter of <title level="m">El
                Giaur</title> represents one of the wildest and more explicit expressions
                of Gothic sensibility in nineteenth-century Latin American literature.</p>
                  <p>In the context of Argentine political discussions, the timing of Zapata’s translation makes his
                    production particularly intriguing. By the 1830s, Byron was certainly deemed by
                    the Argentine intellectual establishment (Esteban Echeverría, José Mármol, and
                    Juan Bautista Alberdi) a cornerstone of the Romantic pantheon of foreign
                    authors. However, by the 1840s, these sentiments were starting to recede, and
                    discussions about the pertinence of Romanticism would be abundant. It is
                    therefore surprising to note how Zapata’s publication straddles the fence of the
                    first two extremely influential editions of Sarmiento’s <title level="m">Facundo: Civilization y Barbarie</title> (1845, 1851).</p>
                  <p>In its most basic tenets, <title level="m">Facundo</title> aims at fostering a model
                of Western progress though critical representations of backwardness, embodied in the
                portrayal of gaucho leader Juan Facundo Quiroga. Along the way, Sarmiento delineates
                a clear-cut opposition between two antithetical cultural realities: the presumed
                signifiers of barbarism (indigenous peoples, <emph>gauchos</emph> or mixed-race cowboys,
                and Spaniards); and those of Western Modernity (associated with the US, UK and France).
                Furthermore, he does not hesitate to equate the <emph>gauchos</emph>’ uncivilized
                character with nomadic subjects of the Middle East. His “otherizing” exoticism
                is unabashedly grounded in racist prejudice:
            <quote>
            It would not be useless to remind [the

                    Let’s not even talk about physiognomies: I have met some Arabs who I swear I
                    have seen in my country. (<title level="m">Facundo</title> 28 n. without number; my translation)

                        monotony…The barbarian is bodily insensitive, as he is <emph>less prompt to

            </quote>
                     <quote>
            It is necessary to see those closed-bearded faces, those grave and serious countenances,
            such as in the Asian Arabs, to judge the compassionate disdain that inspires their
            contemplation of the sedentary man of the cities. (14, my translation)
            </quote>
            Sarmiento’s depiction of countrymen and that of Orientalized subjects are one and the same.
            Within his social imaginary, Arabs and <emph>gaucho</emph> people represent closed-mindedness
                (“less prompt to reflection”) and non-urban backwardness. Certainly, Sarmiento’s
                internal contradictions deserve a more complex analysis than I am able to provide
                here.<note place="foot" resp="author">For this purpose, Noe Jitrik’s considerations
                    of the internal contradictions of <title level="m">Facundo</title> and Carlos
                    Alonso’s examination of Sarmiento’s passionate incongruities are still
                    relevant.</note> Yet, for the interests of my argument on the innovative character of
                    <title level="m">El Giaur</title>, it is striking that Zapata decided to publish and
                translate a story where those precise boundaries (Good-Evil, East-West) were forcibly
                blurred and problematized. Within the context of Sarmiento’s binary ideology, Zapata
                provides an indication of a more complex worldview, one in which the lines dividing
                <title level="m">Civilization and Barbarism</title> are harder to grasp. Considering
                the later disagreements between both writers, Sarmiento and Zapata, it is possible to
                see in the publication of <title level="m">El Giaur</title> a foreshadowing of their
                later differences.</p>

                  <head>III. After Martín Zapata</head>
                  <p>The consecration of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> in the Spanish-speaking world as a
                major text in the Byronic canon would take time. Byron’s first Oriental poem was not
                translated again into Spanish until 1864, after almost another twenty years. Continuing
                the interest awakened by Zapata’s translation, Argentine poet Pedro Espinosa, known as
                “Espinillo,” took the responsibility of being the first to provide a versified rendition
                of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Unfortunately, the little booklet did not achieve
                much attention and currently sits in the National Library of Buenos Aires, a testimony to
                the ephemeral attraction that this poem had in Argentina during the nineteenth century.
                From this point forward, interest in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> would spark in
                other geographies. After a second translation in verse by José Núñez de Prado y Fernández
                (1824–1894) included in <title level="m">Lord Byron: tres poemas puestos en verso
                castellano</title> (Spain, 1885), the tragic parable of the Greek Christian lover transformed
                into a vampire would resume his journey to Perú and Cuba. Almost concomitantly, two notable
                translators, José Arnaldo Márquez (Peru, 1832–1903) and Francisco Sellén (Cuba,1836–1907)
                issued the most notable renditions in verse to date of <title level="m">The
                Giaour</title>. The individual efforts of Núñez, Márquez, and Sellén draw a new afterlife
                of the Byronic text, one in which translations from the original English source are conveyed
                through classical diction and meter (such as combinations of seven- and eleven-syllable lines),
                but with an unmistakable Gothic flair.</p>
                  <p>As Vicente Quirarte beautifully reminds us, “The Vampire cannot enter / unless we open the window”
                (<title level="a">Elogio del vampiro</title>, lines 4–5; my translation). In the discontinuous
                life of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> in the Spanish language, Martín Zapata signaled a
                moment of openness that not only spread a more comprehensive understanding of Lord Byron’s works,
                but also led to the acclimatization of the vampire and prose poetry in Latin America. Before the
                powerful vampiric stories by Horacio Quiroga, Rubén Darío, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes,
                there was once <title level="m">El Giaur o el infiel</title>, fathered by an almost forgotten
                Argentine writer. With the broad historical perspective that we hold today, we can see how
                Zapata’s rendition put in motion the interest in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> and
                planted the seeds for the current cultivation of the vampire theme in contemporary Spanish
                and Latin American fiction. This article aimed at doing justice to his contribution, while
                underlining the subversiveness implicit in the timing of his publication. Within the stark
                coordinates of Argentine debates of the period, where little tolerance was given to ambiguity,
                Zapata’s choice carries a strong political stance. Today, as we read <title level="m">El
                Giaur</title>, the same delightful chill that readers felt at the time comes back to us, to
                excite our fear and confront us with our prejudices once again.</p>

               <p>In commemoration of the bicentenary of Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), this comparative essay focuses on the
                    reception of the lyrical drama as a revolutionary manifesto in Spanish-American
                    nations. Fittingly, the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century
                    coincided not only with Rafael del Riego’s republican revolt in Spain but also
                    with the independence movements throughout Latin America more generally.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="a">The Shelleys and
                            Spain,</title> Joselyn Almeida explores Percy Shelley’s interest in
                        writings by Cervantes and Calderón de la Barca as well as Riego’s revolt in
                        Spain. The essay also analyzes the influence of these writings on <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. She notes that Joseph Blanco White
                        read <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> in exile in Britain “as he
                        reflected upon Riego’s liberal uprising” of the 1820s in Asturias
                        (173).</note> The essay begins with an overview of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s short-lived yet influential reception history
                    in Hispanophone culture, before tracking particular readings of the play in
                    local journalism and literature. I focus my reading primarily on Alejo
                    Carpentier’s <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> [<title level="m">The
                        Lost Steps</title>] (1950), a major twentieth-century novel whose network of
                    references and allusions to Shelley’s play provides one of the most earnest
                    artistic engagements with the drama ever produced. I ultimately suggest that as
                    an endorsement of non-violent revolution and social equality, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> has been indelibly inscribed into the radical
                    political and literary history of Spanish-American nations.</p>
               <p>Given that Shelley did not expect <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> to
                    be a popular work in English, its brief circulation and reception history in
                    Hispanophone cultures is perhaps unsurprising.<note place="foot" resp="author">James Barcus has noted: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no more than
                        20 copies, and John Gisborne remarked that <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title> was never intended for more than five or six persons”
                        (3). This initial scarcity of copies and readers seems to corroborate what
                        Shelley claimed in his preface to the play that “[his] purpose has hitherto
                        been simply to familiarize the highly refined imagination of the more select
                        classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence”
                        (209).</note>
                  <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> was not <emph>fully</emph>
                    translated into the Spanish language until 1994, when Hiperion Press in Spain
                    published a bilingual edition with a translation by Alejandro Valero. The drama
                    had hitherto appeared in translation in both Spain and Spanish America only in
                    parts: as an array of fragments that existed as separate “poems” featured in
                    anthologies. Excerpts of it had also been used as epigraphs or cited in works by
                    authors such as Miguel de Unamuno, who considered Shelley to be a “marvelous”
                    writer (González and Rodríguez 101).<note place="foot" resp="author">Unamuno
                        became interested in the play’s representation of linguistic origins,
                        especially the lines, “[Prometheus] gave Man speech, and speech created
                        thought / Which is the measure of the universe” (II.iv.72–73), as he cited
                        them in his <title level="m">Amor y Pedagogia</title> (<title level="m">Love
                            and Pedagogy</title>).</note> As Beatriz Gonzalez and Santiago Rodríguez
                    point out, Shelley’s reception in Spain has suffered from various gaps of
                    omission. This is owing largely to the country’s complicated history. During the
                    nineteenth century, for instance, Shelley was occluded from the “conservative
                    attitudes” of the reign of Ferdinand VII (1784–1833), when several liberal,
                    progressive authors, including Jose de Espronceda, were exiled from
                    Spain—a time period that also coincided with the Spanish American
                    Independence movements. It was not until the fin-de-siècle that [Shelley] is
                    first mentioned in Spain. His name reappeared during the 1920s only to disappear
                    soon thereafter with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 and the ensuing
                    fascist state created under Francisco Franco. The name of Shelley and his work
                    began reappearing in the 1970s and has continued to gain traction ever since;
                    the recent translation of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is a good
                    case in point (97).</p>
               <p>In the two centuries since <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s
                    publication, versions of it—as either a reference or part-translation in
                    Spanish America—have taken on varying titles: <title level="m">Prometeo</title> (Prometheus), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Desencadenado</title> (Prometheus Unchained), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Liberado</title> (Prometheus Liberated), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Desatado</title> (the closest version one comes to “unbound” in Spanish),
                    and <title level="m">Prometeo Libertado</title> (an orthographical variation of
                    Prometheus Liberated).<note place="foot" resp="author">A complete translation in
                        Italian was published in 1892 by Mario Rapisardi, which was titled <title level="m">Prometeo Liberato</title> and likely inspired by the
                        significance of Italy and its landscapes to the drama’s composition
                        history</note> Valero’s translation of the play features paratextual
                    materials in Spanish, including a translation of Shelley’s Preface and Mary
                    Shelley’s <title level="a">Note</title> from her publication of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> in 1839. The volume’s back cover, which
                    functions as a preface to the collection, highlights the drama as “perhaps
                    [Shelley’s] most ambitious work.” It traces some biographical information on
                    Shelley and the play’s composition history prior to offering a synopsis that
                    makes the case for the drama as a text of resistance (Figure 1): <figure>

                        according to his own style, [the play] brings fundamental problems into
                        relief such as the struggle between good and evil and the origin and destiny
                        of the human species who, alongside the natural world, resists oppression
                        and destruction in the struggle for liberty. The poem ends with a great song
                        of hope in the wake of love’s triumph as the law of the world. </quote> In
                    his editorial notes, Valero remarks how, in contrast to Aeschylus’s version of
                    the myth, Shelley focused his adaptation on the moral and psychological aspects
                    that enable Prometheus’s liberation (215). For Valero, the play’s portrayal of a
                    new political reality culminates in a celebratory chant of freedom: <quote>

                            has been born, more than a new man, is a new perception of the world as

                    centenary of Shelley’s death (1922). Written by Edouard Herriot, who eventually
                    became prime minister of France, the text presents his radical political
                    interests in Shelley and was fittingly published in the aftermath of World War
                        I.<note place="foot" resp="author"> An investigation into Herriot’s
                        biography, including his letters and journals, did not reveal any connection
                        to Shelley or his drama.</note> In addition to summarizing all four acts,
                    Herriot lauds the play’s poetic ideals as both “current” and “eternal.” After
                    citing the final lines uttered by Demogorgon in Act IV, he praises the play’s
                    “luxuries of lyricism,” its ideas of passive resistance, and the “necessary
                    agony” suffered by Prometheus. In the final paragraph, Herriot states: <quote> I
                        gladly read [<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>] again in these
                        troublesome times. I have placed it among my beloved books, very close to
                        Plato. Shelley is the poet of democracy, of reason, of intellectual beauty;
                        [he is] the adversary of tyranny, the enthusiastic chanter of liberty. I
                        love everything about its classic purity; the poetry that flows through all
                        its parts, the immense love of nature that resounds in each of its stanzas,
                        [and] the ineffable music of its verse. During the war’s tragic hours, I
                        would hear [the play’s] words of hope, which sang in the wind of the battle.
                        May [Shelley’s] memory rise again today among the lands of the free in order
                        to inspire respect for life, the love of Reason and of Peace! After all,
                        [Shelley] was the one who said: “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of
                        the world.” </quote> Employing his own poetic liberties and invoking
                    Shelley’s famous description of poets as “unacknowledged legislators,” Herriot’s
                    synopsis mirrors the earlier sentiments of W.B. Yeats, who famously said at the
                    turn of the twentieth century that <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                    is among the “sacred books of the world” (<title level="m">Early Essays</title>
                    70). Like Valero, Herriot acknowledges the drama’s timeless connections between
                    poetry, politics, and popular reform.</p>
               <p>This seemingly uncritical treatment of Shelley’s poetry and politics turns
                    strikingly more nuanced in Carpentier’s reading of the play in <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>. Although Carpentier was born in Switzerland to
                    French and Russian parents and was educated throughout Europe, he grew up in
                    Cuba and identified as Cuban. He spent much of his life fascinated by music,
                    becoming a musicologist and studying musical traditions of the Caribbean and
                    South America. Carpentier fled Cuba in 1945 because of the threat his left-wing
                    politics posed to Fulgencio Batista’s regime. While in exile he wrote the partly
                    autobiographical work, <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, which was
                    published in Venezuela thirty-one years after Herriot’s article. A novel with
                    Shelleyan, Conradian, and Proustian resonances, it tells the story of an
                    unnamed, spiritually-exhausted protagonist and narrator whose Prufrockian
                        <emph>malaise</emph> puts him at odds with the modern world. The narrative’s
                    idealization of the origins of the human species is pit starkly against the
                    “missteps” of human progress—as seen in the novel’s contrast between the
                    native customs of a South American primitive oral society and the contemporary
                    world of European languages, literature, philosophy, and cultures. A
                    musicologist in search of native musical instruments, the narrator travels from
                    New York City through the Andes Mountains into the heart of the South American
                    jungle where his arduous physical journey toward the center of the continent
                    also represents a journey back in time. From the contemporary urban landscape
                    into farmlands, primitive villages, and stone-age-like encampments, he discovers
                    an Edenic oasis and refuge from modern civilization.</p>
               <p>Throughout its pages, Carpentier integrates the plot, mystical settings, and
                    idealistic aims of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> into its
                    narrative space. Like the lyrical drama, the novel portrays the reversal of
                    historical time.<note place="foot" resp="author">While Carpentier’s novel
                        suggests it, in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, humans are not
                        at fault for the woe that they must endure.</note> Yet this modern
                    adaptation of Shelley’s work, which is set in a South American jungle instead of
                    the Indian Caucasus, offers a more ambivalent take than Valero’s or Herriot’s.
                    The novel critiques the structure and aims of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>, as the integration of the play becomes an experiment that
                    ultimately fails. Carpentier’s empiricist approach for thinking through
                    Shelley’s radical imperatives brings to light the incompatibility between the
                    demands for real-world change and the conceptual blueprints for revolution that
                    Shelley presumably left under-theorized.</p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is undoubtedly the most significant
                    source text for <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, and its
                    assimilation in the novel occurs in multiple ways. Carpentier introduces
                    Shelley’s text early in the book when the narrator sees a copy of the lyrical
                    drama in a New York City bookshop, which made him “forget the world of books”
                    altogether (12).<note place="foot" resp="author">It is not made clear whether
                        the narrator finds a print copy of only the play itself or the entire 1820
                            <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> volume that contained other
                        poems, including <title level="a">To a Skylark,</title>
                     <title level="a">Ode to the West Wind,</title> and <title level="a">The
                            Sensitive Plant.</title>
                  </note> This influential moment cues the reader
                    to the currency of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as the novel’s
                    major touchstone, while prompting the narrator to recall his own musical
                    adaptation of Shelley’s drama. He has, in fact, composed “a prelude and the
                    first draft of the opening scenes” of an “ambitious cantata on <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>,” a choral composition that emulates the style
                    of the hymnic fourth act of Shelley’s play (19). The novel further resembles its
                    predecessor text through its plot structure as a quest romance, its emphasis on
                    social revolution, and its panoply of images and poetic descriptions.</p>
               <p>The novel’s treatment of free love is also definitively Shelleyan. While married
                    to Ruth, an American woman, the narrator has sought out a French lover named
                    Mouche, with whom he travels to South America. When he grows tired of her during
                    their journey, increasingly identifiying Mouche with Western bourgeois culture,
                    he trades her for Rosario, a native woman and kindred spirit. These polyamorous
                    behavioral patterns are reminiscent of Shelley’s own pursuits of love and
                    depictions in such poems as <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title>. For the
                    narrator, Rosario transcends the taints of European modernity and colonialism
                    and is the closest he comes to discovering his soulmate, his epipsyche: “several
                    races had met in this [ideal] woman”; she is “an amalgam of related peoples” as
                    an interracial and multi-ethnic ideal (81–2). “Through her lips the plants began
                    to speak and describe their own powers,” which is suggestive of the animistic
                    and anthropomorphic features of Shelley’s play (83). Carpentier even includes a
                    moment of homoerotic tension when Mouche unsuccessfully attempts a pass at
                    Rosario. This moment echoes the homoerotic scene between the daughters of Ocean
                    at the beginning of Act II, as Carpentier meticulously aligns the plot and
                    characters of each work.</p>
               <p>In terms of setting, the urban landscapes of New York City and the guerilla-torn
                    South American city parallel the unredeemed Earth of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>’s first act. These correspondences make evident that, for
                    the narrator, both European metropoles and colonial peripheries have become
                    contaminated and corrupted. Several lines from Act I, including those from
                    Prometheus’s opening monologue, appear throughout this early part of the novel;
                    the second chapter even begins with the first fury’s initial line, “Ha! I scent
                    life,” which signals a point of transition for the Titan who, despite being
                    persecuted and tormented by the goddesses, refuses to despair. When the narrator
                    visits what scholars agree is Caracas, he experiences his own form of encounter
                    with the taunting furies: the outbreak of a violent revolution and guerilla
                    warfare in which snipers detain him against his will. In Caracas, even nature
                    appears to be up in arms: “For hundreds of years a struggle had been going on
                    with roots that pushed up the sidewalks and cracked the walls” (38). The scene
                    recalls the tension that verges on stalemate between Prometheus and Jupiter,
                    especially when the narrator comments on the fraught South American history of
                    the twentieth century where one finds the “movement of Socialists against
                    Conservatives, of Communists against Catholics . . . [and] one lives with
                    Rousseau and the Inquisition, with the Immaculate Conception and Das Kapital”
                    (50–1). The echoes from the first act of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> are further reinforced when the narrator passes a shop with
                    a “mysterious sign,” “[el] Rastro de Zoroastro,” a rhymed Spanish phrase meaning
                    the trail (or trace) of Zoroaster (42). The sign brings to mind Shelley’s own
                    reference to Zoroaster in Act I, which reveals the play’s interest in critiquing
                    institutionalized religions and dualistic structures.</p>
               <p>Through a series of trials, the narrator also undertakes a quest romance into the
                    heart of a jungle untainted by European civilization and colonization. The
                    expedition echoes not only Prometheus’s mental transformation in Act I but also
                    Asia’s quests in Act II: her physical journey into the underworld and the
                    figurative voyage into the depths and discovery of her own psyche. Although both
                    texts take place in different epochs and different parts of the globe, the
                    characters in <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> encounter settings
                    familiar to any reader of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>: frozen
                    landscapes, ravines, volcanoes, and a “multitude of peaks and abysses” (78).
                    Like Asia at the beginning of Act II, scene five, who appears on a cloud atop a
                    mountain ready to redeem the earth with love alongside Prometheus, the narrator
                    also finds himself positioned above the clouds just prior to his new life in the
                    jungle beside his own ideal love, Rosario.</p>
               <p>To engage Shelley’s work even further, Carpentier employs a style of imagery as
                    if taken directly from the play’s experimental fourth act. Describing what he
                    calls the “dance of the trees,” the narrator notes “the rhythm that begins in
                    the leaves, a restless, ascending rhythm—with the surge and breaking of
                    the waves, with gentle pauses, rests—which suddenly becomes a storm of
                    rejoicing. There is nothing more beautiful than a bamboo thicket dancing in the
                    breeze” (211). In Act IV, the Chorus of Unseen Spirits decree how: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Bright clouds float in heaven,</l>
                        <l>Dew-stars gleam on earth,</l>
                        <l>Waves assemble on ocean,</l>
                        <l>They are gathered and driven</l>
                        <l>By the storm of delight, by the panic of glee!</l>
                        <l>They shake with emotion,</l>
                        <l>They dance in their mirth.</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent2">(lines 40–46)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> Later, the chorus rejoices to “weave the dance on the floor of the
                    breeze, / [and] Pierce with song heaven's silent light” (70–71).</p>
               <p>Beyond embedding these ecstatic images into his poetical prose, Carpentier links
                    the journey through space (to the center of the continent) to an expedition back
                    in time. Upon his arrival at the secluded village, he remarks how he has
                    retrogressed several millennia: <quote> the 58 centuries separating the fourth
                        chapter of Genesis from the current year <emph>back there</emph> could be
                        spanned in one hundred and eighty minutes . . . [we flew] over cities that
                        today, at this very time, belonged to the Middle Ages, the Conquest, the
                        Colony, or the Romantic era” (233–34). </quote> For the narrator, the gap he
                    once understood between the past and present has collapsed, as the
                    self-sustaining community he has reached seemingly exists outside of history.
                    Carpentier pits the Edenic surroundings of “<foreign xml:lang="sp">acá</foreign>” (here) against the “<foreign xml:lang="sp">allá</foreign>” (back
                    there) of everyday modern life in New York and Caracas. The native village has
                    bypassed the ravages of time and “progress” altogether; it is a “world compact,
                    complete . . . a hidden nation, a map in code, a vast vegetable kingdom with few
                    entrances” (126). Surrounded by native life and customs, the narrator
                    experiences “the years . . . melt away, vanish, in the dizzying backward flight
                    of time . . . We are in the Paleolithic age” (177–79). This part of the
                    narrative is no doubt an adaptation of the final lines of the second act, in
                    which Prometheus’s and Asia’s feats have reset history and have hence returned
                    the world back to its origins: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>We have passed Age's icy caves,</l>
                        <l>And Manhood's dark and tossing waves,</l>
                        <l>And Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray:</l>

                     </lg>
                  </quote> It is no coincidence that, in the midst of living in the native
                    community, the narrator mentions his “old plan” of working on <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, as he delights in being part of a primitive
                    oral society that is centered on community, memory, and literature. He learns
                    “that the Indians had preserved the memory of a confused epic . . . of a Carib
                    migration . . . [through which] the amazing unity of myths was borne out . . .
                    the poem lived in the memory of the generations of the jungle” (210). The
                    passage recalls Shelley’s own heterogeneous and eclectic myth of global
                    aspiration. A play that symbolically unites the West (Prometheus) and East
                    (Asia), <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is itself a “confused epic”
                    that bridges numerous traditions, faiths, and cultures.</p>
               <p>This ostensibly uncritical homage to Shelley’s drama starts to dwindle, however,
                    toward the end of the novel. While enjoying his new jungle life and using
                    language and imagery inspired by the Shelleyan imagination, the narrator appears
                    to lose touch with the actual details of the play. As he recounts, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> for him <quote> conveyed a sense of
                        resurrection, an emergence from darkness . . . Certain verses I recalled
                        would have fitted in admirably with my desire to work on <emph>a text made
                            of simple and direct words</emph>: ‘Ah me! Alas, pain, pain, pain ever,
                        for ever!’—‘No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure.’ And then
                        those choruses of mountains, springs, storms, elements by which I was
                        surrounded and I felt. That voice of the Earth, at once Mother, clay, womb,
                        like the Mothers of Gods who still reign in the jungle. And those hounds of
                        hell who break into the drama and howl with the accent of maenads rather
                        than furies. ‘Ha! I scent life!’ ‘Let me but look into his eyes!’” (166,
                        emphasis added) </quote> Notwithstanding the narrator’s (and Carpentier’s)
                    palpable admiration for the drama, any careful reader of Shelley’s play will
                    detect the blatant misreading. Most obviously, the language of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is neither simple nor direct. Nor are the furies
                    represented in Act I as agents of Dionysus. In an unusual manner, the above
                    lines interweave the fantastical aspects of Shelley’s drama with the narrator’s
                    inaccurate recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Yet these are not careless mistakes on Carpentier’s part. The mischaracterization
                    of Shelley’s work arrives at a fitting point in the novel when the narrator
                    stops idealizing the South American natives and landscape. This transformation
                    is signaled most pointedly and symbolically by the appearance of a copy of
                    Homer’s <title level="m">The Odyssey</title>. Snapping out of Shelleyan fantasy,
                    the narrator regains his “modern” consciousness. “But no,” he confesses, “it was
                    absurd to excite my imagination with [the cantata] when I did not have Shelley’s
                    poem there, and never would” (218). At this climactic juncture, rather than
                    resuming that “misbegotten Prelude to <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>,” he decides instead to compose a cantata on <title level="m">The Odyssey</title> (218). That is, the spell cast by Shelley’s
                    poetry is broken, as the turn to Homeric epic foreshadows not only the end of
                    the narrator’s sojourn in paradise but also his imminent return home to New
                    York.</p>
               <p>It is appropriate at this point in the novel that—as in the case with the
                    regeneration of the earth in <title level="m">Prometheus
                    Unbound</title>—veils and masks suddenly “fall.” Let us recall that, at
                    the end of Act III, the Spirit of the Hour declares: <quote>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>The painted veil, by those who were, called life,</l>
                        <l>Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread,</l>
                        <l>All men believed or hoped, is torn aside;</l>
                        <l>
                           <emph>The loathsome mask has fallen</emph>, the man remains</l>
                        <l>Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man</l>
                        <l>Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,</l>
                        <l>Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king</l>
                        <l>Over himself;</l>
                        <l rendition="#indent2">(III.iv.190–97, emphasis added)</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote> When the characters in the play report that masks and veils have
                    fallen, they mean that the regenerated earth has shed the unnatural distortions
                    caused by tyranny and corruption—allowing thus a view of things as they
                    really are. In <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, however, Carpentier
                    transforms the ends of the Shelleyan trope. Rather than highlighting the
                    illusions generated by a tainted world, the fallen veils seemingly betray the
                    pitfalls of Shelley’s play. This can be detected when, feeling like an intruder,
                    the narrator suspects he “had torn the veil” of the primitive society (203).
                    While he understands that he has reached a “primordial sense of beauty . . . in
                    such remoteness” (163)—a landscape “unshaken since prehistoric times”
                    (165)—Carpentier, unlike Shelley, ceases to depict nature as idealized. In
                    the jungle, beauty stands beside coarseness: a “slimy tangle of snakes,”
                    “rampant fauna,” and “primeval slime” (160–61). The narrator experiences “a kind
                    of disorientation, and dizziness of the eyes . . . a [feeling] of being
                    completely lost” within such a wilderness (161). This passage is reminiscent of
                    the dizzying and intoxicating haze that overwhelms Asia during her descent
                    toward Demogorgon, especially with echoes of the <title level="a">Life of
                        Life</title> hymn from the second act’s fifth scene. But, unlike Asia, who
                    releases Demogorgon through her proto-psychoanalytic introspection, the narrator
                    believes himself to be an interloper in the prelapsarian landscape: “We were
                    intruders, ignorant outlanders . . . in a city born in the dawn of History”
                    (179). He unmasks, as it were, the Shelleyan fantasy and reconsiders the value
                    of returning to one’s alleged origins: “If we go back a little farther, we will
                    come to the terrible loneliness of the Creator, the . . . sadness of the times
                    without incense or songs of praise, when the earth was without order and empty,
                    and darkness was upon the face of the deep” (187). Surviving in this “prenatal
                    world” becomes impossible, as the narrator is incapable of reconciling the
                    disjunction between the primitive and modern worlds (206).</p>
               <p>The narrator’s retreat from the South American cradle of civilization, then,
                    abruptly brings Carpentier’s Shelleyan experiment to its end. Despite the
                    jungle’s allure of art, poetry, seclusion, and exile, as well as his
                    “irresistible” desire to finish his Shelleyan cantata, he remembers the lack of
                    paper and other modern tools that have deterred him from figuratively turning
                    back those “58 centuries” (206). Like Prometheus, he recants, retracting his
                    original desires of remaining in paradise. Unlike Prometheus, though, he
                    ultimately decides to return <foreign xml:lang="sp">allá</foreign> to New York
                    City. When the narrator boards a plane that arrived in search of him, he
                    abandons Rosario and the Shelleyan imagination alike. Carpentier magnifies the
                    tension at this moment by drawing one final time upon Shelley’s poetry. During
                    takeoff, the narrator discovers “an opalescent mist . . . [that] cut us off from
                    everything . . . a fleecy bank of clouds” (238–39).<note place="foot" resp="author">Along her path in the underworld, Asia notes the “multitudes
                        of dense white fleecy clouds” that have filled her imagination
                        (II.i.145).</note> Though the narrator later tries to reverse his own “lost
                    steps” by returning to the South American jungle, the rising tide of the Amazon
                    blocks his entryway.</p>
               <p>Having retraced and allegedly rediscovered the “lost steps” of the human
                    community, the narrator willfully lets them go again. In so doing, he reveals
                    not only the irreducible gap created by time and error but also the incapacity
                    for art—especially in this case, Romantic literary writing—to heal
                    such wounds and fractures. In his tribute to and admiration for Shelley’s
                    lyrical drama, Carpentier’s profound engagement with the text also brings the
                    pitfalls of the utopian drama into relief. For, at least through the novel’s
                    depiction of the modern era of bourgeois capitalism, there exists neither a
                    redeeming Demogorgon nor a cosmic celebration of perpetual harmony. The secluded
                    and intimate South American jungle is not, after all, like Asia's and
                    Prometheus's cave of artistic cultivation, which sustains the renovated
                    universe. According to Carpentier’s conclusion,
                    this alternate prelapsarian South American space must remain elusive:
                    contained instead in hearts of darkness, chasms and caves of wonder, obscure
                    volumes, and even unfinished cantatas.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This essay presents a study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and
                    his poetic appropriation of the English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A
                    member of the Generation of '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 to deliver lectures
                    at Oxford and Cambridge, traveling to Glasgow, Cambridge, London, and the United
                    States before finally settling in Mexico. As an exile in Scotland and England,
                    Cernuda encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the
                    era, negotiating questions of poetical ethics and pertinence during an era of
                    modern warfare. Reading <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> and echoing Shelley a century later,
                    he asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” Cernuda decides, “but
                    also has certain social effects.” This essay offers an encompassing view of how
                    Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own poetics, negotiating an English
                    tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing his Romantic interests against
                    contemporary Modernist pressures.</p>

                  <head>The Fruit of Exile</head>
                  <p>Luis Cernuda arrived in Great Britain in March 1938, with
                    the lure of a series of lectures that the poet Stanley Richardson had promised
                    to organize for him to escape the dangers of the Spanish Civil War. He remained
                    in Glasgow until 1943, in Cambridge until 1945, and in London until 1947,
                    whereupon he made his way to Massachusetts, always working in educational and
                    university institutions. His stay in these English-speaking countries would be
                    extremely fruitful: during this time the poet wrote numerous essays, several
                    volumes of poems, a collection of short stories, and two books of prose poems
                    (<title level="m">Ocnos</title> and <title level="m">Variaciones sobre tema mexicano</title>).</p>
                  <p>The first thing the years spent in England gave to Cernuda
                    was his knowledge of the English language.<note place="foot" resp="author">According
                        to testimonies of his years in Glasgow,
                        his English skills were underdeveloped. However, it is fair to assume that
                        with time, and despite his shyness, Cernuda's linguistic skills in this
                        language improved.</note> A glance at the texts written during his exile allow the
                reader to recognize a loss of familiarity with the natural turn of phrases in oral Spanish.
                His grammatical constructions abound in unusual expressions and anastrophes and it is very
                common to find in his writings the use of Anglicisms and linguistic loans. A second element
                to be highlighted is the choice of reading materials. During his first stay at Cranleigh
                School, Cernuda began to read Shakespeare, Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Housman.
                Along with the Bible and the Spanish Golden Age classics, the English poets would always
                be present in his personal library. A third component acquired as a result of the years
                spent in England and the United States was the opportunity to engage in the translation
                of canonic works of the English literary tradition. Cernuda undertook the translation of
                two sonnets by Wordsworth, <title level="a">The Definition of Love</title> by Marvell,
                <title level="a">A Toccata of Gallupi’s</title> by Browning, <title level="a">Byzantium</title>
                by Yeats, and <title level="m">Troilus and Cressida</title> by Shakespeare. There are also
                indications that he was able to translate Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                and Blake’s <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>. Finally, it must
                also be mentioned that he was able to acquire many of the aesthetic criteria and tools
                for engaging in literary criticism, a task that Cernuda cultivated profusely. Dryden,
                Johnson, Coleridge and Arnold—names that are also considered by T.S. Eliot among
                the most eminent literary critics—are some of the critics that he mentions most
                often in his writings.</p>
                  <p>Of course, the critic to whom Cernuda probably paid most attention was Eliot himself,
                towards whom he harbored mixed feelings. On the one hand he admired his poetry but,
                on the other, he lost a certain impartiality in his judgment when his own verses were
                rejected from Eliot’s <title level="m">Faber &amp; Faber</title> collection.<note place="foot" resp="author">The essay <title level="a">Goethe and Mr. Eliot,</title>
                    for instance, could be read as a direct attack on Eliot. This essay is a direct rebuttal
                    to Eliot’s <title level="m">Goethe, or the Sage</title> (1959). Cernuda also openly
                        contradicts Eliot in <title level="a">Baudelaire en el centenario de <title level="m">Las
                            flores del mal</title>
                        </title> (1959). However, the importance of Eliot as the
                        central point of English criticism for Cernuda is undeniable: all the
                        references made by Cernuda in his texts (Herbert Read, I. A. Richards, Lord
                        Houghton, Middleton Murry, Lowes, etc.) match those listed in Eliot’s
                    <title level="m">The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</title> and
                    <title level="m">On Poetry and Poets</title>.</note> In this regard it should not be
                forgotten that Cernuda’s stay in Great Britain coincides with a moment of definitive
                recognition for Eliot: the last years of <title level="m">The
                    Criterion</title>, his beginnings in theater with the successful
                    <title level="m">Murder in the Cathedral</title>, etc. and with the conclusive backing of the Nobel
                    Prize. In fact, I believe that at least three features of Eliot’s critique
                    attracted Cernuda’s approval: the thesis of <title level="a">Tradition and Individual
                    Talent</title>, according to which tradition is not inherited “naturally,” which was the
                    criterion that had guided Cernuda himself during his formative years and had led
                    him to expand his reading and to learn languages; the Eliotian “correlative
                    objective” that Cernuda translates as “equivalente correlativo” in
                    <title level="m">Historial de un libro</title>; and the idea that the only legitimate critic is the
                    poet himself, which was recognizably and perfectly embodied in Eliot. In any
                    case, there is no doubt that these years, and especially those spent in England,
                    left their mark on Cernuda. “Perhaps my stay there,” he would write to Edward
                    Wilson from America, “has been the richest phase of my life so far, if not as a
                    mold first, then as a refinement of what I took there with me."<note place="foot" resp="author">This information is found, among other sources, in

                Part of this imprint, no doubt, was his reading of the English Romantic poets.</p>

                  <head>The Areas of Shadow</head>
                  <p>When Cernuda says that he learned a lot from English poetry, that his stay in England “completed”
                and “refined” what he had brought with him, he was being very precise. That being said, what did
                the poet “bring with him” when he arrived in England? What readings, teachings or references are
                to be found in his poetry from 1927 to 1938? It can be said that his trajectory prior to exile
                was a kind of journey against the current of time: he moved from the purism of <title level="m">Perfil del
                aire</title> (1927) to the surrealism of <title level="m">Un río, un amor</title> (1929) and
                <title level="m">Los placeres prohibidos</title> (1931); from there he shifted towards to the
                Becquerian Romanticism of <title level="m">Donde habite el olvido</title> (1933) and, finally,
                geared in the direction of the great European Romanticism, with the watchword of a neo-paganism
                inherited from the <emph>Greek Revival</emph> under the guidance of Hölderlin, in
                <title level="m">Invocaciones</title> (1935). In other words, our poet was already part of a
                Romantic family tree on the eve of his departure for England.</p>
                  <p>The starting point of that Romanticism—a consequence and a response to eighteenth-century
                rationalism—was the drama of the splitting of consciousness and the thirst for unity.
                Hölderlin exclaimed at the beginning of his <title level="m">Hyperion</title> that the highest
                human aspiration was “to be one with all that is alive, to return to the whole of nature” (25),
                while Wordsworth encoded in his “<emph>Aeolian visitations</emph>” a hint of participation in
                the <title level="m">Spirit of Nature</title> which he reveals in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>.
                In <title level="m">Palabras antes de una lectura</title> (1935), Cernuda gives an account of his
                beginnings in poetry:
                <quote>
                The poetic instinct awakened in me with the sharpest
                    perception of reality, experiencing, with a deep impact, the beauty and
                    attraction of the surrounding world. Its effect was, somewhat similarly to what
                    happens with the desire that love produces, the painful and intense necessity to
                    rise up out of myself, drowning in that vast body of creation. What made this
                    desire even more agonizing was the tacit recognition of its impossible
                    satisfaction. (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602)<note place="foot" resp="author">All translations from Spanish by Gabriel Insausti.</note>
                     </quote>
                I believe that with a touch of Freudian language (the
                    urgency of artistic creation as the sublimation of eroticism, the “desire for
                    death” as the path to reintegration into unity), it is easy to recognize in
                    these words the same melancholy that moved Hölderlin and Wordsworth: the urge
                    for communion with nature and the loss of a Kantian lost paradise of immediacy.
                    That is to say, that poetic writing would have in its origin the ascertainment
                    of this rift and would consist of an attempt (inevitably frustrated, suggests
                    Cernuda) to suture it. Poetry, once wrote Novalis, heals the wounds that
                    philosophy inflicts.</p>
                  <p>If we look closely at this narrative of the origins, the Romantic affiliation clearly reappears. In
            <title level="m">Historial de un libro</title> (1958), for example, Cernuda refers to the first time
                he was pushed to write poetry: during his military service he went out on horseback around the
                outskirts of Seville every afternoon, and during one of these excursions “things appeared to me
                as if I were seeing them for the first time, as if I were entering and communicating with them for
                the first time, and this unusual vision, simultaneously provoked in me an expressive urgency, the
                urgency to tell of this experience” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 626). That was the same
                attitude that Coleridge had envisioned in his <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>,
                and also that of Wordsworth in his <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), where this
                latter explains that the purpose of
                    poetry was “to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the
                    mind’s attention from the lethargy of custom,” which prevents us from seeing
                    everything anew. In short, this Romantic theorization of poetry would be an
                    intimation of the concept of “defamiliarization” that formalist criticism would
                    erect as the cornerstone of literary writing. However, as Cernuda had already
                    said, this attempt to take over the world by word of mouth was invariably bound
                    to frustration:
                    <quote>
                    I began to distinguish a simultaneous and opposite current
                    within me: towards reality and against reality, of attraction and hostility
                    towards what is real. Desire led me to the reality that offered itself before my
                    eyes, as if only by its possession could I attain certainty about my own life.
                    But like that possession I have never reached it except in a precarious way,
                    hence the opposite current of hostility to the ironic attraction of reality.

                    Hence, from this conflict, the title that presides over all his poetic work:
                    <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>. Again, a further development of Romanticism: the
                    inescapable tantalizing frustration in which Schopenhauer’s thought ends up. It
                    is not surprising to find that this expression of isolated subjectivity is
                    expressed through allegory. On this topic Philip Silver has observed that
                    allegory is the means by which isolated subjectivity with the environment and
                    nature is usually featured, given that—unlike the language of the symbols—it
                    presupposes a pause, a disjunction (<title level="a">Hacia</title>). Finally, this Romanticism had
                    closed ranks around a fundamental idea, that of imagination. This dimension
                    appears as an alternative to a scientific vision of the world, characteristic of
                    the eighteenth-century mentality. It is science that Hölderlin accuses of
                    “having ruined everything,” and it is through it that the poet has learned “to
                    differentiate myself fundamentally from what surrounds me, […] I have thus been
                    expelled from the garden of nature” (26). Wordsworth expresses this idea
                    memorably in <title level="a">The Tables Turned</title>:

               With its analytical impulse and its proliferation of
                    distinctions, science would thus be reduced to a “scrutiny” of the physical

                     </note> Against the inanimate mechanism, Wordsworth would pursue a
                personal and unitary experience of nature, in which something remains unobtainable through
                mere analysis. This idea of <emph>natura naturans</emph> and its correlation to the imagination
                as an invisible link between nature and the poet’s soul appears in the
                <title level="m">Ocnos</title> poem meaningfully entitled <title level="a">La naturaleza,</title>
                where Cernuda recalls a child’s proximity to the natural environment:
                <quote>
                What a joy when I saw the leaves break at last, and their
                    tender color, which by force of transparency almost seemed luminous,
                    accentuating the raised veins, darkened little by little with the strongest sap.
                    I felt as if He himself had worked the miracle of life, of awakening on the
                    fundamental earth, such a god, the form previously dormant in the dream of the
                    non-existent. (<title level="m">Poesía Completa</title> 554)
                </quote>
                This passage resonates with the Rousseauian mythology of childhood as well as with Wordsworth’s idea of
                <emph>vision and faculty divine</emph>, whose purest expression lies in that of a child's gaze.
                    It is only that this participation in the intimacy of nature takes place in the
                    past perfect and in the third person, as if the poet were inescapably distancing
                    himself from an experience he can no longer share, in a melancholic suggestion.
                    In any case, if Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley and Keats agreed on
                    something, over and above the nominalist differences, it was in vindicating that
                    the queen among the faculties, imagination, is capable of glimpsing a reality
                    superior to everyday life. Cernuda, who revels the Romantic imagination as the
                    source of the “individualistic attitude” and the “supremacy of the spirit”
                    characteristic of Romantic poets (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 271–72), is very close to this Romantic idea when he
                    affirms that the essence of the poetic problem “is the conflict between reality
                    and desire, between appearance and truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse
                    of the complete image of the world that we do not know, of the ‘divine idea of
                    the world that lies at the bottom of the appearance,’ according to Fichte’s
                    phrase” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602). On the other hand, on the marginal
                nature of this task, (the historic defeat of the Romantic amendment to the unilateralities
                of enlightened rationalism), our poet is not fooled: “Modern society, unlike those that
                preceded it, has decided to dispense with the inseparable mysterious element of life. Unable
                to explore it, society prefers to pretend not to believe in its existence. But the poet
                cannot proceed in this way and must count on that area of shadow and fog in life that floats
                around human bodies” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602–4). The Cernudian melancholy therefore exudes a
                    quality that places it unequivocally in the tradition of high European
                    Romanticism. It also places it on the path of some sort of “reactionary” or
                    anti-modern trend: despite the attempt of modern scientificism to “disenchant”
                    the world—according to Weber, and later to Adorno and Horkheimer—the mystery in
                    life remains. And that means that the ultimate truth cannot be grasped through
                    reason, but through imagination.</p>

                  <head>The Underlying Fire</head>
                  <p>It is worth making a few comments on the significance of this Cernudian reception of
                English Romanticism. First, we must remember the obvious fact that Spanish Romanticism
                had historically been very weak and had not produced any noteworthy poet. This would make
                of Cernuda a sort of “late-yielding fruit,” apparently inactive in an outdated rhetoric,
                if it were not for his ability to recover elements of that rhetoric in order to build a
                relevant discourse. Secondly, it should be noted that at the time of this reception,
                Romanticism had been “dismissed” in the English literary officialdom, due to the
                anti-Romantic tirades that Pound, Eliot, and <emph>modernism</emph> in general had
                launched against the Wordsworthian tradition since the war years, in order to displace
                some Georgians who were contemplating the exhaustion of that tradition. Thirdly, when
                Cernuda assimilated the reading of the English Romantic poets, he did not take into
                account the revision that began with <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title>
                (1953) by M. H. Abrams. He could not have read either—as they were yet to be
                produced—the later interpretations of Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartmann, and Harold Bloom.</p>
                  <p>The Cernudian reading of Romanticism dealt with authors
                    and works that had been subject to prejudice for decades. This was the case, for
                    instance of the Victorian dilemma between the aesthetes, Wilde, Pater, Rossetti,
                    etc., and moralists such as Carlyle, Arnold, and Morris, who tended to
                    assimilate the Romantic legacy to the first group in a biased vision that
                    amputated the Romantic message to the point of denaturing it. This was a dualism
                    that, as Raymond Williams observed, was the result of the false image of the
                    Romantic artist as an isolated aesthete in his individual solipsism
                    (30).<note place="foot" resp="author">A brief inspection is enough to refute
                        this: Blake introduced criticisms of labor exploitation and racism in his
                        <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title>, developed a summary examination
                        of his own homeland in <title level="m">The Daughters of Albion</title>, and proclaimed
                        revolution in <title level="m">America</title>; Wordsworth incorporated his
                        autobiographical account of the march of European civilization in the
                        chapters on the French Revolution included in <title level="m">The
                            Prelude</title>; Coleridge went beyond the subject of defending rural life
                        in poems such as <title level="a">This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison</title> or
                        <title level="a">Frost at Midnight</title>; he expressed his disappointment at
                        the revolutionary phenomenon in <title level="a">France: an Ode</title> and
                        admonished England against its own social and political ills in <title level="a">Fears in Solitude</title>;
                        Shelley adopted an avowedly committed attitude with <title level="m">Queen
                        Mab</title> and <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title>; and Keats, with
                        his ideas on empathy, taken from Hazlitt and moralists from the previous
                        century such as Shaftesbury and Adam Smith, advanced the modern poet's
                        ethical viewpoint.</note> Obviously, this dualism is indebted to the language of
                the Romantics themselves: think of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s fancy and imagination; or
                think of Coleridge’s distinction between reason and understanding; or think of the antagonism
                between reason and imagination in Keats’s <title level="a">Letters</title>; or
                    think of the all-pervading logics of dialectics in Blake, with the constant
                    struggle of Los and Urizen. How could Cernuda cope with that?</p>
                  <p>The first half of the essay <title level="a">Pensamiento poético en la lírica inglesa del siglo
                    XIX</title> suggests that, according to Cernuda, the
                    temperament and "metaphysical position" of these poets is only understood
                    against the background of industrialization and rural exodus (and also, of
                    course, in the context of the English empiricist tradition). His particular
                    judgment on them confirms it: in Cernuda’s opinion, “the ethical intention is
                    evident in Wordsworth” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 295), while in Blake
                there would be a mystic and a revolutionary that our poet relates to the figures of
                Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Thus, far from sterile aestheticism or inane escapism,
                Romanticism could have an outcome in the form of civil responsibility. In <title level="m">Río vespertino</title>
                Cernuda states this in unmistakably Romantic terms when he declares that

            The revelation of the imagination is an alternative
                    reality to mere (and unsatisfactory) factuality. Contrary to what the doctrines
                    of the engaged artist proclaimed in the twentieth century, Cernuda’s civil
                    responsibility did not opt for a dissolution of individuality. The task of
                    challenging individualism, which in Byron or Shelley could reach the theatrical,
                    was only the starting point of the Romantic program. Cernuda seems to remember

                    What can the poet do for himself? Never before has society
                    reduced life to such narrow limits. Certainly, the poet is almost always a
                    revolutionary, at least I believe he is; a revolutionary who, like other men,
                    lacks freedom, but who, unlike them, cannot accept this imprisonment and who
                    runs into the walls of his prison countless times. (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 603)

            Poetry, in short, could constitute a sort of <foreign xml:lang="sp">ultima ratio</foreign>, and the
                poet would be characterized as a being defeated beforehand by the practical world that of mere
                efficiency, capitalism and <emph>Realpolitik</emph>. Moreover, Cernuda goes so far as to claim
                that in expressing man’s reaction to survive in a society where there is no room for him, Blake and Wordsworth
                    would be, even before Baudelaire, the first modern poets. Against this state of
                    affairs (that of “reality”), Cernuda opposes an ethical affirmation, that of
                    “desire,” which is once again Romantic, in the tributes to the figure of the
                    literary hero contained in poems such as <title level="a">F. G. L,</title>
                     <title level="a">A Larra, con unas violetas,</title> and <title level="a">Góngora</title>
                among others. In these texts, the poet is shown in
                    constant confrontation with a hostile environment and political dissatisfaction
                    would form part of his case. "Poetry is not only useful," Cernuda deduces from
                    Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title>, "but also has certain social effects"
                (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 333). This is not to say that our poet is in favor of
                <emph>all</emph> the Romantic pronouncements in this sense, and in his reluctance we can
                see the shadow of the problems and the embarrassment that imprisoned the writer of the
                twentieth century—fundamentally, the urgency of taking sides but the reticence
                to a compromise that reduced his voice to a watchword. On Shelley, Cernuda observes that
                the primacy of action can be guessed in him, and only when this latter failed did the
                English poet make up his mind to use his forces differently—that is, in an exercise
                of writing that would be characterized as a substitute for real political activity. The
                result is a poetic theory that borders on propaganda, as can be seen in the letter to Thomas
                Love Peacock—written in Naples on January 26th 1819—, which Cernuda mentions:
                “I consider poetry,” Shelley said there, “to be very subordinate to morality and political
                science” (Shelley quoted by Cernuda 501). Despite the Victorian caricature, the poetics of
                political <emph>engagement</emph> were sometimes not too far from the Romantic sensibility.
                In fact, the Romantic poets were very often on the verge of preaching such a doctrine. And
                Cernuda, long before Williams stressed on this aspect, was quite right to underline the moral
                and political implications of some of these poems.</p>
                  <p>Interestingly, this recovery of the ethical and political aspect of Romanticism had reached a
                remarkable milestone during Cernuda’s English years. In 1937 Stephen Spender—whom our
                poet met in a slightly unpleasant appointment recounted by Rafael Martínez Nadal (86–90)—published
                a book entitled <title level="m">Forward from Liberalism</title> (1937). What was Spender’s proposal?
                Between the “anti-heroic” myth of Auden’s generation and the new political urgency caused by the
                rise of fascism, which would lead Harry Pollitt to wish that with his trip to a Spain at war he
                would become “a new Byron,” Spender advocated for a development of the Romantic program. In his
                opinion, this program had been fenced in; it promoted social justice and an idea of the role of
                the writer that returned to Shelley's famous phrase that poets are "prophets" and "the unacknowledged
                legislators of the world."<note place="foot" resp="author">From <title level="m">A Defence of
                Poetry</title>
                     </note> The Cernudian poetry of exile—with its heroic recreation of the figure
                of the poet, its critical position in the face of events, its evaluation of the Spanish reality,
                and its historical examination of Spanishness, as well as the warmongering and capitalism that
                shake his host countries—corresponds with this definition.</p>
                  <p>Of course, this does not mean that the totality of <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>
                fits within this Romantic image: modalities of discourse such as the doubling, the dramatic
                monologue, the culturalist piece, or the metaliterary poem of his last years point to other
                sources. What I want to highlight is that this consideration of Romanticism in all its breadth
                allows us to resolve the traditional dualism between the “Edenist” interpretation of the Cernudian
                work (the one defended by Philip Silver, according to which its fundamental meaning, with the
                “thirst for eternity” as the “unifying theme” (<title level="m">Luis Cernuda</title>
                48), corresponds to the Romantic argument of the expulsion from paradise) and the “ethicist”
                argument (the one fundamentally
                    advocated by Derek Harris (13–14), for whom, as time goes by, there is a
                    distancing "from the Romantic vision of the world" in Cernuda). Why? Because,
                    although it is true that the Edenist thesis (the evocation of paradise, and the
                    longing and the search for restitution, even if vicarious, through writing) is
                    almost exclusively based on <title level="m">Ocnos</title> and a few poems from
                    <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>, if one considers Romanticism in
                    all its aspects, as I
                    have proposed here, the critical attitude is not excluded from the
                    characterization of the Cernudian character as "Romantic." On the other hand,
                    Paz's idea that our poet is "one of the few moralists that Spain has given," but
                    a moralist "who tests the systems of collective morality" (116), fits perfectly
                    into this model, which would provide a channel for Cernuda's temperamental
                    individualism. Of course, the idea of "spiritual biography" that accompanies the
                    ethicist thesis would be perfectly congruent with a Romanticism that, far from
                    the symbolist ideal of full autonomy, always preserves a knot between the poet
                    and the poem.</p>

                  <p>How does this Cernudian Romanticism manifest in the poems? Of course, it is not difficult

                    the blackbird of <title level="a">Río vespertin</title> whose fate is “purer than that of man” seems
                    to be inherited directly from the nightingales of Coleridge and Keats, from
                    Shelley’s lark and from Wordsworth’s redbreast, and also reissues an eminently
                    Romantic theme such as the affirmation of the superiority of nature over art
                    (Poesía Completa 371); <title level="a">Violetas,</title> where the spiked flowers are for a moment
                    “norma para lo efímero que es bello” and “vivo embeleso en la memoria,”

                    at other aspects of the Cernudian writings perhaps less striking or
                    recognizable, but also less anecdotal, insofar as they inform the whole of his
                    poetry of exile. To observe them (and to read in them a poetry of that
                    longed-for Romantic unity), one needs only to reread <title level="a">Cementerio en la ciudad,</title>

            One of the constants of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s poetry is a sense of expression that rejects the
                <emph>wit-writing</emph> of the Augustan poets: that association of wit—“For works may have
            more wit than does ‘em good, / As bodies perish through excess of blood,” Pope himself warned
            (303–4)—that in Coleridge's theory is linked to an "inferior" faculty, fantasy. Cernuda takes
            up this doctrine with no less constancy: in <title level="a">Tres poetas metafísicos</title> he warns
            that the predominance of wit was “a primary condition and instrument of imaginative creation” in
            seventeenth-century Spanish “conceptismo,” and that “under such a weight of associations the unique
            reality that the word supposes disappears as something annoying and useless” (<title level="m">Prosa
            I</title> 512). The verbal fireworks would have an irritating effect that subtracts their substantial
            reality from things. Hence the accusation of a “wit game” that Cernuda launches against Salinas and, in
            general, against much of the Spanish tradition. In the face of the rapid and startling succession of
            parts, Cernuda stressed the unity of the whole. The circularity of <title level="a">Cementerio en la
            ciudad,</title> where the fourth stanza picks up and places in time the scene of the first one, where
            every startling association is eluded to (except, slightly, in the adjectivization of the “clandestine
            dead”), points in that direction.</p>
                  <p>This sense of expression was accompanied in the Lake poets by a very determined prosody: a discarding
            of the heroic couplet and a recovery of the Miltonic blank verse, which in the last century had seen
            notable attempts, such as Young’s <title level="m">Night Thoughts</title>. In Cernuda’s case, the search
            for a different musicality and a diffuse intensity, scattered throughout the whole poem, which does not
            privilege that moment of brilliance, is obtained in part from a similar attempt that resorts to a dialogue
            between grammatical unity and meter (that is, between the phrase and the sentence that strictly coincided
            with Pope, creating an effect of mere juxtaposition). The “sliding from one verse to another, which in
            Spanish I believe is called <foreign xml:lang="sp">encabalgamiento</foreign>” (<title level="m">Prosa
            I</title> 650), in the words of Cernuda himself, will be one of the most constant features of his poetry
            of exile, as can be seen here in lines 6–7, 12–13, and 19–20. Again, the discursiveness reveals a poetics
            of unity: the true sign is the poem as a whole, and not a memorable fragment that can be removed
            from the piece without losing its meaning.</p>
                  <p>This discursiveness often stems from a morose <foreign xml:lang="la">compositio loci</foreign>, which
                relates many similar poems to the model that M.
                    H. Abrams (1965) considered characteristic of high Romanticism: the great ode,
                    which after a descriptive start in which the speaker is situated, focuses one’s
                    attention on a detail of the panorama to introduce a reflection and finally
                    returns to the initial stage, as happens in some poems by Shelley, Wordsworth
                    and, above all, Coleridge. In <title level="a">Historial de un libro,</title> Cernuda linked this
                    procedure with his teaching experience, in which he sought “that my explanations
                    would lead the students to see for themselves what I was going to tell them”
                    (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 645): in short, it was a question of evading the declarative
                form and seeking greater objectivity, not to blurt out to the reader a series of sentimental outpourings.
                It does not take much effort to recognize this series of events in <title level="a">Cementerio en la
                ciudad,</title> where the delay in the descriptive phase is accompanied by figures of amplification and
                argumentation: the parenthesis (line 14), the enumeration (first and third stanzas), the rhetorical
                question (line 17), conciliation (lines 19–22), the apostrophe (lines 28–30). These are strategies to
                expand from particular anecdotes to universal themes as, in this case, death (and its paradoxical link
                with life, in a relationship that is not one of mutual exclusion). This meditative aspect of Cernudian
                writing—which José Ángel Valente highlighted in <title level="m">Palabras de la
                tribu</title> (11–12), relating it to the idea of Coleridge’s imagination—would have been a great
                renewal for a Spanish poetry that Miguel de Unamuno contemptuously defined in his 1904 letter to Juan
                Arzadun as mere “rhymed eloquence,” since it would allow for the “sensory apprehension” of thought
                (60–61)—that is, a reconciliation of faculties that was an eminently Romantic aspiration and
                that Schiller had placed at the core of the aesthetic experience: once again, the search for unity.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it is not too risky to say that, due to a surrealist influence—Vicente Huidobro’s
                creationism, Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s humor, Ortega’s boldness and approval—the poem was
                often a succession of metaphors in Cernuda’s generation. His choice of maturity, however, consisted
                of opting for the image, as can be seen here in the verses 12–13, 22–23 and 26–27. So, what’s the big
                difference? The key difference is that against the purely tropical technique, against the substitutive
                game, the image allowed the coexistence of real and figurative elements, and a poet who pursued both
                the free flight of the imagination and the rescue of the most literal empirical reality thus found
                the bridge between both kingdoms. Jorge Luis Borges, always such a friend of British literature, agreed
                in this regard when he advised the Spanish writer to beware of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">phrase à effet</foreign>
                for ingenuity, which is a danger, in a controversy as old as Aristotle’s <title level="m">Rhetoric</title>.
                “In the image,” declares Cernuda, “there is more poetic creation than in
                    metaphor” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 175). Why? For the very Romantic reason that
                “imagination is more holistic than wit." Unity, once again. It was not in vain that the task
                of the poet, as <title level="a">Río vespertino</title> outlines, was to “see the scattered
                being in unity.” Cernuda applied himself to the task with tools that his vernacular tradition
                could not provide.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay focuses on Keats’s reception and critical influence through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges
                    and Julio Cortázar, the two giants of Argentine letters. Both writers depicted and identified Keats as a misunderstood
                    figure that needed to be rescued by their intervention. They seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own
                    intellectual community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” Cortázar and Borges’s reading
                    of Keats as a contemporary challenges the colonial view of Latin American literary creations as subsidiary of
                    the European tradition, renegotiating transatlantic dynamics of colonial cultural interactions. The essay
                    traces the theme of Negative Capability in Borges’s 1952 essay <title level="a">Keats’s Nightingale,</title> and
                    the chameleon figure in Julio Cortázar’s <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>.</p>

               <p>During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many Latin American writers were
                fascinated by the aristocratic and legendary lives of British Romantic poets such as
                Byron and Shelley. Their poetic works had not only a literary but also a political
                impact in Spanish speaking countries, where they were seen as paradigmatic images of
                rebellion, independence, and revolution. These figures were incorporated and
                imported into the Latin American imagination as early as 1850 (as shown in this
                volume’s essays by Hart, Payán, and Insausti). Keats, however, did not enjoy the
                same celebrity; his short life was full of financial trouble, and it was very
                unlikely that he would inspire the imagination of the Latin American writers of the
                time, so avid of glamorous, Romantic heroism. His afterlives in this continent would
                not spark until the 1950s, when he was awoken by two Argentinian writers, Jorge Luis
                Borges and Julio Cortázar, who portray him as an odd presence of the English
                Romantic letters. They see in his image a reflection of their own condition as
                outsiders to the European canon. Although Keats is already established as a pillar
                of British poetry, they approach him as a sort of “minor” writer who has not yet
                received proper recognition. By strategically approaching Keats as an “underrated”
                predecessor, Borges and Cortázar succeed at transplanting him as a living presence
                into their own time and city of Buenos Aires, decades after the poet’s death in
                Rome. In Borges’s essay we will meet Keats by the fire of the family’s personal
                library. We will meet him again, later, walking arm in arm with Cortázar, wandering
                around the outskirts of the city.</p>
               <p>My analysis of these transatlantic dialogues trace two different readings. In Borges’s works,
                the Romantic poet is the object of celebratory odes and the topic of an insightful essay
                that underscores his uniqueness and originality. With his characteristic erudite irony,
                Borges proposes that Keats has been misunderstood by English critics, and offers himself
                as a poetic defense attorney that pleads for a corrective view of his works. Cortázar,
                on the other hand, rescues Keats’s image through a lengthy biography written between 1948
                and 1952, where he brings the Romantic poet as a pal that walks with him through Buenos
                Aires. Through an examination of these afterlives, I ask the question of how Cortázar and
                Borges invent their own image of the British poet in order to engage with him as equals.
                Subverting canonical and colonial hierarchies, both Argentinians draw portraits of Keats
                as a “marginal” and misunderstood poet that needs to be rescued by their intervention.
                They feel entitled to reinterpret and reassess the value of his works, to integrate his
                presence into their own community of intellectual peers—not as a master, but as a comrade-in-arms.</p>
               <p> It is no coincidence that two of the most prominent readers of Keats in Latin
                America happened to be from Argentina. Historically, this country was shaped and
                transformed by waves of immigration from the early nineteenth century through the
                first half of the twentieth. During these decades, the immigration of Europeans was
                not only well regarded, but encouraged and even facilitated by government
                policies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> During 1852–1923 Argentina adopted a
                    policy of “libertad de inmigración” which allowed European citizens to migrate
                    to the country and receive the same rights and benefits as the locals. In some
                    occasions the government also helped with the cost of relocation that
                    incentivized the influx of migrants. For more information on this subject,
                    see Fernando Devoto’s <title level="a">Ideas, políticas y prácticas migratorias
                        argentinas en una perspectiva de largo plazo (1852–1950).</title>
                  </note> Like
                many other South American countries, after declaring its
                independence, the recently constituted Nation of Argentina sought to find its path
                towards progress and modernization. The feeling of belatedness in comparison to
                Europe caused the former colonies to look towards the Old Continent in search of
                political, intellectual and economic models. Politicians such as Domingo Faustino

                            and American “barbarism.”</note> Following the same logic, he opened the borders and invited citizens
                from Italy, France, Spain, and England—among others—to settle in Argentina, under
                the belief that the migratory waves would transform the country into a modern and
                prosperous European-like state. I will not comment here on the problematic ideology
                behind these political decisions, nor about its socio-economic consequences. I
                allude to this historical event only to underline the fact that during these years,
                there was an important presence of European cultural goods, art objects, and ideas
                that were brought into the country by the families and individuals who established
                themselves here. The immigrants who came to Argentina and settled in the country
                brought with them not only a work force, industrial knowledge, machinery, and
                economic practices, but also their own languages, objects, and even their private
                book collections. </p>
               <p>This was the case of Jorge Luis Borges’s ancestors. Following the accounts that the
                author provides about the history of his family in his <title level="m">Autobiographic
                Essay</title>, Emir Rodriguez Monegal reminds us of Borges’s
                English origins and alludes to the formative influence of the British grandmother
                who, “though she had come to Argentina as a young woman and had married an Argentine
                … continued to inhabit the English speaking world” (15). In his well-documented
                biography, Rodriguez Monegal tells the story of Fanny Haslam’s arrival to Argentina,
                her marriage to Francisco Borges, and the years she lived in the same household with
                both of Jorge Luis’ parents (7–9). Under Fanny’s care, Georgie—as he was called by
                his relatives—grew up speaking English at home and “learned to read in this language
                before he did in Spanish” (15). The importance of providing an English education in
                the Borges family is not to be underestimated: not only was the language used within
                the household but was also a fundamental part of their schooling. Instead of sending
                young Jorge Luis to a public institution, his father hired an English governess to
                oversee the first years of his son’s education (Rodriguez Monegal 98). This decision
                was not motivated exclusively by a nostalgic—and undoubtedly colonial—attachment to
                the traditions and culture of Europe. As the Uruguayan biographer observes, it must
                also be understood within the frame of historical events:
                <quote>
                …there was then rampant in Argentina a sort of pro-British snobbery that would
                dominate Buenos Aires society as the century advanced … This change had an economic
                base … the independence of the River Plate area was achieved under the aegis of British diplomacy and
                commerce. Until World War II, Argentina belonged to the pound sterling international
                trading zone and was virtually part of the Commonwealth. (18)
                </quote>
                The role England played in the development of industry, trade, politics, and culture
                was such that during the last quarter of the century, as Erika Beckman reminds us,
                Argentina formed part of what historians have called “Britain’s ‘informal’ empire”
                    (112).<note place="foot" resp="author">To understand the complexities of the

               </p>
               <p> In this context of commercial and cultural attachment, where the consumption of
                European culture and products was equated with the aqcuisition of a “civilized”
                status, it is not surprising to find spaces that symbolically embody this admiration
                and dependence. This is the case of Borges’s family collection, full of “unlimited
                English books,” which Jorge Luis speaks of with marvel: “If I were asked to name the
                chief event in my life, I should say it was my father’s library. In fact, sometimes
                I think I have never strayed out of that library” (quoted by Rodriguez Monegal 3).
                It is in this room—remembered by Borges as a mythical space—that he one night felt
                the revelation of poetry as he heard his father recite the <title level="a">Ode To a Nightingale.</title>
                This is also the moment when his apprectiation for Keats started, as did his
                life-long dialogue with the poet. In a house of British descendants located on the
                outskirts of Buenos Aires, amongst an admirable collection of English books, began
                the first of Keats’s Argentinian afterlives discussed here.<note place="foot" resp="author">For critical studies that analyze the relation between Borges and Keats,

               </p>
               <p> In <title level="m">Otras inquisitionces</title> (1952), Borges includes an essay
                entitled <title level="a">El ruiseñor de Keats</title> (<title level="a">Keats’s
                Nightingale</title>). This text puts forwards an
                interpretation of the famous ode where Borges underscores an opposition between
                human transcience and poetic immortality. Borges analyzes this poem as a reflection
                upon the atemporality of the poetic rapture that is presented as successive across
                the ages and is, therefore, eternal. The nightingale is adopted as the symbolic
                image of this phenomenon and when it is perceived, the poetic mystery is momentarily
                revealed. However, this revelation also brings about awareness of one’s own
                mortality: when confronted with the sublime feeling of beauty and eternity, humans
                are reminded of their own death. Though Borges’s interpretation is interesting,
                there is not much novelty in it. What I want to highlight instead as an original
                approach in his text is the fact that Borges insists on drawing a portrait of Keats
                as a “marginal” and misundersood figure. In order to do so, he skillfully combines
                biographical information with critical readings of the ode to put forward a rather
                heterodox interpretation. </p>
               <p> In the opening lines of the essay, Borges alludes, almost as in passing, to the
                hardships that defined Keats’s life:
                <quote>
                Sick with tuberculosis, poor and perhaps also unfortunate in love, at the age of
                twenty-three, on one April night of 1819, he composed the <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title> In
                that suburban garden, he heard the eternal nightingale of Ovid and Shakespeare, and
                he felt his own mortality, and he contrasted it to the tenuous everlasting voice of
                the invisible bird.” (II: 95)<note place="foot" resp="author">All translations of texts

                His appropriation of the Romantic poet emphasizes the elements that make of him an
                underdog, a “suburbian” presence with regards to his environment and to the English
                tradition. The insistence on drawing his portrait according to the legend of “poor
                Keats,” as well as his emphatic location of the poet in a “jardin suburbano,”
                responds to the centrifugal force by which Borges tries to pull the Romantic poet
                towards a position of symbolic marginality. And by doing so, he succeeds in locating
                himself in a position of parity with his English peer. The essay elaborates on this
                “creative misreading”—using Harold Bloom’s critical term—and uses additional
                critical materials to reinforce a fringe-reading of Keats. It is not by chance nor a
                mere adherence to conventions that Borges forefronts this information. The dramatic
                effect of this presentation moves the reader to interpret his sickness and poverty
                as signs announcing Keats’s isolation and estrangement. By highlighting this, Borges
                applies the first brush strokes of a portrait that fits the legend of “poor Keats”
                which, as Edward Hirsch observes, “comes not only from his early detractors … but
                also from some of his later admirers” (xvii). What we find in the letters, as well
                as in the many reliable biographies of the poet (Lowell, Roe, Bate), is that the
                spring of 1819 was not such a terrible season for Keats. Although the first signs of
                his illness were already manifest, his health had not yet dramatically deteriorated.
                Following the death of his brother, he is constantly sourrounded by close friends
                and keeps a most active social life. Additionally, he has just met Fanny Brawne and
                they have fallen in love. None of this comes across in the depiction that Borges
                offers, where we find a much more passive, frail, and isolated character. The
                Argentine author selects a number of facts that fit into the legend of the feeble
                and sensitive artist outcasted by his society. By creating a narrative that
                coherently reinforces this view, the displacement of the English writer to a
                position of marginality allows Borges to situate himself in a relation of closeness
                and empathy from which he can advocate for his predecesor. </p>
               <p>Simultaneously, as he builds up the case of margnizalization that calls for a
                corrective intervention, Borges advances a veiled tactic of identification: by
                pointing out that the place of composition of the ode was a suburban garden, he
                draws a parallel with his own biography. He wishes to stress the fact that he and
                Keats are located on the peripheries of their respective cities. Both Keats and
                Borges are poets of the outskirts. What appears as a seemingly anecdotal remark
                points to a more complex strategy of shifting towards the margins of cultural
                centers. Symbolically, Borges is trying to dislodge this celebrated bard from his
                pedestal and drags him back out to the outposts of the English tradition. While
                recognizing his centrality for the canon of British poetry, Borges is more
                interested in emphasizing the image of an isolated Keats who does not fully belong
                to London society. By placing him back in the suburbs, the Argentine writer starts
                laying the suggestion that will be developed in further paragraphs: to encounter
                Keats, to dialogue freely with him, they must meet outside of the charted maps of
                metropolis. As they move away from the established cultural centers, hierarchies
                weaken and the stability of literary institutions starts to fade out, allowing for
                alternative networks of connection to be created and relations of influence to be
                renegotiated. </p>
               <p>Before moving forward with this portrayal of Keats, a note on the notion of Borges’s
                sense of marginality is needed. The notion of a not-subordinate “periphery” becomes
                fundamental to understand Borges’s dialogues with other Western cultures and
                literary figures. In 1992, Beatriz Sarlo presented a series of lectures on the works
                of the Argentinian writer where she proposed to understand him as a “writer on the
                edge.” The central concept of her study was that of the “border,” and she analyzed
                Borges’s literature as one that is issued from gaps, spaces in between frontiers,
                and blurried limits. Sarlo points out that Borges’s poetry and fictions explore the
                imaginary spaces dividing the city and the countryside, the idealized epic past and
                his own present time, mythology and history, fiction and reality. Similarly, she
                observes how his writings are built upon a dialogue between national and
                cosmopolitan elements that intertwine and create a territory of exchange, tension,
                and hybridization. The Argentine author oscillates between local elements with which
                he does not totally identify, and the “nostalgia for a European culture which can
                never wholly offer an alternative cultural base” (Sarlo). By locating himself in the
                margins of his own culture and in the sidelines of other traditions, he makes his
                literature shift from one border to others, constantly renewing lines of attachment
                and familiarity to each side:
                <quote>
                By reinventing a national tradition, Borges also offers Argentine culture an oblique
                reading of Western literatures. From the edge of the West, Borges achieves a
                literature that is related to foreign literature but not in any subordinate way…
                (Sarlo)
                </quote>
                In accordance with Sarlo’s view of Borges as a writer on the margins, I would like to
                expand her idea and consider the Argentinian intellectual also as a “reader of
                edges.” From his self-assumed position as an outsider, he reshuffles the networks of
                literary tradition, bringing to light unexplored faces of canonic writers and
                uncharted paths of connection between texts that would otherwise remain foreign to
                each other. The reading of other authors as if they were also in the edges of their
                own time and space allows for the creation of alternative options of spatial and
                chronological organization that do not need to conform to the constrains of
                geographical proximity or linear historicity. What Borges as a reader of peripheries
                gains is the possibility to playfuly appropriate elements from the central tradition
                in order to bring them outside of their original circles in order to playfully
                rearrange them, reinvent new constellations and move around grativational centers. </p>
               <p>But let us return now to Borges’s portrayal of Keats and the interpretation of his
                poetry. After this presentation of the background and biographical information of
                the English poet, Borges claims that Keats’s <title level="a">Ode To a Nightingale</title> has been
                essentially misunderstood by Anglophone intellectuals and critics. First he points
                at what, in his opinion, is the most remarkable aspect of the poem: Keats’s
                intuitive vision of the bird as a platonic archetype. He contrasts his platonic
                reading of the poem with that of other scholars he deems erroneous. In his essay,
                Borges quotes Sidney Colvin’s opinion as a first example misinterpretation:
                <quote>
                In his monographic work about Keats, published in 1887, Sideney Colvin …
                <emph>perceived or invented</emph> a difficulty in the aforementioned
                [seventh] stanza. I transcribe his curious declaration: “by a breach of logic which
                is also, I think, a flaw in the poetry, he contrasts the transitoriness of human
                life, meaning the life of the individual, with the permanence of the song-bird’s
                life, meaning the life of the type” (II: 95, emphasis added)
                </quote>
                With his characteristic irony, Borges labels Colvin’s observation as “voluntary”
                misperception. As he questions the validity of the division between the individual
                and the type set by the critic, he also undermines the opinion of other scholars who
                adhere to this premise: Robert Briges, F.R. Leavis, and H.W. Garrod (95). He is less
                severe with the opinion of Amy Lowell, for whom the nightingale of the poem should
                be interpreted only as the “species nightingale,”<note place="foot" resp="author">The
                    passage by Amy Lowell that Borges refers to
                            is the following: “Stanza seven has been the cause of much foolish
                            chatter. In calling the nightingale ‘immortal bird’ and contrasting its
                            eternity of life with individual man’s short existence, any one with a
                            spark of imaginative or poetical feeling realizes at once that Keats is
                            not referring to the particular Nightingale singing at that instant, but
                            to the species nightingale” (252).</note> and not as an individual presence. Borges goes on to drastically
                deny that there is any opposition whatsoever between the actual bird heard by Keats
                “on one April night of 1819” and the generic image.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is
                    interesting to note that Borges incorrectly dates the composition of the poem: he dates
                    it in April while Lowell clearly states, “we know the Nightingale to have been written
                    in May” (237).</note> To support his opinion, he turns to Schopenhauer’s theory of
                archetypes and quotes from <title level="m">The World as Will and
                    Representation</title>:
                <quote>
                Ask yourself honestly whether the swallow of this year’s spring is an entirely
                different one from the swallow of the first spring, and whether actually between the
                two the miracle of creation out of nothing has been renewed a million times, in
                order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation. (II: 482)
                </quote>
                This excerpt provides an endorsement to interpret the nightingale as an embodiment of
                a platonic form. From the perspective of the German philosopher, the bird heard by
                Keats repeats the same song as all other nightingales that ever existed. This
                reading was, to Borges, just too evident, and he is puzzled by fact that no English
                reader had been able to solve the question sooner: “How did Garrad, Leavis, and the
                like, not get to this interpretation?” (II: 95). In a provocative statement, he
                ascribes this blindness to what, in his opinion, is an essential trait of the
                British character:
                <quote>
                Men, says Coleridge, are born Aristotelian or Platonic. One could say that the
                English mind was born Aristotelian. What is real, for this type of mentality, are
                not the abstract concepts, but the individualities; not the generic nightingale, but
                the concrete nightingales. It is only natural, inevitable perhaps, that the <title level="m">Ode to
                a nightingale</title> was not rightfully understood in England. (II: 96)
                </quote>
                Borges adopts Coleridge’s philosophical binary categorization as a tool to emphasize
                his representation of Keats as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal compris</foreign>. Through this
                reductive division, he is able to disconnect the Romantic writer from the “British”
                mental sphere, and he offers a depiction of an unfortunate Platonist isolated among
                Aristotelians. The Argentine even offers an <foreign xml:lang="la">excusatio</foreign> that
                reinforces his ultimate goal of detaching Keats from the intellectual habitat of his
                country: “No one should read in the previously stated ideas a sign of disaproval or
                disdain … [The Englishman] does not understand the <title level="m">Ode to a
                    Nightingale,</title> but that valuable misunderstanding allows him to become a
                Locke, a Berkeley, a Hume” (97). This elegant attack, disguised as an <emph>encomium</emph>,
                is intended to build up the accusation that will
                open a necessary space for his own intervention. Reading and speaking from the
                outside of British tradition, Borges feels entitled to offer a corrective judgement
                of one of the main English poets and with utmost irreverence he defies the
                hierarchical organisation that relegates him to a place of subordination. He turns
                the tables around and locates himself in a position of intellectual superiority that
                symbolically refutes any colonial dependency or belatedness with regards to Europe.
                South-American intellectuals, he seems to assert, are sufficiently prepared to beat
                Europeans at their own games. </p>
               <p> In the essay previously analysed, Borges relies on the legend of “poor Keats” to
                depict a frail and contemplative young boy touched by poetic illumination. Other
                biographers and intellectuals, however, recognize that there is another side to his
                life that must be accounted for: that of the lively, energetic, and curiosity-driven
                young man. Nicholas Roe, for instance, highlights the fact that if, on the one hand,
                we have a “‘a sickly boy of pretty abilities’ who had missed his path in the world,”
                it is also necessary to see in him the “sturdy twenty-two-year-old, who strode six
                hundred miles around Scotland” (xv). Julio Cortázar is very keen to perceive this
                other facet of Keats, and it is in this light that he will compose his literary
                biography. For Cortázar, the Romantic writer appears as a presence full of joy,
                creativity, and poetic intelligence. His depiction is much closer to the impression
                that Roe gives, where the poet is described as “vigorous, colorful and animated”
                (xv), “a smart, streetwise creature—restless, pugnacious” (xvi). As we will now see,
                in his second Argentine afterlife, Keats does not inhabit the library of a suburban
                house; he appears as an energetic walker and an adventurous explorer. </p>
               <p> If Borges identified the nightingale as Keats’s totemic animal, Cortázar opted for
                the chameleon. The main characteristic that Cortázar highlights is his sympathetic
                capacity, the ability to become one with the other, and the ability to establish
                links of identification outside of the realms of one’s own subjectivity. In an
                attempt to present the Romantic poet as a living presence beyond his short life and
                the borders of British circles, the literary biography
                <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> opens up as a
                complex artifact in which Cortázar is able to relive part of Keats’s existence, and
                Keats can experience the contemporary Buenos Aires of his interlocutor (Ana Martínez
                196). Thanks to a chamaleonic strategy of identification, Cortázar perceives his
                immediate reality through the eyes of the English poet to which he also lends his
                words. This sensibility of empathy and synchronicity resonates clearly with the
                “capacity of trascending the self, which Keats calls negative capability” (Linda Von
                Pfahl 453). The biographer becomes, then, a sort of “chameleon Poet” who—borrowing a
                passage from the famous letter to Woodhouse—“is perhaps not speaking from [himself];
                but from some character in whose soul [he] now live[s]” (Keats 501). Cortázar
                engages in a process of identification with this “other” and, by doing so, develops
                the capacity of adopting “metamorphic identities, which furnish him with constant
                symapthetic identifications” (Li Ou 6). This aspect of the Keatsian negative
                capability is clearly recognizable throughout the biography, but I wish to highlight
                several passages when this phenomenon stands out more vividly. </p>
               <p>First, Cortázar draws a parallel between Keats’s journey to Scotland and his own
                excursion to Chile:
                <quote>
                I do not know why the trip to the north that John Keats is about to undertake in 1818
                brings me back to my own hiking trip in Chile. It is maybe because the two
                expeditions were mainly by foot and through landscapes surrounded by mountains and
                lakes… Upon my return from that trip I understood better Keats’s tour around
                Scotland and the region of the lakes. Without any touristic sentimentalization of
                it, I understood his state of mind: alert and vigilant before a reality that only
                partially captures his attention. (178–79)
                </quote>
                By recreating a journey that is comparable to Keats’s hiking tour through Scotland,
                Cortázar retrospectively remembers his own his trek in the Chilean mountains as a
                process of “becoming” John. A phenomenon of reflection allows Cortázar to see his
                life through the lens of Keats’s biography. What this excerpt shows is that the
                Argentinian, following the practice of emptying out the self, uses this strategy of
                sympathetic identification as an epistemological tool. </p>
               <p> A second example of chameleonism resonates even more clearly with the Keatsian
                practice of openness and receptivity. As Cortázar recounts his first trip to Italy
                and recounts the feeling of awe that he experiences before the marvel of Greek
                sculptures, he borrows the words and the empathetic capacities of Keats himself to
                narrate this overwhelming experience:
                <quote>
                I remember that a year ago I went to the museum in Naples, one morning of powdery
                light rain. That was my first reencounter with Greece. Annihilated, haunted, I was
                not thinking, I was not understanding, I was not comparing. Later I had something
                like a revelation, in which during those hours, I had been <emph>nobody</emph>,
                    replaced by—how should I say this?—the statues that looked at
                themselves, that recognized themselves. It was as if they were chasing me away,
                throwing me out, but not “outside of my own being,” because the one being ousted was
                precisely my “self,” to the point where there was nothing outside of the marble
                recognizing one another, looking at each other, and enjoying themselves.
                (265–66)
                </quote>
                This description of the museum shows a striking similarity with Keats’s own ideas and
                words, to the point where it could almost be read as a personal rewriting of the
                famous October 1818 letter:
                <quote>
                As to the poetical Character itself… it is not itself—it has no self—It is everything
                and nothing—It has no character— … the poet has none; no identity … When I am in a
                room with People, if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain,
                then, not myself goes home to myself, but the identity of every one in the room
                begins to press upon me, so that I am in a very little time annihilated. (Keats
                500–501)
                </quote>
                Not only does Cortázar copy words, concepts, and even phrasings from this passage,
                but he also adopts the same philosophy of poetic anihilation. In a two-folded
                mimetic exercise, the Argentine embodies simultaneously Keats—on a textual level—and
                the statues he is contemplating—on his circumstantial plane.</p>
               <p> Keats’s “negative capability” also has an influence in Cortázar’s world view that
                goes beyond the biographic identification pointed out earlier. For the Argentinian
                writer, this empathetic ability also gains aesthetic, political, and ethical
                resonances. Ana del Castillo and Ana Martínez Santa recognize the fundamental
                importance that “negative capability” had in the development of Cortázar’s poetics
                and trace the presence of the “sympathetic imagination” in his novels and shorts
                stories. Both scholars follow trails of the symbolic presence of the chameleon all
                the way to the 1967 book <title level="m">La vuelta al día en ochenta mundos</title>,
                in which Cortázar includes a short piece entitled <title level="a">Casilla del camaleón</title>
                (<title level="a">Chameleon’s square</title>). Here, Keats’s poetic theory is subjected to an unexpected
                political reading. In a heterodox interpretation of the chameleon theory, the author
                understands Keats’s sympathetic identification as a humanist force with a political
                implication: the unfailing recognition of other as equal. He frames this
                interpretation in what he calls a “Latin American time” and defends the importance
                of a poet like Keats in times when artists and intellectuals are judged based on
                their historical engagement (<title level="m">La vuelta</title> 189). Cortázar does
                not hide his leftist affiliations and makes a strong defense of them, but also
                stands up for the validity and necessity of literary figures who do not restrict
                their works to ideological objectives. His vindication of Keats is thus very
                significant within the Latin American context. In the first place, it rehabilitates
                an aesthetic and sensitive approach to literature in a period when this option was
                considered out of fashion and socially irresponsible. Secondly, it provides the
                English poet with a letter of recommendation that grants him an entrance to Latin
                American circles where he would not have been admited otherwise. </p>
               <p> Julio Cortázar also perceived Keats as a “peripheral” figure and highlighted this
                condition with the purpose of relating to him as an equal. Through an act of
                creative misreading, the Argentine biographer dislodges Keats outside of the
                boundaries of his own time and relates to him as a contemporary. In
                <title level="m">Imagen</title>, Cortázar creates the illusion that they both coexist
                in the margins of chronological time and meet in a dimension where temporal and
                geographic distances have been collapsed<note place="foot" resp="author">Olivia Loksing
                    Moy’s article <title level="a">From Hampstead to Buenos Aires and Beyond: Anticipating Worlds in Julio Cortázar’s
                    <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>
                     </title> offers an excellent analysis of the collapsing of temporal
                    references in Cortázar’s texts. Moy cleverly explores the sense of “transtemporality” in
                    <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> through the perspective of Way Chee Dimock’s
                        concept of “deep time,” and offers an interesting take on Cortázar’s position in the
                        map of World Literature.</note>.
                As temporal linearity is challenged in the pages of this biography, the sense of
                belatedness is also contested by Cortázar. From the opening pages of the
                introduction, it is made evident that the Argentinian does not look up to the
                British poet from a subsidiary position but speaks to him as an equal and challenges
                any assumptions of hierarchical subordination. The structure of their interaction
                does not reproduce a colonial pattern of defferent imitation and submission but,
                rather, maps a horizontal line of exchange. In the chapter labeled <title level="a">Methodology,</title>
                Cortázar states:
                <quote>
                [I am going to write with] Keats on my arm; a more natural way to get to know him,
                rather than the usual manner, where the poor guy is put up on a cloud as the
                literary critics throw together a couple of chairs and tables to build a stage that
                he didn’t even need in the first place… And all this forms a part of this Keats,
                because I’m not going to write about him, I’m going to walk by his side. (19)
                </quote>
                Rejecting the academic perspective in favor of a more familiar approach, Cortázar
                questions chronological lines, geographic divisions, and epistemological categories.
                Not only does he pretend to inhabit the same time and place as his peer, he also
                offers an alternative—and very Keatsian—way of access to literary knowledge: an
                empathetic identification. This is accurately observed by Steven Boldy:
                <quote>
                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is a competent
                academic study… but it is also the day-to-day chronicle of an intimate friendship,
                and of the connections he builds with a poet “friend,” a model he admires. It is, at
                the same time, the chronicle of this relation and that of the writing of the book:
                Cortázar walks arm in arm with Keats in the streets of Buenos Aires and Hampstead.
                The phenomenon of identification is powerful… (18)
                </quote>
                In the reconstruction of Keats’s literary biography Cortázar appears as an
                unapologetic and daring misreader. His goal is not that of rendering a faithful and
                elegiac homage to an English master. On the contrary, he strives to recognize Keats
                as a quotidian and tangible presence:
                <quote>
                … in the past weeks John’s physical presence has haunted me more and more as I read
                his letters… All of a sudden he is so close by my side that it frightens me ... I
                see him, he is here; time yields to this tangential contact that drops me in 1819,
                in this suburb of time… in the heaths of Hampstead. (<title level="m">Imagen</title>
                214)
                </quote>
                The text evidences a chronological multidirectionality that drops Cortázar into the
                Hampstead of 1819 and brings Keats to the Buenos Aires of 1950. This is, for Boldy,
                one of the most interesting aspects of the book: “the way by which the Romantic
                English poet becomes a contemporary of … Julio Cortázar. The latter, as a scholar,
                shows a profound knowledge of Keats and his epoch, as well as of his fellow Romantic
                writers … but he also affirms that it is necessary to read Keats as a contemporary
                voice” (19). Bondy recognizes the originality of the particular temporal
                displacement performed by Cortázar: he does not only transplant himself to the past
                as a meticulous historian, but also allows this poet from the nineteenth century to
                live, act, and speak in the present time, where he recognizes him as an active
                formative presence:
                <quote>
                … I cannot <emph>feel</emph> Keats in the past. I
                don’t run into Keats on the street, nor do I expect to hear his voice over the
                phone
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">(and how beautiful it would have been to hear his voice, seeing him coming, short as
                he was, a little commoner, treating himself to a laugh)</p>
                     <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">but sometimes, I’m wandering around and I do run into poets of my own time and John
                is one of them. (<title level="m">Imagen</title> 52–53)</p>
                  </quote>
                Cortázar recognizes the limitations of the knowledge he can achieve through
                intellectual explorations. As a historian and a biographer, he can only draw a
                partial understanding of the person that was Keats, of his intuitions of beauty, his
                capacity for irradiating poetry. For he is unable to “feel” Keats in this dimension,
                he seeks to recognize in his environment the elements and people that evoke his
                presence. Reversing the direction of Keats’s sympathetic capacity, Cortázar searches
                for those of whom, in this time, awaken the memory and the presence of Keats. </p>
               <p> The dialectic movement in time that structures <title level="m">Imagen de John
                    Keats</title> attests to a search for an alternative idea of contemporaneousness.
                Instead of relying on temporal coincidence, the Argentinian proposes an idea that is
                very close to T.S. Eliot’s notion of tradition as a simultaneous order of
                existence:
                <quote>
                    Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot
                    be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labor. It involves,
                    in the first place, the historical sense … and the historical sense involves a
                    perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the
                    historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in
                    his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from
                    Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a
                    simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order. (38)
                </quote>
                For Eliot, past and present coexist in this imaginary dimension, and Virgil is
                virtually as close to Baudelaire as he is to Ezra Pound—his <title level="m">Four
                    Quartets</title> and <title level="m">The Waste Land</title> are a faithful testimony
                and an illustration of this principle. The same functional reorganization of history
                can be recognized in <title level="m">Imagen</title>, where the categories of temporal
                and geographic distance have been suspended. If the nineteenth-century poet can be
                seen as a contemporary it is because, to the eyes of Cortázar, both inhabit a
                dimension where the notion of proximity is determined by aesthetic, philosophical,
                and artistic affinities. This flexible notion of time and tradition allows him to
                knit an elaborate network of synchronicity that brings together otherwise distant
                authors. <title level="m">Imagen</title> includes a constellation
                of other poets that the Argentine biographer also declares as citizens of Keats’s
                time: Rimbaud, Rilke, Valéry, Saint-John Perse, Neruda, and García Lorca, among
                others. In the chapter <title level="a">Being in the World,</title> Cortázar identifies, for instance, two
                of the most remarkable Spanish readers of Keats: Vicente Aleixandre (1898–1984) and
                Luis Cernuda (1902–1963). Despite the historical, cultural, and temporal gaps that
                divide them, Cortázar recognizes in them a fundamental “coincidence of attitudes and
                lyric production” that allow him to conceive them as “kindred Spanish-speaking
                poets; close to him, similar to him,” to his dear Keats (253).</p>
               <p> The two Keatsian afterlives that I have presented in the previous pages continue to
                be the most remarkable and significant readings of this Romantic poet in Latin
                America. As I have shown, Cortázar and Borges, writing from outside of the English
                tradition, claim the right to reappropriate Keats’s works and to integrate him as
                part of their most intimate and immediate cultural landscape. Both of them compose
                personal portraits and adapt the image of the nightingale and the chameleon to their
                own cultural landscape. By doing so, they readjust the divisions between center and
                periphery, challenging national, cultural, linguistic and academic boundaries. Their
                gestures of “irreverence” towards the canon and the centrality of the English
                tradition are far more significant than a playful demystification. What Cortázar and
                Borges achieve by bringing the dialogue to a familiar level is opening alternative
                symbolic spaces of interaction between Latin America and Europe. </p>
               <p> The sense of arriving belatedly to the “banquet of civilization”—as Alfonso Reyes
                states it (5)—was particularly acute in Latin America throughout the nineteenth
                century. In the early twentieth century, the movement of “modernismo” was the first
                to claim the right to a cosmopolitan culture and to dialogue with traditions beyond
                the peninsular Spanish heritage. From this moment on, the debate about the place of
                Latin America on the map of Western and world culture was remarkably animated.
                Cortázar and Borges are two examples of cosmopolitan intellectuals who defend the
                right of Latin American writers, artists and intellectuals to be recognized as part
                of that “universal” tradition to which, writing from a peripheral space, they did
                not have full access. Echoing Borges, Cortázar makes a strong defense of the idea
                that Latin America has as much right to profit from European traditions as any other
                intellectual from England, France, the United States, or any other country. Their
                literary dialogues with Keats are an example of the attitude towards culture that
                Borges described in his famous essay, <title level="a">The Argentine Writer and The Tradition</title>:
                <quote>
                I believe our tradition is all of Western culture, and I also believe we have a right
                to this tradition, greater than that which the inhabitants of one or another Western
                nation might have ... I believe that we Argentines, we South Americans in general,
                are in an analogous situation; we can handle all European themes, handle them
                without superstition, with an irreverence which can have, and already does have,
                fortunate consequences. (I: 274)
                </quote>
                The self-assumed peripheral condition of Borges and Cortázar, as I have argued,
                becomes a condition of productivity. The strategy of writing and reading
                from the margins, allows them to engage differently with the canon of European
                literary tradition. Instead of perpetuating a logic of submission and imitation,
                they actively engage in a renegotiation of their place in the broader western and
                universal tradition.</p>

                        <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, Julio Cortázar’s literary
                    biography from the 1950s. An amphibious text that oscillates between a rigorous
                    work of criticism and a playful work of fiction, it follows two lines of
                    national influence: the Latin American surrealist short story and Romantic
                    poetry. Moreover, in staging a sense of timeless contemporaneity by
                    strategically merging literary-historical events, the book brings together
                    Keats, Shelley, and Hunt with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine friends and
                    intellectuals. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for Cortázar to
                    personally inhabit a Romantic universality, rendering Keats accessible to the
                    Latin American “everyman.”</p>

                  <p>In the 1950s, the Argentinian author Julio Cortázar (1914–1984) composed an
                        ambitious work—a “life and letters” of his favorite Romantic poet. The
                        result was <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, a six-hundred-page
                        collage of Keats’s poems and letters, Cortázar’s own prose, and a myriad of
                        references to Latin American, Spanish, German, French, and British authors.
                        This little-known masterpiece covers the entirety of Keats’s adult life and
                        works, beginning with <title level="m">Sleep and Poetry</title> and ending
                        with his lesser-known dramas and posthumous works. Inspired by Cortázar’s
                        Spanish translation of Richard Monckton Milnes’s <title level="m">The Life
                            and Letters of John Keats</title>, published in Madrid in 1955, it far
                        exceeds Lord Houghton’s efforts in its geographical and generic scope. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> opens with a gust of brightness
                        and momentum, its initial sentence announcing participation in the Romantic
                        tradition by calling upon Nature, Imagination, and an Aeolian breeze: “This
                        is a Romantic book, driven by its impulse towards its theme with the focus
                        and faithfulness of a sunflower” (15). Playful and ambulatory, Cortázar’s
                        text meanders in and out of the modes of biography, literary criticism,
                        personal essay, and artistic memoir. It functions as a Keats anthology
                        tailored for the Latin American reader, as well as a collection of
                        Cortázar’s annotated translations and original poems. The methodological
                        declarations, personal effusions, and literary references culminate in what
                        Victor Zonana terms a “generic hybrid” and the work of a “poet-critic” who,
                        rather than composing an erudite and academic study, traces the process of a
                        poetry “in the making” (57). But while it oscillates between various genres,
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title> is presented as one organic structure,
                        its formidable <title level="a">Table of Contents</title> offering a roadmap
                        for the thirteen chapters and eighty-five subsections that follow. </p>
                  <p>Published posthumously by Alfaguara in 1996, <title level="m">Imagen</title>
                        has garnered scant attention from Keats scholars and appears but briefly

                        text so inaccessible to both Anglophone and Hispanophone readers. Especially
                        given Cortázar’s recognition as a global author of the Latin American Boom
                        movement, that <title level="m">Imagen</title> has eluded critical attention
                        cannot solely be attributed to the fact that the work has not yet been fully
                        translated into English.<note place="foot" resp="author">Cortázar received

                        In addition to any language barrier, Cortázar’s text presents a difficult
                        challenge to Latin Americanists and Romanticists alike, due to its
                        ahistorical approach and its hybrid style. This essay introduces Cortázar’s
                            <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> to unfamiliar readers by
                        elucidating its genre and methodology. Attending to important parallels
                        between Cortázar’s and Keats’s literary circles, I then situate the work
                        within Cortázar’s own statements on the transcultural transmission of
                        English Romantic works to a Latin American audience. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is unique among Latin American
                        afterlives of the English Romantic poets in two significant ways. First, it
                        is a truly transtemporal work, jumping timelines and collapsing eras within
                        one literary plane. Cortázar creates a dynamic field that accommodates a
                        motley crew of ancient Greek, Renaissance, Romantic, and modern Hispanophone
                        figures. This differs from typical neoromantic interactions of
                        twentieth-century writers who might simply import and repurpose familiar
                        motifs of Wordsworth or Shelley in a postmodern context. Instead, throughout
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title>, Cortázar inhabits the same time and
                        locales as Keats. What we witness is a contemporaneous overlapping of two
                        literary circles: Cortázar and his fellow writers of the Boom era are
                        superimposed upon the world of Hunt, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Blake. These
                        figures intermingle in pages redolent of Cortázar’s signature style,
                        featuring the crossing of paths of a seemingly listless flaneur. While
                            <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is one of Cortázar’s
                        non-fiction works, its cast of characters occupies a fiction-like space
                        projected onto an epic scale. In this essay, I draw upon the imagery of
                        playing hopscotch and “blowing up” (expanding) an image—borrowed from
                        two of Cortázar’s most famous works, <title level="m">Hopscotch</title>
                        (1963) and <title level="a">Blow-up</title> (1967)—to explore the
                        experimentation he employs throughout his innovative treatise on Keats.<note place="foot" resp="author">Cortázar’s major novel <title level="m">Hopscotch</title> (<title level="m">Rayuela</title>) is often
                            regarded as a text marking the beginning of the Latin American Boom,
                            while his short story <title level="a">Blow-up</title> (<title level="a">Las babas del diablo</title>) was immortalized in film by
                            Michelangelo Antonioni in 1966.</note> In so doing, I seek to restore
                        the lost reception of <title level="m">Imagen</title> by untangling the two
                        factors most problematic to the text’s transmission: periodization and
                        genre.</p>
                  <p>In the opening section of <title level="m">Imagen</title>, titled <title level="a">Preludes,</title> Cortázar announces the scope of his project
                        in teasingly lofty and legal language, calling his opening a “Sworn
                        Statement.” At other points, as in the chapter <title level="a">Sleep and
                            Poetry,</title> he shifts into a confiding voice, assuming the mode of
                        personal essay or of casual biography. His reportage of Keats’s life in the
                        section titled <title level="a">Romanticism</title> feels at times flippant
                        and comical: <quote>

                     </quote> As we see in this passage, Cortázar regards Keats with a sense of
                        camaraderie that borders upon self-identification. He speaks authoritatively
                        and on behalf of Keats, as if present throughout the poet’s early years. The
                        reference to Adrogué, a small town in the suburbs of Buenos Aires with
                        cobble-stoned streets and town squares, familiarizes the foreignness of
                        Hampstead through analogy and geographic translation. Rather than glossing
                        an Argentinian reference for the benefit of an English audience, Cortázar
                        naturally reverses the Anglocentric orientation, catering to his ideal Latin
                        American reader. Ultimately, it is Cortázar who invites Keats for an
                        exploratory stroll, not the other way around. His physical metaphor for
                        companionship, of walking side by side, serves as a leitmotif throughout the
                        text, proposing a relation of friendship and equality rather than one of
                        idolatry or infatuation. This becomes an enduring theme in the structure,
                        spirit, and timescale that is central to Cortázar’s treatise on Keats.</p>
                  <p>Taking after Samuel Johnson’s <title level="m">Lives of the Poets</title> in

                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> incorporates personal
                        anecdotes with stylistic critique, whether offering its cultural commentary
                        on nineteenth-century England or twentieth-century Buenos Aires. The work
                        exhibits a comfortable mastery over figures in British literature,
                        offhandedly alluding to lines of Spenser, Herbert, Wordsworth, and Coleridge
                        as if they were close friends. Cortázar’s invocation of these authors is
                        casual but not disrespectful; he gestures toward these canonical figures
                        with disarming hospitality and a gracious informality. In an intriguing
                        balance between admiration and sauciness, Cortázar conjures up a living
                        community populated by Shelley, Byron, “John,” “Bob Burns,” George and Tom,
                        and even “Mom and Dad”: <quote>

                                1795—the year and the season in which Wordsworth and Coleridge
                                met, with illustrious consequences. It was the year of the
                                guillotine in the front shores of France…[Then] another star:
                                William Blake, a <emph>nova</emph> of nineteen years-old, another

                                a confusing childhood, closely tied to his two brothers, George and
                                Tom, (both of them younger than him), and also to Fanny, the
                                flip-flop of the household, who very early in his life bestowed upon

                     </quote> Here, Cortázar is at ease, mapping out the baby steps and first
                        literary strides of William Blake and Robert Burns. He converts the
                        publication timelines of Romantic literary geniuses into anecdote and
                        caricature, pure baby stuff: “What a nursery!” He inserts himself into the
                        scene of “John’s” infancy, bearing witness by inviting himself into the
                        Keats family household and into the childhood playpens of the Big Six as
                        well. Freely working on a first-name basis, he flits in and out as a welcome
                        member of the clan with carefree familiarity. This quick movement from a
                        grand historical scale to such individual intimacy characterizes much of the
                        lengthy book and lends a dynamic rhythm to the long stretches of prose.
                        Cortázar often zooms in at a rapid pace, “blowing up” meaningful moments to
                        notice the possibility of unrealized, fantastic detail behind the mundane.
                        This zooming in and out is an important device that breathes magic into the
                        ending of Cortázar’s surrealist short story <title level="m">Blow-Up,</title> in which the expanded print of a camera snapshot,
                        scrutinized in the photographer’s studio after the moment of capture,
                        reveals a chain of unforeseen possibilities and traumas. It allows the past
                        to become present, locked in a dynamic stasis and primed for revelation and
                        analysis. Such is the process of “blowing up” and developing the “image” of
                        John Keats, opening up possibilities for alternative representations of the
                        poet we thought we knew. </p>
                  <p>Blowing up images allows for a mode of discovery that curates moments and
                        transcends chronological time. In his literary practice of merging times and
                        epochs, Cortázar intimately enters the Romantic past and brings the coterie
                        of the Keats-Shelley circle to life, communing with Byron, Coleridge,
                        Shelley, Haydon, and Hunt; but he also shows how these spirits have come to
                        life in his own day. He recognizes them in the works of contemporary
                        Latin-American poets and translators, such as Ricardo Molinari, Francisco
                        Luis Bernárdez and Miguel Cané (22). In many passages, Cortázar keeps the
                        text humming with experimental punctuation and an irregular distribution of
                        paragraphs that is particularly vivacious and poetic. <quote> I’m thinking

                        (Devoto), and Classics professors (Mascialino). These are the Argentine
                        writers who sustained the bustling afterlife of Keats in 1950s Buenos Aires,
                        bonded through a common physical token of recognition: walking together,
                        carrying an “essential” edition of Keats in their pocket: “Y cuánto muchacho

                        series, this notion of a “pocket Keats” establishes the poet’s universality,
                        accessibility, and portability. Through it, Keats is available to the Latin
                        American everyman or <foreign xml:lang="sp">fulano de tal</foreign>. It
                        claims Keats as a working-class poet for young men living out in the world,
                        walking and reading outdoors in town squares. He is not a bust to be
                        worshipped upon the bookshelves of musty offices and libraries, alongside
                        Coleridge and Eliot. Keats’s poems are a practical necessity and an item to
                        be used daily, palpably, by this troupe of Latin American writers. Cané,
                        Arrieta, and Devoto exist within the same chapters and street corners as
                        “John,” in Paris, Buenos Aires, Teignmouth, and Hampstead. It is this
                        Romantic element of timeless universality and ubiquity that appeals to
                        Cortázar, more so than the fractured images offered by the Modernists; it
                        lends him a space of contemporaneity and freedom. More importantly, it
                        offers him the ability to create a unified, unbroken image, <foreign xml:lang="sp">una imagen de John Keats</foreign> that is singular and
                        not plural.</p>
                  <p> What happens in the final lines of the passage above is jarring: in almost
                        cinematic fashion, Cortázar draws parallels between the everyman’s daily
                        ambles and a moment of high Romantic tragedy. Through this transition, he
                        pans out from the pockets of the young Argentine men in 1950s to the pocket
                        of a young Percy Shelley—drowned and washed up ashore in the Gulf of
                        Spezia on July 8, 1822. The zooming out of the camera lens is a strategic
                        narrative movement that affords a dramatic sense of identification between
                        distant parties. This potential for immediate transport—physically,
                        temporally, and historically—is seminal to Cortázar’s early writing
                        and becomes absolutely definitive of his later works.</p>
                  <p>Critics such as Ana Martínez Santa have read <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> as a compositional training ground for Cortázar, who after
                        the 1960s would emerge onto the world literary scene in full force (195). As
                        we can see, Cortázar does not simply borrow themes from Keats and transplant
                        them within a Latin American setting. Instead, <title level="m">Imagen</title> enacts a unique experiment in flattening timescales,
                        providing in each chapter a series of permeable wormholes through which the
                        reader and author can embark on literary time travel, spanning from 1816 to
                        1959. This does not follow the model of a two-dimensional timeline but
                        rather inhabits a three-dimensional field, an all-encompassing space that
                        plays host to otherwise impossible interactions.<note place="foot" resp="author">For more on the transtemporal and transnational features

                        fundamental to Cortázar, whose experimentations with novelistic structure
                        became his principle claim to fame. Considered by Alfred McAdam as the novel
                        that marked the beginning of the Latin American Boom movement, <title level="m">Hopscotch</title> (originally <title level="m">Rayuela</title>) presents readers with an innovative set of instructions in
                        the <title level="a">Table of Contents</title> from which to choose
                        different reading paths, to read sequentially or skip around in an erratic
                        sequence (Donald Shaw, <title level="a">Which Was the First Novel of the
                            Boom?</title> 360). The suggested trajectory for readers begins, for
                        instance, not at Chapter 1, but Chapters “73-1-2-116-3-84-4-71...” (<title level="m">Hopscotch</title> v). Much more than simply summon the reader
                        to jump from section to section and experience the fluctuation of page
                        numbers along a linear scale, Cortázar invites the reader to become immersed
                        in jarringly different environments, transporting suddenly from a
                        conversation with the enchanting Gekrepten in the Almagro neighborhood of
                        Buenos Aires to a walk along the Quai de Conti in Paris with a different
                        woman, La Maga. We can thus see how the seed of timelessness in <title level="m">Imagen</title>, which would later explode in <title level="m">Hopscotch</title>, also mirrored the transcontinental, back-and-forth
                        movements between “el lado de acá” and “el lado de allá.” This penchant for
                        dynamic movement, for a truly bodily experience of transport, fuels the
                        “contemporaneous” intimacy that makes for the indissoluble personal bond,
                        physically choreographed, between Cortázar and Keats.</p>

                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is a project predicated upon
                        forging a strong individual connection between Cortázar and Keats, but it
                        also traces lines of affinity and overlap between their literary circles.
                        The attentive reader will easily notice parallels between the Leigh Hunt
                        circle and the Latin American Boom writers of the 1960s and 1970s. Both
                        consisted of young men spurred to publication in response to the political
                        turmoil and threat of censorship during their time, the former provoked by
                        the Peterloo Massacre, and the latter by the violence of repressive
                        authoritarian governments and dictatorships in Latin America. The rise of
                        military regimes in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru in the
                        second half of the twentieth century ultimately brought together many
                        Hispanic authors across Spain and Latin America. Their political fervor and
                        leftist ideological lineage earned the Boom authors an international
                        audience of young readers who opposed the climate of censorship and the
                        threats to human rights, themes featured in many of the Latin American
                        novels produced during those years.</p>
                  <p>Cortázar left his university post at the National University of Cuyo in 1946
                        as a result of his opposition to the regime of General Juan Perón. In many
                        ways, the period of censorship and intellectual repression preceding the
                        Dirty War in Argentina became for Cortázar what Peterloo was for Keats.
                        Nicholas Roe’s <title level="m">Keats and the Culture of Dissent</title> and
                        Jeffrey Cox’s <title level="m">Poetry and Politics in the Cockney
                            School</title> have showcased how the liberal convictions of Leigh Hunt
                        and the Cockney School shaped Keats in a stronger vein than has been
                        previously recognized. Much like Keats, Cortázar was sympathetic to the
                        political urgencies shared by other Boom writers. He protested the impending
                        presidency of Perón, leaving his teaching position and his country shortly
                        after. He would travel to Cuba numerous times, first in 1963, but his
                        enthusiasm for the revolution quickly dissolved when the poet Heberto
                        Padilla was arrested and jailed by the Castro regime in 1971. Relying on his
                        own voice, Cortázar eventually withdrew from the Cuban cause, just as Keats
                        had eventually distanced himself from the Hunt circle, though he would
                        always remain strongly supportive of the political left throughout his life.
                        Still, it is important not to impose exact parallels upon the political
                        situations of both authors, nor to assume that a Latin American author would
                        automatically cleave to Romantic literature for its revolutionary echoes.
                        This is simply not the case, and despite resonances between the Latin
                        American Boom writers and the Keats-Hunt circle, <title level="m">Imagen de
                            John Keats</title> is not a politically motivated work.<note place="foot" resp="author">The only overtly political statements where

                            of Romantic sympathetic identification. </note> Instead, Cortázar
                        creates a flattened world that celebrates individual connections over any
                        group agenda, honoring individual talent over aesthetic or political
                        movements. </p>

                  <p>Scholars of the Latin American Boom typically trace any European influence to
                        the French and British modernists, including Proust, Joyce, and the
                        surrealists; or by way of Latin American <foreign xml:lang="sp">modernismo</foreign> authors at the fin de siècle, such as Rubén Darío,
                        José Martí, and José Asunción Silva, who followed the French Parnassians and
                        Symbolists. For a young Cortázar to align himself with John Keats rather
                        than a figure like James Joyce was thus a marked departure from others
                        within his literary circle, which was dominated at the time by French
                        intellectualism. As Peter Standish attests, Cortázar “was in many respects a
                        romantic, the prime source of his romanticism being English poetry of the
                        nineteenth century” (14–15). Borges, who was also a great reader of English
                        literature, delivered a series of lectures that included twenty-five classes
                        from <title level="m">Beowulf</title> to <title level="m">The Picture of
                            Dorian Gray</title>, with four classes devoted to Wordsworth, Coleridge,
                        and Blake (<title level="a">Professor Borges: A Course on English
                            Literature</title>). Cortázar avoids such strict chronological
                        self-positioning: Rather than performing a historical survey, covering the
                        breadth of the English canon, he plunged deeply into the works of a few
                        Anglophone authors he admired, including Defoe, Poe, and Keats.</p>

                        line of transmission from English Romanticism to Latin American writing
                        evades the direct lines of conquest typical of transatlantic movements, such
                        as that from Britain to colonial America and the West Indies, or from Spain
                        to Latin America.<note place="foot" resp="author">See special issues of

                        authors are not necessarily writing “against” an imperialistic tradition
                        (c.f. Ramirez, <title level="a">Keatsians in Argentina</title>). At the same
                        time, the English-Spanish language difference both presents an obstacle and
                        spares them from the anxieties surrounding a colonizing language. For
                        Cortázar, despite recognizing British literature as a central cultural
                        force, his position on the periphery of this somewhat distant tradition is
                        neither one of adulation nor of marginalization. So, what jagged line of
                        influence can be traced through the lens of this cosmopolitan reader? Again,
                        Cortázar’s model of ambulation or meandering comes to play, emulating
                        Montaigne’s impetus to <foreign xml:lang="fr">essayer</foreign>, try out new
                        paths, or <foreign xml:lang="sp">dar un paseo</foreign>. In 1980, he

                            It has been asserted many times that Latin American literature in
                            general enters modernity without all the baggage—and the
                            confidence that comes with it—of a slow past and a slow evolution,
                            as European literature has. We went from the Spanish Conquest to
                            colonization and then independence in a stretch of time that, compared
                            with the development of the great literary cultures of the West, is
                            tiny, a mere instant. This means that when Latin American writers began
                            to write, and write autonomously in each of our countries, they might
                            have unconsciously felt the absence of a slow evolution of which they
                            were the last link in a long chain. Suddenly they found themselves
                            confronting a modern culture, and a language that could be used in all

                     </quote> Here, in Cortázar’s assessment, Latin American authors enjoy the
                        possibility of writing autonomously. The evolution of their literature is
                        not a slow buildup across generations but a sudden moment in time, a “mere
                        instant.” Its potential is thus explosive and optimistic rather than
                        burdened by any “baggage” of periodization. Indeed, the “tiny,” “mere
                        instant” of Latin American inspiration is not so much diminutive as it is
                        liberating through its ahistoricity. It is important to recognize here that
                        Cortázar’s trilingualism and worldliness afforded him the access and
                        confidence to foray the European scene. Born in Brussels in 1914, he settled
                        in Paris in the 1950s, traveling also to Cuba, America, Spain, and
                            Egypt.<note place="foot" resp="author">Many Boom authors were travelers
                            and exiles, lending the political and social action they advocated
                            greater urgency for their readers across the world. Mariano Siskind’s
                                <title level="m">Cosmopolitan Desires</title> discusses Latin
                            American writing as world literature, recognizing the creation of Latin
                            American literary modernity as a global phenomenon that led to the
                            worldwide popularity of magical realism.</note> Not simply an
                        Argentinian author but a true cosmopolitan figure, Cortázar shrugs off the
                        typical postcolonial shackles of the Latin American author writing in
                        Spanish or embracing canonical works of Old Europe. His notion of the rise
                        of Latin American literature as transpiring after the height of Western
                        civilization is a narrative marked by indifference to the imperial burden,
                        in fact a soaring alternative to it.</p>
                  <p>Fitting this conviction that Latin American writers could burst onto the
                        scene without feeling like “the last link in a long chain,” <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is a striking example of writing in the
                        present, particularly from a formal perspective. This is a remarkable
                        strategy for such a lengthy book that is able to maintain a reader’s
                        interest without following the dramatic plotline of a novel or epic.
                        Generically speaking, <title level="m">Imagen</title> is not a collection of
                        short stories, the form later favored by Cortázar and Borges; nor does it do
                        the work of a history, mapping out a long-ranging trajectory with the poets
                        of antiquity on one end of the timeline and contemporary writers on the
                        other. Instead, the book is a series of moments always set in the present,

                  <p>Cortázar insistently refuses historicity, even as he enumerates Keats’s
                        literary forebears. This confidence in seizing the present and shrugging off
                        the past is professedly a tactic he learned from and shared with Keats. Just
                        as Cortázar does not owe his inspiration to Keats, Keats is not beholden to
                        his predecessors. Neither feels the weight of the English canon upon him.
                        Cortázar explains: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">This is how Keats always felt, and if it is literally
                                impossible to say that he cleared the slate of the past, we will see
                                that his adherence to this past is neither born out of a nostalgia
                                nor a sentiment of reverence in the Manriquean mode. On the
                                contrary, in his own poetic dimension, he lives so deeply in the
                                past that he does not feel the need to profess about it, and this
                                abolishes divisions of chronology. From 1814 to 1816, he was trapped
                                by the magic of Spenser’s <title level="m">The Faerie
                                Queene</title>. Later on, it is Shakespeare and Milton who enchant
                                him. But can we really speak about the past—in the sense that
                                Ortega understands it—when we are talking about Shakespeare
                                and Milton <emph>in</emph> England? When Keats feels the need to
                                escape Spenser’s charms—and that was truly a temporal
                                contemplation of a long-gone past—, John remains squarely
                                within the same temporal dimension of Milton and, above all, of
                                Shakespeare. They are not “models or norms”: they are the poetry at
                                the level that Keats is striving so willfully to reach. In regards
                                to Greece, where he finds all the imagery of <title level="m">Endymion</title>, all the pathos of <title level="m">Lamia</title>, and the instant purity of <title level="a">Ode
                                    on a Grecian Urn,</title> his talent is not that of a historian.
                                For John, his world of Hampstead and Greece are the very same
                                reality where nature and man coexist in an alternate plane of direct
                                contemplation and mythological symbology. He does not feel the
                                nostalgia of Greece; his overwhelming joy weaves the tapestry of
                                pagan images in his poetry. He does not see any reason to deplore
                                the passing of time. The <emph>eternal</emph> world is within reach
                                of his hand, and what his eyes see in an oak tree is the same thing

                            Keats</title>. They are also, I argue, what defines his major works,

                        celebrates Keats’s creative autonomy despite being informed by Milton,
                        Shakespeare, and Virgil. In this shared reality, Hampstead is Greece; Keats
                        sees the very same oak tree that Virgil saw. Any literary resemblances are
                        not a matter of historical eventuality but of taste and happenstance of the
                        present. In turn, Cortázar clears his own “slate of the past,” “abolishes
                        the divisions of chronology,” and can draw on Keats without “nostalgia nor a
                        sentiment of reverence.” This lends him, too, complete autonomy from any
                        anxiety of historical influence, within or across national traditions. Both
                        authors are free to shrug off any deferential indebtedness to their literary

                  <p>Following his Waterman ink pen, Cortázar’s writing method is a spontaneous
                        process based on personified inspiration, establishing <title level="m">Imagen</title> as a creative work unburdened by meticulous planning.
                        This complete improvisatory freedom—the possibility of ending up
                        anywhere, in any time signature or any key—is reminiscent of the twist
                        endings and perspectival changes that mark the endings to so many short
                        stories of the surrealist and Latin American Boom movements. In this sense,
                        the interaction of different genres at play adds great interest to <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>—a novel-length work, based
                        on British poetry, that invokes definitive narrative techniques of the Latin
                        American Boom short story style.</p>
                  <p>The question of genre is perhaps the greatest source of distance between
                        Keats the poet and Cortázar, the writer of short stories and fiction. It is
                        also the most challenging aspect of critically approaching a work like
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title>. The book is patently not a historical
                        novel that uses the Romantic poets as familiar characters. Instead, it is a
                        text brimming with facts and details, despite presenting this informational
                        content within a semi-fictional and poetic framework. How do we as readers
                        then approach Cortázar’s text, recognizing its labor of literary commentary
                        while attending to its formal elements of creative memoir? Might one read
                        the many chapters as a series of short stories? As compositional fragments?
                        Or as a manual for navigating Keats’s life and writings?<note place="foot" resp="author">The form of short manuals or guides also figures
                            prominently in Cortázar’s writings. The first section of Cortázar’s

                  <p>Cortázar provides us with the semblance of an answer when he broaches this
                        question of genre himself. Answering questions posed by students at the
                        University of California, Berkeley, he addresses why Latin America produced
                        so many short-story writers: “In Latin America, the short story is so
                        popular and is of such high quality that it can be considered among the best
                        to be imagined or written in the world….Short stories and short-story
                        writers appear in Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, and follow the aesthetic trends
                        that at the time were coming fundamentally from Europe. So, when Romanticism
                        arrives in Latin America, like a kind of enormous deluge, many stories and
                        many novels are written that have Romantic characteristics, but the subjects
                        are already Latin American…” (30–33).<note place="foot" resp="author">“Cortázar drew an interesting parallel between the novel as movie and
                            the short story as paragraph. A movie has an open order, a detailed and
                            rounded structure in which many frames or puzzle pieces eventually
                            deliver a finished story to the viewer, as in a novel. A photograph, on
                            the other hand, presupposes limitations. It is one immobile frame of a
                            single significant piece to a puzzle, a fragment of reality to which the
                            viewer must supply the remaining pieces, as in a short story. The short
                            story, therefore, is an ‘opening up’ of a reality that is much greater
                            than that of the actual tale: ‘that fabulous opening of the minute onto
                            the gigantic, of that which is individual and circumscribed onto the
                            very essence of the human condition.’” (Picon Garfield 13)</note>
                     <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> merges essentially poetic
                        elements of Romanticism with Latin American fictional forms, melding both
                        genres and national literatures. The structure of the text feels novelistic
                        and draws from elements of the surrealist short story, while its content is
                        poetic and biographical. </p>

                     </quote> In addition to emulating free verse through line breaks and
                        extended spacing between words, <title level="m">Imagen</title> also quotes
                        thousands of lines of poetry that interpolate the prose of the tome. These
                        include selected stanzas of Keats’s poems translated by Cortázar himself, as
                        well as lines of Baudelaire, Rimbaud (referred to as “Rimbe”), Mallarmé
                        (“Stéphane”), Shelley, and occasionally, a rare poem or two of Cortázar’s
                        own, inspired by Keats. Combining poetic elements with novelistic structures
                        and components of the short story, Cortázar recruits historical figures but
                        avoids a linear fictional plotline, placing them instead within an amorphous
                        formal space—a space that bridges all three genres, and where time and
                        setting are collapsed.</p>
                  <p> Establishing poets as the ultimate measurers of time, Cortázar operates in
                        the capacity of a vatic poet envisioning not just the future but an
                        ever-mysterious present: <quote>

                  <p>Keats’s omnipresent timelessness is embodied in the improvisatory movements
                        of Cortázar’s seemingly erratic, free-flowing hops and skips around
                        sentences, stanzas, and chapters. In this poetic world in which there are
                        neither birth dates nor death dates, <title level="a">Julio y John</title>
                        take turns leading one another. At the beginning of this article, Cortázar
                        invited Keats for a stroll, placing him in his pocket. Here, he again
                        initiates, but agrees to follow. We see Cortázar inverting the neoromantic
                        impetus of a 1950s writer wishing he lived in the 1810s. Instead, he claims
                        Keats as contemporary, emphasizing both the portability of a pocket Keats
                        and the transportability of all authors into one another’s worlds. This
                        poses a new kind of relationship between British Romanticism and Latin
                        American postmodernist writing, one based on two Cortazarian models:
                        “hopscotch,” which allows us to jump discreetly from point to point within a
                        field that precludes strict sequencing; and “blow-up,” the zooming in up
                        close to a single image, uncovering new life, movement, and action as in a
                        film before panning out. Cortázar shows that the
                        “time traveling” of <title level="m">Hopscotch</title> and up-close reading
                        experiences of <title level="a">Blow-up</title> are not learned
                            <emph>from</emph> Keats, but <emph>with</emph> him, as they go forward
                        together, collapsing distance, overlapping time scales, and merging
                        genres.</p>
                  <p>From the beginning to the end of a long work that never truly feels
                        sequential in its narrative, Cortázar cultivates a purposeful simultaneity
                        and universality that allows him to commune eternally with Keats. Indeed,
                        throughout <title level="m">Imagen</title>, time overlaps on various levels:
                        in the metric time of poetry, the historical timelines of biography, and the
                        narrative horizontal direction of chapters progressing within a novel.
                        Genres overlap as we see the novel and short story overlaid upon the smaller
                        poetic building blocks of alliteration, metaphor, and anaphora. Ultimately,
                        a thoughtful reading of <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is not
                        an exercise in noticing the many parallels between two worlds, two times,
                        and three genres; nor is it simply an occasion to trace lines of
                        inheritance. Rather, it is recognizing the vision of a lively constellation
                        within a single shared space of three-dimensionality, a dynamic collage that
                        choreographs participation in a shared “reality.” </p>
                  <p>Cortázar’s book depicts the accessibility of the “everyman” Keats for all
                        readers, inclusive of a Latin American and Hispanophone audience, from the
                        1950s to today. His games of “hopscotch” and “blow-up” depict a dynamic
                        image of Keats not otherwise afforded to us in chronological memoirs,
                        biography, or literary criticism. And while this formal ambiguity may have
                        been the very reason for the omission of <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> from Keats’s critical lineage thus far, it is a work to be
                        rediscovered and honored—to be preciously placed in our
                        pockets—as a model that resists traditional patterns of Latin American
                        afterlives through its insistent contemporaneity. </p>
