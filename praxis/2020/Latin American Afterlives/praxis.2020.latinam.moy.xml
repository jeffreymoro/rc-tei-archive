                        <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, Julio Cortázar’s literary
                    biography from the 1950s. An amphibious text that oscillates between a rigorous
                    work of criticism and a playful work of fiction, it follows two lines of
                    national influence: the Latin American surrealist short story and Romantic
                    poetry. Moreover, in staging a sense of timeless contemporaneity by
                    strategically merging literary-historical events, the book brings together
                    Keats, Shelley, and Hunt with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine friends and
                    intellectuals. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for Cortázar to
                    personally inhabit a Romantic universality, rendering Keats accessible to the
                    Latin American “everyman.”</p>

                    <p>In the 1950s, the Argentinian author Julio Cortázar (1914–1984) composed an
                        ambitious work&#8212;a “life and letters” of his favorite Romantic poet. The
                        result was <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, a six-hundred-page
                        collage of Keats’s poems and letters, Cortázar’s own prose, and a myriad of
                        references to Latin American, Spanish, German, French, and British authors.
                        This little-known masterpiece covers the entirety of Keats’s adult life and
                        works, beginning with <title level="m">Sleep and Poetry</title> and ending
                        with his lesser-known dramas and posthumous works. Inspired by Cortázar’s
                        Spanish translation of Richard Monckton Milnes’s <title level="m">The Life
                            and Letters of John Keats</title>, published in Madrid in 1955, it far
                        exceeds Lord Houghton’s efforts in its geographical and generic scope. </p>
                    <p><title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> opens with a gust of brightness
                        and momentum, its initial sentence announcing participation in the Romantic
                        tradition by calling upon Nature, Imagination, and an Aeolian breeze: “This
                        is a Romantic book, driven by its impulse towards its theme with the focus
                        and faithfulness of a sunflower” (15). Playful and ambulatory, Cortázar’s
                        text meanders in and out of the modes of biography, literary criticism,
                        personal essay, and artistic memoir. It functions as a Keats anthology
                        tailored for the Latin American reader, as well as a collection of
                        Cortázar’s annotated translations and original poems. The methodological
                        declarations, personal effusions, and literary references culminate in what
                        Victor Zonana terms a “generic hybrid” and the work of a “poet-critic” who,
                        rather than composing an erudite and academic study, traces the process of a
                        poetry “in the making” (57). But while it oscillates between various genres,
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title> is presented as one organic structure,
                        its formidable <title level="a">Table of Contents</title> offering a roadmap
                        for the thirteen chapters and eighty-five subsections that follow. </p>
                    <p>Published posthumously by Alfaguara in 1996, <title level="m">Imagen</title>
                        has garnered scant attention from Keats scholars and appears but briefly
                        even in criticism of Cortázar.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Boldy,

                            appear in either French or Spanish publications.</note> The relative
                        obscurity of such a monumental work begs the question of what has made this
                        text so inaccessible to both Anglophone and Hispanophone readers. Especially
                        given Cortázar’s recognition as a global author of the Latin American Boom
                        movement, that <title level="m">Imagen</title> has eluded critical attention
                        cannot solely be attributed to the fact that the work has not yet been fully
                        translated into English.<note place="foot" resp="author">Cortázar received
                            the Prix Médicis in France in 1974 and the Rubén Darío Order of Cultural
                            Independence in Nicaragua in 1983. The editors of this issue are
                            currently completing a critical English translation of <title level="m"

                        In addition to any language barrier, Cortázar’s text presents a difficult
                        challenge to Latin Americanists and Romanticists alike, due to its
                        ahistorical approach and its hybrid style. This essay introduces Cortázar’s
                            <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> to unfamiliar readers by
                        elucidating its genre and methodology. Attending to important parallels
                        between Cortázar’s and Keats’s literary circles, I then situate the work
                        within Cortázar’s own statements on the transcultural transmission of
                        English Romantic works to a Latin American audience. </p>
                    <p><title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is unique among Latin American
                        afterlives of the English Romantic poets in two significant ways. First, it
                        is a truly transtemporal work, jumping timelines and collapsing eras within
                        one literary plane. Cortázar creates a dynamic field that accommodates a
                        motley crew of ancient Greek, Renaissance, Romantic, and modern Hispanophone
                        figures. This differs from typical neoromantic interactions of
                        twentieth-century writers who might simply import and repurpose familiar
                        motifs of Wordsworth or Shelley in a postmodern context. Instead, throughout
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title>, Cortázar inhabits the same time and
                        locales as Keats. What we witness is a contemporaneous overlapping of two
                        literary circles: Cortázar and his fellow writers of the Boom era are
                        superimposed upon the world of Hunt, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Blake. These
                        figures intermingle in pages redolent of Cortázar’s signature style,
                        featuring the crossing of paths of a seemingly listless flaneur. While
                            <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is one of Cortázar’s
                        non-fiction works, its cast of characters occupies a fiction-like space
                        projected onto an epic scale. In this essay, I draw upon the imagery of
                        playing hopscotch and “blowing up” (expanding) an image&#8212;borrowed from
                        two of Cortázar’s most famous works, <title level="m">Hopscotch</title>
                        (1963) and <title level="a">Blow-up</title> (1967)&#8212;to explore the
                        experimentation he employs throughout his innovative treatise on Keats.<note
                            place="foot" resp="author">Cortázar’s major novel <title level="m"
                                >Hopscotch</title> (<title level="m">Rayuela</title>) is often
                            regarded as a text marking the beginning of the Latin American Boom,
                            while his short story <title level="a">Blow-up</title> (<title level="a"
                                >Las babas del diablo</title>) was immortalized in film by
                            Michelangelo Antonioni in 1966.</note> In so doing, I seek to restore
                        the lost reception of <title level="m">Imagen</title> by untangling the two
                        factors most problematic to the text’s transmission: periodization and
                        genre.</p>
                    <p>In the opening section of <title level="m">Imagen</title>, titled <title
                            level="a">Preludes,</title> Cortázar announces the scope of his project
                        in teasingly lofty and legal language, calling his opening a “Sworn
                        Statement.” At other points, as in the chapter <title level="a">Sleep and
                            Poetry,</title> he shifts into a confiding voice, assuming the mode of
                        personal essay or of casual biography. His reportage of Keats’s life in the
                        section titled <title level="a">Romanticism</title> feels at times flippant
                        and comical: <quote>

                        </quote> As we see in this passage, Cortázar regards Keats with a sense of
                        camaraderie that borders upon self-identification. He speaks authoritatively
                        and on behalf of Keats, as if present throughout the poet’s early years. The
                        reference to Adrogué, a small town in the suburbs of Buenos Aires with
                        cobble-stoned streets and town squares, familiarizes the foreignness of
                        Hampstead through analogy and geographic translation. Rather than glossing
                        an Argentinian reference for the benefit of an English audience, Cortázar
                        naturally reverses the Anglocentric orientation, catering to his ideal Latin
                        American reader. Ultimately, it is Cortázar who invites Keats for an
                        exploratory stroll, not the other way around. His physical metaphor for
                        companionship, of walking side by side, serves as a leitmotif throughout the
                        text, proposing a relation of friendship and equality rather than one of
                        idolatry or infatuation. This becomes an enduring theme in the structure,
                        spirit, and timescale that is central to Cortázar’s treatise on Keats.</p>
                    <p>Taking after Samuel Johnson’s <title level="m">Lives of the Poets</title> in
                        its biographical homage, and emulating the personal accounts from Hazlitt’s
                            <title level="a">My First Acquaintance with Poets,</title>
                        <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> incorporates personal
                        anecdotes with stylistic critique, whether offering its cultural commentary
                        on nineteenth-century England or twentieth-century Buenos Aires. The work
                        exhibits a comfortable mastery over figures in British literature,
                        offhandedly alluding to lines of Spenser, Herbert, Wordsworth, and Coleridge
                        as if they were close friends. Cortázar’s invocation of these authors is
                        casual but not disrespectful; he gestures toward these canonical figures
                        with disarming hospitality and a gracious informality. In an intriguing
                        balance between admiration and sauciness, Cortázar conjures up a living
                        community populated by Shelley, Byron, “John,” “Bob Burns,” George and Tom,
                        and even “Mom and Dad”: <quote>

                                1795&#8212;the year and the season in which Wordsworth and Coleridge
                                met, with illustrious consequences. It was the year of the
                                guillotine in the front shores of France…[Then] another star:

                                and that of Keats. And to think that, in 1795, he had already

                                gave him such a proclivity to psychoanalysis. He comes afloat after
                                a confusing childhood, closely tied to his two brothers, George and
                                Tom, (both of them younger than him), and also to Fanny, the
                                flip-flop of the household, who very early in his life bestowed upon
                                Keats’ a predestined name.</p>

                        </quote> Here, Cortázar is at ease, mapping out the baby steps and first
                        literary strides of William Blake and Robert Burns. He converts the
                        publication timelines of Romantic literary geniuses into anecdote and
                        caricature, pure baby stuff: “What a nursery!” He inserts himself into the
                        scene of “John’s” infancy, bearing witness by inviting himself into the
                        Keats family household and into the childhood playpens of the Big Six as
                        well. Freely working on a first-name basis, he flits in and out as a welcome
                        member of the clan with carefree familiarity. This quick movement from a
                        grand historical scale to such individual intimacy characterizes much of the
                        lengthy book and lends a dynamic rhythm to the long stretches of prose.
                        Cortázar often zooms in at a rapid pace, “blowing up” meaningful moments to
                        notice the possibility of unrealized, fantastic detail behind the mundane.
                        This zooming in and out is an important device that breathes magic into the
                        ending of Cortázar’s surrealist short story <title level="m"
                            >Blow-Up,</title> in which the expanded print of a camera snapshot,
                        scrutinized in the photographer’s studio after the moment of capture,
                        reveals a chain of unforeseen possibilities and traumas. It allows the past
                        to become present, locked in a dynamic stasis and primed for revelation and
                        analysis. Such is the process of “blowing up” and developing the “image” of
                        John Keats, opening up possibilities for alternative representations of the
                        poet we thought we knew. </p>
                    <p>Blowing up images allows for a mode of discovery that curates moments and
                        transcends chronological time. In his literary practice of merging times and
                        epochs, Cortázar intimately enters the Romantic past and brings the coterie
                        of the Keats-Shelley circle to life, communing with Byron, Coleridge,
                        Shelley, Haydon, and Hunt; but he also shows how these spirits have come to
                        life in his own day. He recognizes them in the works of contemporary
                        Latin-American poets and translators, such as Ricardo Molinari, Francisco
                        Luis Bernárdez and Miguel Cané (22). In many passages, Cortázar keeps the
                        text humming with experimental punctuation and an irregular distribution of
                        paragraphs that is particularly vivacious and poetic. <quote> I’m thinking

                                under the green umbrellas of the squares. Keats is something to be
                                carried in your pocket, where you carry the things that really
                                matter. Your hands, your money, your handkerchief; the bookshelves

                        </quote> Here, we are introduced to a confluence of journalists (Cané),
                        poets (Arrieta), politicians (Roca), musicologists and literary critics
                        (Devoto), and Classics professors (Mascialino). These are the Argentine
                        writers who sustained the bustling afterlife of Keats in 1950s Buenos Aires,
                        bonded through a common physical token of recognition: walking together,
                        carrying an “essential” edition of Keats in their pocket: “Y cuánto muchacho
                        habrá que anda con el tomito de la <title level="m">Everyman</title> en el
                        bosillo, para leer a John en la calle, al aire libre, bajo los parasoles
                        verdes de las plazas” (23). Referring to the Everyman’s Library Pocket Poets
                        series, this notion of a “pocket Keats” establishes the poet’s universality,
                        accessibility, and portability. Through it, Keats is available to the Latin
                        American everyman or <foreign xml:lang="sp">fulano de tal</foreign>. It
                        claims Keats as a working-class poet for young men living out in the world,
                        walking and reading outdoors in town squares. He is not a bust to be
                        worshipped upon the bookshelves of musty offices and libraries, alongside
                        Coleridge and Eliot. Keats’s poems are a practical necessity and an item to
                        be used daily, palpably, by this troupe of Latin American writers. Cané,
                        Arrieta, and Devoto exist within the same chapters and street corners as
                        “John,” in Paris, Buenos Aires, Teignmouth, and Hampstead. It is this
                        Romantic element of timeless universality and ubiquity that appeals to
                        Cortázar, more so than the fractured images offered by the Modernists; it
                        lends him a space of contemporaneity and freedom. More importantly, it
                        offers him the ability to create a unified, unbroken image, <foreign
                            xml:lang="sp">una imagen de John Keats</foreign> that is singular and
                        not plural.</p>
                    <p> What happens in the final lines of the passage above is jarring: in almost
                        cinematic fashion, Cortázar draws parallels between the everyman’s daily
                        ambles and a moment of high Romantic tragedy. Through this transition, he
                        pans out from the pockets of the young Argentine men in 1950s to the pocket
                        of a young Percy Shelley&#8212;drowned and washed up ashore in the Gulf of
                        Spezia on July 8, 1822. The zooming out of the camera lens is a strategic
                        narrative movement that affords a dramatic sense of identification between
                        distant parties. This potential for immediate transport&#8212;physically,
                        temporally, and historically&#8212;is seminal to Cortázar’s early writing
                        and becomes absolutely definitive of his later works.</p>
                    <p>Critics such as Ana Martínez Santa have read <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> as a compositional training ground for Cortázar, who after
                        the 1960s would emerge onto the world literary scene in full force (195). As
                        we can see, Cortázar does not simply borrow themes from Keats and transplant
                        them within a Latin American setting. Instead, <title level="m"
                            >Imagen</title> enacts a unique experiment in flattening timescales,
                        providing in each chapter a series of permeable wormholes through which the
                        reader and author can embark on literary time travel, spanning from 1816 to
                        1959. This does not follow the model of a two-dimensional timeline but
                        rather inhabits a three-dimensional field, an all-encompassing space that
                        plays host to otherwise impossible interactions.<note place="foot"

                        numbers along a linear scale, Cortázar invites the reader to become immersed
                        in jarringly different environments, transporting suddenly from a
                        conversation with the enchanting Gekrepten in the Almagro neighborhood of
                        Buenos Aires to a walk along the Quai de Conti in Paris with a different

                        dynamic movement, for a truly bodily experience of transport, fuels the
                        “contemporaneous” intimacy that makes for the indissoluble personal bond,
                        physically choreographed, between Cortázar and Keats.</p>

                        consisted of young men spurred to publication in response to the political
                        turmoil and threat of censorship during their time, the former provoked by
                        the Peterloo Massacre, and the latter by the violence of repressive
                        authoritarian governments and dictatorships in Latin America. The rise of
                        military regimes in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru in the
                        second half of the twentieth century ultimately brought together many
                        Hispanic authors across Spain and Latin America. Their political fervor and
                        leftist ideological lineage earned the Boom authors an international
                        audience of young readers who opposed the climate of censorship and the
                        threats to human rights, themes featured in many of the Latin American
                        novels produced during those years.</p>
                    <p>Cortázar left his university post at the National University of Cuyo in 1946
                        as a result of his opposition to the regime of General Juan Perón. In many
                        ways, the period of censorship and intellectual repression preceding the
                        Dirty War in Argentina became for Cortázar what Peterloo was for Keats.
                        Nicholas Roe’s <title level="m">Keats and the Culture of Dissent</title> and
                        Jeffrey Cox’s <title level="m">Poetry and Politics in the Cockney
                            School</title> have showcased how the liberal convictions of Leigh Hunt
                        and the Cockney School shaped Keats in a stronger vein than has been
                        previously recognized. Much like Keats, Cortázar was sympathetic to the
                        political urgencies shared by other Boom writers. He protested the impending
                        presidency of Perón, leaving his teaching position and his country shortly
                        after. He would travel to Cuba numerous times, first in 1963, but his
                        enthusiasm for the revolution quickly dissolved when the poet Heberto
                        Padilla was arrested and jailed by the Castro regime in 1971. Relying on his
                        own voice, Cortázar eventually withdrew from the Cuban cause, just as Keats
                        had eventually distanced himself from the Hunt circle, though he would
                        always remain strongly supportive of the political left throughout his life.
                        Still, it is important not to impose exact parallels upon the political
                        situations of both authors, nor to assume that a Latin American author would
                        automatically cleave to Romantic literature for its revolutionary echoes.
                        This is simply not the case, and despite resonances between the Latin
                        American Boom writers and the Keats-Hunt circle, <title level="m">Imagen de

                    <p>Scholars of the Latin American Boom typically trace any European influence to
                        the French and British modernists, including Proust, Joyce, and the
                        surrealists; or by way of Latin American <foreign xml:lang="sp"
                            >modernismo</foreign> authors at the fin de siècle, such as Rubén Darío,
                        José Martí, and José Asunción Silva, who followed the French Parnassians and
                        Symbolists. For a young Cortázar to align himself with John Keats rather
                        than a figure like James Joyce was thus a marked departure from others
                        within his literary circle, which was dominated at the time by French
                        intellectualism. As Peter Standish attests, Cortázar “was in many respects a
                        romantic, the prime source of his romanticism being English poetry of the
                        nineteenth century” (14–15). Borges, who was also a great reader of English
                        literature, delivered a series of lectures that included twenty-five classes
                        from <title level="m">Beowulf</title> to <title level="m">The Picture of
                            Dorian Gray</title>, with four classes devoted to Wordsworth, Coleridge,

                            Literature</title>). Cortázar avoids such strict chronological
                        self-positioning: Rather than performing a historical survey, covering the
                        breadth of the English canon, he plunged deeply into the works of a few
                        Anglophone authors he admired, including Defoe, Poe, and Keats.</p>

                        (c.f. Ramirez, <title level="a">Keatsians in Argentina</title>). At the same
                        time, the English-Spanish language difference both presents an obstacle and
                        spares them from the anxieties surrounding a colonizing language. For
                        Cortázar, despite recognizing British literature as a central cultural
                        force, his position on the periphery of this somewhat distant tradition is
                        neither one of adulation nor of marginalization. So, what jagged line of
                        influence can be traced through the lens of this cosmopolitan reader? Again,
                        Cortázar’s model of ambulation or meandering comes to play, emulating
                        Montaigne’s impetus to <foreign xml:lang="fr">essayer</foreign>, try out new

                            It has been asserted many times that Latin American literature in
                            general enters modernity without all the baggage&#8212;and the
                            confidence that comes with it&#8212;of a slow past and a slow evolution,
                            as European literature has. We went from the Spanish Conquest to
                            colonization and then independence in a stretch of time that, compared
                            with the development of the great literary cultures of the West, is
                            tiny, a mere instant. This means that when Latin American writers began
                            to write, and write autonomously in each of our countries, they might
                            have unconsciously felt the absence of a slow evolution of which they
                            were the last link in a long chain. Suddenly they found themselves
                            confronting a modern culture, and a language that could be used in all

                        </quote> Here, in Cortázar’s assessment, Latin American authors enjoy the
                        possibility of writing autonomously. The evolution of their literature is
                        not a slow buildup across generations but a sudden moment in time, a “mere
                        instant.” Its potential is thus explosive and optimistic rather than
                        burdened by any “baggage” of periodization. Indeed, the “tiny,” “mere
                        instant” of Latin American inspiration is not so much diminutive as it is
                        liberating through its ahistoricity. It is important to recognize here that
                        Cortázar’s trilingualism and worldliness afforded him the access and
                        confidence to foray the European scene. Born in Brussels in 1914, he settled
                        in Paris in the 1950s, traveling also to Cuba, America, Spain, and
                            Egypt.<note place="foot" resp="author">Many Boom authors were travelers
                            and exiles, lending the political and social action they advocated
                            greater urgency for their readers across the world. Mariano Siskind’s
                                <title level="m">Cosmopolitan Desires</title> discusses Latin
                            American writing as world literature, recognizing the creation of Latin
                            American literary modernity as a global phenomenon that led to the
                            worldwide popularity of magical realism.</note> Not simply an
                        Argentinian author but a true cosmopolitan figure, Cortázar shrugs off the
                        typical postcolonial shackles of the Latin American author writing in
                        Spanish or embracing canonical works of Old Europe. His notion of the rise
                        of Latin American literature as transpiring after the height of Western
                        civilization is a narrative marked by indifference to the imperial burden,
                        in fact a soaring alternative to it.</p>

                        strategy for such a lengthy book that is able to maintain a reader’s
                        interest without following the dramatic plotline of a novel or epic.
                        Generically speaking, <title level="m">Imagen</title> is not a collection of
                        short stories, the form later favored by Cortázar and Borges; nor does it do
                        the work of a history, mapping out a long-ranging trajectory with the poets
                        of antiquity on one end of the timeline and contemporary writers on the
                        other. Instead, the book is a series of moments always set in the present,
                        invoking the mode of “automatic writing” that Cortázar and other surrealist
                        writers would come to champion. He describes and enacts this autonomous,

                    <p>Cortázar insistently refuses historicity, even as he enumerates Keats’s
                        literary forebears. This confidence in seizing the present and shrugging off
                        the past is professedly a tactic he learned from and shared with Keats. Just
                        as Cortázar does not owe his inspiration to Keats, Keats is not beholden to
                        his predecessors. Neither feels the weight of the English canon upon him.
                        Cortázar explains: <quote>
                            <p rend="noCount">This is how Keats always felt, and if it is literally
                                impossible to say that he cleared the slate of the past, we will see
                                that his adherence to this past is neither born out of a nostalgia
                                nor a sentiment of reverence in the Manriquean mode. On the
                                contrary, in his own poetic dimension, he lives so deeply in the
                                past that he does not feel the need to profess about it, and this
                                abolishes divisions of chronology. From 1814 to 1816, he was trapped
                                by the magic of Spenser’s <title level="m">The Faerie
                                Queene</title>. Later on, it is Shakespeare and Milton who enchant
                                him. But can we really speak about the past&#8212;in the sense that
                                Ortega understands it&#8212;when we are talking about Shakespeare
                                and Milton <emph>in</emph> England? When Keats feels the need to
                                escape Spenser’s charms&#8212;and that was truly a temporal
                                contemplation of a long-gone past&#8212;, John remains squarely
                                within the same temporal dimension of Milton and, above all, of
                                Shakespeare. They are not “models or norms”: they are the poetry at
                                the level that Keats is striving so willfully to reach. In regards
                                to Greece, where he finds all the imagery of <title level="m"
                                    >Endymion</title>, all the pathos of <title level="m"

                                    on a Grecian Urn,</title> his talent is not that of a historian.
                                For John, his world of Hampstead and Greece are the very same
                                reality where nature and man coexist in an alternate plane of direct
                                contemplation and mythological symbology. He does not feel the
                                nostalgia of Greece; his overwhelming joy weaves the tapestry of
                                pagan images in his poetry. He does not see any reason to deplore
                                the passing of time. The <emph>eternal</emph> world is within reach
                                of his hand, and what his eyes see in an oak tree is the same thing
                                that Virgil saw. What would be the purpose of remembering the snows

                        to the starting point” that Cortázar recognizes as fundamentally Romantic
                        are a central structural component of <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title>. They are also, I argue, what defines his major works,
                        especially <title level="m">Hopscotch</title>. This passage, excerpted from
                        a section titled <title level="a">Circumstance and Choice,</title>
                        celebrates Keats’s creative autonomy despite being informed by Milton,
                        Shakespeare, and Virgil. In this shared reality, Hampstead is Greece; Keats
                        sees the very same oak tree that Virgil saw. Any literary resemblances are
                        not a matter of historical eventuality but of taste and happenstance of the
                        present. In turn, Cortázar clears his own “slate of the past,” “abolishes
                        the divisions of chronology,” and can draw on Keats without “nostalgia nor a
                        sentiment of reverence.” This lends him, too, complete autonomy from any
                        anxiety of historical influence, within or across national traditions. Both
                        authors are free to shrug off any deferential indebtedness to their literary

                    <p>Following his Waterman ink pen, Cortázar’s writing method is a spontaneous
                        process based on personified inspiration, establishing <title level="m"
                            >Imagen</title> as a creative work unburdened by meticulous planning.
                        This complete improvisatory freedom&#8212;the possibility of ending up
                        anywhere, in any time signature or any key&#8212;is reminiscent of the twist
                        endings and perspectival changes that mark the endings to so many short
                        stories of the surrealist and Latin American Boom movements. In this sense,
                        the interaction of different genres at play adds great interest to <title
                            level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>&#8212;a novel-length work, based
                        on British poetry, that invokes definitive narrative techniques of the Latin
                        American Boom short story style.</p>
                    <p>The question of genre is perhaps the greatest source of distance between
                        Keats the poet and Cortázar, the writer of short stories and fiction. It is
                        also the most challenging aspect of critically approaching a work like
                            <title level="m">Imagen</title>. The book is patently not a historical
                        novel that uses the Romantic poets as familiar characters. Instead, it is a
                        text brimming with facts and details, despite presenting this informational
                        content within a semi-fictional and poetic framework. How do we as readers
                        then approach Cortázar’s text, recognizing its labor of literary commentary
                        while attending to its formal elements of creative memoir? Might one read
                        the many chapters as a series of short stories? As compositional fragments?
                        Or as a manual for navigating Keats’s life and writings?<note place="foot"

                    <p>Cortázar provides us with the semblance of an answer when he broaches this
                        question of genre himself. Answering questions posed by students at the
                        University of California, Berkeley, he addresses why Latin America produced
                        so many short-story writers: “In Latin America, the short story is so
                        popular and is of such high quality that it can be considered among the best
                        to be imagined or written in the world….Short stories and short-story
                        writers appear in Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, and follow the aesthetic trends
                        that at the time were coming fundamentally from Europe. So, when Romanticism
                        arrives in Latin America, like a kind of enormous deluge, many stories and
                        many novels are written that have Romantic characteristics, but the subjects
                        are already Latin American…” (30–33).<note place="foot" resp="author"
                            >“Cortázar drew an interesting parallel between the novel as movie and
                            the short story as paragraph. A movie has an open order, a detailed and
                            rounded structure in which many frames or puzzle pieces eventually
                            deliver a finished story to the viewer, as in a novel. A photograph, on
                            the other hand, presupposes limitations. It is one immobile frame of a
                            single significant piece to a puzzle, a fragment of reality to which the
                            viewer must supply the remaining pieces, as in a short story. The short
                            story, therefore, is an ‘opening up’ of a reality that is much greater
                            than that of the actual tale: ‘that fabulous opening of the minute onto
                            the gigantic, of that which is individual and circumscribed onto the
                            very essence of the human condition.’” (Picon Garfield 13)</note>

                        elements of Romanticism with Latin American fictional forms, melding both
                        genres and national literatures. The structure of the text feels novelistic
                        and draws from elements of the surrealist short story, while its content is
                        poetic and biographical. </p>

                        own, inspired by Keats. Combining poetic elements with novelistic structures
                        and components of the short story, Cortázar recruits historical figures but
                        avoids a linear fictional plotline, placing them instead within an amorphous
                        formal space&#8212;a space that bridges all three genres, and where time and

                    <p>Keats’s omnipresent timelessness is embodied in the improvisatory movements
                        of Cortázar’s seemingly erratic, free-flowing hops and skips around
                        sentences, stanzas, and chapters. In this poetic world in which there are
                        neither birth dates nor death dates, <title level="a">Julio y John</title>
                        take turns leading one another. At the beginning of this article, Cortázar
                        invited Keats for a stroll, placing him in his pocket. Here, he again
                        initiates, but agrees to follow. We see Cortázar inverting the neoromantic
                        impetus of a 1950s writer wishing he lived in the 1810s. Instead, he claims
                        Keats as contemporary, emphasizing both the portability of a pocket Keats
                        and the transportability of all authors into one another’s worlds. This
                        poses a new kind of relationship between British Romanticism and Latin
                        American postmodernist writing, one based on two Cortazarian models:
                        “hopscotch,” which allows us to jump discreetly from point to point within a
                        field that precludes strict sequencing; and “blow-up,” the zooming in up
                        close to a single image, uncovering new life, movement, and action as in a
                        film before panning out. Cortázar shows that the
                        “time traveling” of <title level="m">Hopscotch</title> and up-close reading
                        experiences of <title level="a">Blow-up</title> are not learned
                            <emph>from</emph> Keats, but <emph>with</emph> him, as they go forward
                        together, collapsing distance, overlapping time scales, and merging
                        genres.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning to the end of a long work that never truly feels
                        sequential in its narrative, Cortázar cultivates a purposeful simultaneity
                        and universality that allows him to commune eternally with Keats. Indeed,
                        throughout <title level="m">Imagen</title>, time overlaps on various levels:
                        in the metric time of poetry, the historical timelines of biography, and the
                        narrative horizontal direction of chapters progressing within a novel.
                        Genres overlap as we see the novel and short story overlaid upon the smaller
                        poetic building blocks of alliteration, metaphor, and anaphora. Ultimately,
                        a thoughtful reading of <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is not
                        an exercise in noticing the many parallels between two worlds, two times,
                        and three genres; nor is it simply an occasion to trace lines of
                        inheritance. Rather, it is recognizing the vision of a lively constellation
                        within a single shared space of three-dimensionality, a dynamic collage that
                        choreographs participation in a shared “reality.” </p>
                    <p>Cortázar’s book depicts the accessibility of the “everyman” Keats for all
                        readers, inclusive of a Latin American and Hispanophone audience, from the
                        1950s to today. His games of “hopscotch” and “blow-up” depict a dynamic
                        image of Keats not otherwise afforded to us in chronological memoirs,
                        biography, or literary criticism. And while this formal ambiguity may have
                        been the very reason for the omission of <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> from Keats’s critical lineage thus far, it is a work to be
                        rediscovered and honored&#8212;to be preciously placed in our
                        pockets&#8212;as a model that resists traditional patterns of Latin American
                        afterlives through its insistent contemporaneity. </p>
