               <p>In commemoration of the bicentenary of Percy Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), this comparative essay focuses on the reception of the lyrical drama as a
                  revolutionary manifesto in Spanish-American nations. Fittingly, the drama’s publication
                  in the early nineteenth century coincided not only with Rafael del Riego’s republican
                  revolt in Spain but also with the independence movements throughout Latin America
                  more generally.

                           “The Shelleys and Spain,”
                           Joselyn Almeida explores Percy Shelley’s interest in writings by Cervantes and Calderón
                           de la Barca as well as Riego’s revolt in Spain. The essay also analyzes the influence
                           of these writings on Prometheus Unbound. She notes that Joseph Blanco White read Prometheus
                           Unbound in exile in Britain “as he reflected upon Riego’s liberal uprising” of the
                           1820s in Asturias (173).</span></div>
                  </div> The essay begins with an overview of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s short-lived yet influential reception history in Hispanophone culture, before tracking
                  particular readings of the play in local journalism and literature. I focus my reading
                  primarily on Alejo Carpentier’s <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> [<em>The Lost Steps</em>] (1950), a major twentieth-century novel whose network of references and allusions
                  to Shelley’s play provides one of the most earnest artistic engagements with the drama
                  ever produced. I ultimately suggest that as an endorsement of non-violent revolution
                  and social equality, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> has been indelibly inscribed into the radical political and literary history of Spanish-American
                  nations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Given that Shelley did not expect <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> to be a popular work in English, its brief circulation and reception history in Hispanophone
                  cultures is perhaps unsurprising.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>James Barcus has noted: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no more than 20 copies,
                           and John Gisborne remarked that Prometheus Unbound was never intended for more than
                           five or six persons” (3). This initial scarcity of copies and readers seems to corroborate
                           what Shelley claimed in his preface to the play that “[his] purpose has hitherto been
                           simply to familiarize the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of
                           poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209).</span></div>
                  </div> <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was not <em>fully</em> translated into the Spanish language until 1994, when Hiperion Press in Spain published
                  a bilingual edition with a translation by Alejandro Valero. The drama had hitherto
                  appeared in translation in both Spain and Spanish America only in parts: as an array
                  of fragments that existed as separate “poems” featured in anthologies. Excerpts of
                  it had also been used as epigraphs or cited in works by authors such as Miguel de
                  Unamuno, who considered Shelley to be a “marvelous” writer (González and Rodríguez
                  101).

                           the lines, “[Prometheus] gave Man speech, and speech created thought / Which is the
                           measure of the universe” (II.iv.72–73), as he cited them in his Amor y Pedagogia (Love
                           and Pedagogy).</span></div>
                  </div> As Beatriz Gonzalez and Santiago Rodríguez point out, Shelley’s reception in Spain
                  has suffered from various gaps of omission. This is owing largely to the country’s
                  complicated history. During the nineteenth century, for instance, Shelley was occluded
                  from the “conservative attitudes” of the reign of Ferdinand VII (1784–1833), when
                  several liberal, progressive authors, including Jose de Espronceda, were exiled from
                  Spain—a time period that also coincided with the Spanish American Independence movements.
                  It was not until the fin-de-siècle that [Shelley] is first mentioned in Spain. His
                  name reappeared during the 1920s only to disappear soon thereafter with the outbreak
                  of the Civil War in 1936 and the ensuing fascist state created under Francisco Franco.
                  The name of Shelley and his work began reappearing in the 1970s and has continued
                  to gain traction ever since; the recent translation of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is a good case in point (97).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the two centuries since <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s publication, versions of it—as either a reference or part-translation in Spanish
                  America—have taken on varying titles: <em>Prometeo</em> (Prometheus), <em>Prometeo Desencadenado</em> (Prometheus Unchained), <em>Prometeo Liberado</em> (Prometheus Liberated), <em>Prometeo Desatado</em> (the closest version one comes to “unbound” in Spanish), and <em>Prometeo Libertado</em> (an orthographical variation of Prometheus Liberated).

                  “Note”
                   from her publication of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in 1839. The volume’s back cover, which functions as a preface to the collection,
                  highlights the drama as “perhaps [Shelley’s] most ambitious work.” It traces some
                  biographical information on Shelley and the play’s composition history prior to offering
                  a synopsis that makes the case for the drama as a text of resistance (Figure 1):

                     style, [the play] brings fundamental problems into relief such as the struggle between
                     good and evil and the origin and destiny of the human species who, alongside the natural
                     world, resists oppression and destruction in the struggle for liberty. The poem ends
                     with a great song of hope in the wake of love’s triumph as the law of the world. ’</span> In his editorial notes, Valero remarks how, in contrast to Aeschylus’s version of
                  the myth, Shelley focused his adaptation on the moral and psychological aspects that
                  enable Prometheus’s liberation (215). For Valero, the play’s portrayal of a new political
                  reality culminates in a celebratory chant of freedom:

                  on the fifth page of <em>El Universal</em>, an early twentieth-century radical newspaper from Caracas, further supports this

                  —Un valle estrecho y sombrío”
                  ], was published in commemoration of the centenary of Shelley’s death (1922). Written
                  by Edouard Herriot, who eventually became prime minister of France, the text presents
                  his radical political interests in Shelley and was fittingly published in the aftermath
                  of World War I.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                           not reveal any connection to Shelley or his drama.</span></div>
                  </div> In addition to summarizing all four acts, Herriot lauds the play’s poetic ideals as
                  both “current” and “eternal.” After citing the final lines uttered by Demogorgon in
                  Act IV, he praises the play’s “luxuries of lyricism,” its ideas of passive resistance,
                  and the “necessary agony” suffered by Prometheus. In the final paragraph, Herriot
                  states: <span class="quote">‘I gladly read [<em>Prometheus Unbound</em>] again in these troublesome times. I have placed it among my beloved books, very
                     close to Plato. Shelley is the poet of democracy, of reason, of intellectual beauty;
                     [he is] the adversary of tyranny, the enthusiastic chanter of liberty. I love everything
                     about its classic purity; the poetry that flows through all its parts, the immense
                     love of nature that resounds in each of its stanzas, [and] the ineffable music of
                     its verse. During the war’s tragic hours, I would hear [the play’s] words of hope,
                     which sang in the wind of the battle. May [Shelley’s] memory rise again today among
                     the lands of the free in order to inspire respect for life, the love of Reason and
                     of Peace! After all, [Shelley] was the one who said: “Poets are the unacknowledged
                     legislators of the world.”’</span> Employing his own poetic liberties and invoking Shelley’s famous description of poets
                  as “unacknowledged legislators,” Herriot’s synopsis mirrors the earlier sentiments
                  of W.B. Yeats, who famously said at the turn of the twentieth century that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is among the “sacred books of the world” (<em>Early Essays</em> 70). Like Valero, Herriot acknowledges the drama’s timeless connections between poetry,
                  politics, and popular reform.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This seemingly uncritical treatment of Shelley’s poetry and politics turns strikingly
               more nuanced in Carpentier’s reading of the play in <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>. Although Carpentier was born in Switzerland to French and Russian parents and was
               educated throughout Europe, he grew up in Cuba and identified as Cuban. He spent much
               of his life fascinated by music, becoming a musicologist and studying musical traditions
               of the Caribbean and South America. Carpentier fled Cuba in 1945 because of the threat
               his left-wing politics posed to Fulgencio Batista’s regime. While in exile he wrote
               the partly autobiographical work, <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, which was published in Venezuela thirty-one years after Herriot’s article. A novel
               with Shelleyan, Conradian, and Proustian resonances, it tells the story of an unnamed,
               spiritually-exhausted protagonist and narrator whose Prufrockian <em>malaise</em> puts him at odds with the modern world. The narrative’s idealization of the origins
               of the human species is pit starkly against the “missteps” of human progress—as seen
               in the novel’s contrast between the native customs of a South American primitive oral
               society and the contemporary world of European languages, literature, philosophy,
               and cultures. A musicologist in search of native musical instruments, the narrator
               travels from New York City through the Andes Mountains into the heart of the South
               American jungle where his arduous physical journey toward the center of the continent
               also represents a journey back in time. From the contemporary urban landscape into
               farmlands, primitive villages, and stone-age-like encampments, he discovers an Edenic
               oasis and refuge from modern civilization.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Throughout its pages, Carpentier integrates the plot, mystical settings, and idealistic
                  aims of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> into its narrative space. Like the lyrical drama, the novel portrays the reversal
                  of historical time.

                  </div> Yet this modern adaptation of Shelley’s work, which is set in a South American jungle
                  instead of the Indian Caucasus, offers a more ambivalent take than Valero’s or Herriot’s.
                  The novel critiques the structure and aims of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as the integration of the play becomes an experiment that ultimately fails. Carpentier’s
                  empiricist approach for thinking through Shelley’s radical imperatives brings to light
                  the incompatibility between the demands for real-world change and the conceptual blueprints
                  for revolution that Shelley presumably left under-theorized.</p>

                  Shelley’s text early in the book when the narrator sees a copy of the lyrical drama
                  in a New York City bookshop, which made him “forget the world of books” altogether
                  (12).

                           or the entire 1820 Prometheus Unbound volume that contained other poems, including
                           
                           “To a Skylark,”

                           “The Sensitive Plant.”
                           </span></div>
                  </div> This influential moment cues the reader to the currency of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as the novel’s major touchstone, while prompting the narrator to recall his own musical
                  adaptation of Shelley’s drama. He has, in fact, composed “a prelude and the first
                  draft of the opening scenes” of an “ambitious cantata on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>,” a choral composition that emulates the style of the hymnic fourth act of Shelley’s
                  play (19). The novel further resembles its predecessor text through its plot structure
                  as a quest romance, its emphasis on social revolution, and its panoply of images and
                  poetic descriptions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The novel’s treatment of free love is also definitively Shelleyan. While married to
               Ruth, an American woman, the narrator has sought out a French lover named Mouche,
               with whom he travels to South America. When he grows tired of her during their journey,
               increasingly identifiying Mouche with Western bourgeois culture, he trades her for
               Rosario, a native woman and kindred spirit. These polyamorous behavioral patterns
               are reminiscent of Shelley’s own pursuits of love and depictions in such poems as
               <em>Epipsychidion</em>. For the narrator, Rosario transcends the taints of European modernity and colonialism
               and is the closest he comes to discovering his soulmate, his epipsyche: “several races
               had met in this [ideal] woman”; she is “an amalgam of related peoples” as an interracial
               and multi-ethnic ideal (81–2). “Through her lips the plants began to speak and describe
               their own powers,” which is suggestive of the animistic and anthropomorphic features
               of Shelley’s play (83). Carpentier even includes a moment of homoerotic tension when
               Mouche unsuccessfully attempts a pass at Rosario. This moment echoes the homoerotic
               scene between the daughters of Ocean at the beginning of Act II, as Carpentier meticulously
               aligns the plot and characters of each work.</p>
            <p>In terms of setting, the urban landscapes of New York City and the guerilla-torn South
               American city parallel the unredeemed Earth of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s first act. These correspondences make evident that, for the narrator, both European
               metropoles and colonial peripheries have become contaminated and corrupted. Several
               lines from Act I, including those from Prometheus’s opening monologue, appear throughout
               this early part of the novel; the second chapter even begins with the first fury’s
               initial line, “Ha! I scent life,” which signals a point of transition for the Titan
               who, despite being persecuted and tormented by the goddesses, refuses to despair.
               When the narrator visits what scholars agree is Caracas, he experiences his own form
               of encounter with the taunting furies: the outbreak of a violent revolution and guerilla
               warfare in which snipers detain him against his will. In Caracas, even nature appears
               to be up in arms: “For hundreds of years a struggle had been going on with roots that
               pushed up the sidewalks and cracked the walls” (38). The scene recalls the tension
               that verges on stalemate between Prometheus and Jupiter, especially when the narrator
               comments on the fraught South American history of the twentieth century where one
               finds the “movement of Socialists against Conservatives, of Communists against Catholics
               . . . [and] one lives with Rousseau and the Inquisition, with the Immaculate Conception
               and Das Kapital” (50–1). The echoes from the first act of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> are further reinforced when the narrator passes a shop with a “mysterious sign,”
               “[el] Rastro de Zoroastro,” a rhymed Spanish phrase meaning the trail (or trace) of
               Zoroaster (42). The sign brings to mind Shelley’s own reference to Zoroaster in Act
               I, which reveals the play’s interest in critiquing institutionalized religions and
               dualistic structures.</p>
            <p>Through a series of trials, the narrator also undertakes a quest romance into the
               heart of a jungle untainted by European civilization and colonization. The expedition
               echoes not only Prometheus’s mental transformation in Act I but also Asia’s quests
               in Act II: her physical journey into the underworld and the figurative voyage into
               the depths and discovery of her own psyche. Although both texts take place in different
               epochs and different parts of the globe, the characters in <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> encounter settings familiar to any reader of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: frozen landscapes, ravines, volcanoes, and a “multitude of peaks and abysses” (78).
               Like Asia at the beginning of Act II, scene five, who appears on a cloud atop a mountain
               ready to redeem the earth with love alongside Prometheus, the narrator also finds
               himself positioned above the clouds just prior to his new life in the jungle beside
               his own ideal love, Rosario.</p>
            <p>To engage Shelley’s work even further, Carpentier employs a style of imagery as if
               taken directly from the play’s experimental fourth act. Describing what he calls the
               “dance of the trees,” the narrator notes “the rhythm that begins in the leaves, a
               restless, ascending rhythm—with the surge and breaking of the waves, with gentle pauses,
               rests—which suddenly becomes a storm of rejoicing. There is nothing more beautiful
               than a bamboo thicket dancing in the breeze” (211). In Act IV, the Chorus of Unseen
               Spirits decree how: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Bright clouds float in heaven,</div>
                  <div class="l">Dew-stars gleam on earth,</div>
                  <div class="l">Waves assemble on ocean,</div>
                  <div class="l">They are gathered and driven</div>
                  <div class="l">By the storm of delight, by the panic of glee!</div>
                  <div class="l">They shake with emotion,</div>
                  <div class="l">They dance in their mirth.</div>
                  <div class="indent2">(lines 40–46)</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Later, the chorus rejoices to “weave the dance on the floor of the breeze, / [and]
               Pierce with song heaven's silent light” (70–71).</p>
            <p>Beyond embedding these ecstatic images into his poetical prose, Carpentier links the
               journey through space (to the center of the continent) to an expedition back in time.
               Upon his arrival at the secluded village, he remarks how he has retrogressed several
               millennia: <span class="quote">‘the 58 centuries separating the fourth chapter of Genesis from the current year <em>back there</em> could be spanned in one hundred and eighty minutes . . . [we flew] over cities that
                  today, at this very time, belonged to the Middle Ages, the Conquest, the Colony, or
                  the Romantic era” (233–34).’</span> For the narrator, the gap he once understood between the past and present has collapsed,
               as the self-sustaining community he has reached seemingly exists outside of history.
               Carpentier pits the Edenic surroundings of “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">acá</span>” (here) against the “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">allá</span>” (back there) of everyday modern life in New York and Caracas. The native village
               has bypassed the ravages of time and “progress” altogether; it is a “world compact,
               complete . . . a hidden nation, a map in code, a vast vegetable kingdom with few entrances”
               (126). Surrounded by native life and customs, the narrator experiences “the years
               . . . melt away, vanish, in the dizzying backward flight of time . . . We are in the
               Paleolithic age” (177–79). This part of the narrative is no doubt an adaptation of
               the final lines of the second act, in which Prometheus’s and Asia’s feats have reset
               history and have hence returned the world back to its origins: </p>

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> It is no coincidence that, in the midst of living in the native community, the narrator
               mentions his “old plan” of working on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as he delights in being part of a primitive oral society that is centered on community,
               memory, and literature. He learns “that the Indians had preserved the memory of a
               confused epic . . . of a Carib migration . . . [through which] the amazing unity of
               myths was borne out . . . the poem lived in the memory of the generations of the jungle”
               (210). The passage recalls Shelley’s own heterogeneous and eclectic myth of global
               aspiration. A play that symbolically unites the West (Prometheus) and East (Asia),
               <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is itself a “confused epic” that bridges numerous traditions, faiths, and cultures.</p>
            <p>This ostensibly uncritical homage to Shelley’s drama starts to dwindle, however, toward
               the end of the novel. While enjoying his new jungle life and using language and imagery
               inspired by the Shelleyan imagination, the narrator appears to lose touch with the
               actual details of the play. As he recounts, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> for him <span class="quote">‘conveyed a sense of resurrection, an emergence from darkness . . . Certain verses
                  I recalled would have fitted in admirably with my desire to work on <em>a text made of simple and direct words</em>: ‘Ah me! Alas, pain, pain, pain ever, for ever!’—‘No change, no pause, no hope! Yet
                  I endure.’ And then those choruses of mountains, springs, storms, elements by which
                  I was surrounded and I felt. That voice of the Earth, at once Mother, clay, womb,
                  like the Mothers of Gods who still reign in the jungle. And those hounds of hell who
                  break into the drama and howl with the accent of maenads rather than furies. ‘Ha!
                  I scent life!’ ‘Let me but look into his eyes!’” (166, emphasis added)’</span> Notwithstanding the narrator’s (and Carpentier’s) palpable admiration for the drama,
               any careful reader of Shelley’s play will detect the blatant misreading. Most obviously,
               the language of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is neither simple nor direct. Nor are the furies represented in Act I as agents of
               Dionysus. In an unusual manner, the above lines interweave the fantastical aspects
               of Shelley’s drama with the narrator’s inaccurate recollection of it.</p>
            <p>Yet these are not careless mistakes on Carpentier’s part. The mischaracterization
               of Shelley’s work arrives at a fitting point in the novel when the narrator stops
               idealizing the South American natives and landscape. This transformation is signaled
               most pointedly and symbolically by the appearance of a copy of Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em>. Snapping out of Shelleyan fantasy, the narrator regains his “modern” consciousness.
               “But no,” he confesses, “it was absurd to excite my imagination with [the cantata]
               when I did not have Shelley’s poem there, and never would” (218). At this climactic
               juncture, rather than resuming that “misbegotten Prelude to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>,” he decides instead to compose a cantata on <em>The Odyssey</em> (218). That is, the spell cast by Shelley’s poetry is broken, as the turn to Homeric
               epic foreshadows not only the end of the narrator’s sojourn in paradise but also his
               imminent return home to New York.</p>
            <p>It is appropriate at this point in the novel that—as in the case with the regeneration
               of the earth in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>—veils and masks suddenly “fall.” Let us recall that, at the end of Act III, the Spirit
               of the Hour declares: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> When the characters in the play report that masks and veils have fallen, they mean
               that the regenerated earth has shed the unnatural distortions caused by tyranny and
               corruption—allowing thus a view of things as they really are. In <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, however, Carpentier transforms the ends of the Shelleyan trope. Rather than highlighting
               the illusions generated by a tainted world, the fallen veils seemingly betray the
               pitfalls of Shelley’s play. This can be detected when, feeling like an intruder, the
               narrator suspects he “had torn the veil” of the primitive society (203). While he
               understands that he has reached a “primordial sense of beauty . . . in such remoteness”
               (163)—a landscape “unshaken since prehistoric times” (165)—Carpentier, unlike Shelley,
               ceases to depict nature as idealized. In the jungle, beauty stands beside coarseness:
               a “slimy tangle of snakes,” “rampant fauna,” and “primeval slime” (160–61). The narrator
               experiences “a kind of disorientation, and dizziness of the eyes . . . a [feeling]
               of being completely lost” within such a wilderness (161). This passage is reminiscent
               of the dizzying and intoxicating haze that overwhelms Asia during her descent toward
               Demogorgon, especially with echoes of the 
               “Life of Life”
               hymn from the second act’s fifth scene. But, unlike Asia, who releases Demogorgon
               through her proto-psychoanalytic introspection, the narrator believes himself to be
               an interloper in the prelapsarian landscape: “We were intruders, ignorant outlanders
               . . . in a city born in the dawn of History” (179). He unmasks, as it were, the Shelleyan
               fantasy and reconsiders the value of returning to one’s alleged origins: “If we go
               back a little farther, we will come to the terrible loneliness of the Creator, the
               . . . sadness of the times without incense or songs of praise, when the earth was
               without order and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep” (187). Surviving
               in this “prenatal world” becomes impossible, as the narrator is incapable of reconciling
               the disjunction between the primitive and modern worlds (206).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The narrator’s retreat from the South American cradle of civilization, then, abruptly
                  brings Carpentier’s Shelleyan experiment to its end. Despite the jungle’s allure of
                  art, poetry, seclusion, and exile, as well as his “irresistible” desire to finish
                  his Shelleyan cantata, he remembers the lack of paper and other modern tools that
                  have deterred him from figuratively turning back those “58 centuries” (206). Like
                  Prometheus, he recants, retracting his original desires of remaining in paradise.
                  Unlike Prometheus, though, he ultimately decides to return <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">allá</span> to New York City. When the narrator boards a plane that arrived in search of him,
                  he abandons Rosario and the Shelleyan imagination alike. Carpentier magnifies the
                  tension at this moment by drawing one final time upon Shelley’s poetry. During takeoff,
                  the narrator discovers “an opalescent mist . . . [that] cut us off from everything
                  . . . a fleecy bank of clouds” (238–39).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Though the narrator later tries to reverse his own “lost steps” by returning to the
                  South American jungle, the rising tide of the Amazon blocks his entryway.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Having retraced and allegedly rediscovered the “lost steps” of the human community,
               the narrator willfully lets them go again. In so doing, he reveals not only the irreducible
               gap created by time and error but also the incapacity for art—especially in this case,
               Romantic literary writing—to heal such wounds and fractures. In his tribute to and
               admiration for Shelley’s lyrical drama, Carpentier’s profound engagement with the
               text also brings the pitfalls of the utopian drama into relief. For, at least through
               the novel’s depiction of the modern era of bourgeois capitalism, there exists neither
               a redeeming Demogorgon nor a cosmic celebration of perpetual harmony. The secluded
               and intimate South American jungle is not, after all, like Asia's and Prometheus's
               cave of artistic cultivation, which sustains the renovated universe. According to
               Carpentier’s conclusion, this alternate prelapsarian South American space must remain
               elusive: contained instead in hearts of darkness, chasms and caves of wonder, obscure
               volumes, and even unfinished cantatas.</p>

               “The Shelleys and Spain,”
               Joselyn Almeida explores Percy Shelley’s interest in writings by Cervantes and Calderón
               de la Barca as well as Riego’s revolt in Spain. The essay also analyzes the influence
               of these writings on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. She notes that Joseph Blanco White read <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in exile in Britain “as he reflected upon Riego’s liberal uprising” of the 1820s
               in Asturias (173).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">James Barcus has noted: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no more than 20 copies,
               and John Gisborne remarked that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was never intended for more than five or six persons” (3). This initial scarcity
               of copies and readers seems to corroborate what Shelley claimed in his preface to
               the play that “[his] purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarize the highly refined
               imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms
               of moral excellence” (209).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               was titled <em>Prometeo Liberato</em> and likely inspired by the significance of Italy and its landscapes to the drama’s
