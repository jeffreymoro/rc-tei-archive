            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of
                    English Romanticism. However, authors from Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo to
                    Julio Cortázar have innovatively transformed the works of the British Romantics
                    through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links of aesthetic
                    closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their chronological and
                    geographical separation. The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and Keats by
                    Hispanophone and Lusophone writers are marked by authority, whimsy, and
                    adventure, often evoking a sense of playful irreverence. Afterlives from these
                    perspectives help to decenter the Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study,
                    helping to mitigate the exclusivity of a field that centers an entire literary
                    and cultural universe within a span of fifty years on the British Isles. In
                    essays by Stephen and Jordan Hart, Juan Jesús Payan, Omar Miranda, Gabriel
                    Insausti, Marco Ramírez Rojas, and Olivia Loksing Moy, one common strand that
                    emerges is how these authors confront questions of cultural marginality and
                    belatedness. The various transformations of the major British Romantic poets
                    studied in these contributions conjure up new figures with which to populate our
                    familiar canon: an alternately dour or ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares
                    de Azevedo); a more pragmatic Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats
                    (Cortázar).</p>

                    <p>In 1886, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo composed an invocation to Byron in
                        Portuguese, posing the fashionable English lord as his muse. Byromania had
                        spread amongst the literary coteries of Brazil, where, “at the University of
                        São Paolo, everyone wanted to be like Byron” (Stephen and Jordan Hart,
                            <title level="a">Latin America’s Byron</title>). In the 1940s, while in
                        exile in Cambridge during the Spanish Civil War, Luis Cernuda looked to
                        Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (1840) to
                        better understand his own role in society as a poet, questioning how he
                        might alleviate the suffering of man in the practical world. In 1972, Jorge
                        Luis Borges sang to Keats in a sonnet invoking his Grecian urn, echoing the
                        song of the nightingale from Keats’s 1819 ode.</p>
                    <p>It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of English
                        Romanticism. Despite the long and influential relations between the British
                        Empire and the countries of South and Central America, it is surprising that
                        instead of multiple cultural bridges, there appear only a few scattered
                        paths linking Romantic writers to the Latin American intellectual tradition.
                        England not only played a fundamental role in the independence of countries
                        like Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, but also exerted a fundamental
                        influence in the process of industrialization and modernization throughout
                        the continent, including certain territories in Brazil. Throughout the
                        nineteenth century, railroads in Latin America were built by British
                        companies, industries were created under the supervision and much to the
                        profit of English investors, and market networks were developed to
                        facilitate the circulation of capital across the Atlantic. Similarly, waves
                        of immigration brought considerable numbers of British citizens to settle in
                        major developing cities, as well as in rural areas that needed to be
                        industrially developed. How is it possible, then, that this tremendous
                        economic, social, and political impact was not readily reflected in the
                        Luso-Hispanic literary productions of the time?</p>
                    <p>In this volume, we examine a selection of prominent writers and works framed
                        within the lines of British-Luso-Hispanic dialogues. In the essays that
                        follow, Romanticist and Hispanophone scholars trace the reception of the
                        British Romantics in Latin America and Spain through circulation,
                        translation, and adaptation. Each of these studies highlights major
                        obstacles that have historically impeded the transmission of English
                        Romantic works into a language that is, for historical and geographic
                        reasons, a very important neighbor. In many cases, the research offered by
                        the scholars here exposes a surprising dearth in transmission—a paucity of
                        references, or the surprisingly late date of published translations. They
                        also challenge the assumption that Latin American nations would
                        automatically identify with Romantic revolutionary ideals, superimposing
                        these upon their own political contexts and paving the way for plentiful
                        adaptations. Hispanophone authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
                        do not necessarily adopt a tone of identification with English cultural or
                        political paradigms, but, rather, engage in critical readings and creative
                        adaptations. Despite these rich connections, the historical trajectory for
                        Latin American afterlives of the English Romantics is one of surprising
                        scarcity and belatedness. This collection aims to recuperate some of the
                        research, long overdue, along this line of transatlantic and translinguistic
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>Comparative Romanticist studies have long privileged the languages of German,
                        French, and Italian. British Romanticism’s indebtedness to German
                        philosophy, literature, and art has yielded a dominant stronghold within the
                        field; the historical impetus of the French Revolution has made French an
                        essential area for serious comparativist work; while Shelley’s and Keats’s
                        years in Rome have established a strong Italian connection.<note

                            comparativist studies in German, Hebrew, French, and Japanese. But of
                            the major European languages, Spanish has received the least critical
                            attention in reception studies.</note> Yet the critical history of the
                        Romantics’ reception in Spanish, both in Europe and in Latin America, has
                        not garnered serious critical attention until the last decade. Gabriel
                        Insausti attributes this partly to the fact that “Spanish Romanticism had
                        historically been very weak and had not left behind any noteworthy poet,”
                        throwing Spanish writers into a condition of a “sort of late-yielding fruit”
                            (<title level="a">Toward Unity</title>). This volume investigates the
                        afterlives of British Romantic poets in the Hispanophone world with an
                        emphasis on Latin American authors. Reframing the outdated model of a
                        European center and a New World periphery, we ask the following questions:
                        To what extent has translation shaped or impeded the dissemination of
                        otherwise global Romantic texts throughout countries like Argentina, Cuba,
                        Colombia, and Venezuela? How do Latin American reinterpretations of Romantic
                        texts assume or elide the colonial burdens of influence from English works,
                        as compared to those imposed by continental Spanish texts? How do Latin
                        American writers negotiate their position in relation to a European literary
                        and cultural canon? And in what ways do these Anglo-Latino interactions
                        differ from those recently explored in transatlantic studies, of North
                        America, the West Indies and the Black Atlantic?</p>
                    <p>Major critical advances tracing Hispanophone connections to British
                        Romanticism have been spearheaded by Joselyn Almeida-Beveridge, whose <title

                        Age of the Revolutions. The pan-Atlantic, a public sphere of exchange,
                        prominently shaped the shared political ideals of Britain, Africa, and the
                        non-Anglophone Americas in mutual ways, with Spain and Latin American forces
                        influencing English Romantic ideals of humanity, nation, and freedom.
                        Almeida-Beveridge’s 2010 collection of essays, <title level="m">Romanticism
                            and the Anglo-Hispanic Imaginary</title>, reveals the continued presence
                        of South and Central American culture within the British canon and the
                        English literary imagination, particularly in the context of the Peninsular
                        War and the Wars of Latin American Independence. These studies chart the
                        dialogues of Latin American and Spanish intellectuals that took place in
                        British territory during the crucial years of Latin American independence

                    <p>This volume traces such influences but in the opposite direction, often
                        working through lines of transmission in Spain but focusing primarily on
                        authors from Latin America. We explore how Hispanophone writers received,
                        reworked, and incorporated the works of the English poets into their own
                        literary traditions. Often, these authors faced a linguistic barrier,
                        immersing themselves in British literature while improving their English
                        language skills through work as translators. The essays we have included
                        analyze how Anglophone Romantic sources have been read, questioned, and
                        adapted to their own local realities. Building upon Almeida-Beveridge’s and
                        Saglia and Haywood’s collections that explore eighteenth- and
                        nineteenth-century exchanges, we investigate how these interactions extend
                        through the twentieth century and recalibrate the cultural balance between
                        the Hispanic and the Anglophone spheres.</p>
                    <p>Featuring paired essays on Byron, Shelley, and Keats, we trace afterlives
                        anchored around the three major second-generation poets. Their points of
                        connection with the Luso-Hispanic world are prominent writers of the
                        nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose intellectual curiosity and
                        cosmopolitanism bridge the British Isles with Central and South America, as
                        well as with Spain. The following studies compose a collection of echoes,
                        reflections, and translations of the English Romantics in Spanish and
                        Portuguese. The works of José Marmol, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo,
                        Martín Zapata, Luis Cernuda, Alejo Carpentier, Jorge Luis Borges, and Julio
                        Cortázar constitute the tiles of this multicolored mosaic.</p>
                    <p>Given the historical asymmetry of the political and historical relations
                        between Spain, Latin America, and the British Empire, one common strand that
                        emerges among the articles is how these authors confront questions of
                        cultural marginality and belatedness. Contrary to the assumptions of most
                        Anglophone readers, the theme of marginality in the Latin American
                        afterlives of English Romantic writers is not necessarily one of Eurocentric
                        exclusion or rejection. The Latin American works studied in these essays are
                        defined neither by imitative idolatry nor a sense of colonial anxiety. On
                        the contrary, they present different strategies of cultural negotiation that
                        allow them to contest assumptions of subordination or respectful deference.
                        The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and Keats by Hispanophone authors are
                        marked by authority, whimsy, and adventure, often evoking a sense of playful
                        irreverence. These authors innovatively transform the works of their
                        predecessors through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links
                        of aesthetic closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their
                        chronological separation. Major figures like Borges, Cortázar, and
                        Carpentier also function as savvy critics of the English Romantic tradition;
                        they conscientiously position their writings within two literary traditions
                        with a full understanding of their historical, national, and generic
                        repercussions. Afterlives from these perspectives help to decenter the
                        Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study, helping to mitigate the exclusivity
                        of a field that centers an entire literary and cultural universe within a
                        span of fifty years on the British Isles. The various transformations of the
                        major British Romantic poets studied in these contributions conjure up new
                        figures with which to populate our familiar canon: an alternately dour or
                        ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares de Azevedo); a more pragmatic
                        Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats (Cortázar).</p>
                    <p>Our overdue recognition of the Latin-American reception of English Romantics
                        comes at a timely moment, particularly within the current political climate
                        of the United States, where the rhetoric is increasingly one of insular
                        nationalism and discrimination toward our Spanish-speaking neighbors. The
                        imperative to “speak English!” and only English in schools and public spaces
                        runs counter to the Romantic spirit of openness, imagination, and respect
                        for the rights of the individual. With this volume, we wish to demonstrate
                        the obvious: that the ability to work in neighboring languages only enriches
                        our research in the academy and injects life into our Anglophone canon.
                        Moreover, the work we value and make visible through publications and
                        teaching should recognize too the fundamental role that Latin American,
                        including Brazilian, authors played in the global production of Romantic
                        literary legacies. This rings especially true when an increasingly diverse
                        professoriate and graduate cohorts include many talented bilingual scholars
                        of Latin American descent. Beginning with the content of our research, we
                        envision an academia in which fluency in Spanish is viewed as an asset in
                        comparative Romantic studies on an equal plane with proficiency in German,
                        French, and Italian.</p>
                    <p>While developments in World Literature studies have called for a shift away
                        from an assumed Anglocentrism, made evident in manifestos such as Aamar
                        Mufti’s <title level="m">Forget English!</title>, we suggest that these
                        sentiments apply, ever so counterintuitively, to the field of British
                        Romantic studies. To propose that English Romanticists might turn away from
                        English is not an unfounded proposition. As C.C. Wharram asked in his 2014
                        preface, <title level="a">Objects of Translation(s),</title> “Why do we
                        decide in advance that ‘British’ necessarily entails the elimination of all
                        voices not originating in British and in English?” Suh-Reen Han’s <title

                            >English Romanticism in East Asia</title> answers this call, extending
                        Romantic studies to a global scale, showcasing the skills of bilingual
                        scholars who engage deeply in historical study and close readings in
                        Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. These essays help studies in “foreign”
                        languages find a home under the aegis of our discipline. Special issues of

                        Romanticism into regions that force recognition of the most uncomfortable
                        corners of our literary tradition (Youngquist and Pace; Youngquist and
                        Botkin; Chander and Matthew). This courageous scholarship transcends
                        geographic, national, and racial borders with an ear bent towards historical
                        justice. It demonstrates that Romantic studies need not remain divorced from
                        efforts in modernist, Americanist, and medieval literary studies to resist
                        an exclusive and exclusionary Anglocentric impetus&#8212;that Romanticism’s
                        privileging of the Big Six need not preclude global scholarship. We now
                        raise this challenge to scholars who might combine the transatlantic
                            <emph>and</emph> the translingual, encouraging multilingual researchers
                        who can help locate the legacy of Romanticism today in what used to be
                        unforeseen pockets of the globe. This collection serves as an invitation for
                        further research into Latin American afterlives of the Romantic writers,
                        promoting the scholarship of yet undiscovered translations, adaptations, and
                        responses that will continue to expand the transatlantic canon.</p>

                    <p>The first essay of the volume begins broadly and on a celebratory note,
                        exploring ideas of Romantic celebrity and the international circulation of
                        personality in the southern hemisphere. In <title level="a">Latin America’s
                            Byron,</title> Stephen and Jordan Hart explore ways in which Latin
                        America and English Romanticism “clashed and overlapped during the
                        nineteenth century” in their portrayals of Lord Byron. They trace how
                        Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José
                        Mármol, who recontextualized the character of Manfred in an Argentine
                        setting, and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, who
                        projects a Don Juan figure in his Portuguese poems. This study offers a
                        glimpse into the fervid Byromania spreading amongst young intellectuals in
                        the Southern Cone. Hart and Hart propose that Byron’s image was ultimately
                        viewed in Latin America through a diversifying <emph>chiaroscuro</emph>
                        effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was “luminous and ethereal,” while
                        Brazil’s Byron was “dark and brooding.” But this influence exerted by Byron
                        was not unidirectional. Indeed, the essay concludes by suggesting ways in
                        which Simón Bólivar served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both
                        literary freedom and political independence.</p>
                    <p>We continue tracing Byron’s afterlives with a translation study by Juan Jesús
                        Payán, who bypasses the more obvious Hispanic connections of <title
                            level="m">Don Juan</title> to focus on the lingering imprint of Byron’s
                        Gothic valences instead. <title level="a">Translative Vampires: Martín
                            Zapata and the Early Fate of <title>The Giaour</title></title> explores
                        the often unfaithful translations of Byron’s <title level="m">The
                            Giaour</title> into Spanish, especially in light of their prosification
                        and importation across genres. Focusing on a short narrative adaptation by
                        the Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, Payán shows how the very
                        choice of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> as his source material, in the
                        context of Argentine intellectual and political tensions, was a daring
                        statement unto itself. Comparing this to previous renderings of Byron’s
                        works into the Spanish language&#8212;both in Spain and in Latin
                        America&#8212;Payán highlights the exceptionality of Zapata’s version,
                        pointing out that the Argentine was the first to provide a direct adaptation
                        from the original text, and also the only one to truly preserve the vampiric
                        elements of the plot. Performing a political reading, Payán understands
                        Zapata’s translation as an element of disruption that challenges the
                        divisions between “Civilization” and “Barbarism” upheld by his contemporary,
                        Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Complicating the Orientalist paradigm because it

                    <p>We move from translation to adaptation in Omar F. Miranda’s <title level="a"
                                ><title level="m">Prometeo Desencadenado</title>: The Translation of
                            Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> in the
                            Spanish-American Tradition.</title> This essay unpacks the Shelleyan
                        inspiration and thematic echoes in a well-known classic by the Cuban
                        novelist, Alejo Carpentier. In his reevaluation of <title level="m">Los
                            pasos perdidos</title>, Miranda traces the Hispanophone afterlife of one
                        of Shelley’s more difficult works. Revivified in the postmodern imagination
                        of Carpentier, the drama of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is
                        recast in New York City, Caracas, and the South American jungle, combining
                        elements of mystical settings, lyric, dramatic style, and philosophic
                        attempts at “reversing human error.” This novel, written in Venezuela in
                        1950 and considered a precursor to magical realism, is, Miranda argues,
                        “perhaps one of the most earnest and profound engagements with Shelley’s
                        text since the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century.” This
                        statement is supported by the relative dearth of Spanish-language receptions
                        of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, in both Spain and Latin
                        America, which for nearly two centuries has only seen partial translations
                        and even fewer adaptations. Miranda contextualizes his analysis of <title
                            level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> by turning to an article from 1922
                        in the radical Venezuelan newspaper <title level="j">El Universal</title>,
                        which commemorates the centenary of Shelley’s death. This column, written by
                        Edouard Herriot, who eventually became prime minister of France, praises
                            <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> and venerates Shelley for
                        his “current” and “eternal” poetic ideals. Besides these two homages by
                        Herriot and Carpentier, Latin American afterlives of this closet drama are
                        sparse. Adding to the fact that <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                        was not translated in full into Spanish until 1994, Miranda’s research
                        reaffirms the surprising belatedness of the Hispanophone reception of
                        Shelley’s text.</p>
                    <p>In the fourth essay of this volume, <title level="a">Toward Unity: Cernuda
                            and English Romanticism,</title> Gabriel Insausti presents a capacious
                        study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and his poetic appropriation of the
                        English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A member of the Generation of
                        '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War to deliver
                        lectures at Oxford and Cambridge; he traveled to Glasgow, Cambridge, and
                        London through 1947; and finally settled in Mexico, never to return to
                        Spain. As an exile in Scotland and England, his writing, criticism, and
                        translations felt the influence of Shakespeare, Blake, Wordsworth,
                        Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Browning, and Eliot. In his essay, Insausti
                        pinpoints a Cernudian reading of Romanticism that raises problems unique to
                        his geographical positioning and literary historical moment: The Spanish
                        poet encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the
                        era, negotiating questions of poetry’s ethical value and pertinence during
                        an era of modern warfare. Reading <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry</title> and echoing Shelley a century later, Cernuda asks, “What
                        is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” he decides, “but also has certain
                        social effects.” A poet and translator himself, Insausti offers an
                        encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own
                        poetics, negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while
                        balancing his Romantic interests against contemporary Modernist
                        pressures.</p>
                    <p>Our volume ends with two contributions featuring the afterlife of John Keats
                        in Latin America. Marco Ramírez Rojas focuses on the poet’s reception and
                        critical influence through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar,
                        two great giants of Argentine letters. In <title level="a">Keatsians in
                            Argentina: Borges’s Nightingale and Cortázar’s Chameleon,</title>
                        Ramírez argues that both writers depicted and identified Keats as a
                        misunderstood figure who needed to be rescued by their intervention. In this
                        vein, they seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own intellectual
                        community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” This
                        focus on Argentina as a major site of literary transmission for Keats is
                        historically interesting, considering the high rates of European immigration
                        to the country in the nineteenth century and the accompanying nostalgia for
                        British literature, encouraged by a “sort of pro-British snobbery” that
                        pervaded Buenos Aires high society. Ramírez’s reading of Borges’s 1952 essay
                            <title level="a">Keats’s Nightingale</title> stages, through a
                        philosophical defense of Keats, a petition for appropriating Keats into a
                        Latin American space that is presented as more suitable for understanding
                        the Romantic poet. The second half of this essay explores the lengthy
                        creative treatise titled <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> by
                        Cortázar, in which Ramírez theorizes the role of the biographer as a
                        chameleon figure. Through his deep identification and sense of camaraderie
                        with Keats, Cortázar overlaps temporalities with the poet and meets him in a
                        shared “Latin American time” with strong political implications. Cortázar’s
                        connection to Keats emulates the ideas of Negative Capability and the
                        chameleon figure, mirroring a state of poetic annihilation and
                        self-identification.</p>
                    <p>The final essay of the collection, by Olivia Loksing Moy, offers a closer
                        look at <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>, Cortázar’s literary
                        biography from the 1950s. <title level="a">To Carry Keats in Your Pocket:
                            Julio Cortázar’s Everyman Poet</title> explores the amphibious nature of
                        a book that oscillates between a rigorous work of criticism and a playful
                        work of fiction that defies all traditional classifications. Borrowing from
                        Cortázar’s short fiction, Moy uses the models of playing hopscotch and
                        blowing up photos to explain the work of a poet-critic that has been
                        rendered inaccessible to scholarship due to two defining characteristics:
                        its transtemporality and generic hybridity. It is her contention that the
                        “merging of time and epochs” which brings Keats, Shelley, and Hunt together
                        with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine intellectuals is a clever strategy,
                        proposing a defiant sense of timeless contemporaneity. Building upon the two
                        models of playing “hopscotch” and “blow-up,” drawn from the titles of two of
                        Cortázar’s most acclaimed works, Moy shows how the narrative of <title
                            level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> skips around from year to year,
                        while also lingering and zooming in on key moments for biographical
                        exegesis. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for the biographer
                        to stage a direct dialogue with Keats and to personally inhabit a Romantic
                        universality, rendering the poet accessible to the Latin American
                        “everyman.” Stylistically and structurally, <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> also constitutes a novelty. Its “unprecedented merging of
                        fictional and non-fiction genres” includes the dense intertwining of poetic
                        devices, passages of free association and automatic writing, and an
                        overarching narrative structure. For Moy, the textual complexity of this
                        biography reflects a generic hybridity that draws from two lines of national
                        influence: Romantic poetry and the Latin American surrealist short story.
                        Cortázar consciously combines these two traditions without any anxiety of
                        influence. As he both showed and stated, Latin American literature, though
                        arriving a bit late, could “burst onto the literary scene” and enter
                        modernity “without all the baggage” of European literature (<title level="m"
                            >Literature Class</title> 31). By clarifying these aspects of
                        transtemporality and generic hybridity, Moy clears the path for further
                        investigations of <title level="m">Imagen</title>. Previously unavailable in
                        English translation, excerpts of <title level="m">Imagen de John
                            Keats</title> have now been published as a volume of Lost &amp; Found:
                        The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative. <title level="m">Julio y John,

                        Rojas, who are completing a full critical translation of the text.</p>
                    <p>Each of the essays in this volume present a reworking of Bloomian influence
                        that has traditionally guided landmark transatlantic studies, such as Robert
                        Weisbuch’s <title level="m">Atlantic Double-Cross</title>. Earlier models of influence theory
                        unwittingly undergird binaries of an original and inferior copy, which in
                        the context of artists working across lines of race and nation can also
                        reinforce racist rationales of canonicity. These essays all consider
                        binaries, but ultimately explode or complicate them: Hart and Hart’s
                        engagement of light and dark, or <emph>chiaroscuro</emph>; Payán’s with
                        “Civilization and Barbarism”; Miranda’s with notions of the city and jungle;
                        Insausti’s with <foreign xml:lang="sp">la realidad y el deseo</foreign>;
                        Ramírez’s with center and periphery; and Moy’s with past and present,
