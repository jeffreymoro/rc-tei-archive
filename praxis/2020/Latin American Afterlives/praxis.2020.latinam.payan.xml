                    prosification and importation across genres. Focusing on an adaptation by the
                    Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, it contextualizes this afterlife
                    within Argentine intellectual and political tensions. Zapata was the first to
                    provide a direct adaptation from the original text, and also the only adaptor
                    to truly preserve the vampiric elements of the plot. When read through a postcolonial

                    the binary categorizations of good/evil, East/West, and modernity/backwardness in the

            <p>Vampires arrived late to the feast of
                    Romanticism in Latin America. As they roamed the Old World, few echoes of their
                    presence reached the shores of the New World.<note place="foot" resp="author">The
                        overall consensus on this point is
                            exemplified by Sardiñas, Glantz, Gordillo, and Martínez Díaz. We can
                            deem José María Heredia’s translation of <title level="a">The Bride of Corinth</title> (1797)
                            by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1829, as the first example
                            of vampire literature in Latin America.</note> Only from the turn of the century onward, after
                    <foreign xml:lang="sp">modernismo</foreign>,
                    did vampires become known and feared guests in the pages of influential writers,
                    such Horacio Quiroga and Rubén Darío, or even later with Julio Cortázar and
                    Carlos Fuentes. The twentieth century saw the consecration of vampire literature
                    in Latin America. However, this acclimatization could not have been possible
                    without the role carried out by translators during the nineteenth century.
                    “Translation” in the context of this discussion recovers its etymological
                    meaning, since it not only conveys the transference between languages, but also
                    of spatial dissemination, as an import “transferred” or “carried out” from one
                    place to another, from Europe to the Americas. <note place="foot" resp="author">It
                        must be noted that in this article, I deal with Romantic representations of
                        vampires in the Modern era. I do not take into consideration pre-Colombian
                        motifs such as <foreign xml:lang="sp">tlahuelpuchi</foreign> or the
                        <foreign xml:lang="sp">teyollohcuani</foreign>, which, only in hindsight, have been linked to the
                            vampire tradition (Maberry 277, Kallen 23–24, Doan, 138–139; Martín del
                            Campo, 108–109).</note></p>
            <p>Current critical assessments have tended to overlook translations as part of the output
                of vampiric literature, leading to an incomplete picture of its growth in the Hispanic
                context. However, even in studies where translations are noted as progressive steps in
                its adoption by Latin American authors, the absence of Spanish translations of George
                Gordon, Lord Byron, is striking. Considering the central role of Byron in the vampiric
                craze during the Romantic era, stemming both from the association of his public persona
                to this mythical monster and the long-lasting misattribution of John Polidori’s canonical
                tale, a proper study of translations of Byron seems necessary to articulate a more
                comprehensive and accurate historicization of early stages of this subgenre in Latin
                America. This article aims at correcting this lacuna by analyzing the significance of
                the first available Spanish translation of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                by the Argentine politician Martín Zapata Coria (1811–1861).</p>
            <p>In order to fully appreciate the innovative nature of <title level="m">El Giaur</title>
                [<emph>sic</emph>] by Zapata,<note place="foot" resp="author">Throughout this article we will keep Zapata’s
                            misspelling of the title (<emph>Giaur</emph>) to differentiate between
                            references to his translation and those to Lord Byron’s original.</note> I will
                start by exposing the many challenges that the original source (and vampire literature in general)
                had to face in its transfer to a Latin American context. Subsequently, I will analyze the most
                significant features and stylistic choices of the translator’s rendition. Finally, I will argue
                why Zapata’s contribution can be interpreted as a counter-discourse to Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s
                formulation of <title level="a">Civilization and Barbarism.</title> As important as his role as a
                translator was, no less fascinating is Zapata’s implicit position in narratives of progress and
                modernity that characterized the political arena of nineteenth-century Argentina. As James Cisneros
                hints in passing, Byron’s worldview contrasted greatly with the most dogmatic formulations of
                <title level="a">Civilization and Barbarism</title> (251), which presented a black-and-white
                agenda for progress in Argentina. By bringing to the fore a text that strayed beyond
                socially-prescribed boundaries concerning morals and modernity, Zapata forced his readers to
                question the simple binaries so fervently sustained at the time.</p>

            <head>I. <title level="m">The Giaour</title> by Byron: A Challenging Visitor to the Americas</head>
            <p>Before delving into the historical coordinates that informed Byron translations prior to Zapata’s
                rendition, it is worth reviewing the plot and main features of <title level="m">The
                Giaour</title>. T.S. Eliot provides an insightful summary of the poem:
                <quote>
                    A Christian, presumably a Greek, has
                    managed, by some means of which we are not told, to scrape acquaintance with a
                    young woman who belonged to the harem, or was perhaps the favorite wife of a
                    Moslem named Hassan. In the endeavor to escape with her Christian lover, Leila
                    is recaptured and killed; in due course the Christian with some of his friends
                    ambushes and kills Hassan. We subsequently discover that the story of this
                    vendetta&#8212;or part of it&#8212;is being told by the Giaour himself to an elderly priest,
                    by way of making his confession. (227–28)
                </quote>
            Eliot efficiently outlines the story here; however, in what would become a classic move in frequent
            receptions of the text in the Hispanic world, he significantly skips any mention of the vampire
                    subplot.<note place="foot" resp="author">This move could
                            be attributed to a wide range of reasons, including the relatively
                            independent character of the supernatural episode within the rest of the
                            poem.</note> As the Christian protagonist kills Hassan, the latter invokes a curse
                upon him that prophesies the ultimate transformation of the protagonist into a vampire. This
                episode is limited to thirty lines, and runs, depending on the edition, from approximately
                line 755 to line 786. Due to its length, I provide here the most substantial excerpt from the full passage:

            Despite early associations between the poet and the literary vampire, this segment
                    encapsulates the only explicit contribution by Byron to this Gothic
                    theme.<note place="foot" resp="author">As Derek Flitter points out, the Romantic
                        fervor about Byron’s works was initially linked to his image as a leading
                        cultivator of the sublime (135). Interestingly, the association between the
                        English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly in the Spanish
                        language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of Byron
                        in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the
                        first Peninsular translation of Polidori’s <title level="m">The
                        Vampire</title> to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian editorial house of Librería
                        Americana, this misattribution reoccurs in 1829, consolidating the vampiric mark
                        as one of the main features of Byron’s writing during the first process of reception
                        of his works.</note> From that celebrated encounter at Villa Diodati where John
                Polidori, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Clair Clairmont gathered in Geneva during
                the Year Without Summer of 1816, only one text by Byron has survived&#8212;<title level="a">The
                    Fragment of a Novel,</title> later included in the publication of <title level="m">Mazeppa</title>
                in 1819 (Aquilina, 27–30; Glantz 5). Yet, considering the inchoate and truncated nature of
                this narrative, it would be arguable to consider it within the canon of vampire literature at
                all. Furthermore, Byron would later (in most likelihood embittered by the attribution of
                Polidori’s tale) forcibly remove himself from any association with those iconic bloodsucking
                monsters: “I have . . . a personal dislike to ‘Vampires,’ and the little acquaintance I have
                with them would by no means induce me to divulge their secrets” (<title level="a">Letter of
                    Lord Byron</title> 151). In brief, despite the strong association between Byron and the
                vampiric theme, the aforementioned passage in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> remains his
                sole explicit contribution to this lineage.</p>
            <p>Among the varied facets deserving attention in this narrative poem, I would like to briefly
                highlight some key aspects of the original that are useful in measuring the worth of Martín
                Zapata’s translation. To begin, <title level="m">The Giaour</title> offers an intriguing
                complication of the orientalist paradigm, as it casts the Christian lover through Eastern
                eyes. By framing the main character as a representation of the West, as a <emph>Gavur</emph>
                or “infidel,” the poem takes the perspective of the traditional Other. The protagonist is
                framed by the gaze of the East. As the text shifts the focus from comfortable exoticization
                of the oriental subject to a matter of perspective, it could be argued that Byron problematizes,
                to some extent, the “geographical binaries” that legitimized European colonialism (Rangarajan 55).
                In <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, it is precisely the representation of the West that is
                continuously subjected to scrutiny and suspicion. Certainly, as postcolonial critic Padma
                Rangarajan has pointed out, this inversion of perspectives is limited to “an audacious moment
                of colonial ventriloquism,” characteristic of some forward-thinking romantics (55). Yet this
                textual stance must have been deemed necessarily problematic by some audiences, especially in
                emergent Latin American republics such as Argentina, where models of modernity led to the
                excision of any non-Western elements as signs of presumed backwardness. In choosing 
                <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, Martín Zapata was implicitly placing himself in a
                    singular position among his intellectual peers.</p>
            <p>Adding to the complication of the orientalist paradigm,
                    we must add the uncharacteristic portrayal of the doomed-to-be vampire
                    protagonist. As a quintessential Byronic hero, <title level="m">The Giaour</title> is a somewhat
                    sympathetic Gothic villain doomed by fate to carry out death and destruction
                    upon his loved ones against his will (Thorslev 150–151). Departing from the
                    otherness inherently attached to some of the most recognizable vampires in
                    literary tradition (such as Sheridan Le Fanu’s <title level="m">Carmilla</title>
                or Bram Stoker’s <title level="m">Dracula</title>), Byron’s cursed Giaour evinces a complex character,
                    neither entirely innocent nor completely guilty. Therefore, the text elicits the
                    monster within us all, the vampire we might become when touched by ill fate and
                    the unbridled thirst of vengeance.<note place="foot" resp="author">It must be noted
                        that <title level="m">The Giaour</title>’s vampiric
                            transformation is merely shown though a prophecy and not in action. Its
                            vagueness forces the audience to determine, by the end of the story,
                            whether Hassan’s curse is or is not to blame for the unnamed sins
                            admitted in confession later on by the protagonist.</note> Again, as
                we will see, the moral ambiguity of Byron’s original could hardly fit well within
                the clear-cut distinctions aimed by progressive intellectuals such as Domingo
                Faustino Sarmiento (1811–1874), the future president of Argentina.</p>
            <p>Hispanic resistance towards Gothic horror and fantastic
                    supernaturalism adds an additional key to appreciating Zapata’s initiative as a
                    translator. According to José María Martínez, the institutional demands of the
                    emergent Latin American republics enforced a social-political inflection to
                    Romantic ideals that, along with the reawakening of the enlightened
                    instrumentalization of imagination, led most writers to postpone the use of
                    fantastic aesthetics (55–56). Until the end of the 1850s, and especially after
                    1860 (with the later impact of Edgar Allan Poe), is it difficult to trace a
                    quantitative and qualitatively stronger corpus of supernatural tales in Latin
                    America.<note place="foot" resp="author">Following in the steps of Óscar Hahn,
                        scholars of the fantastic considered <title level="a">Gaspar Blondín</title>
                        (1858) by Juan Montalvo the first original supernatural tale in Latin America.
                        Although this position has been increasingly revised (Sandoval 13; López,
                        XI–XXXIX, 3–30; Morales, XXI; Martínez 55, n.41, 56–57; Abraham 35–37, 55–59,
                        60–106), the overall consensus is that the consolidation of the genre occurred
                        in the last third of the nineteenth century. This context would place Zapata’s
                        translation over a decade ahead of the peak of the fantastic trend.</note></p>

            <head>II. Martín Zapata, Translator of <title level="m">The Giaour</title></head>
            <p>In contrast to Sarmiento’s current
                    relevance in Latin American studies, very little is known nowadays of lawyer and
                    politician Martín Zapata. By the mid-nineteenth century, he was recognized as
                    one of the leading promoters of the Constitution of 1853, which, incidentally,
                    is still the base of the current Argentine juridical system (Lorenzo 220, 227).
                    Through brief and scattered political notes of the period, it is possible to
                    place Zapata among the liberal intellectuals who opposed José Manuel de Rosas,
                    the dictator who ruled Argentina between 1835 and 1852. Within this context,
                    Zapata’s path closely follows the steps of members of the “1837 Generation” such
                    as Juan Bautista Alberdi, Esteban Echeverría, or Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="author">It is worth noting the different approach to the fantastic by both
                        Echeverría (<title level="a">Elvira y la novia del Plata,</title> 1832;
                        <title level="m">Mefistófeles</title>, 1833), and Sarmiento (<title level="a">La
                            pirámide,</title> 1839 and <title level="m">Argirópolis</title>, 1850) and by
                        Zapata, via Byron. For Echeverría and Sarmiento, the fantastic appears through
                        visions and it is used either as a moral or political allegory (Abraham 91–99,
                        135–142).</note> Along with these notable writers, Martín Zapata would live as
                an exile in Chile and participate in frequent gatherings held in the capital, Santiago.</p>
            <p>In the years that preceded the translation of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>, Sarmiento
                and Zapata had a close relationship,<note place="foot" resp="author">This relation is
                    confirmed in letters of both authors, published in <title level="m">The Complete
                        Works</title> of Sarmiento (volumes XIII and XV).</note> as evidenced by their
                collaboration in <title level="m">Crónica Contemporánea de Sud-América</title>, a journal
                that led the opposition against Argentine dictator de Rosas. Despite its short run, with
                only four issues in 1841, <title level="m">Crónica</title> played a significant role in
                providing cohesion to a liberal unitarian party in risk of disbandment. Later political differences seem
                    to have broken the friendship between Sarmiento and Zapata soon after.
                    Nevertheless, by 1849, their relation must have remained strong. That year, in
                    an editorial headlined by Sarmiento’s confidant and son-in-law, Julio Belín,
                    Zapata published <title level="m">El Giaur</title> [<emph>sic</emph>] <title level="m">o el infiel: Fragmento de un cuento turco</title>.</p>
            <p>Starting with the title, <title level="m">El Giaur o el infiel</title> opens with a statement of
                his purpose of faithfulness: “Traducción literal del orijinal [<emph>sic</emph>] inglés.”<note
                    place="foot" resp="author">Zapata in his translation follows the new phonetic
                    orthography proposed by Sarmiento. Among its features, <emph>i</emph> is written
                    instead of <emph>y</emph>, <emph>j</emph> instead of <emph>g</emph>, the
                        silent <emph>h</emph> is eliminated, and new rules of accentuation are
                    applied.</note> Zapata presents his work as a literal translation from the English
                original, and, consequently, positions himself critically against previous undertakings
                of the work, elaborated solely from French sources and characterized by extreme poetic
                liberties. Early transmission of Byron’s works could not be understood without the role
                of the Parisian publisher Librería Americana-Decourchant. It was originally from France
                that the first major wave of his Spanish translations were made possible.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="author">Here I provide a careful record of the actual
                            census of Byron’s translations into Spanish. As Daniel G. Samuel pointed
                            out, the first complete and contradictory bibliographical records by
                            scholars Ernest Coleridge and Richard Churchman led to a long-lasting
                            confusion about what titles were actually translated into Spanish and
                            which ones were merely advertised, but never published. Fortunately,
                            proper systemization of records and recent digitalization of texts
                            provide me with enough direct access and cross-references to establish a
                            more accurate evaluation of the processes of reception and translation
                            of Byron’s works.</note> During this phase, thirteen titles were published:
                            <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (1827), <title level="m">The Bride of
                    Abydos</title> (1828), <title level="m">The Giaour</title> (1828), <title level="m">Lara</title>
                (1828), <title level="m">Mazeppa</title> (1828), <title level="m">The Siege of
                    Corinth</title> (1828), <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1829), <title level="m">Beppo</title>
                (1830), <title level="m">Manfred</title> (1830), <title level="m">The Prisoner of
                    Chillon</title> (1830), <title level="m">Oscar de
                    Alba</title> (1830), <title level="m">Parisina</title> (1830), and <title level="m">Odes to
                    Napoleon</title> (1830). Leaving aside the fragmentary renditions by Spanish-speaking intellectuals
                who lived in England during their time in exile (such as José María Heredia or Andrés Bello), early
                translations of Byron were made accessible through second-hand French versions, where taking extreme
                poetic license was a common practice. It is worth noting that <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                appears during this timeframe among Byron texts that traveled through Spain to some territories in
                Latin America. However, interest in this narrative poem would decline during the nineteenth century,
                as is demonstrated by the delay with which a second translation of the work would be undertaken by
                Zapata. Twenty years separated the first Spanish edition of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                in Paris (1828) and the first Latin American one in Chile
                    (1849).<note place="foot" resp="author">Between the editions of Paris and Santiago de Chile,
                        there were no translations of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Byron’s poem was rendered
                        in neither the Spanish Romantic journal <title level="j">El Europeo</title> nor the historical novel
                        <title level="m">Los bandos de Castilla</title> (<title level="m">The Bans of Castille</title>) by
                        Ramón López Soler, as was once stated. Instead of proper translations, during this period we
                        witness bastardized versions of the characters and main plot of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                        in Spain. The historical novel <title level="m">Kar-Osman, Memorias de la Casa de Silva</title>
                        (<title level="m">Kar-Osman, Memories of the House of Silva</title>) by Ramón López Soler from
                        1832 (Picoche 91), and the poetic diptych <title level="a">El infiel</title> by Juan Arolas from
                        1849 are examples of symbolic vampirization of the original source. Remarkably, both writers
                        obliterate any reference to the preternatural curse and vampiric transformation of the protagonist.
                        It is within this context that Martín Zapata’s first Latin American rendition of <title level="m">The
                        Giaour</title> in 1849 becomes a relevant <emph>tour de force</emph>, since it unapologetically
                        brings back the vampiric element of the original story.</note></p>
            <p>We must nuance Zapata’s initial stance as a faithful
                    translator, as his praxis is still rooted in the tradition of prosification,
                    frequently carried out in the Romantic era. It is important to remember that, in
                    the early stages of reception, Byron’s narrative poems were predominantly
                    rendered into prose. Not by chance, Spanish translations of the period are
                    commonly labeled as “novelas” (“novels”) or even “cuentos poéticos” (“poetic
                    tales”). As a result, this practice of prosification significantly altered the
                    horizon of expectations of the initial Spanish-speaking readership (Montesinos
                    64; Pegenaute <title level="a">La época romántica</title> 337, 343; Medina Calzada 148). Lord Byron’s
                    works were mostly associated in these early stages with the productions of a
                    novel writer or even those of a playwright. Despite the poetic recreations by
                    José María Heredia, Henrique de Vedia, or Manuel Cañete, translations in verse
                    were exceptions, undertaken only by a small number of daring authors during the
                    first half of the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="author">This article
                        makes use of the catalogue of Byron’s translations into Spanish in the nineteenth
                        century that I am currently developing. For this project, I consult editions
                        available in the National Library of Spain, Paris, Mexico and Buenos Aires, as
                        well as the World Cat database. As part of a work in-progress, evaluation of
                        the references stated herein are subject to revision.</note> Subsequently,
                versified translations of Byron would become increasingly common, especially toward
                the last third of the century.</p>
            <p>Zapata does not diverge from the practice of literary prosification, and in this particular
                aspect he does not stand out as a particularly original writer. However, in contrast to
                previous translations of Byron,<note place="foot" resp="author">In the Hispanic Americas,
                    the path to Romantic Byronism was led by Cuban poet José María Heredia during his years
                    of residence in Mexico. His impulse would soon be followed by Basque diplomat Henrique
                    de Vedia (“Parisina”) in the Argentine journal <title level="j">La Moda</title>, and
                    later by Andrés Bello and Antonio María Vizcayno. Still, by the mid century, translations
                    of Byron in Latin America were significantly scarce.</note> he seems especially guided by
                an impulse to better convey Byron’s lexical choices and poetry. It could be argued that the
                malleability of prose allows him to provide more accurate correspondences to the original,
                avoiding customary manipulations. The translator seems aware of the sacrifices that result
                from his decision, and compensates for the loss of rhyme and meter through a wise implementation
                of rhythm, which approximates his rendition to the formal experiments of prose poetry as
                practiced in France.<note place="foot" resp="author">To contextualize, <title level="m">Gaspar
                    de la nuit</title> by Aloysius Bertrand, a milestone in the

                            1842, only seven years before Zapata’s translation of Byron (Friebert
                            and Young, 17–21).</note></p>
            <p>Zapata also opts to organize <title level="m">El Giaur</title> in clear-cut chapters or sections. Instead of reproducing
                    the mosaic of mingling and interrupted perspectives of the original, he made use
                    of an explicit external structure. It is reasonable to suppose that the same
                    aspects that would attract the attention of modernist poets such as T.S. Eliot
                    in the twentieth century (fragmentation, elusiveness, disarticulation) must have
                    been perceived as a source of disorientation by audiences of the time. A similar
                    scenario must have occurred within the Spanish-speaking readership. Zapata
                    likely feared the risk of confusing his audience with the meandering
                    structure of the original. To guide his readership, he devoted individual
                    chapters to specific parts of the narrative poem. The addition of subtitles is
                    another of the strategies used by the Argentine to further his clarification of
                    the plot. In Zapata’s rendition, the story is divided into twelve chapters.</p>
            <p>Particularly relevant to our study of the
                    vampire theme is Chapter IX, <title level="a">The Curse</title> (20–21). There, Zapata compresses the
                    supernatural transformation of the protagonist. This chapter could be considered
                    in itself one of the first explorations of vampire literature in a Hispanic
                    context. The famous passage of vampirism by Byron quoted above reads this way in
                    Zapata’s translation:
                    <quote>
                    Tu cuerpo arrancado de su tumba i convertido en vampiro, habitará cual espectro
                    en tu tierra nativa i beberá la sangre de toda tu propia raza: allí, en la oscuridad
                    de la medianoche, arrancarás a tu hija, a tu esposa i a tu hermana la corriente de la
                    vida; i aunque te horrorice tu asquerosa bebida has de alimentar con ella tu lívido
                    cadáver. - Tus víctimas, antes de espirar, reconocerán al demonio por su deudo: i
                    maldiciéndote i maldecidos por ti, perecerán en la flor de su edad esos seres que te
                    son tan queridos. Pero una de ellas, la más joven, la más querida de todos, te llamará
                    con el nombre <emph>padre</emph>, i
                    esta palabra sagrada te destrozará el corazón…I tus crujientes dientes y
                    cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos, i volviéndote a tu
                    oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales
                    huirán de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos . . .

                    This excerpt exemplifies Zapata’s approach as a translator. Unable to
                    produce the rhythmic cadence of Byron’s pentameter and the alliteration
                    of English nasal and occlusive consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), he opts for a
                    different palette of sounds, but with the same effect in mind: horror.
                    For this purpose, Zapata makes a forceful, combined use of the alveolar
                    trill /r/ and nasal consonants (/m/, /n/) throughout the passage. These
                    are some of the clearest examples of alliteration: <foreign xml:lang="sp">arrancado, convertido,
                    raza, arrancarás, corriente, horrorice, alimentar, cadáver,
                    espirar, reconocerán, flor, cárdenos, rabiarás, porque,
                    infernales, horrorizados</foreign>. These abundant examples illustrate the
                intentionality of the author. The taps and trills, so characteristic of the Spanish
                /r/, help provide this scene with a sense of urgency and aggression, while the nasal
                sounds provide a background tension that suitably convenes the tremendous curse
                invoked upon the protagonist.</p>
            <p>Since Zapata does not count with the power of meter that emphasizes the fateful metric
            <emph>ostinato</emph> of the original, he has to supply other means to this end. The use
                of polysyndeton in relatively long sentences contribute to exacerbate the tension
                until its climatic resolution, with the curse of the protagonist:
                “<emph>I</emph> tus crujientes dientes <emph>y</emph>
                cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos,
                <emph>i</emph> volviéndote a tu oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás
                desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales huirán
                de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos”
                (21; emphases added). As if these formal means of expression were
                not sufficient, Zapata resorts to a hyperbolic use of punctuation.
                The translator not only multiplies the exclamation marks of the
                original, but also inserts two complete lines of periods or suspension
                points. Whether these signs are a representation of an unutterable
                horror or a sudden break of the narrative is open to interpretation.
                What remains clear is Zapata’s effective intention of producing an
                intense shock in his audience. Despite its brevity and translative
                character, this chapter of <title level="m">El
                Giaur</title> represents one of the wildest and more explicit expressions
                of Gothic sensibility in nineteenth-century Latin American literature.</p>
            <p>In the context of Argentine political discussions, the timing of Zapata’s translation makes his
                    production particularly intriguing. By the 1830s, Byron was certainly deemed by
                    the Argentine intellectual establishment (Esteban Echeverría, José Mármol, and
                    Juan Bautista Alberdi) a cornerstone of the Romantic pantheon of foreign
                    authors. However, by the 1840s, these sentiments were starting to recede, and
                    discussions about the pertinence of Romanticism would be abundant. It is
                    therefore surprising to note how Zapata’s publication straddles the fence of the
                    first two extremely influential editions of Sarmiento’s <title level="m">Facundo: Civilization y Barbarie</title> (1845, 1851).</p>
            <p>In its most basic tenets, <title level="m">Facundo</title> aims at fostering a model
                of Western progress though critical representations of backwardness, embodied in the
                portrayal of gaucho leader Juan Facundo Quiroga. Along the way, Sarmiento delineates
                a clear-cut opposition between two antithetical cultural realities: the presumed
                signifiers of barbarism (indigenous peoples, <emph>gauchos</emph> or mixed-race cowboys,
                and Spaniards); and those of Western Modernity (associated with the US, UK and France).
                Furthermore, he does not hesitate to equate the <emph>gauchos</emph>’ uncivilized
                character with nomadic subjects of the Middle East. His “otherizing” exoticism
                is unabashedly grounded in racist prejudice:

                    Let’s not even talk about physiognomies: I have met some Arabs who I swear I
                    have seen in my country. (<title level="m">Facundo</title> 28 n. without number; my translation)

                        monotony…The barbarian is bodily insensitive, as he is <emph>less prompt to

            <quote>
            It is necessary to see those closed-bearded faces, those grave and serious countenances,
            such as in the Asian Arabs, to judge the compassionate disdain that inspires their
            contemplation of the sedentary man of the cities. (14, my translation)
            </quote>
            Sarmiento’s depiction of countrymen and that of Orientalized subjects are one and the same.
            Within his social imaginary, Arabs and <emph>gaucho</emph> people represent closed-mindedness
                (“less prompt to reflection”) and non-urban backwardness. Certainly, Sarmiento’s
                internal contradictions deserve a more complex analysis than I am able to provide
                here.<note place="foot" resp="author">For this purpose, Noe Jitrik’s considerations
                    of the internal contradictions of <title level="m">Facundo</title> and Carlos
                    Alonso’s examination of Sarmiento’s passionate incongruities are still
                    relevant.</note> Yet, for the interests of my argument on the innovative character of
                    <title level="m">El Giaur</title>, it is striking that Zapata decided to publish and
                translate a story where those precise boundaries (Good-Evil, East-West) were forcibly
                blurred and problematized. Within the context of Sarmiento’s binary ideology, Zapata
                provides an indication of a more complex worldview, one in which the lines dividing
                <title level="m">Civilization and Barbarism</title> are harder to grasp. Considering
                the later disagreements between both writers, Sarmiento and Zapata, it is possible to
                see in the publication of <title level="m">El Giaur</title> a foreshadowing of their
                later differences.</p>

            <head>III. After Martín Zapata</head>
            <p>The consecration of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> in the Spanish-speaking world as a
                major text in the Byronic canon would take time. Byron’s first Oriental poem was not
                translated again into Spanish until 1864, after almost another twenty years. Continuing
                the interest awakened by Zapata’s translation, Argentine poet Pedro Espinosa, known as
                “Espinillo,” took the responsibility of being the first to provide a versified rendition
                of <title level="m">The Giaour</title>. Unfortunately, the little booklet did not achieve
                much attention and currently sits in the National Library of Buenos Aires, a testimony to
                the ephemeral attraction that this poem had in Argentina during the nineteenth century.
                From this point forward, interest in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> would spark in
                other geographies. After a second translation in verse by José Núñez de Prado y Fernández
                (1824–1894) included in <title level="m">Lord Byron: tres poemas puestos en verso
                castellano</title> (Spain, 1885), the tragic parable of the Greek Christian lover transformed
                into a vampire would resume his journey to Perú and Cuba. Almost concomitantly, two notable
                translators, José Arnaldo Márquez (Peru, 1832–1903) and Francisco Sellén (Cuba,1836–1907)
                issued the most notable renditions in verse to date of <title level="m">The
                Giaour</title>. The individual efforts of Núñez, Márquez, and Sellén draw a new afterlife
                of the Byronic text, one in which translations from the original English source are conveyed
                through classical diction and meter (such as combinations of seven- and eleven-syllable lines),
                but with an unmistakable Gothic flair.</p>
            <p>As Vicente Quirarte beautifully reminds us, “The Vampire cannot enter / unless we open the window”
                (<title level="a">Elogio del vampiro</title>, lines 4–5; my translation). In the discontinuous
                life of <title level="m">The Giaour</title> in the Spanish language, Martín Zapata signaled a
                moment of openness that not only spread a more comprehensive understanding of Lord Byron’s works,
                but also led to the acclimatization of the vampire and prose poetry in Latin America. Before the
                powerful vampiric stories by Horacio Quiroga, Rubén Darío, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes,
                there was once <title level="m">El Giaur o el infiel</title>, fathered by an almost forgotten
                Argentine writer. With the broad historical perspective that we hold today, we can see how
                Zapata’s rendition put in motion the interest in <title level="m">The Giaour</title> and
                planted the seeds for the current cultivation of the vampire theme in contemporary Spanish
                and Latin American fiction. This article aimed at doing justice to his contribution, while
                underlining the subversiveness implicit in the timing of his publication. Within the stark
                coordinates of Argentine debates of the period, where little tolerance was given to ambiguity,
                Zapata’s choice carries a strong political stance. Today, as we read <title level="m">El
                Giaur</title>, the same delightful chill that readers felt at the time comes back to us, to
                excite our fear and confront us with our prejudices once again.</p>
