            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This essay presents a study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and
                    his poetic appropriation of the English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A
                    member of the Generation of '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 to deliver lectures
                    at Oxford and Cambridge, traveling to Glasgow, Cambridge, London, and the United
                    States before finally settling in Mexico. As an exile in Scotland and England,
                    Cernuda encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the
                    era, negotiating questions of poetical ethics and pertinence during an era of
                    modern warfare. Reading <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> and echoing Shelley a century later,
                    he asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” Cernuda decides, “but
                    also has certain social effects.” This essay offers an encompassing view of how
                    Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own poetics, negotiating an English
                    tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing his Romantic interests against
                    contemporary Modernist pressures.</p>

             <head>The Fruit of Exile</head>
            <p>Luis Cernuda arrived in Great Britain in March 1938, with
                    the lure of a series of lectures that the poet Stanley Richardson had promised
                    to organize for him to escape the dangers of the Spanish Civil War. He remained
                    in Glasgow until 1943, in Cambridge until 1945, and in London until 1947,
                    whereupon he made his way to Massachusetts, always working in educational and
                    university institutions. His stay in these English-speaking countries would be
                    extremely fruitful: during this time the poet wrote numerous essays, several
                    volumes of poems, a collection of short stories, and two books of prose poems
                    (<title level="m">Ocnos</title> and <title level="m">Variaciones sobre tema mexicano</title>).</p>
            <p>The first thing the years spent in England gave to Cernuda
                    was his knowledge of the English language.<note place="foot" resp="author">According
                        to testimonies of his years in Glasgow,
                        his English skills were underdeveloped. However, it is fair to assume that
                        with time, and despite his shyness, Cernuda's linguistic skills in this
                        language improved.</note> A glance at the texts written during his exile allow the
                reader to recognize a loss of familiarity with the natural turn of phrases in oral Spanish.
                His grammatical constructions abound in unusual expressions and anastrophes and it is very
                common to find in his writings the use of Anglicisms and linguistic loans. A second element
                to be highlighted is the choice of reading materials. During his first stay at Cranleigh
                School, Cernuda began to read Shakespeare, Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Housman.
                Along with the Bible and the Spanish Golden Age classics, the English poets would always
                be present in his personal library. A third component acquired as a result of the years
                spent in England and the United States was the opportunity to engage in the translation
                of canonic works of the English literary tradition. Cernuda undertook the translation of
                two sonnets by Wordsworth, <title level="a">The Definition of Love</title> by Marvell,
                <title level="a">A Toccata of Gallupi’s</title> by Browning, <title level="a">Byzantium</title>
                by Yeats, and <title level="m">Troilus and Cressida</title> by Shakespeare. There are also
                indications that he was able to translate Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title>
                and Blake’s <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>. Finally, it must
                also be mentioned that he was able to acquire many of the aesthetic criteria and tools
                for engaging in literary criticism, a task that Cernuda cultivated profusely. Dryden,
                Johnson, Coleridge and Arnold&#8212;names that are also considered by T.S. Eliot among
                the most eminent literary critics&#8212;are some of the critics that he mentions most
                often in his writings.</p>
            <p>Of course, the critic to whom Cernuda probably paid most attention was Eliot himself,
                towards whom he harbored mixed feelings. On the one hand he admired his poetry but,
                on the other, he lost a certain impartiality in his judgment when his own verses were
                rejected from Eliot’s <title level="m">Faber &amp; Faber</title> collection.<note
                    place="foot" resp="author">The essay <title level="a">Goethe and Mr. Eliot,</title>
                    for instance, could be read as a direct attack on Eliot. This essay is a direct rebuttal
                    to Eliot’s <title level="m">Goethe, or the Sage</title> (1959). Cernuda also openly
                        contradicts Eliot in <title level="a">Baudelaire en el centenario de <title level="m">Las
                            flores del mal</title></title> (1959). However, the importance of Eliot as the
                        central point of English criticism for Cernuda is undeniable: all the
                        references made by Cernuda in his texts (Herbert Read, I. A. Richards, Lord
                        Houghton, Middleton Murry, Lowes, etc.) match those listed in Eliot’s
                    <title level="m">The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</title> and
                    <title level="m">On Poetry and Poets</title>.</note> In this regard it should not be
                forgotten that Cernuda’s stay in Great Britain coincides with a moment of definitive
                recognition for Eliot: the last years of <title level="m">The
                    Criterion</title>, his beginnings in theater with the successful
                    <title level="m">Murder in the Cathedral</title>, etc. and with the conclusive backing of the Nobel
                    Prize. In fact, I believe that at least three features of Eliot’s critique
                    attracted Cernuda’s approval: the thesis of <title level="a">Tradition and Individual
                    Talent</title>, according to which tradition is not inherited “naturally,” which was the
                    criterion that had guided Cernuda himself during his formative years and had led
                    him to expand his reading and to learn languages; the Eliotian “correlative
                    objective” that Cernuda translates as “equivalente correlativo” in
                    <title level="m">Historial de un libro</title>; and the idea that the only legitimate critic is the
                    poet himself, which was recognizably and perfectly embodied in Eliot. In any
                    case, there is no doubt that these years, and especially those spent in England,
                    left their mark on Cernuda. “Perhaps my stay there,” he would write to Edward
                    Wilson from America, “has been the richest phase of my life so far, if not as a
                    mold first, then as a refinement of what I took there with me."<note

                Part of this imprint, no doubt, was his reading of the English Romantic poets.</p>

            <head>The Areas of Shadow</head>
            <p>When Cernuda says that he learned a lot from English poetry, that his stay in England “completed”
                and “refined” what he had brought with him, he was being very precise. That being said, what did
                the poet “bring with him” when he arrived in England? What readings, teachings or references are
                to be found in his poetry from 1927 to 1938? It can be said that his trajectory prior to exile
                was a kind of journey against the current of time: he moved from the purism of <title level="m">Perfil del
                aire</title> (1927) to the surrealism of <title level="m">Un río, un amor</title> (1929) and
                <title level="m">Los placeres prohibidos</title> (1931); from there he shifted towards to the
                Becquerian Romanticism of <title level="m">Donde habite el olvido</title> (1933) and, finally,
                geared in the direction of the great European Romanticism, with the watchword of a neo-paganism
                inherited from the <emph>Greek Revival</emph> under the guidance of Hölderlin, in
                <title level="m">Invocaciones</title> (1935). In other words, our poet was already part of a
                Romantic family tree on the eve of his departure for England.</p>
            <p>The starting point of that Romanticism&#8212;a consequence and a response to eighteenth-century
                rationalism&#8212;was the drama of the splitting of consciousness and the thirst for unity.
                Hölderlin exclaimed at the beginning of his <title level="m">Hyperion</title> that the highest
                human aspiration was “to be one with all that is alive, to return to the whole of nature” (25),
                while Wordsworth encoded in his “<emph>Aeolian visitations</emph>” a hint of participation in
                the <title level="m">Spirit of Nature</title> which he reveals in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>.
                In <title level="m">Palabras antes de una lectura</title> (1935), Cernuda gives an account of his
                beginnings in poetry:
                <quote>
                The poetic instinct awakened in me with the sharpest
                    perception of reality, experiencing, with a deep impact, the beauty and
                    attraction of the surrounding world. Its effect was, somewhat similarly to what
                    happens with the desire that love produces, the painful and intense necessity to
                    rise up out of myself, drowning in that vast body of creation. What made this
                    desire even more agonizing was the tacit recognition of its impossible
                    satisfaction. (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602)<note

                </quote>
                I believe that with a touch of Freudian language (the
                    urgency of artistic creation as the sublimation of eroticism, the “desire for
                    death” as the path to reintegration into unity), it is easy to recognize in
                    these words the same melancholy that moved Hölderlin and Wordsworth: the urge
                    for communion with nature and the loss of a Kantian lost paradise of immediacy.
                    That is to say, that poetic writing would have in its origin the ascertainment
                    of this rift and would consist of an attempt (inevitably frustrated, suggests
                    Cernuda) to suture it. Poetry, once wrote Novalis, heals the wounds that
                    philosophy inflicts.</p>
            <p>If we look closely at this narrative of the origins, the Romantic affiliation clearly reappears. In
            <title level="m">Historial de un libro</title> (1958), for example, Cernuda refers to the first time
                he was pushed to write poetry: during his military service he went out on horseback around the
                outskirts of Seville every afternoon, and during one of these excursions “things appeared to me
                as if I were seeing them for the first time, as if I were entering and communicating with them for
                the first time, and this unusual vision, simultaneously provoked in me an expressive urgency, the
                urgency to tell of this experience” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 626). That was the same
                attitude that Coleridge had envisioned in his <title level="m">Biographia Literaria</title>,
                and also that of Wordsworth in his <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798), where this
                latter explains that the purpose of
                    poetry was “to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the
                    mind’s attention from the lethargy of custom,” which prevents us from seeing
                    everything anew. In short, this Romantic theorization of poetry would be an
                    intimation of the concept of “defamiliarization” that formalist criticism would
                    erect as the cornerstone of literary writing. However, as Cernuda had already
                    said, this attempt to take over the world by word of mouth was invariably bound
                    to frustration:
                    <quote>
                    I began to distinguish a simultaneous and opposite current
                    within me: towards reality and against reality, of attraction and hostility
                    towards what is real. Desire led me to the reality that offered itself before my
                    eyes, as if only by its possession could I attain certainty about my own life.
                    But like that possession I have never reached it except in a precarious way,
                    hence the opposite current of hostility to the ironic attraction of reality.
                    (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602)
                    </quote>
                    Hence, from this conflict, the title that presides over all his poetic work:
                    <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>. Again, a further development of Romanticism: the
                    inescapable tantalizing frustration in which Schopenhauer’s thought ends up. It
                    is not surprising to find that this expression of isolated subjectivity is
                    expressed through allegory. On this topic Philip Silver has observed that
                    allegory is the means by which isolated subjectivity with the environment and
                    nature is usually featured, given that&#8212;unlike the language of the symbols&#8212;it
                    presupposes a pause, a disjunction (<title level="a">Hacia</title>). Finally, this Romanticism had
                    closed ranks around a fundamental idea, that of imagination. This dimension
                    appears as an alternative to a scientific vision of the world, characteristic of
                    the eighteenth-century mentality. It is science that Hölderlin accuses of
                    “having ruined everything,” and it is through it that the poet has learned “to
                    differentiate myself fundamentally from what surrounds me, […] I have thus been
                    expelled from the garden of nature” (26). Wordsworth expresses this idea
                    memorably in <title level="a">The Tables Turned</title>:
                    <quote>

               With its analytical impulse and its proliferation of
                    distinctions, science would thus be reduced to a “scrutiny” of the physical
                    world.<note place="foot" resp="author">In fact, when in <title level="m">The Prelude</title>,
                        Wordsworth apostrophes his friend Coleridge (to whom the poem as a whole was dedicated), he does so

                            </quote></note> Against the inanimate mechanism, Wordsworth would pursue a
                personal and unitary experience of nature, in which something remains unobtainable through
                mere analysis. This idea of <emph>natura naturans</emph> and its correlation to the imagination
                as an invisible link between nature and the poet’s soul appears in the
                <title level="m">Ocnos</title> poem meaningfully entitled <title level="a">La naturaleza,</title>
                where Cernuda recalls a child’s proximity to the natural environment:
                <quote>
                What a joy when I saw the leaves break at last, and their
                    tender color, which by force of transparency almost seemed luminous,
                    accentuating the raised veins, darkened little by little with the strongest sap.
                    I felt as if He himself had worked the miracle of life, of awakening on the
                    fundamental earth, such a god, the form previously dormant in the dream of the
                    non-existent. (<title level="m">Poesía Completa</title> 554)
                </quote>
                This passage resonates with the Rousseauian mythology of childhood as well as with Wordsworth’s idea of
                <emph>vision and faculty divine</emph>, whose purest expression lies in that of a child's gaze.
                    It is only that this participation in the intimacy of nature takes place in the
                    past perfect and in the third person, as if the poet were inescapably distancing
                    himself from an experience he can no longer share, in a melancholic suggestion.
                    In any case, if Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley and Keats agreed on
                    something, over and above the nominalist differences, it was in vindicating that
                    the queen among the faculties, imagination, is capable of glimpsing a reality
                    superior to everyday life. Cernuda, who revels the Romantic imagination as the
                    source of the “individualistic attitude” and the “supremacy of the spirit”
                    characteristic of Romantic poets (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 271–72), is very close to this Romantic idea when he
                    affirms that the essence of the poetic problem “is the conflict between reality
                    and desire, between appearance and truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse
                    of the complete image of the world that we do not know, of the ‘divine idea of
                    the world that lies at the bottom of the appearance,’ according to Fichte’s
                    phrase” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602). On the other hand, on the marginal
                nature of this task, (the historic defeat of the Romantic amendment to the unilateralities
                of enlightened rationalism), our poet is not fooled: “Modern society, unlike those that
                preceded it, has decided to dispense with the inseparable mysterious element of life. Unable
                to explore it, society prefers to pretend not to believe in its existence. But the poet
                cannot proceed in this way and must count on that area of shadow and fog in life that floats
                around human bodies” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 602–4). The Cernudian melancholy therefore exudes a
                    quality that places it unequivocally in the tradition of high European
                    Romanticism. It also places it on the path of some sort of “reactionary” or
                    anti-modern trend: despite the attempt of modern scientificism to “disenchant”
                    the world&#8212;according to Weber, and later to Adorno and Horkheimer&#8212;the mystery in
                    life remains. And that means that the ultimate truth cannot be grasped through
                    reason, but through imagination.</p>

            <head>The Underlying Fire</head>
            <p>It is worth making a few comments on the significance of this Cernudian reception of
                English Romanticism. First, we must remember the obvious fact that Spanish Romanticism
                had historically been very weak and had not produced any noteworthy poet. This would make
                of Cernuda a sort of “late-yielding fruit,” apparently inactive in an outdated rhetoric,
                if it were not for his ability to recover elements of that rhetoric in order to build a
                relevant discourse. Secondly, it should be noted that at the time of this reception,
                Romanticism had been “dismissed” in the English literary officialdom, due to the
                anti-Romantic tirades that Pound, Eliot, and <emph>modernism</emph> in general had
                launched against the Wordsworthian tradition since the war years, in order to displace
                some Georgians who were contemplating the exhaustion of that tradition. Thirdly, when
                Cernuda assimilated the reading of the English Romantic poets, he did not take into
                account the revision that began with <title level="m">The Mirror and the Lamp</title>
                (1953) by M. H. Abrams. He could not have read either&#8212;as they were yet to be
                produced&#8212;the later interpretations of Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartmann, and Harold Bloom.</p>
            <p>The Cernudian reading of Romanticism dealt with authors
                    and works that had been subject to prejudice for decades. This was the case, for
                    instance of the Victorian dilemma between the aesthetes, Wilde, Pater, Rossetti,
                    etc., and moralists such as Carlyle, Arnold, and Morris, who tended to
                    assimilate the Romantic legacy to the first group in a biased vision that
                    amputated the Romantic message to the point of denaturing it. This was a dualism
                    that, as Raymond Williams observed, was the result of the false image of the
                    Romantic artist as an isolated aesthete in his individual solipsism
                    (30).<note place="foot" resp="author">A brief inspection is enough to refute
                        this: Blake introduced criticisms of labor exploitation and racism in his
                        <title level="m">Songs of Innocence</title>, developed a summary examination
                        of his own homeland in <title level="m">The Daughters of Albion</title>, and proclaimed
                        revolution in <title level="m">America</title>; Wordsworth incorporated his
                        autobiographical account of the march of European civilization in the
                        chapters on the French Revolution included in <title level="m">The
                            Prelude</title>; Coleridge went beyond the subject of defending rural life
                        in poems such as <title level="a">This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison</title> or
                        <title level="a">Frost at Midnight</title>; he expressed his disappointment at
                        the revolutionary phenomenon in <title level="a">France: an Ode</title> and
                        admonished England against its own social and political ills in <title level="a">Fears in Solitude</title>;
                        Shelley adopted an avowedly committed attitude with <title level="m">Queen
                        Mab</title> and <title level="m">The Mask of Anarchy</title>; and Keats, with
                        his ideas on empathy, taken from Hazlitt and moralists from the previous
                        century such as Shaftesbury and Adam Smith, advanced the modern poet's
                        ethical viewpoint.</note> Obviously, this dualism is indebted to the language of
                the Romantics themselves: think of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s fancy and imagination; or
                think of Coleridge’s distinction between reason and understanding; or think of the antagonism
                between reason and imagination in Keats’s <title level="a">Letters</title>; or
                    think of the all-pervading logics of dialectics in Blake, with the constant
                    struggle of Los and Urizen. How could Cernuda cope with that?</p>
            <p>The first half of the essay <title level="a">Pensamiento poético en la lírica inglesa del siglo
                    XIX</title> suggests that, according to Cernuda, the
                    temperament and "metaphysical position" of these poets is only understood
                    against the background of industrialization and rural exodus (and also, of
                    course, in the context of the English empiricist tradition). His particular
                    judgment on them confirms it: in Cernuda’s opinion, “the ethical intention is
                    evident in Wordsworth” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 295), while in Blake
                there would be a mystic and a revolutionary that our poet relates to the figures of
                Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Thus, far from sterile aestheticism or inane escapism,
                Romanticism could have an outcome in the form of civil responsibility. In <title level="m">Río vespertino</title>
                Cernuda states this in unmistakably Romantic terms when he declares that

            The revelation of the imagination is an alternative
                    reality to mere (and unsatisfactory) factuality. Contrary to what the doctrines
                    of the engaged artist proclaimed in the twentieth century, Cernuda’s civil
                    responsibility did not opt for a dissolution of individuality. The task of
                    challenging individualism, which in Byron or Shelley could reach the theatrical,
                    was only the starting point of the Romantic program. Cernuda seems to remember

                    What can the poet do for himself? Never before has society
                    reduced life to such narrow limits. Certainly, the poet is almost always a
                    revolutionary, at least I believe he is; a revolutionary who, like other men,
                    lacks freedom, but who, unlike them, cannot accept this imprisonment and who
                    runs into the walls of his prison countless times. (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 603)

            Poetry, in short, could constitute a sort of <foreign xml:lang="sp">ultima ratio</foreign>, and the
                poet would be characterized as a being defeated beforehand by the practical world that of mere
                efficiency, capitalism and <emph>Realpolitik</emph>. Moreover, Cernuda goes so far as to claim
                that in expressing man’s reaction to survive in a society where there is no room for him, Blake and Wordsworth
                    would be, even before Baudelaire, the first modern poets. Against this state of
                    affairs (that of “reality”), Cernuda opposes an ethical affirmation, that of
                    “desire,” which is once again Romantic, in the tributes to the figure of the
                    literary hero contained in poems such as <title level="a">F. G. L,</title>
                <title level="a">A Larra, con unas violetas,</title> and <title level="a">Góngora</title>
                among others. In these texts, the poet is shown in
                    constant confrontation with a hostile environment and political dissatisfaction
                    would form part of his case. "Poetry is not only useful," Cernuda deduces from
                    Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title>, "but also has certain social effects"
                (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 333). This is not to say that our poet is in favor of
                <emph>all</emph> the Romantic pronouncements in this sense, and in his reluctance we can
                see the shadow of the problems and the embarrassment that imprisoned the writer of the
                twentieth century&#8212;fundamentally, the urgency of taking sides but the reticence
                to a compromise that reduced his voice to a watchword. On Shelley, Cernuda observes that
                the primacy of action can be guessed in him, and only when this latter failed did the
                English poet make up his mind to use his forces differently&#8212;that is, in an exercise
                of writing that would be characterized as a substitute for real political activity. The
                result is a poetic theory that borders on propaganda, as can be seen in the letter to Thomas
                Love Peacock&#8212;written in Naples on January 26th 1819&#8212;, which Cernuda mentions:
                “I consider poetry,” Shelley said there, “to be very subordinate to morality and political
                science” (Shelley quoted by Cernuda 501). Despite the Victorian caricature, the poetics of
                political <emph>engagement</emph> were sometimes not too far from the Romantic sensibility.
                In fact, the Romantic poets were very often on the verge of preaching such a doctrine. And
                Cernuda, long before Williams stressed on this aspect, was quite right to underline the moral
                and political implications of some of these poems.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, this recovery of the ethical and political aspect of Romanticism had reached a
                remarkable milestone during Cernuda’s English years. In 1937 Stephen Spender&#8212;whom our
                poet met in a slightly unpleasant appointment recounted by Rafael Martínez Nadal (86–90)&#8212;published
                a book entitled <title level="m">Forward from Liberalism</title> (1937). What was Spender’s proposal?
                Between the “anti-heroic” myth of Auden’s generation and the new political urgency caused by the
                rise of fascism, which would lead Harry Pollitt to wish that with his trip to a Spain at war he
                would become “a new Byron,” Spender advocated for a development of the Romantic program. In his
                opinion, this program had been fenced in; it promoted social justice and an idea of the role of
                the writer that returned to Shelley's famous phrase that poets are "prophets" and "the unacknowledged
                legislators of the world."<note place="foot" resp="author">From <title level="m">A Defence of
                Poetry</title></note> The Cernudian poetry of exile&#8212;with its heroic recreation of the figure
                of the poet, its critical position in the face of events, its evaluation of the Spanish reality,
                and its historical examination of Spanishness, as well as the warmongering and capitalism that
                shake his host countries&#8212;corresponds with this definition.</p>
            <p>Of course, this does not mean that the totality of <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>
                fits within this Romantic image: modalities of discourse such as the doubling, the dramatic
                monologue, the culturalist piece, or the metaliterary poem of his last years point to other
                sources. What I want to highlight is that this consideration of Romanticism in all its breadth
                allows us to resolve the traditional dualism between the “Edenist” interpretation of the Cernudian
                work (the one defended by Philip Silver, according to which its fundamental meaning, with the
                “thirst for eternity” as the “unifying theme” (<title level="m">Luis Cernuda</title>
                48), corresponds to the Romantic argument of the expulsion from paradise) and the “ethicist”
                argument (the one fundamentally
                    advocated by Derek Harris (13–14), for whom, as time goes by, there is a
                    distancing "from the Romantic vision of the world" in Cernuda). Why? Because,
                    although it is true that the Edenist thesis (the evocation of paradise, and the
                    longing and the search for restitution, even if vicarious, through writing) is
                    almost exclusively based on <title level="m">Ocnos</title> and a few poems from
                    <title level="m">La realidad y el deseo</title>, if one considers Romanticism in
                    all its aspects, as I
                    have proposed here, the critical attitude is not excluded from the
                    characterization of the Cernudian character as "Romantic." On the other hand,
                    Paz's idea that our poet is "one of the few moralists that Spain has given," but
                    a moralist "who tests the systems of collective morality" (116), fits perfectly
                    into this model, which would provide a channel for Cernuda's temperamental
                    individualism. Of course, the idea of "spiritual biography" that accompanies the
                    ethicist thesis would be perfectly congruent with a Romanticism that, far from
                    the symbolist ideal of full autonomy, always preserves a knot between the poet
                    and the poem.</p>

            <p>How does this Cernudian Romanticism manifest in the poems? Of course, it is not difficult

                    the blackbird of <title level="a">Río vespertin</title> whose fate is “purer than that of man” seems
                    to be inherited directly from the nightingales of Coleridge and Keats, from
                    Shelley’s lark and from Wordsworth’s redbreast, and also reissues an eminently
                    Romantic theme such as the affirmation of the superiority of nature over art
                    (Poesía Completa 371); <title level="a">Violetas,</title> where the spiked flowers are for a moment
                    “norma para lo efímero que es bello” and “vivo embeleso en la memoria,”

                    recognizable, but also less anecdotal, insofar as they inform the whole of his
                    poetry of exile. To observe them (and to read in them a poetry of that
                    longed-for Romantic unity), one needs only to reread <title level="a">Cementerio en la ciudad,</title>

            One of the constants of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s poetry is a sense of expression that rejects the
                <emph>wit-writing</emph> of the Augustan poets: that association of wit&#8212;“For works may have
            more wit than does ‘em good, / As bodies perish through excess of blood,” Pope himself warned
            (303–4)&#8212;that in Coleridge's theory is linked to an "inferior" faculty, fantasy. Cernuda takes
            up this doctrine with no less constancy: in <title level="a">Tres poetas metafísicos</title> he warns
            that the predominance of wit was “a primary condition and instrument of imaginative creation” in
            seventeenth-century Spanish “conceptismo,” and that “under such a weight of associations the unique
            reality that the word supposes disappears as something annoying and useless” (<title level="m">Prosa
            I</title> 512). The verbal fireworks would have an irritating effect that subtracts their substantial
            reality from things. Hence the accusation of a “wit game” that Cernuda launches against Salinas and, in
            general, against much of the Spanish tradition. In the face of the rapid and startling succession of
            parts, Cernuda stressed the unity of the whole. The circularity of <title level="a">Cementerio en la
            ciudad,</title> where the fourth stanza picks up and places in time the scene of the first one, where
            every startling association is eluded to (except, slightly, in the adjectivization of the “clandestine
            dead”), points in that direction.</p>
            <p>This sense of expression was accompanied in the Lake poets by a very determined prosody: a discarding
            of the heroic couplet and a recovery of the Miltonic blank verse, which in the last century had seen
            notable attempts, such as Young’s <title level="m">Night Thoughts</title>. In Cernuda’s case, the search
            for a different musicality and a diffuse intensity, scattered throughout the whole poem, which does not
            privilege that moment of brilliance, is obtained in part from a similar attempt that resorts to a dialogue
            between grammatical unity and meter (that is, between the phrase and the sentence that strictly coincided
            with Pope, creating an effect of mere juxtaposition). The “sliding from one verse to another, which in
            Spanish I believe is called <foreign xml:lang="sp">encabalgamiento</foreign>” (<title level="m">Prosa
            I</title> 650), in the words of Cernuda himself, will be one of the most constant features of his poetry
            of exile, as can be seen here in lines 6–7, 12–13, and 19–20. Again, the discursiveness reveals a poetics
            of unity: the true sign is the poem as a whole, and not a memorable fragment that can be removed
            from the piece without losing its meaning.</p>
            <p>This discursiveness often stems from a morose <foreign xml:lang="la">compositio loci</foreign>, which
                relates many similar poems to the model that M.
                    H. Abrams (1965) considered characteristic of high Romanticism: the great ode,
                    which after a descriptive start in which the speaker is situated, focuses one’s
                    attention on a detail of the panorama to introduce a reflection and finally
                    returns to the initial stage, as happens in some poems by Shelley, Wordsworth
                    and, above all, Coleridge. In <title level="a">Historial de un libro,</title> Cernuda linked this
                    procedure with his teaching experience, in which he sought “that my explanations
                    would lead the students to see for themselves what I was going to tell them”
                    (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 645): in short, it was a question of evading the declarative
                form and seeking greater objectivity, not to blurt out to the reader a series of sentimental outpourings.
                It does not take much effort to recognize this series of events in <title level="a">Cementerio en la
                ciudad,</title> where the delay in the descriptive phase is accompanied by figures of amplification and
                argumentation: the parenthesis (line 14), the enumeration (first and third stanzas), the rhetorical
                question (line 17), conciliation (lines 19–22), the apostrophe (lines 28–30). These are strategies to
                expand from particular anecdotes to universal themes as, in this case, death (and its paradoxical link
                with life, in a relationship that is not one of mutual exclusion). This meditative aspect of Cernudian
                writing&#8212;which José Ángel Valente highlighted in <title level="m">Palabras de la
                tribu</title> (11–12), relating it to the idea of Coleridge’s imagination&#8212;would have been a great
                renewal for a Spanish poetry that Miguel de Unamuno contemptuously defined in his 1904 letter to Juan
                Arzadun as mere “rhymed eloquence,” since it would allow for the “sensory apprehension” of thought
                (60–61)&#8212;that is, a reconciliation of faculties that was an eminently Romantic aspiration and
                that Schiller had placed at the core of the aesthetic experience: once again, the search for unity.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is not too risky to say that, due to a surrealist influence&#8212;Vicente Huidobro’s
                creationism, Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s humor, Ortega’s boldness and approval&#8212;the poem was
                often a succession of metaphors in Cernuda’s generation. His choice of maturity, however, consisted
                of opting for the image, as can be seen here in the verses 12–13, 22–23 and 26–27. So, what’s the big
                difference? The key difference is that against the purely tropical technique, against the substitutive
                game, the image allowed the coexistence of real and figurative elements, and a poet who pursued both
                the free flight of the imagination and the rescue of the most literal empirical reality thus found
                the bridge between both kingdoms. Jorge Luis Borges, always such a friend of British literature, agreed
                in this regard when he advised the Spanish writer to beware of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">phrase à effet</foreign>
                for ingenuity, which is a danger, in a controversy as old as Aristotle’s <title level="m">Rhetoric</title>.
                “In the image,” declares Cernuda, “there is more poetic creation than in
                    metaphor” (<title level="m">Prosa I</title> 175). Why? For the very Romantic reason that
                “imagination is more holistic than wit." Unity, once again. It was not in vain that the task
                of the poet, as <title level="a">Río vespertino</title> outlines, was to “see the scattered
                being in unity.” Cernuda applied himself to the task with tools that his vernacular tradition
                could not provide.</p>
