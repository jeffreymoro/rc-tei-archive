            <p class="noCount">This essay presents a study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and his poetic appropriation
               of the English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A member of the Generation of '27,
               Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 to deliver lectures at Oxford and Cambridge, traveling
               to Glasgow, Cambridge, London, and the United States before finally settling in Mexico.
               As an exile in Scotland and England, Cernuda encounters Romanticism in the midst of
               the Modernist rejection of the era, negotiating questions of poetical ethics and pertinence
               during an era of modern warfare. Reading <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and echoing Shelley a century later, he asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not only
               useful,” Cernuda decides, “but also has certain social effects.” This essay offers
               an encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own poetics,
               negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing his Romantic
               interests against contemporary Modernist pressures.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Fruit of Exile</span></h2>
               <p>Luis Cernuda arrived in Great Britain in March 1938, with the lure of a series of
                  lectures that the poet Stanley Richardson had promised to organize for him to escape
                  the dangers of the Spanish Civil War. He remained in Glasgow until 1943, in Cambridge
                  until 1945, and in London until 1947, whereupon he made his way to Massachusetts,
                  always working in educational and university institutions. His stay in these English-speaking
                  countries would be extremely fruitful: during this time the poet wrote numerous essays,
                  several volumes of poems, a collection of short stories, and two books of prose poems
                  (<em>Ocnos</em> and <em>Variaciones sobre tema mexicano</em>).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The first thing the years spent in England gave to Cernuda was his knowledge of the
                     English language.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>According to testimonies of his years in Glasgow, his English skills were underdeveloped.
                              However, it is fair to assume that with time, and despite his shyness, Cernuda's linguistic
                              skills in this language improved.</span></div>
                     </div> A glance at the texts written during his exile allow the reader to recognize a loss
                     of familiarity with the natural turn of phrases in oral Spanish. His grammatical constructions
                     abound in unusual expressions and anastrophes and it is very common to find in his
                     writings the use of Anglicisms and linguistic loans. A second element to be highlighted
                     is the choice of reading materials. During his first stay at Cranleigh School, Cernuda
                     began to read Shakespeare, Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Housman. Along with
                     the Bible and the Spanish Golden Age classics, the English poets would always be present
                     in his personal library. A third component acquired as a result of the years spent
                     in England and the United States was the opportunity to engage in the translation
                     of canonic works of the English literary tradition. Cernuda undertook the translation
                     of two sonnets by Wordsworth, 
                     “The Definition of Love”
                      by Marvell, 
                     “A Toccata of Gallupi’s”
                      by Browning, 
                     “Byzantium”
                      by Yeats, and <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> by Shakespeare. There are also indications that he was able to translate Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>. Finally, it must also be mentioned that he was able to acquire many of the aesthetic
                     criteria and tools for engaging in literary criticism, a task that Cernuda cultivated
                     profusely. Dryden, Johnson, Coleridge and Arnold—names that are also considered by
                     T.S. Eliot among the most eminent literary critics—are some of the critics that he
                     mentions most often in his writings.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course, the critic to whom Cernuda probably paid most attention was Eliot himself,
                     towards whom he harbored mixed feelings. On the one hand he admired his poetry but,
                     on the other, he lost a certain impartiality in his judgment when his own verses were
                     rejected from Eliot’s <em>Faber &amp; Faber</em> collection.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The essay 
                              “Goethe and Mr. Eliot,”
                              for instance, could be read as a direct attack on Eliot. This essay is a direct rebuttal
                              to Eliot’s Goethe, or the Sage (1959). Cernuda also openly contradicts Eliot in 
                              “Baudelaire en el centenario de Las flores del mal”
                              (1959). However, the importance of Eliot as the central point of English criticism
                              for Cernuda is undeniable: all the references made by Cernuda in his texts (Herbert
                              Read, I. A. Richards, Lord Houghton, Middleton Murry, Lowes, etc.) match those listed
                              in Eliot’s The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism and On…</span></div>
                     </div> In this regard it should not be forgotten that Cernuda’s stay in Great Britain coincides
                     with a moment of definitive recognition for Eliot: the last years of <em>The Criterion</em>, his beginnings in theater with the successful <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>, etc. and with the conclusive backing of the Nobel Prize. In fact, I believe that
                     at least three features of Eliot’s critique attracted Cernuda’s approval: the thesis
                     of 
                     “Tradition and Individual Talent”
                     , according to which tradition is not inherited “naturally,” which was the criterion
                     that had guided Cernuda himself during his formative years and had led him to expand
                     his reading and to learn languages; the Eliotian “correlative objective” that Cernuda
                     translates as “equivalente correlativo” in <em>Historial de un libro</em>; and the idea that the only legitimate critic is the poet himself, which was recognizably
                     and perfectly embodied in Eliot. In any case, there is no doubt that these years,
                     and especially those spent in England, left their mark on Cernuda. “Perhaps my stay
                     there,” he would write to Edward Wilson from America, “has been the richest phase
                     of my life so far, if not as a mold first, then as a refinement of what I took there
                     with me."

               <h2><span class="head">The Areas of Shadow</span></h2>
               <p>When Cernuda says that he learned a lot from English poetry, that his stay in England
                  “completed” and “refined” what he had brought with him, he was being very precise.
                  That being said, what did the poet “bring with him” when he arrived in England? What
                  readings, teachings or references are to be found in his poetry from 1927 to 1938?
                  It can be said that his trajectory prior to exile was a kind of journey against the
                  current of time: he moved from the purism of <em>Perfil del aire</em> (1927) to the surrealism of <em>Un río, un amor</em> (1929) and <em>Los placeres prohibidos</em> (1931); from there he shifted towards to the Becquerian Romanticism of <em>Donde habite el olvido</em> (1933) and, finally, geared in the direction of the great European Romanticism, with
                  the watchword of a neo-paganism inherited from the <em>Greek Revival</em> under the guidance of Hölderlin, in <em>Invocaciones</em> (1935). In other words, our poet was already part of a Romantic family tree on the
                  eve of his departure for England.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The starting point of that Romanticism—a consequence and a response to eighteenth-century
                     rationalism—was the drama of the splitting of consciousness and the thirst for unity.
                     Hölderlin exclaimed at the beginning of his <em>Hyperion</em> that the highest human aspiration was “to be one with all that is alive, to return
                     to the whole of nature” (25), while Wordsworth encoded in his “<em>Aeolian visitations</em>” a hint of participation in the <em>Spirit of Nature</em> which he reveals in <em>The Prelude</em>. In <em>Palabras antes de una lectura</em> (1935), Cernuda gives an account of his beginnings in poetry: <span class="quote">‘The poetic instinct awakened in me with the sharpest perception of reality, experiencing,
                        with a deep impact, the beauty and attraction of the surrounding world. Its effect
                        was, somewhat similarly to what happens with the desire that love produces, the painful
                        and intense necessity to rise up out of myself, drowning in that vast body of creation.
                        What made this desire even more agonizing was the tacit recognition of its impossible
                        satisfaction. (<em>Prosa I</em> 602)
                        <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                                 (4)
                                 </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All translations from Spanish by Gabriel Insausti.</span></div>
                        </div>’</span> I believe that with a touch of Freudian language (the urgency of artistic creation
                     as the sublimation of eroticism, the “desire for death” as the path to reintegration
                     into unity), it is easy to recognize in these words the same melancholy that moved
                     Hölderlin and Wordsworth: the urge for communion with nature and the loss of a Kantian
                     lost paradise of immediacy. That is to say, that poetic writing would have in its
                     origin the ascertainment of this rift and would consist of an attempt (inevitably
                     frustrated, suggests Cernuda) to suture it. Poetry, once wrote Novalis, heals the
                     wounds that philosophy inflicts.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If we look closely at this narrative of the origins, the Romantic affiliation clearly
                     reappears. In <em>Historial de un libro</em> (1958), for example, Cernuda refers to the first time he was pushed to write poetry:
                     during his military service he went out on horseback around the outskirts of Seville
                     every afternoon, and during one of these excursions “things appeared to me as if I
                     were seeing them for the first time, as if I were entering and communicating with
                     them for the first time, and this unusual vision, simultaneously provoked in me an
                     expressive urgency, the urgency to tell of this experience” (<em>Prosa I</em> 626). That was the same attitude that Coleridge had envisioned in his <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, and also that of Wordsworth in his <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), where this latter explains that the purpose of poetry was “to excite a feeling
                     analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind’s attention from the lethargy
                     of custom,” which prevents us from seeing everything anew. In short, this Romantic
                     theorization of poetry would be an intimation of the concept of “defamiliarization”
                     that formalist criticism would erect as the cornerstone of literary writing. However,
                     as Cernuda had already said, this attempt to take over the world by word of mouth
                     was invariably bound to frustration: <span class="quote">‘I began to distinguish a simultaneous and opposite current within me: towards reality
                        and against reality, of attraction and hostility towards what is real. Desire led
                        me to the reality that offered itself before my eyes, as if only by its possession
                        could I attain certainty about my own life. But like that possession I have never
                        reached it except in a precarious way, hence the opposite current of hostility to
                        the ironic attraction of reality. (<em>Prosa I</em> 602)’</span> Hence, from this conflict, the title that presides over all his poetic work: <em>La realidad y el deseo</em>. Again, a further development of Romanticism: the inescapable tantalizing frustration
                     in which Schopenhauer’s thought ends up. It is not surprising to find that this expression
                     of isolated subjectivity is expressed through allegory. On this topic Philip Silver
                     has observed that allegory is the means by which isolated subjectivity with the environment
                     and nature is usually featured, given that—unlike the language of the symbols—it presupposes
                     a pause, a disjunction (
                     “Hacia”
                     ). Finally, this Romanticism had closed ranks around a fundamental idea, that of imagination.
                     This dimension appears as an alternative to a scientific vision of the world, characteristic
                     of the eighteenth-century mentality. It is science that Hölderlin accuses of “having
                     ruined everything,” and it is through it that the poet has learned “to differentiate
                     myself fundamentally from what surrounds me, […] I have thus been expelled from the
                     garden of nature” (26). Wordsworth expresses this idea memorably in 
                     “The Tables Turned”
                     : 
                     <blockquote class="quote">
                        <div class="stanza">
                           <div class="l">Sweet is the lore which Nature brings;</div>
                           <div class="l">Our meddling intellect</div>
                           <div class="l">Misshapes the beauteous forms of things</div>
                           <div class="l">We murder to dissect (lines 25–28; 103).</div>
                        </div>
                     </blockquote> With its analytical impulse and its proliferation of distinctions, science would thus
                     be reduced to a “scrutiny” of the physical world.

                     </div> Against the inanimate mechanism, Wordsworth would pursue a personal and unitary experience
                     of nature, in which something remains unobtainable through mere analysis. This idea
                     of <em>natura naturans</em> and its correlation to the imagination as an invisible link between nature and the
                     poet’s soul appears in the <em>Ocnos</em> poem meaningfully entitled 
                     “La naturaleza,”
                      where Cernuda recalls a child’s proximity to the natural environment: <span class="quote">‘What a joy when I saw the leaves break at last, and their tender color, which by force
                        of transparency almost seemed luminous, accentuating the raised veins, darkened little
                        by little with the strongest sap. I felt as if He himself had worked the miracle of
                        life, of awakening on the fundamental earth, such a god, the form previously dormant
                        in the dream of the non-existent. (<em>Poesía Completa</em> 554)’</span> This passage resonates with the Rousseauian mythology of childhood as well as with
                     Wordsworth’s idea of <em>vision and faculty divine</em>, whose purest expression lies in that of a child's gaze. It is only that this participation
                     in the intimacy of nature takes place in the past perfect and in the third person,
                     as if the poet were inescapably distancing himself from an experience he can no longer
                     share, in a melancholic suggestion. In any case, if Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge,
                     Shelley and Keats agreed on something, over and above the nominalist differences,
                     it was in vindicating that the queen among the faculties, imagination, is capable
                     of glimpsing a reality superior to everyday life. Cernuda, who revels the Romantic
                     imagination as the source of the “individualistic attitude” and the “supremacy of
                     the spirit” characteristic of Romantic poets (<em>Prosa I</em> 271–72), is very close to this Romantic idea when he affirms that the essence of the
                     poetic problem “is the conflict between reality and desire, between appearance and
                     truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse of the complete image of the world that
                     we do not know, of the ‘divine idea of the world that lies at the bottom of the appearance,’
                     according to Fichte’s phrase” (<em>Prosa I</em> 602). On the other hand, on the marginal nature of this task, (the historic defeat
                     of the Romantic amendment to the unilateralities of enlightened rationalism), our
                     poet is not fooled: “Modern society, unlike those that preceded it, has decided to
                     dispense with the inseparable mysterious element of life. Unable to explore it, society
                     prefers to pretend not to believe in its existence. But the poet cannot proceed in
                     this way and must count on that area of shadow and fog in life that floats around
                     human bodies” (<em>Prosa I</em> 602–4). The Cernudian melancholy therefore exudes a quality that places it unequivocally
                     in the tradition of high European Romanticism. It also places it on the path of some
                     sort of “reactionary” or anti-modern trend: despite the attempt of modern scientificism
                     to “disenchant” the world—according to Weber, and later to Adorno and Horkheimer—the
                     mystery in life remains. And that means that the ultimate truth cannot be grasped
                     through reason, but through imagination.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Underlying Fire</span></h2>
               <p>It is worth making a few comments on the significance of this Cernudian reception
                  of English Romanticism. First, we must remember the obvious fact that Spanish Romanticism
                  had historically been very weak and had not produced any noteworthy poet. This would
                  make of Cernuda a sort of “late-yielding fruit,” apparently inactive in an outdated
                  rhetoric, if it were not for his ability to recover elements of that rhetoric in order
                  to build a relevant discourse. Secondly, it should be noted that at the time of this
                  reception, Romanticism had been “dismissed” in the English literary officialdom, due
                  to the anti-Romantic tirades that Pound, Eliot, and <em>modernism</em> in general had launched against the Wordsworthian tradition since the war years,
                  in order to displace some Georgians who were contemplating the exhaustion of that
                  tradition. Thirdly, when Cernuda assimilated the reading of the English Romantic poets,
                  he did not take into account the revision that began with <em>The Mirror and the Lamp</em> (1953) by M. H. Abrams. He could not have read either—as they were yet to be produced—the
                  later interpretations of Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartmann, and Harold Bloom.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Cernudian reading of Romanticism dealt with authors and works that had been subject
                     to prejudice for decades. This was the case, for instance of the Victorian dilemma
                     between the aesthetes, Wilde, Pater, Rossetti, etc., and moralists such as Carlyle,
                     Arnold, and Morris, who tended to assimilate the Romantic legacy to the first group
                     in a biased vision that amputated the Romantic message to the point of denaturing
                     it. This was a dualism that, as Raymond Williams observed, was the result of the false
                     image of the Romantic artist as an isolated aesthete in his individual solipsism (30).

                              Wordsworth incorporated his autobiographical account of the march of European civilization
                              in the chapters on the French Revolution included in The Prelude; Coleridge went beyond

                     “Letters”
                     ; or think of the all-pervading logics of dialectics in Blake, with the constant struggle
                     of Los and Urizen. How could Cernuda cope with that?</p>

                  <p>The first half of the essay 
                     “Pensamiento poético en la lírica inglesa del siglo XIX”
                      suggests that, according to Cernuda, the temperament and "metaphysical position" of
                     these poets is only understood against the background of industrialization and rural
                     exodus (and also, of course, in the context of the English empiricist tradition).
                     His particular judgment on them confirms it: in Cernuda’s opinion, “the ethical intention
                     is evident in Wordsworth” (<em>Prosa I</em> 295), while in Blake there would be a mystic and a revolutionary that our poet relates
                     to the figures of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Thus, far from sterile aestheticism or
                     inane escapism, Romanticism could have an outcome in the form of civil responsibility.
                     In <em>Río vespertino</em> Cernuda states this in unmistakably Romantic terms when he declares that

                     factuality. Contrary to what the doctrines of the engaged artist proclaimed in the
                     twentieth century, Cernuda’s civil responsibility did not opt for a dissolution of
                     individuality. The task of challenging individualism, which in Byron or Shelley could
                     reach the theatrical, was only the starting point of the Romantic program. Cernuda

                        accept this imprisonment and who runs into the walls of his prison countless times.
                        (<em>Prosa I</em> 603)’</span> Poetry, in short, could constitute a sort of <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">ultima ratio</span>, and the poet would be characterized as a being defeated beforehand by the practical
                     world that of mere efficiency, capitalism and <em>Realpolitik</em>. Moreover, Cernuda goes so far as to claim that in expressing man’s reaction to survive
                     in a society where there is no room for him, Blake and Wordsworth would be, even before
                     Baudelaire, the first modern poets. Against this state of affairs (that of “reality”),
                     Cernuda opposes an ethical affirmation, that of “desire,” which is once again Romantic,
                     in the tributes to the figure of the literary hero contained in poems such as 
                     “F. G. L,”
                      
                     “A Larra, con unas violetas,”
                      and 
                     “Góngora”
                      among others. In these texts, the poet is shown in constant confrontation with a hostile
                     environment and political dissatisfaction would form part of his case. "Poetry is
                     not only useful," Cernuda deduces from Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>, "but also has certain social effects" (<em>Prosa I</em> 333). This is not to say that our poet is in favor of <em>all</em> the Romantic pronouncements in this sense, and in his reluctance we can see the shadow
                     of the problems and the embarrassment that imprisoned the writer of the twentieth
                     century—fundamentally, the urgency of taking sides but the reticence to a compromise
                     that reduced his voice to a watchword. On Shelley, Cernuda observes that the primacy
                     of action can be guessed in him, and only when this latter failed did the English
                     poet make up his mind to use his forces differently—that is, in an exercise of writing
                     that would be characterized as a substitute for real political activity. The result
                     is a poetic theory that borders on propaganda, as can be seen in the letter to Thomas
                     Love Peacock—written in Naples on January 26th 1819—, which Cernuda mentions: “I consider
                     poetry,” Shelley said there, “to be very subordinate to morality and political science”
                     (Shelley quoted by Cernuda 501). Despite the Victorian caricature, the poetics of
                     political <em>engagement</em> were sometimes not too far from the Romantic sensibility. In fact, the Romantic poets
                     were very often on the verge of preaching such a doctrine. And Cernuda, long before
                     Williams stressed on this aspect, was quite right to underline the moral and political
                     implications of some of these poems.</p>

                  <p>Interestingly, this recovery of the ethical and political aspect of Romanticism had
                     reached a remarkable milestone during Cernuda’s English years. In 1937 Stephen Spender—whom
                     our poet met in a slightly unpleasant appointment recounted by Rafael Martínez Nadal
                     (86–90)—published a book entitled <em>Forward from Liberalism</em> (1937). What was Spender’s proposal? Between the “anti-heroic” myth of Auden’s generation
                     and the new political urgency caused by the rise of fascism, which would lead Harry
                     Pollitt to wish that with his trip to a Spain at war he would become “a new Byron,”
                     Spender advocated for a development of the Romantic program. In his opinion, this
                     program had been fenced in; it promoted social justice and an idea of the role of
                     the writer that returned to Shelley's famous phrase that poets are "prophets" and
                     "the unacknowledged legislators of the world."

                     its critical position in the face of events, its evaluation of the Spanish reality,
                     and its historical examination of Spanishness, as well as the warmongering and capitalism
                     that shake his host countries—corresponds with this definition.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of course, this does not mean that the totality of <em>La realidad y el deseo</em> fits within this Romantic image: modalities of discourse such as the doubling, the
                  dramatic monologue, the culturalist piece, or the metaliterary poem of his last years
                  point to other sources. What I want to highlight is that this consideration of Romanticism
                  in all its breadth allows us to resolve the traditional dualism between the “Edenist”
                  interpretation of the Cernudian work (the one defended by Philip Silver, according
                  to which its fundamental meaning, with the “thirst for eternity” as the “unifying
                  theme” (<em>Luis Cernuda</em> 48), corresponds to the Romantic argument of the expulsion from paradise) and the
                  “ethicist” argument (the one fundamentally advocated by Derek Harris (13–14), for
                  whom, as time goes by, there is a distancing "from the Romantic vision of the world"
                  in Cernuda). Why? Because, although it is true that the Edenist thesis (the evocation
                  of paradise, and the longing and the search for restitution, even if vicarious, through
                  writing) is almost exclusively based on <em>Ocnos</em> and a few poems from <em>La realidad y el deseo</em>, if one considers Romanticism in all its aspects, as I have proposed here, the critical
                  attitude is not excluded from the characterization of the Cernudian character as "Romantic."
                  On the other hand, Paz's idea that our poet is "one of the few moralists that Spain
                  has given," but a moralist "who tests the systems of collective morality" (116), fits
                  perfectly into this model, which would provide a channel for Cernuda's temperamental
                  individualism. Of course, the idea of "spiritual biography" that accompanies the ethicist
                  thesis would be perfectly congruent with a Romanticism that, far from the symbolist
                  ideal of full autonomy, always preserves a knot between the poet and the poem.</p>

                      and 
                     “Otras ruinas”
                      recreate a motif already used by Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley; 
                     “El arpa”
                      obviously invites one to think of 
                     “The Eolian Harp”
                      by Coleridge and in Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>; the blackbird of 
                     “Río vespertin”
                      whose fate is “purer than that of man” seems to be inherited directly from the nightingales
                     of Coleridge and Keats, from Shelley’s lark and from Wordsworth’s redbreast, and also
                     reissues an eminently Romantic theme such as the affirmation of the superiority of
                     nature over art (Poesía Completa 371); 
                     “Violetas,”
                      where the spiked flowers are for a moment “norma para lo efímero que es bello” and
                     “vivo embeleso en la memoria,” introduces the theme of anticipating the memory of
                     Wordsworth’s famous 
                     “Daffodils;”
                      
                     “El cementerio”
                      and 
                     “Otro cementerio”
                      recall the Romantic reflections raised by Gray’s memorable 
                     “Elegy.”
                      I would, however, like to look at other aspects of the Cernudian writings perhaps
                     less striking or recognizable, but also less anecdotal, insofar as they inform the
                     whole of his poetry of exile. To observe them (and to read in them a poetry of that
                     longed-for Romantic unity), one needs only to reread 
                     “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
                      one of the poems from the Glasgow period, about the place known as 
                     “The Necropolis”
                      in Townhead, adjacent to a local railway line:

                     </blockquote> One of the constants of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s poetry is a sense of expression
                     that rejects the <em>wit-writing</em> of the Augustan poets: that association of wit—“For works may have more wit than does
                     ‘em good, / As bodies perish through excess of blood,” Pope himself warned (303–4)—that
                     in Coleridge's theory is linked to an "inferior" faculty, fantasy. Cernuda takes up
                     this doctrine with no less constancy: in 
                     “Tres poetas metafísicos”
                      he warns that the predominance of wit was “a primary condition and instrument of imaginative
                     creation” in seventeenth-century Spanish “conceptismo,” and that “under such a weight
                     of associations the unique reality that the word supposes disappears as something
                     annoying and useless” (<em>Prosa I</em> 512). The verbal fireworks would have an irritating effect that subtracts their substantial
                     reality from things. Hence the accusation of a “wit game” that Cernuda launches against
                     Salinas and, in general, against much of the Spanish tradition. In the face of the
                     rapid and startling succession of parts, Cernuda stressed the unity of the whole.
                     The circularity of 
                     “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
                      where the fourth stanza picks up and places in time the scene of the first one, where
                     every startling association is eluded to (except, slightly, in the adjectivization
                     of the “clandestine dead”), points in that direction.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This sense of expression was accompanied in the Lake poets by a very determined prosody:
                  a discarding of the heroic couplet and a recovery of the Miltonic blank verse, which
                  in the last century had seen notable attempts, such as Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>. In Cernuda’s case, the search for a different musicality and a diffuse intensity,
                  scattered throughout the whole poem, which does not privilege that moment of brilliance,
                  is obtained in part from a similar attempt that resorts to a dialogue between grammatical
                  unity and meter (that is, between the phrase and the sentence that strictly coincided
                  with Pope, creating an effect of mere juxtaposition). The “sliding from one verse
                  to another, which in Spanish I believe is called <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">encabalgamiento</span>” (<em>Prosa I</em> 650), in the words of Cernuda himself, will be one of the most constant features
                  of his poetry of exile, as can be seen here in lines 6–7, 12–13, and 19–20. Again,
                  the discursiveness reveals a poetics of unity: the true sign is the poem as a whole,
                  and not a memorable fragment that can be removed from the piece without losing its
                  meaning.</p>
               <p>This discursiveness often stems from a morose <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">compositio loci</span>, which relates many similar poems to the model that M. H. Abrams (1965) considered
                  characteristic of high Romanticism: the great ode, which after a descriptive start
                  in which the speaker is situated, focuses one’s attention on a detail of the panorama
                  to introduce a reflection and finally returns to the initial stage, as happens in
                  some poems by Shelley, Wordsworth and, above all, Coleridge. In 
                  “Historial de un libro,”
                  Cernuda linked this procedure with his teaching experience, in which he sought “that
                  my explanations would lead the students to see for themselves what I was going to
                  tell them” (<em>Prosa I</em> 645): in short, it was a question of evading the declarative form and seeking greater
                  objectivity, not to blurt out to the reader a series of sentimental outpourings. It
                  does not take much effort to recognize this series of events in 
                  “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
                  where the delay in the descriptive phase is accompanied by figures of amplification
                  and argumentation: the parenthesis (line 14), the enumeration (first and third stanzas),
                  the rhetorical question (line 17), conciliation (lines 19–22), the apostrophe (lines
                  28–30). These are strategies to expand from particular anecdotes to universal themes
                  as, in this case, death (and its paradoxical link with life, in a relationship that
                  is not one of mutual exclusion). This meditative aspect of Cernudian writing—which
                  José Ángel Valente highlighted in <em>Palabras de la tribu</em> (11–12), relating it to the idea of Coleridge’s imagination—would have been a great
                  renewal for a Spanish poetry that Miguel de Unamuno contemptuously defined in his
                  1904 letter to Juan Arzadun as mere “rhymed eloquence,” since it would allow for the
                  “sensory apprehension” of thought (60–61)—that is, a reconciliation of faculties that
                  was an eminently Romantic aspiration and that Schiller had placed at the core of the
                  aesthetic experience: once again, the search for unity.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is not too risky to say that, due to a surrealist influence—Vicente Huidobro’s
                  creationism, Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s humor, Ortega’s boldness and approval—the poem
                  was often a succession of metaphors in Cernuda’s generation. His choice of maturity,
                  however, consisted of opting for the image, as can be seen here in the verses 12–13,
                  22–23 and 26–27. So, what’s the big difference? The key difference is that against
                  the purely tropical technique, against the substitutive game, the image allowed the
                  coexistence of real and figurative elements, and a poet who pursued both the free
                  flight of the imagination and the rescue of the most literal empirical reality thus
                  found the bridge between both kingdoms. Jorge Luis Borges, always such a friend of
                  British literature, agreed in this regard when he advised the Spanish writer to beware
                  of the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">phrase à effet</span> for ingenuity, which is a danger, in a controversy as old as Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em>. “In the image,” declares Cernuda, “there is more poetic creation than in metaphor”
                  (<em>Prosa I</em> 175). Why? For the very Romantic reason that “imagination is more holistic than wit."
                  Unity, once again. It was not in vain that the task of the poet, as 
                  “Río vespertino”
                  outlines, was to “see the scattered being in unity.” Cernuda applied himself to the
                  task with tools that his vernacular tradition could not provide.</p>

               “Baudelaire en el centenario de <em>Las flores del mal</em>”
               (1959). However, the importance of Eliot as the central point of English criticism
               for Cernuda is undeniable: all the references made by Cernuda in his texts (Herbert
               Read, I. A. Richards, Lord Houghton, Middleton Murry, Lowes, etc.) match those listed
               in Eliot’s <em>The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</em> and <em>On Poetry and Poets</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               exploitation and racism in his <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, developed a summary examination of his own homeland in <em>The Daughters of Albion</em>, and proclaimed revolution in <em>America</em>; Wordsworth incorporated his autobiographical account of the march of European civilization
               in the chapters on the French Revolution included in <em>The Prelude</em>; Coleridge went beyond the subject of defending rural life in poems such as 
               “This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison”
               or 
               “Frost at Midnight”

               “France: an Ode”

               “Fears in Solitude”
               ; Shelley adopted an avowedly committed attitude with <em>Queen Mab</em> and <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>; and Keats, with his ideas on empathy, taken from Hazlitt and moralists from the
               previous century such as Shaftesbury and Adam Smith, advanced the modern poet's ethical
