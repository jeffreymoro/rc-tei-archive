                <p>In commemoration of the bicentenary of Percy Shelley’s <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), this comparative essay focuses on the
                    reception of the lyrical drama as a revolutionary manifesto in Spanish-American
                    nations. Fittingly, the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century
                    coincided not only with Rafael del Riego’s republican revolt in Spain but also
                    with the independence movements throughout Latin America more generally.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="a">The Shelleys and
                            Spain,</title> Joselyn Almeida explores Percy Shelley’s interest in
                        writings by Cervantes and Calderón de la Barca as well as Riego’s revolt in
                        Spain. The essay also analyzes the influence of these writings on <title
                            level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>. She notes that Joseph Blanco White
                        read <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> in exile in Britain “as he
                        reflected upon Riego’s liberal uprising” of the 1820s in Asturias
                        (173).</note> The essay begins with an overview of <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title>’s short-lived yet influential reception history
                    in Hispanophone culture, before tracking particular readings of the play in
                    local journalism and literature. I focus my reading primarily on Alejo
                    Carpentier’s <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> [<title level="m">The
                        Lost Steps</title>] (1950), a major twentieth-century novel whose network of
                    references and allusions to Shelley’s play provides one of the most earnest
                    artistic engagements with the drama ever produced. I ultimately suggest that as
                    an endorsement of non-violent revolution and social equality, <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title> has been indelibly inscribed into the radical
                    political and literary history of Spanish-American nations.</p>
                <p>Given that Shelley did not expect <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> to
                    be a popular work in English, its brief circulation and reception history in
                    Hispanophone cultures is perhaps unsurprising.<note place="foot" resp="author"
                        >James Barcus has noted: “Shelley himself thought it would sell no more than
                        20 copies, and John Gisborne remarked that <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title> was never intended for more than five or six persons”
                        (3). This initial scarcity of copies and readers seems to corroborate what
                        Shelley claimed in his preface to the play that “[his] purpose has hitherto
                        been simply to familiarize the highly refined imagination of the more select
                        classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence”
                        (209).</note>
                    <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> was not <emph>fully</emph>
                    translated into the Spanish language until 1994, when Hiperion Press in Spain
                    published a bilingual edition with a translation by Alejandro Valero. The drama
                    had hitherto appeared in translation in both Spain and Spanish America only in
                    parts: as an array of fragments that existed as separate “poems” featured in
                    anthologies. Excerpts of it had also been used as epigraphs or cited in works by
                    authors such as Miguel de Unamuno, who considered Shelley to be a “marvelous”
                    writer (González and Rodríguez 101).<note place="foot" resp="author">Unamuno
                        became interested in the play’s representation of linguistic origins,
                        especially the lines, “[Prometheus] gave Man speech, and speech created
                        thought / Which is the measure of the universe” (II.iv.72–73), as he cited
                        them in his <title level="m">Amor y Pedagogia</title> (<title level="m">Love
                            and Pedagogy</title>).</note> As Beatriz Gonzalez and Santiago Rodríguez
                    point out, Shelley’s reception in Spain has suffered from various gaps of
                    omission. This is owing largely to the country’s complicated history. During the
                    nineteenth century, for instance, Shelley was occluded from the “conservative
                    attitudes” of the reign of Ferdinand VII (1784–1833), when several liberal,
                    progressive authors, including Jose de Espronceda, were exiled from
                    Spain&#8212;a time period that also coincided with the Spanish American
                    Independence movements. It was not until the fin-de-siècle that [Shelley] is
                    first mentioned in Spain. His name reappeared during the 1920s only to disappear
                    soon thereafter with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 and the ensuing
                    fascist state created under Francisco Franco. The name of Shelley and his work
                    began reappearing in the 1970s and has continued to gain traction ever since;
                    the recent translation of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is a good
                    case in point (97).</p>
                <p>In the two centuries since <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>’s
                    publication, versions of it&#8212;as either a reference or part-translation in
                    Spanish America&#8212;have taken on varying titles: <title level="m"
                        >Prometeo</title> (Prometheus), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Desencadenado</title> (Prometheus Unchained), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Liberado</title> (Prometheus Liberated), <title level="m">Prometeo
                        Desatado</title> (the closest version one comes to “unbound” in Spanish),
                    and <title level="m">Prometeo Libertado</title> (an orthographical variation of
                    Prometheus Liberated).<note place="foot" resp="author">A complete translation in
                        Italian was published in 1892 by Mario Rapisardi, which was titled <title
                            level="m">Prometeo Liberato</title> and likely inspired by the
                        significance of Italy and its landscapes to the drama’s composition
                        history</note> Valero’s translation of the play features paratextual
                    materials in Spanish, including a translation of Shelley’s Preface and Mary
                    Shelley’s <title level="a">Note</title> from her publication of <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title> in 1839. The volume’s back cover, which
                    functions as a preface to the collection, highlights the drama as “perhaps
                    [Shelley’s] most ambitious work.” It traces some biographical information on
                    Shelley and the play’s composition history prior to offering a synopsis that
                    makes the case for the drama as a text of resistance (Figure 1): <figure>

                    <quote> Grounded in Greek myth that [Shelley] interprets and reimagines
                        according to his own style, [the play] brings fundamental problems into
                        relief such as the struggle between good and evil and the origin and destiny
                        of the human species who, alongside the natural world, resists oppression
                        and destruction in the struggle for liberty. The poem ends with a great song
                        of hope in the wake of love’s triumph as the law of the world. </quote> In
                    his editorial notes, Valero remarks how, in contrast to Aeschylus’s version of
                    the myth, Shelley focused his adaptation on the moral and psychological aspects
                    that enable Prometheus’s liberation (215). For Valero, the play’s portrayal of a
                    new political reality culminates in a celebratory chant of freedom: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">The new world created by Prometheus’s liberation. The
                            ancient world passes away and nature celebrates with joy the new state

                            has been born, more than a new man, is a new perception of the world as
                            seen by man, because nothing exists outside of human perception.</p>

                <p>Valero’s reading of the play as a reimagined classical myth in which love and

                 The article, <title level="a">The Poet Shelley&#8212;with Byron and

                        valle estrecho y sombrío</title>], was published in commemoration of the
                    centenary of Shelley’s death (1922). Written by Edouard Herriot, who eventually
                    became prime minister of France, the text presents his radical political
                    interests in Shelley and was fittingly published in the aftermath of World War
                        I.<note place="foot" resp="author"> An investigation into Herriot’s
                        biography, including his letters and journals, did not reveal any connection
                        to Shelley or his drama.</note> In addition to summarizing all four acts,
                    Herriot lauds the play’s poetic ideals as both “current” and “eternal.” After
                    citing the final lines uttered by Demogorgon in Act IV, he praises the play’s
                    “luxuries of lyricism,” its ideas of passive resistance, and the “necessary
                    agony” suffered by Prometheus. In the final paragraph, Herriot states: <quote> I
                        gladly read [<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>] again in these
                        troublesome times. I have placed it among my beloved books, very close to
                        Plato. Shelley is the poet of democracy, of reason, of intellectual beauty;
                        [he is] the adversary of tyranny, the enthusiastic chanter of liberty. I
                        love everything about its classic purity; the poetry that flows through all
                        its parts, the immense love of nature that resounds in each of its stanzas,
                        [and] the ineffable music of its verse. During the war’s tragic hours, I
                        would hear [the play’s] words of hope, which sang in the wind of the battle.
                        May [Shelley’s] memory rise again today among the lands of the free in order
                        to inspire respect for life, the love of Reason and of Peace! After all,
                        [Shelley] was the one who said: “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of
                        the world.” </quote> Employing his own poetic liberties and invoking
                    Shelley’s famous description of poets as “unacknowledged legislators,” Herriot’s
                    synopsis mirrors the earlier sentiments of W.B. Yeats, who famously said at the
                    turn of the twentieth century that <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>
                    is among the “sacred books of the world” (<title level="m">Early Essays</title>
                    70). Like Valero, Herriot acknowledges the drama’s timeless connections between
                    poetry, politics, and popular reform.</p>
                <p>This seemingly uncritical treatment of Shelley’s poetry and politics turns
                    strikingly more nuanced in Carpentier’s reading of the play in <title level="m"
                        >Los pasos perdidos</title>. Although Carpentier was born in Switzerland to
                    French and Russian parents and was educated throughout Europe, he grew up in
                    Cuba and identified as Cuban. He spent much of his life fascinated by music,
                    becoming a musicologist and studying musical traditions of the Caribbean and
                    South America. Carpentier fled Cuba in 1945 because of the threat his left-wing
                    politics posed to Fulgencio Batista’s regime. While in exile he wrote the partly
                    autobiographical work, <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, which was
                    published in Venezuela thirty-one years after Herriot’s article. A novel with
                    Shelleyan, Conradian, and Proustian resonances, it tells the story of an
                    unnamed, spiritually-exhausted protagonist and narrator whose Prufrockian
                        <emph>malaise</emph> puts him at odds with the modern world. The narrative’s
                    idealization of the origins of the human species is pit starkly against the
                    “missteps” of human progress&#8212;as seen in the novel’s contrast between the
                    native customs of a South American primitive oral society and the contemporary
                    world of European languages, literature, philosophy, and cultures. A
                    musicologist in search of native musical instruments, the narrator travels from
                    New York City through the Andes Mountains into the heart of the South American
                    jungle where his arduous physical journey toward the center of the continent
                    also represents a journey back in time. From the contemporary urban landscape
                    into farmlands, primitive villages, and stone-age-like encampments, he discovers
                    an Edenic oasis and refuge from modern civilization.</p>
                <p>Throughout its pages, Carpentier integrates the plot, mystical settings, and
                    idealistic aims of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> into its
                    narrative space. Like the lyrical drama, the novel portrays the reversal of
                    historical time.<note place="foot" resp="author">While Carpentier’s novel
                        suggests it, in <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, humans are not
                        at fault for the woe that they must endure.</note> Yet this modern
                    adaptation of Shelley’s work, which is set in a South American jungle instead of
                    the Indian Caucasus, offers a more ambivalent take than Valero’s or Herriot’s.
                    The novel critiques the structure and aims of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>, as the integration of the play becomes an experiment that
                    ultimately fails. Carpentier’s empiricist approach for thinking through
                    Shelley’s radical imperatives brings to light the incompatibility between the
                    demands for real-world change and the conceptual blueprints for revolution that
                    Shelley presumably left under-theorized.</p>
                <p><title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is undoubtedly the most significant
                    source text for <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, and its
                    assimilation in the novel occurs in multiple ways. Carpentier introduces
                    Shelley’s text early in the book when the narrator sees a copy of the lyrical
                    drama in a New York City bookshop, which made him “forget the world of books”
                    altogether (12).<note place="foot" resp="author">It is not made clear whether
                        the narrator finds a print copy of only the play itself or the entire 1820
                            <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> volume that contained other
                        poems, including <title level="a">To a Skylark,</title>
                        <title level="a">Ode to the West Wind,</title> and <title level="a">The
                            Sensitive Plant.</title></note> This influential moment cues the reader
                    to the currency of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> as the novel’s
                    major touchstone, while prompting the narrator to recall his own musical
                    adaptation of Shelley’s drama. He has, in fact, composed “a prelude and the
                    first draft of the opening scenes” of an “ambitious cantata on <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title>,” a choral composition that emulates the style
                    of the hymnic fourth act of Shelley’s play (19). The novel further resembles its
                    predecessor text through its plot structure as a quest romance, its emphasis on
                    social revolution, and its panoply of images and poetic descriptions.</p>
                <p>The novel’s treatment of free love is also definitively Shelleyan. While married
                    to Ruth, an American woman, the narrator has sought out a French lover named
                    Mouche, with whom he travels to South America. When he grows tired of her during
                    their journey, increasingly identifiying Mouche with Western bourgeois culture,
                    he trades her for Rosario, a native woman and kindred spirit. These polyamorous
                    behavioral patterns are reminiscent of Shelley’s own pursuits of love and
                    depictions in such poems as <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title>. For the
                    narrator, Rosario transcends the taints of European modernity and colonialism
                    and is the closest he comes to discovering his soulmate, his epipsyche: “several
                    races had met in this [ideal] woman”; she is “an amalgam of related peoples” as
                    an interracial and multi-ethnic ideal (81–2). “Through her lips the plants began
                    to speak and describe their own powers,” which is suggestive of the animistic
                    and anthropomorphic features of Shelley’s play (83). Carpentier even includes a
                    moment of homoerotic tension when Mouche unsuccessfully attempts a pass at
                    Rosario. This moment echoes the homoerotic scene between the daughters of Ocean
                    at the beginning of Act II, as Carpentier meticulously aligns the plot and
                    characters of each work.</p>
                <p>In terms of setting, the urban landscapes of New York City and the guerilla-torn
                    South American city parallel the unredeemed Earth of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>’s first act. These correspondences make evident that, for
                    the narrator, both European metropoles and colonial peripheries have become
                    contaminated and corrupted. Several lines from Act I, including those from
                    Prometheus’s opening monologue, appear throughout this early part of the novel;
                    the second chapter even begins with the first fury’s initial line, “Ha! I scent
                    life,” which signals a point of transition for the Titan who, despite being
                    persecuted and tormented by the goddesses, refuses to despair. When the narrator
                    visits what scholars agree is Caracas, he experiences his own form of encounter
                    with the taunting furies: the outbreak of a violent revolution and guerilla
                    warfare in which snipers detain him against his will. In Caracas, even nature
                    appears to be up in arms: “For hundreds of years a struggle had been going on
                    with roots that pushed up the sidewalks and cracked the walls” (38). The scene
                    recalls the tension that verges on stalemate between Prometheus and Jupiter,
                    especially when the narrator comments on the fraught South American history of
                    the twentieth century where one finds the “movement of Socialists against
                    Conservatives, of Communists against Catholics . . . [and] one lives with
                    Rousseau and the Inquisition, with the Immaculate Conception and Das Kapital”
                    (50–1). The echoes from the first act of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> are further reinforced when the narrator passes a shop with
                    a “mysterious sign,” “[el] Rastro de Zoroastro,” a rhymed Spanish phrase meaning
                    the trail (or trace) of Zoroaster (42). The sign brings to mind Shelley’s own
                    reference to Zoroaster in Act I, which reveals the play’s interest in critiquing
                    institutionalized religions and dualistic structures.</p>
                <p>Through a series of trials, the narrator also undertakes a quest romance into the
                    heart of a jungle untainted by European civilization and colonization. The
                    expedition echoes not only Prometheus’s mental transformation in Act I but also
                    Asia’s quests in Act II: her physical journey into the underworld and the
                    figurative voyage into the depths and discovery of her own psyche. Although both
                    texts take place in different epochs and different parts of the globe, the
                    characters in <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title> encounter settings
                    familiar to any reader of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>: frozen
                    landscapes, ravines, volcanoes, and a “multitude of peaks and abysses” (78).
                    Like Asia at the beginning of Act II, scene five, who appears on a cloud atop a
                    mountain ready to redeem the earth with love alongside Prometheus, the narrator
                    also finds himself positioned above the clouds just prior to his new life in the
                    jungle beside his own ideal love, Rosario.</p>
                <p>To engage Shelley’s work even further, Carpentier employs a style of imagery as
                    if taken directly from the play’s experimental fourth act. Describing what he
                    calls the “dance of the trees,” the narrator notes “the rhythm that begins in
                    the leaves, a restless, ascending rhythm&#8212;with the surge and breaking of
                    the waves, with gentle pauses, rests&#8212;which suddenly becomes a storm of
                    rejoicing. There is nothing more beautiful than a bamboo thicket dancing in the
                    breeze” (211). In Act IV, the Chorus of Unseen Spirits decree how: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>Bright clouds float in heaven,</l>
                            <l>Dew-stars gleam on earth,</l>
                            <l>Waves assemble on ocean,</l>
                            <l>They are gathered and driven</l>
                            <l>By the storm of delight, by the panic of glee!</l>
                            <l>They shake with emotion,</l>
                            <l>They dance in their mirth.</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent2">(lines 40–46)</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote> Later, the chorus rejoices to “weave the dance on the floor of the
                    breeze, / [and] Pierce with song heaven's silent light” (70–71).</p>
                <p>Beyond embedding these ecstatic images into his poetical prose, Carpentier links
                    the journey through space (to the center of the continent) to an expedition back
                    in time. Upon his arrival at the secluded village, he remarks how he has
                    retrogressed several millennia: <quote> the 58 centuries separating the fourth
                        chapter of Genesis from the current year <emph>back there</emph> could be
                        spanned in one hundred and eighty minutes . . . [we flew] over cities that
                        today, at this very time, belonged to the Middle Ages, the Conquest, the
                        Colony, or the Romantic era” (233–34). </quote> For the narrator, the gap he
                    once understood between the past and present has collapsed, as the
                    self-sustaining community he has reached seemingly exists outside of history.
                    Carpentier pits the Edenic surroundings of “<foreign xml:lang="sp"
                    >acá</foreign>” (here) against the “<foreign xml:lang="sp">allá</foreign>” (back
                    there) of everyday modern life in New York and Caracas. The native village has
                    bypassed the ravages of time and “progress” altogether; it is a “world compact,
                    complete . . . a hidden nation, a map in code, a vast vegetable kingdom with few
                    entrances” (126). Surrounded by native life and customs, the narrator
                    experiences “the years . . . melt away, vanish, in the dizzying backward flight
                    of time . . . We are in the Paleolithic age” (177–79). This part of the
                    narrative is no doubt an adaptation of the final lines of the second act, in
                    which Prometheus’s and Asia’s feats have reset history and have hence returned
                    the world back to its origins: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">

                    </quote> It is no coincidence that, in the midst of living in the native
                    community, the narrator mentions his “old plan” of working on <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title>, as he delights in being part of a primitive
                    oral society that is centered on community, memory, and literature. He learns
                    “that the Indians had preserved the memory of a confused epic . . . of a Carib
                    migration . . . [through which] the amazing unity of myths was borne out . . .
                    the poem lived in the memory of the generations of the jungle” (210). The
                    passage recalls Shelley’s own heterogeneous and eclectic myth of global
                    aspiration. A play that symbolically unites the West (Prometheus) and East
                    (Asia), <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is itself a “confused epic”
                    that bridges numerous traditions, faiths, and cultures.</p>
                <p>This ostensibly uncritical homage to Shelley’s drama starts to dwindle, however,
                    toward the end of the novel. While enjoying his new jungle life and using
                    language and imagery inspired by the Shelleyan imagination, the narrator appears
                    to lose touch with the actual details of the play. As he recounts, <title
                        level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> for him <quote> conveyed a sense of
                        resurrection, an emergence from darkness . . . Certain verses I recalled
                        would have fitted in admirably with my desire to work on <emph>a text made
                            of simple and direct words</emph>: ‘Ah me! Alas, pain, pain, pain ever,
                        for ever!’&#8212;‘No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure.’ And then
                        those choruses of mountains, springs, storms, elements by which I was
                        surrounded and I felt. That voice of the Earth, at once Mother, clay, womb,
                        like the Mothers of Gods who still reign in the jungle. And those hounds of
                        hell who break into the drama and howl with the accent of maenads rather
                        than furies. ‘Ha! I scent life!’ ‘Let me but look into his eyes!’” (166,
                        emphasis added) </quote> Notwithstanding the narrator’s (and Carpentier’s)
                    palpable admiration for the drama, any careful reader of Shelley’s play will
                    detect the blatant misreading. Most obviously, the language of <title level="m"
                        >Prometheus Unbound</title> is neither simple nor direct. Nor are the furies
                    represented in Act I as agents of Dionysus. In an unusual manner, the above
                    lines interweave the fantastical aspects of Shelley’s drama with the narrator’s
                    inaccurate recollection of it.</p>
                <p>Yet these are not careless mistakes on Carpentier’s part. The mischaracterization
                    of Shelley’s work arrives at a fitting point in the novel when the narrator
                    stops idealizing the South American natives and landscape. This transformation
                    is signaled most pointedly and symbolically by the appearance of a copy of
                    Homer’s <title level="m">The Odyssey</title>. Snapping out of Shelleyan fantasy,
                    the narrator regains his “modern” consciousness. “But no,” he confesses, “it was
                    absurd to excite my imagination with [the cantata] when I did not have Shelley’s
                    poem there, and never would” (218). At this climactic juncture, rather than
                    resuming that “misbegotten Prelude to <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title>,” he decides instead to compose a cantata on <title
                        level="m">The Odyssey</title> (218). That is, the spell cast by Shelley’s
                    poetry is broken, as the turn to Homeric epic foreshadows not only the end of
                    the narrator’s sojourn in paradise but also his imminent return home to New
                    York.</p>
                <p>It is appropriate at this point in the novel that&#8212;as in the case with the
                    regeneration of the earth in <title level="m">Prometheus
                    Unbound</title>&#8212;veils and masks suddenly “fall.” Let us recall that, at
                    the end of Act III, the Spirit of the Hour declares: <quote>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>The painted veil, by those who were, called life,</l>
                            <l>Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread,</l>
                            <l>All men believed or hoped, is torn aside;</l>
                            <l><emph>The loathsome mask has fallen</emph>, the man remains</l>
                            <l>Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man</l>
                            <l>Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,</l>
                            <l>Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king</l>
                            <l>Over himself;</l>
                            <l rendition="#indent2">(III.iv.190–97, emphasis added)</l>
                        </lg>
                    </quote> When the characters in the play report that masks and veils have
                    fallen, they mean that the regenerated earth has shed the unnatural distortions
                    caused by tyranny and corruption&#8212;allowing thus a view of things as they
                    really are. In <title level="m">Los pasos perdidos</title>, however, Carpentier
                    transforms the ends of the Shelleyan trope. Rather than highlighting the
                    illusions generated by a tainted world, the fallen veils seemingly betray the
                    pitfalls of Shelley’s play. This can be detected when, feeling like an intruder,
                    the narrator suspects he “had torn the veil” of the primitive society (203).
                    While he understands that he has reached a “primordial sense of beauty . . . in
                    such remoteness” (163)&#8212;a landscape “unshaken since prehistoric times”
                    (165)&#8212;Carpentier, unlike Shelley, ceases to depict nature as idealized. In
                    the jungle, beauty stands beside coarseness: a “slimy tangle of snakes,”
                    “rampant fauna,” and “primeval slime” (160–61). The narrator experiences “a kind
                    of disorientation, and dizziness of the eyes . . . a [feeling] of being
                    completely lost” within such a wilderness (161). This passage is reminiscent of
                    the dizzying and intoxicating haze that overwhelms Asia during her descent
                    toward Demogorgon, especially with echoes of the <title level="a">Life of
                        Life</title> hymn from the second act’s fifth scene. But, unlike Asia, who
                    releases Demogorgon through her proto-psychoanalytic introspection, the narrator
                    believes himself to be an interloper in the prelapsarian landscape: “We were
                    intruders, ignorant outlanders . . . in a city born in the dawn of History”
                    (179). He unmasks, as it were, the Shelleyan fantasy and reconsiders the value
                    of returning to one’s alleged origins: “If we go back a little farther, we will
                    come to the terrible loneliness of the Creator, the . . . sadness of the times
                    without incense or songs of praise, when the earth was without order and empty,
                    and darkness was upon the face of the deep” (187). Surviving in this “prenatal
                    world” becomes impossible, as the narrator is incapable of reconciling the
                    disjunction between the primitive and modern worlds (206).</p>
                <p>The narrator’s retreat from the South American cradle of civilization, then,
                    abruptly brings Carpentier’s Shelleyan experiment to its end. Despite the
                    jungle’s allure of art, poetry, seclusion, and exile, as well as his
                    “irresistible” desire to finish his Shelleyan cantata, he remembers the lack of
                    paper and other modern tools that have deterred him from figuratively turning
                    back those “58 centuries” (206). Like Prometheus, he recants, retracting his
                    original desires of remaining in paradise. Unlike Prometheus, though, he
                    ultimately decides to return <foreign xml:lang="sp">allá</foreign> to New York
                    City. When the narrator boards a plane that arrived in search of him, he
                    abandons Rosario and the Shelleyan imagination alike. Carpentier magnifies the
                    tension at this moment by drawing one final time upon Shelley’s poetry. During
                    takeoff, the narrator discovers “an opalescent mist . . . [that] cut us off from
                    everything . . . a fleecy bank of clouds” (238–39).<note place="foot"
                        resp="author">Along her path in the underworld, Asia notes the “multitudes
                        of dense white fleecy clouds” that have filled her imagination
                        (II.i.145).</note> Though the narrator later tries to reverse his own “lost
                    steps” by returning to the South American jungle, the rising tide of the Amazon
                    blocks his entryway.</p>
                <p>Having retraced and allegedly rediscovered the “lost steps” of the human
                    community, the narrator willfully lets them go again. In so doing, he reveals
                    not only the irreducible gap created by time and error but also the incapacity
                    for art&#8212;especially in this case, Romantic literary writing&#8212;to heal
                    such wounds and fractures. In his tribute to and admiration for Shelley’s
                    lyrical drama, Carpentier’s profound engagement with the text also brings the
                    pitfalls of the utopian drama into relief. For, at least through the novel’s
                    depiction of the modern era of bourgeois capitalism, there exists neither a
                    redeeming Demogorgon nor a cosmic celebration of perpetual harmony. The secluded
                    and intimate South American jungle is not, after all, like Asia's and
                    Prometheus's cave of artistic cultivation, which sustains the renovated
                    universe. According to Carpentier’s conclusion,
                    this alternate prelapsarian South American space must remain elusive:
                    contained instead in hearts of darkness, chasms and caves of wonder, obscure
                    volumes, and even unfinished cantatas.</p>
