                <p rend="noCount">This essay focuses on Keats’s reception and critical influence through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges
                    and Julio Cortázar, the two giants of Argentine letters. Both writers depicted and identified Keats as a misunderstood
                    figure that needed to be rescued by their intervention. They seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own
                    intellectual community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” Cortázar and Borges’s reading
                    of Keats as a contemporary challenges the colonial view of Latin American literary creations as subsidiary of
                    the European tradition, renegotiating transatlantic dynamics of colonial cultural interactions. The essay
                    traces the theme of Negative Capability in Borges’s 1952 essay <title level="a">Keats’s Nightingale,</title> and
                    the chameleon figure in Julio Cortázar’s <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title>.</p>

            <p>During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many Latin American writers were
                fascinated by the aristocratic and legendary lives of British Romantic poets such as
                Byron and Shelley. Their poetic works had not only a literary but also a political
                impact in Spanish speaking countries, where they were seen as paradigmatic images of
                rebellion, independence, and revolution. These figures were incorporated and
                imported into the Latin American imagination as early as 1850 (as shown in this
                volume’s essays by Hart, Payán, and Insausti). Keats, however, did not enjoy the
                same celebrity; his short life was full of financial trouble, and it was very
                unlikely that he would inspire the imagination of the Latin American writers of the
                time, so avid of glamorous, Romantic heroism. His afterlives in this continent would
                not spark until the 1950s, when he was awoken by two Argentinian writers, Jorge Luis
                Borges and Julio Cortázar, who portray him as an odd presence of the English
                Romantic letters. They see in his image a reflection of their own condition as
                outsiders to the European canon. Although Keats is already established as a pillar
                of British poetry, they approach him as a sort of “minor” writer who has not yet
                received proper recognition. By strategically approaching Keats as an “underrated”
                predecessor, Borges and Cortázar succeed at transplanting him as a living presence
                into their own time and city of Buenos Aires, decades after the poet’s death in
                Rome. In Borges’s essay we will meet Keats by the fire of the family’s personal
                library. We will meet him again, later, walking arm in arm with Cortázar, wandering
                around the outskirts of the city.</p>
            <p>My analysis of these transatlantic dialogues trace two different readings. In Borges’s works,
                the Romantic poet is the object of celebratory odes and the topic of an insightful essay
                that underscores his uniqueness and originality. With his characteristic erudite irony,
                Borges proposes that Keats has been misunderstood by English critics, and offers himself
                as a poetic defense attorney that pleads for a corrective view of his works. Cortázar,
                on the other hand, rescues Keats’s image through a lengthy biography written between 1948
                and 1952, where he brings the Romantic poet as a pal that walks with him through Buenos
                Aires. Through an examination of these afterlives, I ask the question of how Cortázar and
                Borges invent their own image of the British poet in order to engage with him as equals.
                Subverting canonical and colonial hierarchies, both Argentinians draw portraits of Keats
                as a “marginal” and misunderstood poet that needs to be rescued by their intervention.
                They feel entitled to reinterpret and reassess the value of his works, to integrate his
                presence into their own community of intellectual peers&#8212;not as a master, but as a comrade-in-arms.</p>
            <p> It is no coincidence that two of the most prominent readers of Keats in Latin
                America happened to be from Argentina. Historically, this country was shaped and
                transformed by waves of immigration from the early nineteenth century through the
                first half of the twentieth. During these decades, the immigration of Europeans was
                not only well regarded, but encouraged and even facilitated by government
                policies.<note place="foot" resp="author"> During 1852–1923 Argentina adopted a
                    policy of “libertad de inmigración” which allowed European citizens to migrate
                    to the country and receive the same rights and benefits as the locals. In some
                    occasions the government also helped with the cost of relocation that
                    incentivized the influx of migrants. For more information on this subject,
                    see Fernando Devoto’s <title level="a">Ideas, políticas y prácticas migratorias
                        argentinas en una perspectiva de largo plazo (1852–1950).</title></note> Like
                many other South American countries, after declaring its
                independence, the recently constituted Nation of Argentina sought to find its path
                towards progress and modernization. The feeling of belatedness in comparison to
                Europe caused the former colonies to look towards the Old Continent in search of
                political, intellectual and economic models. Politicians such as Domingo Faustino
                Sarmiento were convinced that by importing goods, products, and ideas, the country
                would promptly make its way into “civilization.”<note place="foot" resp="author">See
                    Faustino Sarmiento’s <title level="m">Facundo: Civilización y
                            Barbarie</title> and his dycotomic división between European “civilization”
                            and American “barbarism.”</note> Following the same logic, he opened the borders and invited citizens
                from Italy, France, Spain, and England&#8212;among others&#8212;to settle in Argentina, under
                the belief that the migratory waves would transform the country into a modern and
                prosperous European-like state. I will not comment here on the problematic ideology
                behind these political decisions, nor about its socio-economic consequences. I
                allude to this historical event only to underline the fact that during these years,
                there was an important presence of European cultural goods, art objects, and ideas
                that were brought into the country by the families and individuals who established
                themselves here. The immigrants who came to Argentina and settled in the country
                brought with them not only a work force, industrial knowledge, machinery, and
                economic practices, but also their own languages, objects, and even their private
                book collections. </p>
            <p>This was the case of Jorge Luis Borges’s ancestors. Following the accounts that the
                author provides about the history of his family in his <title level="m">Autobiographic
                Essay</title>, Emir Rodriguez Monegal reminds us of Borges’s
                English origins and alludes to the formative influence of the British grandmother
                who, “though she had come to Argentina as a young woman and had married an Argentine
                … continued to inhabit the English speaking world” (15). In his well-documented
                biography, Rodriguez Monegal tells the story of Fanny Haslam’s arrival to Argentina,
                her marriage to Francisco Borges, and the years she lived in the same household with
                both of Jorge Luis’ parents (7–9). Under Fanny’s care, Georgie&#8212;as he was called by
                his relatives&#8212;grew up speaking English at home and “learned to read in this language
                before he did in Spanish” (15). The importance of providing an English education in
                the Borges family is not to be underestimated: not only was the language used within
                the household but was also a fundamental part of their schooling. Instead of sending
                young Jorge Luis to a public institution, his father hired an English governess to
                oversee the first years of his son’s education (Rodriguez Monegal 98). This decision
                was not motivated exclusively by a nostalgic&#8212;and undoubtedly colonial&#8212;attachment to
                the traditions and culture of Europe. As the Uruguayan biographer observes, it must
                also be understood within the frame of historical events:
                <quote>
                …there was then rampant in Argentina a sort of pro-British snobbery that would
                dominate Buenos Aires society as the century advanced … This change had an economic
                base … the independence of the River Plate area was achieved under the aegis of British diplomacy and
                commerce. Until World War II, Argentina belonged to the pound sterling international
                trading zone and was virtually part of the Commonwealth. (18)
                </quote>
                The role England played in the development of industry, trade, politics, and culture
                was such that during the last quarter of the century, as Erika Beckman reminds us,
                Argentina formed part of what historians have called “Britain’s ‘informal’ empire”
                    (112).<note place="foot" resp="author">To understand the complexities of the
                        Anglo-Argentinian relationships, see Gordon Bridger’s book
                        <title level="m">Britain and the Making of Argentina</title>.</note></p>
            <p> In this context of commercial and cultural attachment, where the consumption of
                European culture and products was equated with the aqcuisition of a “civilized”
                status, it is not surprising to find spaces that symbolically embody this admiration
                and dependence. This is the case of Borges’s family collection, full of “unlimited
                English books,” which Jorge Luis speaks of with marvel: “If I were asked to name the
                chief event in my life, I should say it was my father’s library. In fact, sometimes
                I think I have never strayed out of that library” (quoted by Rodriguez Monegal 3).
                It is in this room&#8212;remembered by Borges as a mythical space&#8212;that he one night felt
                the revelation of poetry as he heard his father recite the <title level="a">Ode To a Nightingale.</title>
                This is also the moment when his apprectiation for Keats started, as did his
                life-long dialogue with the poet. In a house of British descendants located on the
                outskirts of Buenos Aires, amongst an admirable collection of English books, began
                the first of Keats’s Argentinian afterlives discussed here.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">For critical studies that analyze the relation between Borges and Keats,
                    see María A. Rosarossa’s <title level="a">Keats en Borges,</title> where she gives a
                    thorough account and analysis of the symbolic presence of the nightingale in several
                    short stories of the Argentine writer. See also Jason Wilson’s essay included in the
                    commemorative book, <title level="m">Keats, Borges and the
                            Nightingale</title>.</note></p>
            <p> In <title level="m">Otras inquisitionces</title> (1952), Borges includes an essay
                entitled <title level="a">El ruiseñor de Keats</title> (<title level="a">Keats’s
                Nightingale</title>). This text puts forwards an
                interpretation of the famous ode where Borges underscores an opposition between
                human transcience and poetic immortality. Borges analyzes this poem as a reflection
                upon the atemporality of the poetic rapture that is presented as successive across
                the ages and is, therefore, eternal. The nightingale is adopted as the symbolic
                image of this phenomenon and when it is perceived, the poetic mystery is momentarily
                revealed. However, this revelation also brings about awareness of one’s own
                mortality: when confronted with the sublime feeling of beauty and eternity, humans
                are reminded of their own death. Though Borges’s interpretation is interesting,
                there is not much novelty in it. What I want to highlight instead as an original
                approach in his text is the fact that Borges insists on drawing a portrait of Keats
                as a “marginal” and misundersood figure. In order to do so, he skillfully combines
                biographical information with critical readings of the ode to put forward a rather
                heterodox interpretation. </p>
            <p> In the opening lines of the essay, Borges alludes, almost as in passing, to the
                hardships that defined Keats’s life:
                <quote>
                Sick with tuberculosis, poor and perhaps also unfortunate in love, at the age of
                twenty-three, on one April night of 1819, he composed the <title level="a">Ode to a Nightingale.</title> In
                that suburban garden, he heard the eternal nightingale of Ovid and Shakespeare, and
                he felt his own mortality, and he contrasted it to the tenuous everlasting voice of
                the invisible bird.” (II: 95)<note place="foot" resp="author">All translations of texts

                His appropriation of the Romantic poet emphasizes the elements that make of him an
                underdog, a “suburbian” presence with regards to his environment and to the English
                tradition. The insistence on drawing his portrait according to the legend of “poor
                Keats,” as well as his emphatic location of the poet in a “jardin suburbano,”
                responds to the centrifugal force by which Borges tries to pull the Romantic poet
                towards a position of symbolic marginality. And by doing so, he succeeds in locating
                himself in a position of parity with his English peer. The essay elaborates on this
                “creative misreading”&#8212;using Harold Bloom’s critical term&#8212;and uses additional
                critical materials to reinforce a fringe-reading of Keats. It is not by chance nor a
                mere adherence to conventions that Borges forefronts this information. The dramatic
                effect of this presentation moves the reader to interpret his sickness and poverty
                as signs announcing Keats’s isolation and estrangement. By highlighting this, Borges
                applies the first brush strokes of a portrait that fits the legend of “poor Keats”
                which, as Edward Hirsch observes, “comes not only from his early detractors … but
                also from some of his later admirers” (xvii). What we find in the letters, as well
                as in the many reliable biographies of the poet (Lowell, Roe, Bate), is that the
                spring of 1819 was not such a terrible season for Keats. Although the first signs of
                his illness were already manifest, his health had not yet dramatically deteriorated.
                Following the death of his brother, he is constantly sourrounded by close friends
                and keeps a most active social life. Additionally, he has just met Fanny Brawne and
                they have fallen in love. None of this comes across in the depiction that Borges
                offers, where we find a much more passive, frail, and isolated character. The
                Argentine author selects a number of facts that fit into the legend of the feeble
                and sensitive artist outcasted by his society. By creating a narrative that
                coherently reinforces this view, the displacement of the English writer to a
                position of marginality allows Borges to situate himself in a relation of closeness
                and empathy from which he can advocate for his predecesor. </p>
            <p>Simultaneously, as he builds up the case of margnizalization that calls for a
                corrective intervention, Borges advances a veiled tactic of identification: by
                pointing out that the place of composition of the ode was a suburban garden, he
                draws a parallel with his own biography. He wishes to stress the fact that he and
                Keats are located on the peripheries of their respective cities. Both Keats and
                Borges are poets of the outskirts. What appears as a seemingly anecdotal remark
                points to a more complex strategy of shifting towards the margins of cultural
                centers. Symbolically, Borges is trying to dislodge this celebrated bard from his
                pedestal and drags him back out to the outposts of the English tradition. While
                recognizing his centrality for the canon of British poetry, Borges is more
                interested in emphasizing the image of an isolated Keats who does not fully belong
                to London society. By placing him back in the suburbs, the Argentine writer starts
                laying the suggestion that will be developed in further paragraphs: to encounter
                Keats, to dialogue freely with him, they must meet outside of the charted maps of
                metropolis. As they move away from the established cultural centers, hierarchies
                weaken and the stability of literary institutions starts to fade out, allowing for
                alternative networks of connection to be created and relations of influence to be
                renegotiated. </p>
            <p>Before moving forward with this portrayal of Keats, a note on the notion of Borges’s
                sense of marginality is needed. The notion of a not-subordinate “periphery” becomes
                fundamental to understand Borges’s dialogues with other Western cultures and
                literary figures. In 1992, Beatriz Sarlo presented a series of lectures on the works
                of the Argentinian writer where she proposed to understand him as a “writer on the
                edge.” The central concept of her study was that of the “border,” and she analyzed
                Borges’s literature as one that is issued from gaps, spaces in between frontiers,
                and blurried limits. Sarlo points out that Borges’s poetry and fictions explore the
                imaginary spaces dividing the city and the countryside, the idealized epic past and
                his own present time, mythology and history, fiction and reality. Similarly, she
                observes how his writings are built upon a dialogue between national and
                cosmopolitan elements that intertwine and create a territory of exchange, tension,
                and hybridization. The Argentine author oscillates between local elements with which
                he does not totally identify, and the “nostalgia for a European culture which can
                never wholly offer an alternative cultural base” (Sarlo). By locating himself in the
                margins of his own culture and in the sidelines of other traditions, he makes his
                literature shift from one border to others, constantly renewing lines of attachment
                and familiarity to each side:
                <quote>
                By reinventing a national tradition, Borges also offers Argentine culture an oblique
                reading of Western literatures. From the edge of the West, Borges achieves a
                literature that is related to foreign literature but not in any subordinate way…
                (Sarlo)
                </quote>
                In accordance with Sarlo’s view of Borges as a writer on the margins, I would like to
                expand her idea and consider the Argentinian intellectual also as a “reader of
                edges.” From his self-assumed position as an outsider, he reshuffles the networks of
                literary tradition, bringing to light unexplored faces of canonic writers and
                uncharted paths of connection between texts that would otherwise remain foreign to
                each other. The reading of other authors as if they were also in the edges of their
                own time and space allows for the creation of alternative options of spatial and
                chronological organization that do not need to conform to the constrains of
                geographical proximity or linear historicity. What Borges as a reader of peripheries
                gains is the possibility to playfuly appropriate elements from the central tradition
                in order to bring them outside of their original circles in order to playfully
                rearrange them, reinvent new constellations and move around grativational centers. </p>
            <p>But let us return now to Borges’s portrayal of Keats and the interpretation of his
                poetry. After this presentation of the background and biographical information of
                the English poet, Borges claims that Keats’s <title level="a">Ode To a Nightingale</title> has been
                essentially misunderstood by Anglophone intellectuals and critics. First he points
                at what, in his opinion, is the most remarkable aspect of the poem: Keats’s
                intuitive vision of the bird as a platonic archetype. He contrasts his platonic
                reading of the poem with that of other scholars he deems erroneous. In his essay,
                Borges quotes Sidney Colvin’s opinion as a first example misinterpretation:
                <quote>
                In his monographic work about Keats, published in 1887, Sideney Colvin …
                <emph>perceived or invented</emph> a difficulty in the aforementioned
                [seventh] stanza. I transcribe his curious declaration: “by a breach of logic which
                is also, I think, a flaw in the poetry, he contrasts the transitoriness of human
                life, meaning the life of the individual, with the permanence of the song-bird’s
                life, meaning the life of the type” (II: 95, emphasis added)
                </quote>
                With his characteristic irony, Borges labels Colvin’s observation as “voluntary”
                misperception. As he questions the validity of the division between the individual
                and the type set by the critic, he also undermines the opinion of other scholars who
                adhere to this premise: Robert Briges, F.R. Leavis, and H.W. Garrod (95). He is less
                severe with the opinion of Amy Lowell, for whom the nightingale of the poem should
                be interpreted only as the “species nightingale,”<note place="foot" resp="author">The
                    passage by Amy Lowell that Borges refers to
                            is the following: “Stanza seven has been the cause of much foolish
                            chatter. In calling the nightingale ‘immortal bird’ and contrasting its
                            eternity of life with individual man’s short existence, any one with a
                            spark of imaginative or poetical feeling realizes at once that Keats is
                            not referring to the particular Nightingale singing at that instant, but
                            to the species nightingale” (252).</note> and not as an individual presence. Borges goes on to drastically
                deny that there is any opposition whatsoever between the actual bird heard by Keats
                “on one April night of 1819” and the generic image.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is
                    interesting to note that Borges incorrectly dates the composition of the poem: he dates
                    it in April while Lowell clearly states, “we know the Nightingale to have been written
                    in May” (237).</note> To support his opinion, he turns to Schopenhauer’s theory of
                archetypes and quotes from <title level="m">The World as Will and
                    Representation</title>:
                <quote>
                Ask yourself honestly whether the swallow of this year’s spring is an entirely
                different one from the swallow of the first spring, and whether actually between the
                two the miracle of creation out of nothing has been renewed a million times, in
                order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation. (II: 482)
                </quote>
                This excerpt provides an endorsement to interpret the nightingale as an embodiment of
                a platonic form. From the perspective of the German philosopher, the bird heard by
                Keats repeats the same song as all other nightingales that ever existed. This
                reading was, to Borges, just too evident, and he is puzzled by fact that no English
                reader had been able to solve the question sooner: “How did Garrad, Leavis, and the
                like, not get to this interpretation?” (II: 95). In a provocative statement, he
                ascribes this blindness to what, in his opinion, is an essential trait of the
                British character:
                <quote>
                Men, says Coleridge, are born Aristotelian or Platonic. One could say that the
                English mind was born Aristotelian. What is real, for this type of mentality, are
                not the abstract concepts, but the individualities; not the generic nightingale, but
                the concrete nightingales. It is only natural, inevitable perhaps, that the <title level="m">Ode to
                a nightingale</title> was not rightfully understood in England. (II: 96)
                </quote>
                Borges adopts Coleridge’s philosophical binary categorization as a tool to emphasize
                his representation of Keats as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal compris</foreign>. Through this
                reductive division, he is able to disconnect the Romantic writer from the “British”
                mental sphere, and he offers a depiction of an unfortunate Platonist isolated among
                Aristotelians. The Argentine even offers an <foreign xml:lang="la">excusatio</foreign> that
                reinforces his ultimate goal of detaching Keats from the intellectual habitat of his
                country: “No one should read in the previously stated ideas a sign of disaproval or
                disdain … [The Englishman] does not understand the <title level="m">Ode to a
                    Nightingale,</title> but that valuable misunderstanding allows him to become a
                Locke, a Berkeley, a Hume” (97). This elegant attack, disguised as an <emph>encomium</emph>,
                is intended to build up the accusation that will
                open a necessary space for his own intervention. Reading and speaking from the
                outside of British tradition, Borges feels entitled to offer a corrective judgement
                of one of the main English poets and with utmost irreverence he defies the
                hierarchical organisation that relegates him to a place of subordination. He turns
                the tables around and locates himself in a position of intellectual superiority that
                symbolically refutes any colonial dependency or belatedness with regards to Europe.
                South-American intellectuals, he seems to assert, are sufficiently prepared to beat
                Europeans at their own games. </p>
            <p> In the essay previously analysed, Borges relies on the legend of “poor Keats” to
                depict a frail and contemplative young boy touched by poetic illumination. Other
                biographers and intellectuals, however, recognize that there is another side to his
                life that must be accounted for: that of the lively, energetic, and curiosity-driven
                young man. Nicholas Roe, for instance, highlights the fact that if, on the one hand,
                we have a “‘a sickly boy of pretty abilities’ who had missed his path in the world,”
                it is also necessary to see in him the “sturdy twenty-two-year-old, who strode six
                hundred miles around Scotland” (xv). Julio Cortázar is very keen to perceive this
                other facet of Keats, and it is in this light that he will compose his literary
                biography. For Cortázar, the Romantic writer appears as a presence full of joy,
                creativity, and poetic intelligence. His depiction is much closer to the impression
                that Roe gives, where the poet is described as “vigorous, colorful and animated”
                (xv), “a smart, streetwise creature&#8212;restless, pugnacious” (xvi). As we will now see,
                in his second Argentine afterlife, Keats does not inhabit the library of a suburban
                house; he appears as an energetic walker and an adventurous explorer. </p>
            <p> If Borges identified the nightingale as Keats’s totemic animal, Cortázar opted for
                the chameleon. The main characteristic that Cortázar highlights is his sympathetic
                capacity, the ability to become one with the other, and the ability to establish
                links of identification outside of the realms of one’s own subjectivity. In an
                attempt to present the Romantic poet as a living presence beyond his short life and
                the borders of British circles, the literary biography
                <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> opens up as a
                complex artifact in which Cortázar is able to relive part of Keats’s existence, and
                Keats can experience the contemporary Buenos Aires of his interlocutor (Ana Martínez
                196). Thanks to a chamaleonic strategy of identification, Cortázar perceives his
                immediate reality through the eyes of the English poet to which he also lends his
                words. This sensibility of empathy and synchronicity resonates clearly with the
                “capacity of trascending the self, which Keats calls negative capability” (Linda Von
                Pfahl 453). The biographer becomes, then, a sort of “chameleon Poet” who&#8212;borrowing a
                passage from the famous letter to Woodhouse&#8212;“is perhaps not speaking from [himself];
                but from some character in whose soul [he] now live[s]” (Keats 501). Cortázar
                engages in a process of identification with this “other” and, by doing so, develops
                the capacity of adopting “metamorphic identities, which furnish him with constant
                symapthetic identifications” (Li Ou 6). This aspect of the Keatsian negative
                capability is clearly recognizable throughout the biography, but I wish to highlight
                several passages when this phenomenon stands out more vividly. </p>
            <p>First, Cortázar draws a parallel between Keats’s journey to Scotland and his own
                excursion to Chile:
                <quote>
                I do not know why the trip to the north that John Keats is about to undertake in 1818
                brings me back to my own hiking trip in Chile. It is maybe because the two
                expeditions were mainly by foot and through landscapes surrounded by mountains and
                lakes… Upon my return from that trip I understood better Keats’s tour around
                Scotland and the region of the lakes. Without any touristic sentimentalization of
                it, I understood his state of mind: alert and vigilant before a reality that only
                partially captures his attention. (178–79)
                </quote>
                By recreating a journey that is comparable to Keats’s hiking tour through Scotland,
                Cortázar retrospectively remembers his own his trek in the Chilean mountains as a
                process of “becoming” John. A phenomenon of reflection allows Cortázar to see his
                life through the lens of Keats’s biography. What this excerpt shows is that the
                Argentinian, following the practice of emptying out the self, uses this strategy of
                sympathetic identification as an epistemological tool. </p>
            <p> A second example of chameleonism resonates even more clearly with the Keatsian
                practice of openness and receptivity. As Cortázar recounts his first trip to Italy
                and recounts the feeling of awe that he experiences before the marvel of Greek
                sculptures, he borrows the words and the empathetic capacities of Keats himself to
                narrate this overwhelming experience:
                <quote>
                I remember that a year ago I went to the museum in Naples, one morning of powdery
                light rain. That was my first reencounter with Greece. Annihilated, haunted, I was
                not thinking, I was not understanding, I was not comparing. Later I had something
                like a revelation, in which during those hours, I had been <emph>nobody</emph>,
                    replaced by&#8212;how should I say this?&#8212;the statues that looked at
                themselves, that recognized themselves. It was as if they were chasing me away,
                throwing me out, but not “outside of my own being,” because the one being ousted was
                precisely my “self,” to the point where there was nothing outside of the marble
                recognizing one another, looking at each other, and enjoying themselves.
                (265–66)
                </quote>
                This description of the museum shows a striking similarity with Keats’s own ideas and
                words, to the point where it could almost be read as a personal rewriting of the
                famous October 1818 letter:
                <quote>
                As to the poetical Character itself… it is not itself&#8212;it has no self&#8212;It is everything

                room with People, if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain,
                then, not myself goes home to myself, but the identity of every one in the room
                begins to press upon me, so that I am in a very little time annihilated. (Keats
                500–501)
                </quote>
                Not only does Cortázar copy words, concepts, and even phrasings from this passage,
                but he also adopts the same philosophy of poetic anihilation. In a two-folded
                mimetic exercise, the Argentine embodies simultaneously Keats&#8212;on a textual level&#8212;and
                the statues he is contemplating&#8212;on his circumstantial plane.</p>
            <p> Keats’s “negative capability” also has an influence in Cortázar’s world view that
                goes beyond the biographic identification pointed out earlier. For the Argentinian
                writer, this empathetic ability also gains aesthetic, political, and ethical
                resonances. Ana del Castillo and Ana Martínez Santa recognize the fundamental
                importance that “negative capability” had in the development of Cortázar’s poetics
                and trace the presence of the “sympathetic imagination” in his novels and shorts
                stories. Both scholars follow trails of the symbolic presence of the chameleon all
                the way to the 1967 book <title level="m">La vuelta al día en ochenta mundos</title>,
                in which Cortázar includes a short piece entitled <title level="a">Casilla del camaleón</title>
                (<title level="a">Chameleon’s square</title>). Here, Keats’s poetic theory is subjected to an unexpected
                political reading. In a heterodox interpretation of the chameleon theory, the author
                understands Keats’s sympathetic identification as a humanist force with a political
                implication: the unfailing recognition of other as equal. He frames this
                interpretation in what he calls a “Latin American time” and defends the importance
                of a poet like Keats in times when artists and intellectuals are judged based on
                their historical engagement (<title level="m">La vuelta</title> 189). Cortázar does
                not hide his leftist affiliations and makes a strong defense of them, but also
                stands up for the validity and necessity of literary figures who do not restrict
                their works to ideological objectives. His vindication of Keats is thus very
                significant within the Latin American context. In the first place, it rehabilitates
                an aesthetic and sensitive approach to literature in a period when this option was
                considered out of fashion and socially irresponsible. Secondly, it provides the
                English poet with a letter of recommendation that grants him an entrance to Latin
                American circles where he would not have been admited otherwise. </p>
            <p> Julio Cortázar also perceived Keats as a “peripheral” figure and highlighted this
                condition with the purpose of relating to him as an equal. Through an act of
                creative misreading, the Argentine biographer dislodges Keats outside of the
                boundaries of his own time and relates to him as a contemporary. In
                <title level="m">Imagen</title>, Cortázar creates the illusion that they both coexist
                in the margins of chronological time and meet in a dimension where temporal and
                geographic distances have been collapsed<note place="foot" resp="author">Olivia Loksing
                    Moy’s article <title level="a">From Hampstead to Buenos Aires and Beyond: Anticipating Worlds in Julio Cortázar’s
                    <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title></title> offers an excellent analysis of the collapsing of temporal
                    references in Cortázar’s texts. Moy cleverly explores the sense of “transtemporality” in
                    <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> through the perspective of Way Chee Dimock’s
                        concept of “deep time,” and offers an interesting take on Cortázar’s position in the
                        map of World Literature.</note>.
                As temporal linearity is challenged in the pages of this biography, the sense of
                belatedness is also contested by Cortázar. From the opening pages of the
                introduction, it is made evident that the Argentinian does not look up to the
                British poet from a subsidiary position but speaks to him as an equal and challenges
                any assumptions of hierarchical subordination. The structure of their interaction
                does not reproduce a colonial pattern of defferent imitation and submission but,
                rather, maps a horizontal line of exchange. In the chapter labeled <title level="a">Methodology,</title>
                Cortázar states:
                <quote>
                [I am going to write with] Keats on my arm; a more natural way to get to know him,
                rather than the usual manner, where the poor guy is put up on a cloud as the
                literary critics throw together a couple of chairs and tables to build a stage that
                he didn’t even need in the first place… And all this forms a part of this Keats,
                because I’m not going to write about him, I’m going to walk by his side. (19)
                </quote>
                Rejecting the academic perspective in favor of a more familiar approach, Cortázar
                questions chronological lines, geographic divisions, and epistemological categories.
                Not only does he pretend to inhabit the same time and place as his peer, he also
                offers an alternative&#8212;and very Keatsian&#8212;way of access to literary knowledge: an
                empathetic identification. This is accurately observed by Steven Boldy:
                <quote>
                <title level="m">Imagen de John Keats</title> is a competent
                academic study… but it is also the day-to-day chronicle of an intimate friendship,
                and of the connections he builds with a poet “friend,” a model he admires. It is, at
                the same time, the chronicle of this relation and that of the writing of the book:
                Cortázar walks arm in arm with Keats in the streets of Buenos Aires and Hampstead.
                The phenomenon of identification is powerful… (18)
                </quote>
                In the reconstruction of Keats’s literary biography Cortázar appears as an
                unapologetic and daring misreader. His goal is not that of rendering a faithful and
                elegiac homage to an English master. On the contrary, he strives to recognize Keats
                as a quotidian and tangible presence:
                <quote>
                … in the past weeks John’s physical presence has haunted me more and more as I read
                his letters… All of a sudden he is so close by my side that it frightens me ... I
                see him, he is here; time yields to this tangential contact that drops me in 1819,
                in this suburb of time… in the heaths of Hampstead. (<title level="m">Imagen</title>
                214)
                </quote>
                The text evidences a chronological multidirectionality that drops Cortázar into the
                Hampstead of 1819 and brings Keats to the Buenos Aires of 1950. This is, for Boldy,
                one of the most interesting aspects of the book: “the way by which the Romantic
                English poet becomes a contemporary of … Julio Cortázar. The latter, as a scholar,
                shows a profound knowledge of Keats and his epoch, as well as of his fellow Romantic
                writers … but he also affirms that it is necessary to read Keats as a contemporary
                voice” (19). Bondy recognizes the originality of the particular temporal
                displacement performed by Cortázar: he does not only transplant himself to the past
                as a meticulous historian, but also allows this poet from the nineteenth century to
                live, act, and speak in the present time, where he recognizes him as an active
                formative presence:
                <quote>
                … I cannot <emph>feel</emph> Keats in the past. I
                don’t run into Keats on the street, nor do I expect to hear his voice over the
                phone
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">(and how beautiful it would have been to hear his voice, seeing him coming, short as
                he was, a little commoner, treating himself to a laugh)</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#indent1">but sometimes, I’m wandering around and I do run into poets of my own time and John
                is one of them. (<title level="m">Imagen</title> 52–53)</p>
                </quote>
                Cortázar recognizes the limitations of the knowledge he can achieve through
                intellectual explorations. As a historian and a biographer, he can only draw a
                partial understanding of the person that was Keats, of his intuitions of beauty, his
                capacity for irradiating poetry. For he is unable to “feel” Keats in this dimension,
                he seeks to recognize in his environment the elements and people that evoke his
                presence. Reversing the direction of Keats’s sympathetic capacity, Cortázar searches
                for those of whom, in this time, awaken the memory and the presence of Keats. </p>
            <p> The dialectic movement in time that structures <title level="m">Imagen de John
                    Keats</title> attests to a search for an alternative idea of contemporaneousness.
                Instead of relying on temporal coincidence, the Argentinian proposes an idea that is
                very close to T.S. Eliot’s notion of tradition as a simultaneous order of
                existence:
                <quote>
                    Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot
                    be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labor. It involves,
                    in the first place, the historical sense … and the historical sense involves a
                    perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the
                    historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in
                    his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from
                    Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a
                    simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order. (38)
                </quote>
                For Eliot, past and present coexist in this imaginary dimension, and Virgil is
                virtually as close to Baudelaire as he is to Ezra Pound&#8212;his <title level="m">Four
                    Quartets</title> and <title level="m">The Waste Land</title> are a faithful testimony
                and an illustration of this principle. The same functional reorganization of history
                can be recognized in <title level="m">Imagen</title>, where the categories of temporal
                and geographic distance have been suspended. If the nineteenth-century poet can be
                seen as a contemporary it is because, to the eyes of Cortázar, both inhabit a
                dimension where the notion of proximity is determined by aesthetic, philosophical,
                and artistic affinities. This flexible notion of time and tradition allows him to
                knit an elaborate network of synchronicity that brings together otherwise distant
                authors. <title level="m">Imagen</title> includes a constellation
                of other poets that the Argentine biographer also declares as citizens of Keats’s
                time: Rimbaud, Rilke, Valéry, Saint-John Perse, Neruda, and García Lorca, among
                others. In the chapter <title level="a">Being in the World,</title> Cortázar identifies, for instance, two
                of the most remarkable Spanish readers of Keats: Vicente Aleixandre (1898–1984) and
                Luis Cernuda (1902–1963). Despite the historical, cultural, and temporal gaps that
                divide them, Cortázar recognizes in them a fundamental “coincidence of attitudes and
                lyric production” that allow him to conceive them as “kindred Spanish-speaking
                poets; close to him, similar to him,” to his dear Keats (253).</p>
            <p> The two Keatsian afterlives that I have presented in the previous pages continue to
                be the most remarkable and significant readings of this Romantic poet in Latin
                America. As I have shown, Cortázar and Borges, writing from outside of the English
                tradition, claim the right to reappropriate Keats’s works and to integrate him as
                part of their most intimate and immediate cultural landscape. Both of them compose
                personal portraits and adapt the image of the nightingale and the chameleon to their
                own cultural landscape. By doing so, they readjust the divisions between center and
                periphery, challenging national, cultural, linguistic and academic boundaries. Their
                gestures of “irreverence” towards the canon and the centrality of the English
                tradition are far more significant than a playful demystification. What Cortázar and
                Borges achieve by bringing the dialogue to a familiar level is opening alternative
                symbolic spaces of interaction between Latin America and Europe. </p>
            <p> The sense of arriving belatedly to the “banquet of civilization”&#8212;as Alfonso Reyes
                states it (5)&#8212;was particularly acute in Latin America throughout the nineteenth
                century. In the early twentieth century, the movement of “modernismo” was the first
                to claim the right to a cosmopolitan culture and to dialogue with traditions beyond
                the peninsular Spanish heritage. From this moment on, the debate about the place of
                Latin America on the map of Western and world culture was remarkably animated.
                Cortázar and Borges are two examples of cosmopolitan intellectuals who defend the
                right of Latin American writers, artists and intellectuals to be recognized as part
                of that “universal” tradition to which, writing from a peripheral space, they did
                not have full access. Echoing Borges, Cortázar makes a strong defense of the idea
                that Latin America has as much right to profit from European traditions as any other
                intellectual from England, France, the United States, or any other country. Their
                literary dialogues with Keats are an example of the attitude towards culture that
                Borges described in his famous essay, <title level="a">The Argentine Writer and The Tradition</title>:
                <quote>
                I believe our tradition is all of Western culture, and I also believe we have a right
                to this tradition, greater than that which the inhabitants of one or another Western
                nation might have ... I believe that we Argentines, we South Americans in general,
                are in an analogous situation; we can handle all European themes, handle them
                without superstition, with an irreverence which can have, and already does have,
                fortunate consequences. (I: 274)
                </quote>
                The self-assumed peripheral condition of Borges and Cortázar, as I have argued,
                becomes a condition of productivity. The strategy of writing and reading
                from the margins, allows them to engage differently with the canon of European
                literary tradition. Instead of perpetuating a logic of submission and imitation,
                they actively engage in a renegotiation of their place in the broader western and
                universal tradition.</p>
