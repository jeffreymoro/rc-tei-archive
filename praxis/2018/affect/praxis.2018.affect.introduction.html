               <p>This volume presents new work by scholars working at the intersection of British Romanticism
                  and affect studies. The past two decades have seen a growing interest in the use of
                  affect theory, cognitive science, phenomenology, and neuroscience to reconceptualize
                  theories of feeling and emotion in British Romantic writing. This “affective turn”
                  has renewed emphasis on emotion, which experienced relative marginalization in new
                  historicist scholarship throughout the 1980s and 90s. Once dismissed as ideologically
                  suspect, emotion has been put to increasingly sophisticated use by literary critics,
                  often in relation to affect’s effects on the body and its relationship to emotion,
                  cognition, and action. Much more than a passing trend, affect studies has transformed
                  the study of emotion for a generation of scholars.

               <p>While much of the foundational work in affect studies tends toward the theoretical
                  and scientific, an influential group of Romanticists has shaped the field in relation
                  to literature, culture, and history. In particular, scholars such as Joel Faflak,
                  Mary Favret, Steven Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch, Alan Richardson, and Richard
                  Sha have applied affect theory and cognitive science to the study of Romantic texts,
                  revising our understanding of the emotions in relation to thought and action.

                  </div> This unique exchange between Romanticism and affect studies has produced a body of
                  important scholarship that fruitfully crosses disciplinary boundaries. The essays
                  in this volume both capitalize on and extend this scholarship in new and exciting
                  ways, demonstrating the broad application and theorization of “affect” in Romantic-era
                  studies. Each essay takes a different approach to affect and emotion, from a piece
                  on Joanna Baillie’s passion plays, co-written by a literary scholar and a cognitive
                  psychologist, to a piece by Mark Lussier that utilizes affect theory and rhythmic
                  studies in a reading of William Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1793). This volume does not propose a single definition of “affect” or “emotion,”
                  but all of the essays share the conviction that the kind of interdisciplinary work
                  demanded by affect studies is beneficial to both Romantic studies <em>and </em>affect studies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>While “affect studies” refers to a broad range of scholarship rather than a unified
                  movement with a shared theoretical or methodological perspective, affect theory has
                  taken two general trajectories relevant to British Romanticism. The first reflects
                  interest in the writings of American psychologist Silvan Tomkins, who argued for nine
                  “primary affects” rooted in biology.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Tomkins’s writings on emotion and affect from the 1960s have inspired a range of studies
                  on the physiological basis of affect, including work by Eve Sedgwick and Patricia
                  Clough, as well as research in affective neuroscience.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Scholars in this group propound the Basic Emotions paradigm, which asserts that primary
                  affects operate on a different system than cognition. Primary <em>affects</em> such as fear and joy are automatic responses to external triggers, as opposed to <em>emotions</em> like love or hate, which require memory, reflection, and awareness.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This Basic Emotions paradigm presents perhaps the most contentious debate within affect
                  studies: cognitivist vs. anti-intentionalist arguments. Are we really in control of
                  our thoughts, actions, and responses to external stimuli? Or are we pre-programmed,
                  in a sense, feeling and responding <em>before</em> cognition and volition? The Basic Emotions paradigm suggests the latter, and, in doing
                  so, brings up pressing questions about agency, ethics, and action. Theorists and scientists
                  continue research in these areas without consensus.

                           bear on affect theory in literary and cultural studies: (1) James-Lang theory understands
                           emotion as an interpretive result of autonomic physiological response; (2) Cannon-Bard
                           theory understands autonomic response and emotion as occurring simultaneously; (3)
                           Schachter and Singer’s cognitive-arousal theory understands emotion as the result
                           of both autonomic response and cognitive attributions; and (4) Lazarus’ theory argues
                           that thought precedes emotion and physiological arousal. For a useful essay on debates

                  </div> Meanwhile, scholars such as Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ruth Leys, and Richard Sha see too
                  much agreement among affect theorists. Why is it, Leys asks, that so many affect theorists
                  champion anti-intentionalism, while philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars
                  gravitate toward a neglected cognitivism? Barrett and Sha also worry about this anti-intentionalist
                  strand, which essentially argues for emotion and cognition as separate systems wherein
                  “concepts like the human, the subject, and agency” are left behind (Sha, “The Turn
                  to Affect” 260). Leys suggests that we need more social and cognitive psychological
                  research, and, significantly, that we also need to embrace literary approaches to
                  affect: one hesitation among affect theorists to abandon the Basic Emotions paradigm
                  is that “intentionalist interpretations of the affects” require “thick descriptions
                  of life experiences of the kind that are familiar to anthropologists and novelists
                  but are widely held to be inimical to science” (Leys 471). This is the kind of affective-literary
                  project taken up in studies such as Joel Faflak and Richard Sha’s <em>Romanticism and the Emotions</em> (2014) and Lisa Ottum and Seth T. Reno’s <em>Wordsworth and the Green Romantics: Affect and Ecology in the Nineteenth Century</em> (2016). It is also the approach modeled by the essays in this volume.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A literary approach to the affects, then, is much needed, and it reflects a second
                  trajectory in affect theory: renewed interest in philosopher Baruch Spinoza, a figure
                  familiar to Romanticists. Spinoza’s influential <em>Ethics</em> (1677) presented the affects as “confused ideas” rooted in both mind and body, a
                  concept that thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Brian Massumi have
                  revisited and revised.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (6)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Deleuze and Guattari; and Massumi, Parables for the Virtual.</span></div>
                  </div> These “new affect theorists” tend toward the philosophical and theoretical, though
                  neuroscience also plays an important role in their work. For example, in his seminal
                  study <em>Parables for the Virtual</em> (2002), Massumi draws from both Spinoza and neuroscience in his argument for the autonomy
                  of affect. Several of the authors in this volume take up Massumi’s ideas in diverse
                  ways.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Given Spinoza’s influence on Romantic-era writers and scientists, Massumi and the
               new affect theorists have much to offer Romanticists. While scholars have long studied
               Spinoza’s influence on the Romantics’ conceptions of nature, we have only recently
               begun to examine his theories of affect and emotion. In <em>Ethics</em>, Spinoza defines the affects as “affections of the Body by which the Body’s power
               of acting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at the same time, the
               ideas of these affections. . . . affects are confused ideas of <em>the Mind and Body at once</em>” (493, 501; italics original). This dual process of corporeal and cognitive response
               inspired the work of the new affect theorists. Much of the <em>Ethics</em> involves outlining and explaining the various kinds of affects and their effects
               on us, and many contemporary scholars locate the basis of contemporary affect theory
               in Spinoza’s ideas. Through readings of Spinoza, these scholars have opened up new
               possibilities for understanding Romantic figurations of affect and emotion. For example,
               echoing Spinoza, Eric Shouse describes affect as “a prepersonal intensity corresponding
               to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an
               augmentation or diminution in that body’s capacity to act.” Massumi similarly defines
               affect as a non-conscious “intensity” that the mind later “qualifies” as emotion (<em>Parables </em>28). An emotion is only “a very partial expression of affect” that cannot “encompass
               all the depth and breadth” of our experiences (Massumi, <em>Politics</em> 5). For both scholars, Spinoza’s theory of the affects is key, as it incorporates
               both cognition and sensory stimulation. Many scholars thus distinguish affect from
               emotion: <em>affect</em> is an innate biological response, or physiological intensity, while <em>emotion</em> involves awareness of affect through memories, or narratives of accumulative experiences.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For Shouse, Massumi, and others, Spinoza’s insights have great significance for politics,
                  especially when coupled with neuroscientific research. For instance, Massumi argues
                  that most political influence occurs at the level of pre-linguistic and sub-personal
                  affect, and not “ideology” as is commonly assumed. Affect generates thoughts, feelings,
                  and modes of knowing prior to conscious awareness; we feel affect before we know it.
                  According to Leys, theorists in the Massumi camp believe that “political campaigns,
                  advertising, literature, visual images, and the mass media are all mechanisms for
                  producing such effects below the threshold of meaning and ideology” (451).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Leys suggests, such a view extends to aesthetics as well: if experience trumps
                           content, the structures and intentional meanings of artworks are of no consequence.</span></div>
                  </div> Affective intensities exceed language, and thus transcend ideology. This kind of reading
                  pushes Romantic studies beyond the modes of ideology critique and hermeneutics of
                  suspicion that have dominated scholarship since the 1980s. However, other theorists
                  have taken a different approach to Spinoza and affect, treating “affect” as “neither
                  a solely biological phenomenon nor a solely ideological one” (Ottum and Reno 6). Elsewhere,
                  I have shown how affective neuroscience helps us to rethink Wordsworth’s poetry, which
                  is more scientific and ecological than many readers acknowledge.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Such an understanding of affect helps to reconceptualize concepts such as nature and
                  imagination. But of course, affect is also political. Philosopher and affect theorist
                  Martha Nussbaum argues that we need to revive an emphasis on affect and emotion into
                  politics: justice, she argues, necessitates the cultivation of love and compassion.

                  </div> In many ways, this is a return to Romantic-era poetry and politics, but the ground
                  in shifting: rather than ideology critique as the dominant methodology, affect studies
                  offers a more complex picture of the interacting forces of bodies, feelings, emotions,
                  language, and ideas that constitute cognition and subjectivity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The amorphous nature of affect, as well as affect studies’ still-evolving trajectory,
               is precisely what makes it so ripe for exploration by scholars of British Romanticism.
               Indeed, as the essays in this volume show, the study of affect was incipient in the
               nineteenth century: following their eighteenth-century forbearers, the Romantics were
               deeply interested in matters such as the transmission and mediation of “sympathy.” In
               the first essay, Soledad Caballero and Aimee Knupsky highlight connections between
               Joanna Baillie’s “sympathetic curiosity” and recent work in cognitive psychology on
               “emotion regulation.” These connections open up new readings of Baillie’s theory of
               drama, as well as the particular work of <em>De Monfort</em> (1798), and they also inspire more scientific-affective research. This is the kind
               of interdisciplinary work called for by affect studies: Caballero and Knupsky use
               scientific research to study a literary text <em>and</em> use a literary text to direct new scientific research. As they point out, Baillie’s
               “Introductory Discourse” was influential and groundbreaking not only for its contributions
               to dramatic theory but also for her use of Romantic-era science, and so a cognitive
               approach to her work makes perfect sense. By highlighting the relationship between
               De Monfort and Jane in the play, Caballero and Knupsky re-envision investigations
               into social emotion regulation (SER) models. Specifically, they explore moments in
               the play “that highlight both the functioning and dysfunctioning of SER with an eye
               towards identifying those areas that are not currently modeled within constrained
               empirical investigations.” In their application and analysis of SER to <em>De Monfort</em>, with a particular emphasis on hatred, they show how affect is both biological and
               cultural, a process that operates within, as well as among, individual feeling subjects.
               Cognitive psychology suggests that affective and cognitive processes occur simultaneously
               in an intricate and sophisticated manner, which both challenges the conclusions of
               Massumi and pushes beyond the Basic Emotions paradigm.</p>
            <p>In the second essay, Renee Harris also draws from the cognitive humanities in a rereading
               of John Keats’s <em>Isabella</em> (1818). While scholars have traditionally read the poem’s digressions as evidence
               of Keats’s youthful and immature poetic style, Harris argues that this critique doesn’t
               hold up when we consider the digressions in light of nineteenth-century reading practices:
               though the kinds of “passive” or “immersive” reading that Keats practices were disparaged
               by Wordsworth and other high arbiters of literary taste, a counter-tradition reveals
               the cultural work of such reading, which modern cognitive psychology helps to illuminate.
               Keats breaks down the structural norms of the text and calls attention to the reading
               experience itself. In doing so, he “unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that
               allow for absorption in the narrative,” fostering psychic development and intellectual
               growth in the reader. Harris links this practice to Keats’s concept of the “material
               sublime,” which he adopts and adapts from Coleridge. In poems like “Kubla Khan” (1797)
               and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (1798), Coleridge models an immersive, affective
               reading that moves between fiction and reality in ways analogous to what cognitive
               scientists call Theory of Mind. Both poets, then, reveal an interest in the regulation
               and circulation of affect within the literary text, and they do so in an eerie manner,
               through narratives of ghosts, nightmares, deaths, dreams, and sleepwalking, all Gothic
               elements that figure the immersive reading experience “in which the reader is absorbed,
               lost in the automaticity of the affect”—not absorbed forever, but rather awakening
               to a more enlightened state.</p>
            <p>Moving from canonical figures to a lesser-known author, Jonas Cope’s essay focuses
               on Eliza Fenwick, whose understudied gothic novel <em>Secresy</em> (1795) shows unparalleled dramatization of the impersonality of emotion as compared
               to other novels of the same period. What’s more, the novel illustrates several core
               tenets of contemporary affect theory in surprising ways—surprising, I say, given its
               relative obscurity amongst most readers and scholars. In contrast to existing scholarship
               that situates characters in the novel as specific “types” isolated from one another,
               Cope’s affective approach shows how their bodies interact in intimate, non-cognitive
               ways, in the shared space of affect. Cope also intervenes in affect studies by arguing
               that <em>Secresy</em> “illuminates the more recent, physiological-theoretical work in affect theory” espoused
               by Massumi “as much as that work illuminates” the benefits of the literary-historical
               strand of affect studies—that is, how characters interact in the novel. Cope thus
               advances existing scholarship on the novel to show how affect theory can contribute
               to the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers.</p>
            <p>In the fourth essay, Mark Lussier draws from both affect theory and rhythmic studies
               to shed new light on what is arguably William Blake’s greatest and most complex work:
               <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>. In an essay dazzling in its theoretical breadth and critical understanding of Blake,
               Lussier uses his unique critical lens to make sense of Blake’s continuing influence
               on and engagement with each new age (Blake, as Lussier points out, is cited more than
               any other Romantic poet in popular culture), weaving together the poem’s reception
               history, scholarly history, and his own personal relationship with the poem, from
               his Master’s thesis to the present project. This is perhaps what is most novel about
               the essay: while affect studies tends to take an almost detached approach to the emotions—treating
               them historically, theoretically, or scientifically—Lussier takes a personal approach,
               for what is more personal than our emotions and our bodies? Indeed, Lussier reads
               <em>Marriage </em>as a textual body itself, one that transmits affects to its reader through its structure
               and rhythm, a process of “affect contagion.” Blake’s material text embodies affective
               intensities that work on the reader prior to cognition. The text is an “affect-generating
               machine” that continues indefinitely as it is a body that cannot die. Yet, as Lussier
               makes clear, <em>Marriage</em> cannot represent affect but only trace affect through poetic form: affect remains
               outside of conscious thought. But the movement and rhythm of the work unveils the
               presence of affect at work.</p>
            <p>In the final essay, Joel Faflak rereads Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820) as the poet’s ultimate statement on the global and cosmic intersections of
               affect, emotion, and feeling. By drawing from a range of recent work in affect theory,
               Faflak presents a masterful close reading of Shelley’s lyrical drama wherein emotion
               is “the event” (via Badiou) that “materializ[es] subjects <em>as</em> subjects.” The movement of the drama is the movement of emotion itself, the transmission
               of affect that constitutes “a world moving both within and beyond its own boundaries.”
               In a kind of affective feedback loop, subjects “call the world into emotional existence,”
               and that existence in turn materializes the emotional lives of the subjects. In <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Shelley images this complex matrix, this “broader feeling network” that we are unable
               to grasp fully because we exist in its midst. By reading affect theory through Shelley
               and Shelley through affect theory, Faflak offers a new understanding of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as more material and much less idealized. Importantly, the essay helps to illuminate
               key concepts and arguments in affect studies as much as it illuminates Shelley’s poem.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We still have much to learn about affect and emotion, and, as the essays in this volume
                  make clear, Romantic literature continues to offer significant sites for such critical
                  inquiry. In sum, these essays offer a representative example of how affect studies
                  has transformed the study of Romanticism, and how Romanticists continue to shape the
                  trajectory of affect studies. They also represent the future of Romantic scholarship:
                  Caballero and Knupsky’s essay on Baillie is part their ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration
                  and publication program on the intersections of Romantic literature and cognitive
                  psychology; Harris’s essay on Keats stems from her award-winning dissertation, which
                  will likely appear as a monograph in the near future; Cope’s piece on Fenwick speaks
                  to the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers of the Romantic period; Lussier’s
                  essay on Blake is one in a cluster of essays just published or forthcoming on Blake,
                  affect, and rhythmic studies; and Faflak’s piece on Shelley is one of two forthcoming
                  essays on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> emerging from his influential work in affect studies. This kind of work will prove
                  increasingly important in a world where emotion is growing in critical and popular
                  appeal. As we continue to reimagine Romanticism during this renaissance of emotion
                  facilitated by the affective turn, the Romantics will continue to teach us how to
                  feel, and we can teach others how to love and make sense of that feeling.

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">In general, there are four major theories of emotion in the cognitive sciences that
               bear on affect theory in literary and cultural studies: (1) James-Lang theory understands
               emotion as an interpretive result of autonomic physiological response; (2) Cannon-Bard
               theory understands autonomic response and emotion as occurring simultaneously; (3)
               Schachter and Singer’s cognitive-arousal theory understands emotion as the result
               of both autonomic response and cognitive attributions; and (4) Lazarus’ theory argues
               that thought precedes emotion and physiological arousal. For a useful essay on debates
               and findings within cognitive studies and neuroscience related to affect and theories
               of emotion, see Hamann. For a recent neuroscientific study that challenges the Basic
               Emotions paradigm, see Barrett.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
