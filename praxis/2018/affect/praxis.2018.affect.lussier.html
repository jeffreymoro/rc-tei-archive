            <p class="noCount">William Blake’s perpetually protean <em>Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> has proven somewhat elusive for those seeking to articulate “what” the work means.
               Given its unusual form/s (organized along both verbal and visual axes), its visionary
               commitments (evoked through its apocalyptic imagery), and its intertextual engagements
               (from Aristotle and Jesus through Milton to Swedenborg [Blake’s primary focus]), one
               cannot arrive at a singular textual meaning. However, when one asks a different question—“How
               does the text make its meaning?”—the dynamic aims of the work do emerge. The fusion
               of these and other elements creates an art object with an overt gaze woven through
               affective textualities, and this dynamic and interactive presence strives to transform
               the very subjectivities of those readers who enter its entangled zones of semiotic
               operations. Thus, affect forms the boundary conception of such a textual condition,
               and its apprehension transforms them into subjective effects.</p>

                  <p>William Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1793) has long held a special place in Blake Studies, following from those “under
                     late Victorian sponsorship” who undertook the textual recovery and secured, via critical
                     extension, both Blake’s work and the place occupied by <em>The Marriage</em> (Eaves et al. 116).

                     </div> Dante Gabriel and William Michael Rossetti figure prominently in the recovery, and
                     Algernon Charles Swinburne, who published the first book-length interpretation of
                     Blake’s prophetic works, dedicated his critical essay to the latter. Swinburne, a
                     friend of the family, was intimately familiar with the first Blake biography by Alexander
                     Gilchrist and had direct access to the illuminated works. Swinburne pronounced <em>The Marriage</em> “the greatest of all his books” and the work that best brought into view “the high
                     water mark of his intellect” (204). By the end of the century, Edwin Ellis and William
                     Butler Yeats published their famous “three-volume annotated edition, with lithographic
                     reproductions of a fair number of illustrations,” which, in Edward Larrissy’s view,
                     offered “The greatest tribute paid to Blake at the end of the nineteenth century”
                     (69). The volume provided <em>the</em> Blake transmitted to modernity and taken up by some of its strongest advocates and
                     exemplars (e.g., Yeats, as well as James Joyce and André Gide).</p>

                     </div> <em>The Marriage</em> powerfully delivers—through a fusion of the verbal and visual fields (the illuminated
                     book)—“a strange work, a kind of philosophical manifesto” (Nurmi 59) that immediately
                     became the measure of Blake’s genius—and often even of genius itself—as it plunged
                     readers “into a vigorous Beethovenish coda [which was] big with portents of the movement[s]
                     to follow [in perpetuity]” (Frye, “Thief” 35).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The reception accorded the transmission, which periodically assumes material bodies
                  that are quantifiable, can be seen in recent research by Roger Whitson and Jason Whittaker,
                  who mapped the flow of Blake citations (versus those of the other “big five” poets)
                  in the narrowed discursive arena of Twitter citations. Within this eddy of the digital
                  environment, Blake quotations far outstrip the other authors (17,970 quotations in
                  a 27-week span). Of these citations, <em>The Marriage</em> provides the majority, with the collision of the heavenly and hellish accounting
                  for almost 40% of those evocations (4,523 citations). Of course, given the constant
                  unfolding into potential fields of representational force, the amount of “Blakespotting”
                  one could now undertake is almost infinite, even though it has only been less than
                  a decade since the publication of Mike Goode’s splendid and influential <em>PMLA</em> essay. The evidence seems to confirm that Blake, furthered when harnessed to those
                  mechanical horses of instruction—the computational engines of digital knowledge and
                  the machinic mills within the worldwide web—seemingly captures the spirit of every
                  age, but one measured by the rhythms of the body in relation to the pulsation of social
                  process, providing an individuated experience of the event of being for eternity and
                  cultivating via transference an incident of incipient identity. Steven Goldsmith speaks
                  best in current criticism to this undercurrent, the strange pulse writhing beneath
                  the surface of the work in the depths of its textuality, a substratum “mimicking in
                  sound and meaning the cardiac rhythms that expands and contracts an artery” and predicated
                  on “activity and passivity [being] a shared rhythm” (228, 245).</p>
               <p>During this project, I have periodically returned to contemplate Frye’s analogy to
                  the animating energies of Beethoven, since the phrase provided early recognition of
                  the affective functions embedded in work and since the material underlying the analogy—a
                  revolutionary rhythmic presence that moves successive generations—can be measured
                  by new methods to assess how this poetic presence was caught as “a condition of daily
                  labor for Blake” (Goldsmith 38). Consider, quickly, one level of textual operation
                  analyzed below at greater detail, the function of the I-persona and its reinforcement
                  in the entangled fields of the verbal and visual. The first-person persona speaks
                  only in memorable fancies, with the first leading into the proverbs of hell. After
                  the proverbs, on plate ten, the design decodes the narrative process just conveyed
                  to and negotiated by a reader: the devil dictates, the I-persona captures those dictates,
                  and a reader accesses the operation of the work by passing through the devilish wings.
                  In this way, one plane of rhythmic manifestation must be the sequential assessment
                  of what we do when entering though this narrative function to participate in the work
                  of the text, which is a material operation of rhythm, since the “I” vacillates between
                  active and passive modes and reaches a peak on plate twenty-four with the formation
                  of prophetic character. The periodicity of this presence is a material textuality
                  function, providing only one way that Blake brings this rhythmic presence into experience,
                  since the verbal evocation of recording that leads into the proverbs concludes with
                  visual analysis of the textual operation itself.</p>
               <p>The techniques that embody this ethereal presence pulsate beneath the composite text,
                  like blood in arteries, and methodologies associated with current affect theory and
                  rhythmic studies provide strategies for recovering this rhythmic aspect, which seemingly
                  occurs on every plateau of possibility within the work as the spirit beneath Blake’s
                  embrace of the bounding line. The evidence suggests that the perennial popularity
                  of <em>The Marriage</em> is grounded in this elusive yet material presence, since the work encodes a “certain
                  rhythm or order” (Shelley 512) that transfers its pulsations through an assemblage
                  of affective devices (e.g., the narrative functions of the I), whose analytic plateaus
                  provide vectors (or in current parlance de/territorializing and re/territorializing
                  lines of flight) capable of moving the mind into motion (as Kant proposed in the third
                  critique). The text conveys the rhythm of Blake’s thought in a work packed with projections
                  from both the current time and the long traditions that inform it. Literally, the
                  rhythm of the work captures the spirit of its own age (something only perceived across
                  its literal and symbolic reconstruction from obscurity), but, more importantly, <em>The Marriage</em> continues to catch like a corresponding breeze the rhythms of almost every age, including
                  our own (e.g., through Patti Smith). The work evinces something perennial and important
                  arising from the harnessed energies undergirding the dialogic superstructure of the
                  work, which forms the “aspect of poetic form” (i.e., products of poetic genius in
                  poetry and prose) “that escape the conventions of meaning” (Aviram 83). Rhythm defines
                  the technique, provides the theme, and delineates its textuality in ways with profound
                  implications for those who read this work.</p>
               <p>Perhaps another specific example can help gesture at the play of pulsations, providing
                  a local example of rhythmic emergence in a more traditional place, the shortest proverb
                  which occupies the measured center of The Proverbs of Hell: “One thought, fills immensity.”
                  A dimension of rhythm resides in its elusive metrics (made more complicated by the
                  insertion of the comma), since no matter where one places emphasis, the prior monosyllabic
                  terms (either dactyl or anapest) are swept away by the closing polysyllabic double-accented
                  solitary term. The metrics of the poetic line model the sentiments expressed by the
                  proverb, yet the second pulse of this rhythm occurs with the passage of the eye from
                  the term “immensity” to the micro-visualization that follows to complete the line,
                  where a ship, wind filling its sails, sweeps towards the horizon at the edge of the
                  page. Like the metric of the poetic line, the visual tableau also enacts or embodies
                  what the proverb proposes through the image. </p>
               <p><em>The Marriage </em>propagates this rhythm within a work seemingly packed with meaning and through analytic
                  and visionary “utterance designed in such a way as to draw attention simultaneously
                  to its dimensions of pure sound and to that of meaning, creating a sustained tension
                  between the two forces; and which achieves that effect of tension by means of structuring
                  its language according to rhythm” (Aviram 37). The scopic-driven operations of the
                  text create yet another layer of potential for affective interactions, which proceeding
                  along lines defined by textual tracks open to participation, with the resulting spectrum
                  of the self (an individual pattern of interference and reception, a discrete perception
                  of the work) varying according to the hidden variables brought to bear by its readers
                  and spectators in these phenomenological acts of perception and reception. Thus, the
                  inscriptive process (image and word inscribed inversely on copper plates) embodies
                  this rhythm, the order (sequence of plates) and organizational decisions (plate subsets)
                  contain this rhythm, the pace of narrative (vacillation across varied forms) enfolds
                  this rhythm, and the reader embodies, through suspension in narrative techniques,
                  a transmission of energies that moves from alterity to interiority.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. Personal Polarities of Reception</span></h2>
               <p>Blake’s perennially protean proem exerted an immediate impact on my views, especially
                  in light of its emanation from my cultural and social environment, with first contact
                  coming through snippets from other authors and writers (e.g., Huxley or Ginsberg),
                  musical devotees (e.g., The Doors or Emerson, Lake, and Palmer), and even book covers
                  for classes (e.g., <em>World Religions </em>or <em>A History of Prophecy in Israel</em>). <em>The Marriage </em>also arrived at a moment of personal crisis where the confluence of external and internal
                  forces necessitated radical changes in my life, and, following this engagement, a
                  quantum shift in my thinking took hold in relation to the repetitive daily pursuits
                  of studying the classically oriented curriculum at the University of St. Thomas and
                  performing the nightly work in the county trauma center in Houston. Blake’s <em>Marriage</em> literally served “as equipment for living” (Burke 645) through the dark and often
                  tragic occurrences that arrived to the late-night emergency room (between 11:00 PM
                  and 7:00 AM), which was cast into relief by juxtaposition with the tranquil beauty
                  of the campus and its deliberate pace through knowledge—a passage often only separated
                  by thirty minutes. Several years later, when the time came to write my MA thesis,
                  I predictably turned to <em>The Marriage</em> and its multi-dimensional analysis and evocation of the prophetic tradition, which
                  even in this relatively early text (c. 1790–03) seemed to enfold fable, folklore,
                  and myth (plate 11); the history of printing and its relationship to the transmission
                  of “knowledge” (plate 15); the con/fusion of the poetic and prophetic (throughout
                  but especially plates 12 and 13); and the re/cognition of the triangulated interplay
                  of desire projected onto “Vegetable Glass of Nature” (E 555) and the ways drives and
                  ideologies assume material bodies (plates 25-7).</p>

                  <p>Even after writing the thesis (“‘Rintrah Roars’: Anti-structural Prophetics in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>”), I felt my assessment missed as much as it struck, but the impact of its textual
                     gaze during reception and interpretation stuck. The work continued to hail or interpellate
                     from the inside out, no surprise given that “such interpellation [resides] in all
                     acts of reading” (Bracher 177), and figured prominently in my dissertation.

                     rouse the faculties of those who encounter it, literally by the genesis of affect.
                     Blake builds a work with textual features that both recognizes the presence of appellation
                     (and its ideological functions) and re/cognizes its ability to achieve through the
                     marshalling of literary and textual techniques a transformation of readers by its
                     “gaze.”

                              the category of the subject” (173). My dissertation confirms the continued call of
                              The Marriage, since it dedicates a chapter to the Lacanian echoes and essences embedded
                              in the work and its deployment of “mirror stage” apparatus like identification and
                              projection, and the following analysis owes much to Mark Bracher’s work (see below).</span></div>

                     well after our studies concluded, whether they took delight, became enraged, and/or
                     felt provoked, but they all agreed that the work evinced the ability to engage them
                     where they live (the dynamic conditions of the real), while manifesting a trans-temporal
                     textual plasticity of great power that emanates from complex and dynamic operations
                     in the method best termed an “affective mechanics” (“Mirrored Text” 16).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Having taught Blake’s <em>Marriage</em> at all levels of instruction for about thirty-five years, I still marvel at the ability
                  of the work to stimulate receptive activities across a broad spectrum of cultural/social
                  belief and concerns through its activated semiotic textual environment, and the analysis
                  of this matter (the material base for the textual generation of this stimulation)
                  requires a shift from “what” the work means to a question seemingly long resolved:
                  “How does the text make its meaning?’’ Such a question of <em>praxis</em> “turns on [Blake’s] manifold involvement with the many modes of the sign’s operation,
                  the ways of setting alight a signifier . . . and the various ways readers have of
                  making sense of that involvement” (Hilton [2006] 86). Blake fuses from these interactive
                  sign systems “a new art form,” a dynamic textual object that eliminates “the key division
                  between conception and execution” (Jones 32), and thereby offers the opportunity to
                  traverse a plentitude of hermeneutic plateaus in route to the closing “Song of Liberty.”
                  Perhaps the most overt line of flight, the “affective stylistics” built into the material
                  of the text, announces its operational function as “kinetic art [that] forces you
                  to be aware of ‘it’ as a changing object—and therefore no ‘object’ at all—and also
                  to be aware of yourself as correspondingly changing” (Fish 82-3).</p>
               <p>My extended examination, then, takes up an inquiry into the affective functionalities
                  at work within <em>The Marriage</em>, beginning with those dialogic and dynamic exchanges (even the plateaus have polarities
                  implanted in content and form) for which the work is well-known and through the energized
                  interchanges between the “I” active within its memorable fancies and the eye reading
                  the “event” of the work. This direct narrative node operates both linguistically and
                  psychologically through identification at the preliminary point of exchange and becomes
                  the vehicle for the emergence of a “larger I individual participate in a specific
                  form of subjectivity” posited by Michon in the epigraph to this essay. The technique
                  opens a receptive path for forms of transference and counter-transference at the event-horizon
                  of reception (an effect enhanced through repeated reading). Through such methodic
                  techniques, the gaze of the work functions as generator of an affect (thus an affect
                  machine), which renders it an early experiment in and continuing exemplar of what
                  is best termed “affective textuality.”</p>
               <p>Strangely enough, it has now been “thirty-three years since [the] advent” (E 34) of
                  the thesis and its defense, and I feel methodologically better informed to explore
                  precisely how a physical textual object implants itself in consciousness like a reoccurring
                  infection that leaps out to inflect and reflect across the spectrum of the real, symbolic,
                  and imaginary registers of the subject and its projections techniques onto the screen
                  of alterity. Although initially undertaken with typical critical instrumentation (in
                  succession, the rhetorical thrust of the prophetic [MA] and the incorporation of post-structural
                  psychoanalytic methodologies into textual operations [PhD]), the excavation and exploration
                  of such an intricate object eventually extended to spatial/temporal planes of reception/response
                  (the space-time of critical analysis in which the affective aspects of the work’s
                  activated textuality operate), which extends the hermeneutic possibilities to infinite
                  planes and therein establishes what Alain Badiou termed “a new idiom” by which the
                  subject is newly positioned, speaking existentially, as “being-for-the-infinite” (in
                  contradistinction to “being for death” [137]).</p>

                     where (in this case) narrative and generic play, through the guise of parody and satire,
                     are transformed into operational instrumentation directed towards analytic, pedagogical,
                     and spiritual ends (something previously analyzed in two prior essays). While illuminated
                     works precede <em>The Marriage</em>, the work synthesized those earlier efforts into a form where intellectual and technological
                     dimensions achieve a refined unity reflected “in a Part as in the Whole” (E 269) transmitted
                     to the Lambeth (balanced between historical and psychological concerns) and Felpham

               <p><em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </em>opens the most creative and productive decade of Blake’s life and provides an assemblage
                  of forms, sources, and voices filtered through a scathing satiric imagination guided
                  by an impulse akin to Heideggerian <span class="foreign">Destruktion</span>, a “de-structuring of the history of ontology,” to gain purchase on the “onto-theological”
                  embedded in metaphysics as a necessary prelude for any state of dwelling capable of
                  abiding, aspiring, surviving, and thriving (Heidegger 20; Economides 17). Blake the
                  “bricoleur” (Mee 3) functions as artist, engraver, painter, philosopher, poet, printer,
                  and publisher—a rather audacious stance relative to the sophisticated semiotic seas
                  in which he swam—and pursues an imaginary exploration of desires and drives, constructs
                  symbolic repetitions of these conflicts of varied layers of representation and signification,
                  deconstructs the foundational binaries beneath them, renders the mythic and psychologic
                  dynamic and interactive, and traces them through history, myth, and other bearers

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Blake’s multi-formulaic approach is informed by a dizzying array of intertextual references
                     primarily focused on the Old and New Testaments and its secondary “interpreters” John
                     Milton and Emmanuel Swedenborg, with everyone from Aristotle and Jesus through Ezekiel
                     and Isaiah to Dante and Shakespeare mentioned in its twenty-seven pages. However,
                     this typical referential apparatus is supplemented by an incipient intratextual dimension
                     established with the earlier tracts <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (1789) and the later <em>Songs of Experience</em> (1794) (i.e., their combination), as well as the Lambeth prophecies (especially<em>America, A Prophecy</em> [1793] and <em>The Book of Urizen</em> [1794]), creating a work of great plasticity capable of incorporating retrospectively
                     an evolving mythology placed within an entangled field of verbal and visual representation,
                     where even interlinear flourishes serve to support larger hermeneutic and ideological
                     interpellations within their micro-narratives and where insistent apocalyptic and
                     visionary language is capable of a sustained frontal assault on all forms of what

               <p>This assemblage of collective concerns confronted upon encountering the creative aspects
                  of characters and their contexts suspends readers in an affective textuality and its
                  operational modalities, which provide the method of propagation to those “future generations”
                  to which his “sublime allegory” seems to be addressed (E 730). Each layer of intricacy
                  has a quasi-fractal nature of iteration and re/iteration, manipulating the reader
                  through discretely constructed sets: argument, demonstration, vocalization, and visualization.
                  Thus, rather than having little or no structure, the work deploys a hyper-structuration
                  designed “to restore difference in thought [in order] to untie this first knot, which
                  consists of representing difference through the identity of the concept and the thinking
                  subject,” a process unfolding continually in <em>The Marriage</em> and reflecting its commitment to an “affirmation of differences,” which throughout
                  the work provides “a primary” impulse assuming “material and bare” forms that are
                  reflected in all encounters with “every . . . variant, a difference, a disguise or
                  a displacement” (Deleuze, <em>Repetition</em> 266, 267, 271).</p>
               <p><em>The Marriage</em> mostly seems to inspire, to ignite aspirations, yet in almost any class at least
                  one student experiences the work as psychologically disturbing (and perhaps even dangerous),
                  seemingly offering substantiation to Bracher’s argument across that spectrum of response
                  that reception of this work often creates subjective alterations, tends to unveil
                  mental instabilities in the process, and often produces existential/spiritual shifts
                  as one alters one’s opinion in relation to the textual gaze. The event of reading/reception
                  unfolds relative to endless variables woven into the cultural information comprising
                  the content with which the work and its spectator is concerned (within), and every
                  reader must engage textual conditions governed by principles of uncertainty (without)
                  that “activate[] the [spectators’] participation” (while “destabilizing . . . singular
                  identities”), thereby positioning its consumers within a constantly shifting hyper-activated
                  event horizon (Badiou, <em>Being</em> 304–05; Piccitto 80, 149). These dynamic aspects of creation and reception “co-exist
                  and co-function” (as contraries) and depend on “discrete perceptions/cognitions” within
                  this event-horizon, which is shaped by the shared energies of author and reader and
                  provide a path through “productive interference” (mutual imposition) to an infinity
                  of “potential forms/configurations” (those “Unnam’d forms” contained within the fifth
                  chamber of the printing house of hell [E 40: 15]) response to “discrete perceptions/cognitions”
                  (Massumi 197).</p>
               <p>The lines of hermeneutic flight track something somewhat elusive (but hopefully not
                  illusive)—the ways Blake finds to capture and communicate the rhythm of thought in
                  the material operations of <em>The Marriage</em> (the first full-bore illuminated book of prophecy) and to engineer paths of perpetuation
                  within the work’s textual conditions—and serve as routes to transferences and counter-transferences
                  as the primary sought outcome of its textuality. In this and other ways, Blake’s <em>Marriage</em> operates “as a machine conceived in order to elicit interpretation” (Eco 85). This
                  affect-generating machine encloses a plenitude of dimensions, providing paths for
                  intellectual interventions into the cultural processes of subject formation and runs
                  along governing dynamics capable “of directly modifying the neurodynamics of the SELF”
                  (see second epigram) during acts of reading and reception. The textual condition Blake
                  establishes places semiotic complementarity at the foundation of textual functions,
                  with the verbal and visual languages positively writhing within the framing engraved
                  rectangle of representation whose energies depend upon fields of semiotic force manifesting
                  principles of complementarity, which serves as the steady state of the illuminated
                  books generally. The textual field of <em>The Marriage</em> deploys what can only be described as a “gaze” in the full affect/effect given that
                  term in current critical discourse, although manifest at the individual level of aesthetic
                  object is significant for an affect-oriented approach to Blakean textuality. Through
                  at least two layers of its material operations (one visual and one verbal), the work
                  modulates its figural and linguistic languages to effect a shift or transference of
                  perception “from the point of view of the object [to see] . . . from the subject’s
                  point of view” (Merleau-Ponty, <em>Phenomenology</em> 226) and must maneuver within the knowledge of what W. J. T. Mitchell termed the
                  “composite” dimension of the text (Otto 42–44). Blake’s textuality form evinces an
                  overt gaze woven through affective textualities, and this dynamic and interactive
                  presence strives to transform the very subjectivities of those readers who enter its
                  entangled zones of semiotic operations. Thus, affect forms the boundary condition
                  for this new textual state, and its apprehension undertakes forms of transforms designed
                  to create subjective effects.</p>

                  within and without the work. Obviously, the hidden variables at play cannot be definitively
                  mapped; however, the textual operations can be observed. Blake’s activated mode of
                  mimetic representation produces significant local (and often immediate) affects, not
                  a surprising outcome in light of Anna Gibb’s description of such textual operations
                  quite relevant to the case of the illuminated books (although in periodic manifestation
                  and so with unequal measure): <span class="quote">‘At the heart of mimesis is affect contagion, the bioneurological means by which particular
                     affects are transmitted from body to body. The discrete innate affects of which Silvan
                     Tomkins speaks are powerful purveyors of affect contagion, since they are communicated
                     rapidly and automatically via the face, as well as the voice. (“After Affect” 91)’</span> The face of <em>The Marriage</em> is clearly the title plate, and, as Leo Damrosch notes, the bounding lines of the
                  design yield “the shape of a human head” (102), which, in light of the plateaus of
                  experience reflective of polarities, offers (for the experienced reader) a visual
                  x-ray of the dynamic symmetries in existential play erupting within all individuals.
                  The design also assumes the function of a mirror, providing a mimetic representation
                  of a visionary head wherein all textual dynamics operate to create a mirror-stage
                  encounter, escalating affective intensities with every encounter (one can only once
                  be innocent in the face of this gaze textual) through identification. The design provides
                  a view of interior process of a human head, and with this mirror in the text (i.e.,
                  another form of the <em>mise en abyme</em> trope) proffered as aesthetic antidote to the maladies of selfhood (a concern taken
                  up in later works but here in incipient form). Since the “contraries battle” in all
                  (poet and audience alike), the title page presents an archetypal, universal man (an
                  <em>ur</em>-form of Albion), and the mirrored aspects of the construct operate in opposition
                  to “the mundane world, the world built by nature and memory, a crazy house of false
                  mirrors” (Adams 188, 196).</p>

                  within varied spatiotemporal situations and, when transmitted, across varied cultural
                  processes of signification. In the first “Memorable Fancy” (a narrative device borrowed
                  from Emmanuel Swedenborg), “a mighty Devil” not only serves as a front to un/veil
                  Blake’s corrosive inverse printing method but also articulates the governing query
                  by which to contemplate improvement through multiversical forms of affective experience:

               <p> This interrogative mode recurs throughout <em>The Marriage</em>, and, as Nelson Hilton long ago perceived, it (and other forms of enigmatic wisdom
                  [i.e., parables, proverbs and prophecies]) functions in ways similar to Zen <span class="foreign">koan</span> (197–200) by “rouzing the faculties” (E 560) as a method for intellectual development
                  in the constant conversion of knowledge into wisdom. While the devil writes corrosively
                  to inscribe this couple, the I-persona records it, providing the other voice while
                  functioning as the vehicle for incorporation and, thereafter, participation. Given
                  my contention that the work functions as an affect-generating machine by design, the
                  relevance of this quote should be obvious; Blake’s theory of the text uses material
                  elements to unravel ideological manacles and, in the process, rewrite the process
                  of subject formation, which comes equipped with affective aspirations and promises
                  to open “the door of perception” (E 39).</p>

                     in similar ways, but the techniques deployed by <em>The Marriage</em> provide a baseline of affective operations, beginning with mimetic representation
                     predicated upon “the presence of others.” Those “others” are interpellated in the
                     process of reception through Blake’s version of “the larger I” posited by Michon (above),
                     the I-persona, which supplements the imagistic mirror of the title page with a linguistic
                     mirror upon which the contraries of material reality (within and without) are projected.
                     This two-fold mode opens the possibility of a counter-identification that would have
                     some chance of neutralizing the freeplay of the <span class="foreign">imago</span> or Blake’s spectre, although that task awaits Milton in <em>Milton</em>, a work driven by reception dynamics. Reception, then, <em>always</em> occurs within an event-horizon involving the intersection of linguistic and scopic
                     properties that <em>always</em> alters neurological conditions, therein creating a corresponding shift from object
                     relations (author/work or reader/book) to a “subject to subject” relationship that
                     defines, in part, its “gaze” (Lacan, <em>Fundamentals</em> 84). These techniques work somewhat covertly in <em>The Marriage</em>; after all, only educated or experienced readers would know that the “corrosive”
                     process that concludes the first “Memorable Fancy” or the “thirty-three years” (on
                     plate three) are both self-referential and hence meta-textual. However, the affective
                     textual functions become increasingly overt in the vibrant semiotic fields of <em>Milton</em> (1804) and <em>Jerusalem</em> (1820): both include direct addresses to readers, and both periodically unveil the
                     mirrored textual dynamics at the foundation of the illuminated form itself.

                     in my experience, Blake’s <em>Marriage</em> has perhaps the most trackable structure in the canon, unfolding as a fourfold structure

                  utterance) perform visionary work conveying Blake’s reinterpretation of prophetic
                  discourse (a shift from the predictive to the psychoanalytic). The “Song” sung presents
                  the preliminary mytheme of Blake’s evolving mythopoetic map of mental processes (the
                  interactions of the nuclear family: “The Eternal Female,” “The newborn terror,” and
                  “the starry king” [E 44: 25–26]) and announces the vehicle (the illuminated book of
                  prophecy) designed to serve as method itself and to exploit lines of de- and re-territorializing
                  lines of flight forged in reception, leading directly to the assumption of a deliberately
                  crafted visionary perspective yet crafted through difference and repetition rather
                  than solidified mimetic representation and symbolic similitude.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Blake reinforced these broad structural elements though an act of repetition with
                     a difference, since the third section of the work (plates 11–24) manifests its own
                     four-part organization (including the elements of the set comprising the first section)
                     and thereby transforms the deployment of an occasional use of a <span class="foreign">mise en abyme</span> structure within its surface examination of tradition into a treatment in the form
                     of an active textuality, recommending treatment for the condition (within the narrative)
                     and narrative operation and textual techniques and technologies as the prescription
                     for the inherent divisions at play in all areas of the work (Dällenbach 43–53) into
                     both a narrative operation and a textual technique. <em>The Marriage</em> undertakes nothing less than simultaneously diagnosing the maladies of subject formation
                     (based upon known means of reception) and articulating an antidote to the dis/ease
                     resident in the process of subject formation, embracing the semiotic as the cure for
                     the symbolic (in contemporary critical language). The modes of correction assume a
                     fractal-like façade founded in repetition and reiteration that charts the trajectory
                     of method, the evolutionary and revolutionary aspects of the physical body through
                     which Blake staged these often <em>carnivalesque</em> exchanges (i.e., the memorable fancies), where the illuminated book itself provides
                     a dynamic textual environment within which to transfix any reader’s attention and
                     entangle affective operations within these semiotic layers through the rhythmic elements
                     distributed throughout the plateaus of Blake’s formative multiverse.

               </div>
               <p>Jerome McGann associated Blake’s illuminated books with the emergence of a quantum
                  textuality, since the work in hand really does open onto “infinity” within and without:
                  “Holding the book you hold ‘Infinity in the palm of your hand,’ as Blake precisely
                  remarked” (163). The interplay of these dialogic and dynamic elements within any given
                  illuminated book encodes forms of uncertainty at several levels (including form itself)
                  and operates through principles of complementarity (throughout the enriched semiotic
                  environment shaped by the entangled energies of intersecting verbal and visual fields).
                  The affective textual forms and techniques analyzed here—which were uniquely designed
                  to shift “the scene of instruction” into any reader’s mind—does so by discrete textual
                  operations that take hold during acts of reception and response and are shaped with
                  sound psychoanalytic principles in mind (a point already addressed elsewhere). The
                  interplay of these textual forces are supplemented by other aspects of the work, creating
                  an assemblage of interactive generic forms produced from interwoven poetic philosophical
                  argument, prosaic analysis, parodic yet pointed memorable fancy, proverbial wisdom,
                  and numbered biblical verse bound together to articulate patterns that trace, but
                  do not and cannot represent, affect: “The rhythm of poetry [in all its permutations
                  and vacillations] compels affect, which can then be put into words; rhythm does not
                  represent affect”: <span class="quote">‘Physical rhythm can be said to have meaning only in a very limited way, insofar as
                     it alludes to well-known rhythms that are in turn attached to certain ideas, conventions,
                     and moods, and therefore to words and images. . . . Physical rhythm is quite different
                     in kind from either words or images, which are fundamental to the economy, codes,
                     and values of ordinary social life. The ideas and images of poetry are historical;
                     they construct the immediate physical reality of the rhythm that their words simultaneously
                     embody. (Aviram 226–28)’</span> Blake’s textual strategies aspire to unveil this presence through an assemblage that
                  places affect at the foundation of textuality itself, since such a move “is that the
                  specific joys and pleasures of poetry are preserved” (Aviram 244) but would also operate
                  unveil “writing itself is an affect-laden process: driven by interest and desire,
                  subject to frustration and misery as well as productive of joy and excitement” (Gibbs
                  223).</p>
               <p>Blake’s <em>Marriage</em> exploits “the stability of print as a platform and the linearity of text in the codex
                  form,” therein extending “speech beyond the body of the writer [and] producing the
                  effect of an inner voice and with a psychodynamics of interiority” (Gibbs, <em>Affective Materialities</em> 228). Blake’s experimental text and the textual theory behind its strategies operate
                  relative to the unseen while hailing those who come into its gaze, a peculiar tactic
                  again aligned with scopic drives and one that acknowledges the specular nature of
                  subjectivity itself: <span class="quote">‘What we have to circumscribe, by means of the path [Blake] indicates for us, is the
                     pre-existence of the gaze—I see only from one point, but in my existence I am looked
                     at from all sides. . . . The eye and the gaze—this is for us the split in which the
                     drive is manifested at the level of the scopic field (Lacan, <em>Four </em>72–73)’</span> Within the accumulation of <em>The Marriage</em> as assemblage, from its opening titular mirror and its dedicated exploitation of
                  the “I” as our narrative guide through both heaven and hell, readers both transfer
                  (via internalization) the subject-function and thereby continuously pronounce themselves
                  the “I” of the text, which operates through countertransference. Returning this reflection
                  into the textual field of Blake’s <em>Marriage</em>, affective techniques provide a mechanism for a transference of consciousness within
                  the dynamics described by Georges Poulet (I-persona as a vehicle of interiorization
                  and subsequent ex/pression) and evoked by Lacan in his discussion of the gap between
                  the “eye and the gaze.” For both Blake and Lacan, “this split constitutes the characteristic
                  dimension of analytic discovery and experience” (Lacan, <em>Four </em>69), and it clearly informs Blake’s attempt to provide an experience and ex/pression
                  of rhythm through effects and techniques that deploy affect as the vehicle of subjective
                  transformation.</p>

               various sorts are conducted to develop, falsify/verify or discuss hypotheses, or b)
               natural everyday environments (e.g., peoples’ homes, classrooms or the street) that

               or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects, by the functioning of
               the category of the subject” (173). My dissertation confirms the continued call of
               <em>The Marriage</em>, since it dedicates a chapter to the Lacanian echoes and essences embedded in the
               work and its deployment of “mirror stage” apparatus like identification and projection,

               definition; differential elements, in themselves without meaning, which acquire value

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">In essence, Blake’s textuality operates through similar dynamics as Lacan’s famous
               mirror-stage, although the textual mirror Blake presents is a screened window upon
               which both writer and reader project from different spots in the spacetime continuum,
               while transmitting the physical and psychological mechanics needed to annihilate the
               <span class="foreign">imago</span>, a process that reaches its best expression in <em>Milton</em>. Of course, in the mirror stage described by Lacan, the subject assumes an illusory
               identity; in the textual mirror of Blake, the <em>specter </em>is unveiled through a process of mimetic representation, thereafter deconstructed,
               and then restructured through techniques of transformation piloted in <em>The Marriage</em> (although precede by the tractates). The mirror, for Blake, must shatter to reveal
               the work as a window, since one should look through a text and not with it (like one
               should look through the eye and not with it).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               elaboration of the aesthetic, dramatic, and narratological dimensions of this complicated
               trope, and Blake’s enhanced semiotic field creates new possibilities for its incorporation
               as a technique used at different plateaus within a single “structured reality.” Diane

               struggle outlined by Bakhtin . . . in which dialogical forces of language actively
               contest the social and political centralization of their culture” (Hirschkop 74).
               My sole revision would be to replace “language” with “semiotics” as the deeper and
