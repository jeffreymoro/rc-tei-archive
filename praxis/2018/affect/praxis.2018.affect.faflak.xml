                        >Prometheus Unbound</title>, this essay examines the Romantic treatment of
                    feeling as a kind of affective ecology sustained by love. The poem reconstitutes
                    feeling, not as it indicates a subject formed by Enlightenment notions of words
                    or looks, but as an unrestrained <foreign>jouissance</foreign> that constitutes
                    the event of feeling itself. This event shatters the subject so that, as if to
                    tarry with a Jupiterian desire to conscript meaning, the subject can feel its
                    truth. </p>

                    <p> Many of Romanticism’s ur-texts, from <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young
                            Werther</title> (1774) to <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (1850),
                        apotheosize the eighteenth century’s increasing attention to feeling. Our
                        sensate response to the world—<foreign>sentio ergo sum—</foreign>spurred
                        Romanticism’s feeling enterprise as a part of its critical response <emph>to
                        </emph>feeling. Put another way, Romanticism struggles to understand affect
                        as expression, cognition, and cogitation, as when Wordsworth tempers the
                        spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling through the tranquil recollection
                        of emotion. This cognitive latency (feel first; think later) demanded a
                        measured response to feeling’s autonomous rhythms, the symptom of any number
                        of enthusiasms—religious, political, sexual, etc.—that excited concern.
                        Scholarship has long shared this (strangely passionate) distrust of feeling
                        (e.g., Wimsatt and Beardsley’s attack on affective criticism as Romantic
                            subjectivism).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mary Favret reminds us of this
                            “attack” in “The Study of Affect and Romanticism.” </note> Spurred by,
                        among other things, a return to the body in feminist and queer theory and
                        the transformation of emotion into a scientific object, we are now
                        rethinking feeling in Romanticism as a complex matrix of representational
                        and cognitive possibilities. Feeling and thinking are far more interrelated
                        than previously felt or thought, and feeling itself is anything but
                        ancillary to being.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Faflak and Sha.</note></p>
                    <p> Part of this effort requires that we parse feeling’s difference from itself.
                        Rei Terada distinguishes emotion as “a psychologically, at least minimally
                        interpretive experience whose physiological aspect is affect” from feeling,
                        “a capacious term that connotes both physiological sensations (affects) and
                        psychological states (emotions)” (14–15). For Brian Massumi, feeling is
                        affect materialized as virtual existence, a “zone of indistinction” that he
                        reads as a kind of political ecology (66). Affect is a “system” of
                        “autonomic responses” that the cognition of emotions “may seize upon . . .
                        [in order to] . . . ‘qualify’ or name them, but in doing so it ‘dampens’
                        their force or ‘resonance.’” Emotion “is affect ‘owned and recognized’; it
                        translates affect into ‘conventional, consensual’ form, where it can be
                        given ‘function and meaning’” (cited in Favret 1159). Or as Michael Hardt
                        argues, feeling transforms the “ontology of the human” by “illuminat[ing] .
                        . . both our power to affect the world around us and our power to be
                        affected by it, along with the relationship between these two powers” (xi).
                        Each of these cases speaks implicitly to a Romantic impulse at once to
                        understand and thus name feeling, and to give it free rein as a kind of
                        psychochemical radical transferring and transforming of relations between
                        subjects and their world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Sha.</note> What we feel
                        along our pulses registers the natural and preternatural (uncanny)
                        psychosomatics of our sensorium as it touches and withdraws from the world.
                        As Wordsworth says, “we cannot chuse but feel / That [man’s works] must
                        perish” (<title level="m">The Prelude </title>[1805] 5.20), which rather
                        ambivalently prefers feeling to rational determination <emph>and
                        </emph>marks feeling as our unavoidable lot tied to a death that we
                        unavoidably must feel. Our “works” are rather beside the point, for feeling
                            <emph>is </emph>our work, whether we like it or not.</p>
                    <p> This essay takes its cue from these authors as well as from accounts more
                        specifically targeting Romanticism. For Julie Carlson, Percy Shelley’s use
                        of simile, as embodied thought, unlike metaphor, which subordinates reality,
                        registers language’s affective pull as the feeling relationality among
                        selves as others. By enacting their difference from reality, similes offer a
                        non-defensive, non-coercive relation to the very antagonism they stage.
                        Richard C. Sha reads this relation in terms of the motion or force of
                        emotion as a “metalepsis” of the human and nonhuman (both mechanical and
                        divine), an unstable but productive relational matrix that subjectivity
                        materializes: “Emotions . . . literally matter because of the force they
                        contain,” Sha writes, “the mechanism by which the mental becomes somatic and
                        emotion is communicated” (23, 22). Emotions lack agency, but not
                        intentionality, and thus confuse the “border between matter and sociality,”
                        so that “affinities are necessarily multiple, and by implication, transient”
                        and “fungible” (31). This paradoxical transfer informs Terada’s sense of how
                        passion undoes “intentional subjectivity” to mark the “nonsubjectivity
                        within the very concept of the subject” (4–5), the non-human within the
                        human. And for Jacques Khalip, the above lines from Book Five of <title
                            level="m">The Prelude </title>suggest an inhuman automaticity that
                        expresses an “extreme kind of purposiveness without purpose—a zero-degree
                        relation of carelessness, a relation without relation” (631). </p>
                    <p> What does feeling “mean” as a form of inhuman cognition that at once locates
                        us in and beyond the world? I ask this question of Shelley’s <title
                            level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), in which the global effects
                        of feeling are writ large as cosmic phenomenon. Feeling is the eruption and
                        rupture of a material happening embodied through its subjects as feeling’s
                        virtual presences, feeling <emph>as </emph>virtual presence. Alain Badiou
                        describes this rupture as “the event.” For Badiou, within the givenness of
                        any situation, delimited by the dominant ideology of its social order, what
                        that order excludes and thus renders invisible threatens to erupt. “The
                        structure of situations” does not itself “deliver any truths”; rather, the
                        rupture constitutes the truth of “rupturing with the order which supports
                        it, never as an effect of that order” (xii). The event is thus a random,
                        local, subjective breach that calls attention to whatever exclusions made
                        and sustain the situation, a defamiliarizing moment that calls it to its
                            <emph>situatedness</emph>.</p>
                    <p> For my present purposes, I would argue that emotion carries the event’s
                        rupturing force, as in the spontaneity of Wordsworthian feeling. But to
                        Badiou’s sense of the event’s radical, incommensurate singularity, I would
                        add that emotion’s sheer immanence is at the same time tied to that which
                        incites it or to the situation in which it erupts—Wordsworth’s sense of
                        emotion’s recollection. In the simplest terms, emotion at once explodes and
                        gauges the situation it explodes, is at once apart from and embedded within,
                        and thus responsive to and responsible for, the situation. Put another way,
                        by materializing subjects <emph>as </emph>subjects, emotion registers their
                        embeddedness within any situation’s ideological constraints, but also marks
                        them as exceptions to its (and to the subject’s) rule. In the “perpetual
                        Orphic Song” (4.415) that is the fourth act of Shelley’s lyrical drama,
                        Panthea and Ione are awakened by the Voice of Unseen Spirits, who bring news
                        of Prometheus’ unbinding and subsequent union with Asia, a marriage and
                        transformation of unfathomable proportions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">All quotations

                        an affective ecology whose happiness at once agitates and is agitated by
                        “Storm” and “panic.” Contrary to the poem’s otherwise idealist and
                        idealistic slant, Shelley’s environment is both self-possessed and possessed
                        by the agents of its unfolding—who are, in turn, possessed by its autonomous
                        functioning and self-possessed enough at once to be shaped by and to endure
                        its arbitrary purposiveness. </p>
                    <p> The key word here is “shake,” which marks the power of emotional response in
                        excess of itself, something that exceeds cognitive recognition. It also
                        marks the ambivalence of one’s feeling response to the world as an agency
                        without agents, a force materialized through the expressions that it
                        generates in turn. Coincidentally, the OED defines “emotion” as “movement,
                        disturbance, perturbation, or instance of this” by citing Shelley’s “Love’s
                        Philosophy,” first published in <title level="m">Posthumous Poems
                        </title>(1824): “The fountains mingle with the river, / And the rivers with
                        the ocean, / The winds of heaven mix forever / With a sweet emotion” (1–4).
                        Emotion also means “an agitation of mind; an excited mental state.
                        Subsequently: any strong mental or instinctive feeling, as pleasure, grief,
                        hope, fear, etc., deriving esp. from one's circumstances, mood, or
                        relationship with others.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">In “Tintern Abbey,” Wordsworth
                            writes that he has “felt / A presence that disturbs me with the joy / Of
                            elevated thoughts, a sense sublime / Of something far more deeply
                            interfused” (<title level="m">Poetical Works </title>94–97).</note>
                        “Sweet emotion” and “shake with emotion” thus suggest both Heraclitean
                        contingency and pantheistic interconnection (in “Love’s Philosophy,” Shelley
                        continues: “Nothing in the world is single; / All things by a law divine /
                        In one another’s being mingle” [5–7]). Here an emotive nature is not the
                        world humanized, as in a nature rendered “instinct with feeling” by the
                        poet, to borrow a common (by Shelley’s time even hackneyed) phrase, but
                        rather (to borrow another Shelleyan word) enkindled by and as its own
                        sensorium. “Instinct” signifies an autonomous, unwilled self-fashioning, a
                        nature imbued with or animated by feeling but also an innate, spontaneous
                        impulse that disturbs or resists rational cognition, as in Darwin’s account
                        of species formation. Eventually emotion becomes a transitive verb: “to
                        cause to move; to make emotional” and “to affect or imbue with emotion; to
                        make emotional” (OED), which denotes our current understanding of “emoting”
                        as performance. Ironically, this aesthetics of feeling partly recalls
                        Aristotle’s purgation of emotion (<foreign>katharsis ton
                            pathematon</foreign>) and reminds us that feeling stages our
                        subjectivities without our knowing: we only come to know feeling once we
                        feel or see it “staged” for us in turn.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jungian analyst

                            apprehend feeling, which is for her the core of gaining access to one’s
                            unconscious life, one must turn the feeling into an image; but to

                    <p> Put differently, in and through feeling we both find and lose our bearings
                        in the world. Shelley’s rejoinder, “But where are ye?”, asked directly of
                        Ione and Panthea, also addresses all of us as subjects, a dilemma embedded
                        in the ultimate question of Shelley’s truncated final poem: “Then, what is
                        Life?” To say that the cognition of where we fit in the world is
                            <emph>more</emph> than a feeling, to name this essay’s title, suggests a
                        super-addition that makes feeling relevant, understandable—an
                            <foreign>Aufhebung </foreign>in which affect and emotion meet to become
                        cognizable, in which we become cognizant of feeling <emph>as </emph>feeling.
                        But <emph>more</emph> also indicates the event of emotion that feeling
                        itself cannot sublate or render normative, feeling as an excess beyond
                        itself. Feeling is thus both superfluity, something that neither
                        rationality, mental cognition, nor understanding can easily assimilate, and
                        a superabundance that imbricates us within the larger affective matrix that
                        situates us within the world. Binding the above etymologies is emotion as
                        “political agitation, civil unrest” (which again echoes Badiou’s sense of
                        the event), but also of “a movement from one place to another, a migration”
                        (OED). Shelley’s poem senses a world moving both within and beyond its own
                        boundaries. Feeling registers this migratory impulse as a threat that also
                        leads humanity, and its detrimental effects, beyond itself to a brighter but
                        also radically unknown (and thus equally terrifying) future. <title

                        idealistic of Shelley’s texts, expresses an “idealism without
                            absolutes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I borrow this phrase from the title of a
                            volume of essays edited by Tilottama Rajan and Arkady Plotnitsky on the
                            afterlife of German Idealism. They speak of Romanticism an “idealism
                            without absolutes, rather than any kind of absolute materialism or
                            idealism,” which is also to read the influence of German Idealism as
                            “not only configured by materiality but also” as something that “itself
                            reconstitutes the material: both ‘materiality’ as a concept, and the
                            material with which philosophy deals” (2).</note></p>
                    <p> In his Preface to the poem, Shelley speaks of poets as “the combined product
                        of such internal powers as modify the nature of others.” They express the
                        power of poetry as a “mimetic art” that “creates by combination and
                        representation,” to produce “some intelligible and beautiful analogy with
                        those sources of emotion and thought,” by which he means “the mind of man”
                        and “nature” (208). For Shelley this “analogy” takes the form of “imagery .
                        . . drawn from the operations of the human mind, or from those external
                        actions by which they are expressed” (207). This creative reciprocity
                        between mind and world immediately (dis)locates images of the brain, like
                        those of a dream, to a transitional space that is at once communal and
                        nowhere, which is to prompt the question of where such images reside and
                        what effect they might have. Shelley locates the poem’s impetus in an effort
                        to “annihilate” the “moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully
                        sustained by the sufferings and endurance of Prometheus,” by attempting to
                        “conceive of him as unsaying his high language” (206). This rethinking of
                        language’s power to convey, control, and coerce thought is an attempt to
                        discover and explore a radically different vocabulary that would express
                        “some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement
                        it” (208). That the future remains “unimagined” suggests Shelley’s “‘passion
                        for reforming the world,’” yet without a plan to do so, which invokes the
                        customary disparagement of a Shelleyan politics out of touch with reality.
                        But to mark change as “unimagined” is to mark the negative potentiality of
                        three possibilities: a catastrophic outcome avoided, as in the recurrence of
                        despotism against all resistance to the contrary; a future that may or will
                        never come, as in the frustrated hope for political change; or, most
                        radically in Shelley, an event left unfulfilled so as precisely to make way
                        for its possible occurrence. This unimagined “something evermore about to
                        be” evokes a sense of threat that haunts Act One as Prometheus struggles to
                        recall his curse against Jupiter. Yet as we shall see, it haunts the poem’s
                        movement toward its future—toward the future—as a progress without
                            <foreign>telos</foreign>, a trajectory that materializes as if from and
                        within the motions of its own immanence, which is to say the immanence of
                        emotion itself. </p>

                    <p>In his opening speech, Prometheus rails against Jupiter for the toxic
                        emotions—“fear and self-contempt and barren hope” (1.8); “mine own misery
                        and thy vain revenge” (11)—over which Prometheus “Hast [been] made [to]
                        reign and triumph, to thy scorn” (10). For Jupiter’s attempt to legislate
                        another’s emotional life—for how Jupiter’s tyranny tries to make Prometheus
                            <emph>feel—</emph>Prometheus, who refuses to accept the emotions that
                        result from the affect transmitted by Jupiter’s reign, feels not “Disdain”
                        but “pity” for Jupiter (53). Hence, in Act One Prometheus is no longer made
                        to endure but actively <emph>asks </emph>to endure, not <emph>what
                        </emph>his curse said, but <emph>how </emph>it was said, how it might now be
                        recalled in order to transform its effect. Which is why the Phantasm of
                        Jupiter, not of Prometheus, repeats the curse, to which Prometheus replies,
                        in one of the poem’s most moving statements of the ethics of affect, “It
                        doth repent me” (303). Having been “made” to rule an emotional “empire” not
                        of his making, and thus reluctantly estranged from an emotional life he
                        longs to claim, Prometheus, who nonetheless “endure[s],” turns outward to
                        “Earth” and “Heaven” to ask if they have “seen” or “heard [his] agony” (15,
                        24, 25, 26, 27, 29). This gesture is less to gain sympathetic witness to his
                        eternal “pain” than to reclaim, not the words, which “are quick and vain,”
                        but the toxic affect that fueled and sustained the curse’s utterance, the
                        breath of which left Earth’s “wan breast . . . dry / With grief,” and “the
                        thin air . . . stained / With the contagion of a mother’s hate / Breathed on
                        her child’s destroyer” (30, 303, 176–79). </p>
                    <p> Earth and Heaven are thus impoverished by the <emph>sound </emph>of the
                        curse, at first repeated in the four Voices of mountains, springs, air, and
                        whirlwinds. On one hand, Earth resounds with the “dying fall” that encrypts
                        the curse’s ruinous effect. On the other hand, Earth’s “Caverns” remain
                        “tongueless,” except to hear the “hollow Heaven” and “Ocean’s purple waves”
                        cry “Misery!” to the “pale nations” (107, 108, 109, 111). Between Philomel
                        and Echo, that is to say, affect might be heard—sounded—in either violent or
                        transformational ways. More particularly, in the transmission of affect<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors">I borrow this phrase, of course, from the title of Teresa
                            Brennan’s trenchant book, which asks us to re-think, non-pathologically,
                            how affect and its energy of feeling is absorbed by and between
                            subjects, and thus both permeates and blurs the boundary between mind
                            and body. </note> that eventually transforms the life of the poem’s
                        emotional landscape, the text emphasizes the sound of echoes, an odd
                        displacement that paradoxically marks the very thing that echoes are, the
                        mode of their difference from themselves as difference itself, and the echo
                        as sound’s difference from itself. This is why Prometheus “hear[s] <emph>a
                            sound</emph> of voices—not <emph>the</emph> voice / Which [he] gave
                        forth” (112–13; my emphasis), as if to take ethical and moral responsibility
                        for the effect his emotions have, not just on others, but on the environment
                        that both marks him and upon which his existence inevitably leaves its mark.
                        Prometheus accuses the Earth of not knowing him, and implores her not to
                        “deny” him his “dreadful words” (185). But this is only to mark her
                        “inorganic voice” (135). It is more critical that he hears the “melancholy”
                        (152) carried by that voice in order to mourn the mourning of its past
                        effects and affect. That is to say, Prometheus would move past the cycle of
                        mourning itself, emblazoned as what Panthea, having heard the Chorus of
                        Furies come to tempt Prometheus to despair, calls “A woeful sight—a youth /
                        With patient looks nailed to a crucifix” (584–85). Such is the logic of
                        Jupiter’s emotional tyranny that “In each human heart terror survives / The
                        ravin it has gorged” (618–19) and men “live among their suffering fellow men
                        / As if none felt” (630–31). This is at once to legislate the self-predatory
                        nature of affect (not unlike Freud’s notion of guilt internalized as the
                        superego in the name of a self-lacerating and thus self-governing
                        conscience) and to atomize subjects so as to pre-empt any movement of
                        feeling and thus neutralize its potential resistance.</p>
                    <p> His immortality at first keeps Prometheus from hearing the sound of his own
                        (past) voice; as the Earth reminds him, “How canst thou hear / Who knowest
                        not the language of the dead?” (137–38). But his eternal nature reflects a
                        broader emotional landscape, less the timeless utopianism that uncannily
                        depends upon an equally endless cycle between hope and despair for its
                        possible apocalypse (hence the Christian redemptive eschatology that
                        Prometheus eschews), than “merely” the harbinger of things to come, in which
                        the future remains radically unknown so as not to predetermine and thus
                        constrain its emotional life. This is, paradoxically, why dread and terror
                        as much as love and hope sustain this life as a “voice to be accomplished”
                        (3.3.67). Earth, who “dare[s] not speak” the words of the curse, instead has
                        been “mediat[ing]” upon them “In secret joy and hope” (184–86),
                        “Preserve[d], a treasured spell,” among “the inarticulate people of the
                        dead” (183–84). Like the frozen affect of the melancholic, she encrypts the
                        source of her lament, the refuge, as Shelley writes in <title level="m"
                            >Adonais</title>, of “what is still dear” as that which “Attracts to
                        crush, repels to make thee wither” (473, 474). The curse is thus “dreadful”
                        because it bears the hope of a secret that, as Nietzsche suggests in “On
                        Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense,” becomes the empty center around which
                        a mobile army of metaphors and metonymies orchestrate themselves in order to
                        exert the force of truth. Arriving to “execute” a “doom of new revenge,”
                        Jupiter’s son Mercury compels Prometheus to “Clothe . . . in words” the
                        “secret known” to Prometheus of the term of Jupiter’s tyranny (355, 375,
                        371). Like the Foucauldian psychiatrist who feeds the discursive regimes of
                        power by coaxing the confessant’s internal life into the open, Mercury’s
                        promise of redemption and thus happiness, signified by the remedial
                        authority of his “serpent-cinctured wand” (324), feels to Prometheus like
                        the Sword of Damocles (396–405). </p>
                    <p> Yet Prometheus tarries with the <foreign>pharmakon</foreign> in other ways,
                        for he risks re-agitating the same emotional pestilence he was unwillingly
                        made to incite, like a toxin injected into bodies—given bodily
                        form—(hopefully) to mobilize antibodies against the poison it cultivates.
                        That is to say, he must claim the curse’s affect <emph>as his own</emph> in
                        order both to reject and to transform its affective coding. He calls up the
                        archive or Wayback Machine (as it were) of his emotional life in order, like
                        Shelley’s notion of poetry’s re-creative effects from existing causes, to
                        envision this life’s hardwiring otherwise. Very early in the poem Prometheus
                        pities and thus disavows Jupiter’s tyranny. But again, only once he
                        “endures” the variously toxic causes and effects that lead to pity do the
                        various Furies, sent to torment his desire back into bodily (i.e., verbal)
                        form, vanish (634). The text allegorizes this excoriating process when the
                        Earth says that the words of Prometheus’ curse “shall be told” (191), a
                        powerfully passive construction that immediately displaces the force and
                        thus potential affect of their saying: <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> The passage reads as an uncanny template of Lacanian
                        self-encounter. In cursing Jupiter, Prometheus became what he beheld, as if
                        to enter the mirror stage in which we witness for the first time the
                        symbolic contours of our selfhood <emph>as </emph>self, yet simultaneously
                        recognize that our desire <emph>for </emph>this self is constituted
                        precisely by the desire <emph>of </emph>self we witness in the other. Such
                        an encounter turns both sides of the reflection into a specular exchange or
                        transference from which it seems impossible to escape. We might say that the
                        poem begins with Prometheus recognizing this trap. Put another way, the
                        passage invites the subject to witness his own (“sole”) death as the burial
                        of a potential (“unimagined”) life that is less the site of a possible
                        repression (for Shelley repression signals inevitable death) than the
                        unconscious that psychoanalysis can never presume to know. Or to paraphrase
                        Prometheus answering Mercury asking about the “period of Jove’s power,” “I
                        know but this, that it must come” (412–13).</p>
                    <p> The Earth invites passage through the mirror stage to a different
                        constitution of things that does not depend upon the tyrannical power of the
                        gaze in which the other and its Jupiterian authority hope to catch subjects.
                        This “Infinity [that] shall be / A robe of envenomed agony” (288–89)
                        signifies the endless cycle of a possible redemption calcified in the image
                        of a crucified saviour. Gazing upon the Phantasm of Jupiter, Prometheus
                        “see[s] the curse on gestures proud and cold, / And looks of firm defiance,
                        and calm hate, / And such despair as mocks itself with smiles, / Written as
                        on a scroll” (258–61). Shelley’s hermeneutics of facial anatomy suggests
                        Charles Bell’s <title level="m">Essays on the Anatomy and Philosophy of
                            Expression</title> (1824), which reads in the face’s visual topography a
                        spiritual dimension. And Bell’s text anticipates Charles Darwin’s <title
                            level="m">The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals</title> (1872),
                        which re-thinks the relationship between mind and body in terms of a biology
                        of emotion that links mental states to the human and animal movement across
                        and between species through time and space. Like Bell, Darwin uses
                        illustrations as well as photographs to visualize and materialize emotion in
                        process. Yet Shelley’s poem avoids this materialization precisely for its
                        desire (as Massumi notes) to “capture” affect as emotion. As Ione notes
                        after the appearance of Jupiter’s Phantasm, this image of emotion is “but
                        some passing spasm” that would have us, in the words of the First Fury, “die
                        with our desire” (314, 351).</p>
                    <p> In this way, the melancholy of Earth’s voice, which is the echo of
                        Prometheus’ own desire, carries a transforming, semiotic energy. Julia
                        Kristeva accounts for language’s unsteadily disruptive but renewable force
                        as the semiotic <foreign>chora</foreign>, an “essentially mobile and
                        extremely provisional articulation constituted by movements and their
                        ephemeral stases” (<title level="m">Revolution </title>24). Similar to the
                        primary processes in Freudian dreamwork, the <emph>chora</emph> is comprised
                        of “‘energy’ charges as well as ‘psychical’ marks” (25), both the force of
                        the drives and the impressions they leave behind. Associated with the
                        infant’s biological attachment to mother, and thus constellating the matrix
                        of all intersubjective relationships, the semiotic denotes the psychic
                        “binding” of our instinctual and libidinal “motility.” It thus registers the
                        inextricable link of the material and the psychic as part of a
                            “<foreign>signifying process</foreign>” into which all subjects are born
                        and out of which they emerge (25). The semiotic marks the residual
                        materiality of the mother’s body, which is also to say of any primordial
                        sustaining presence or force that registers the subject’s first bodily
                        experience. It thus also marks the matrix of our environmental disposition
                        in the world, the transferential space of our attachment to things, and the
                        energy that at once sustains this relation and perpetually disrupts and
                        (re)generates its manifestation <foreign>as </foreign>relation. The semiotic
                        denotes the reciprocal movement of melancholy itself, of how we are at once
                        born from a past without origin and borne toward a future with trajectory
                        but without <foreign>telos</foreign>. Or as Kristeva writes, without “a bent
                        for melancholia there is no psyche,” for “there is no imagination that is
                        not, overtly or secretly, melancholy,” an “<emph>impossible mourning</emph>”
                        for “an inaccessible—and inaccessibly lost—object” (<title level="m">Black
                            Sun </title>6, 9). Melancholic semiosis—the melancholy <emph>of
                        </emph>semiosis—thus also sustains the affect of sound—the sound <emph>of
                        </emph>affect—that carries the work of affect itself in the poem, the echoes
                        of sound that mark the intrinsic movement through space of sound as an
                        object “inaccessibly lost.”</p>
                    <p> At the end of Act One we anticipate the arrival in Act Two of Asia’s
                        “transforming presence—which would fade / If it were mingled not with [that
                        of Prometheus]” (832–33), which is to say the affective life Act One has
                        worked hard to release—or rather, to keep “unregarded” (3.4.179), to borrow
                        a word from a different context in Act Three. Once the last of the Furies
                        vanishes, Prometheus invokes “two woes: / To speak and to behold” (646–47).
                        Earth having “spare[d]” (647) him one by re-calling the echoes of his curse,
                        the poem now tackles the second vehicle by which emotion has transferred
                        itself: the Enlightenment power of the gaze. Earth thus calls upon “those
                        subtle and fair spirits / Whose homes are the dim caves of human thought”;
                        who “behold / Beyond that twilight realm, as in a glass, / The future”
                        (658–63); and who “breathe, and sicken not, / The atmosphere of human
                        thought” (675–76). This glimpse into, as opposed to gaze upon, the future
                        carries the affective force of “despair / Mingled with love, and then
                        dissolved in sound” (756–57) before it can calcify into image. The force of
                        affect in the poem will now be carried by the materiality of sound that
                        contains it, not as emotion, but as a feeling in which, as Panthea says
                        struggling to speak, “all . . . words are drowned” (758). This “form of
                        Love” (763), like Shelley’s “shape all light” in <title level="m">The
                            Triumph of Life</title>, is constituted by the “sense” of sound that
                        “Remains . . . like the Omnipotence / Of music when the inspired voice and
                        lute / Languish” but carries on “through the deep and labyrinthine soul”
                            (801–05).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Here I mark my indebtedness, again, to
                            Julie Carlson’s analysis of Shelley’s similes as invoking the “feel” of
                            love, and to an unpublished essay on <title level="m">The Triumph of
                                Life </title>by Chris Washington that reads the poem as what I would
                            call the triumph of, to borrow a word from Deleuze, an incompossible
                            love: love <emph>as </emph>incompossible. Washington writes: “Shelley’s
                            theory of love suggests not the egoistic chaos of a world lost to
                            political anarchy but rather a radical politics of love that creates
                            worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests new types of life,
                            of living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world
                            without us we could never have possibly anticipated because those worlds
                            do not yet exist” (courtesy of the author).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p> The force of this form, which is to say the form that the force itself takes
                        as feeling—the form <emph>of</emph> feeling—is Ione and Panthea’s reading of
                        the turmoil in Prometheus’ soul while sitting at his feet throughout Act
                        One. Specifically, Panthea reads this affect as it is registered by Ione,
                        then carried by Panthea to Asia as the “wordless converse” (2.1.52) that has
                        all along been transpiring between Asia and Prometheus.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            My ensuing reading of this “wordless converse” is indebted to Rajan’s
                            account of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>in <title
                                level="m">The Supplement of Reading</title>. For Rajan,
                            communication through the eyes bypasses language, yet offers an exchange
                            equally complex. In Rajan’s deconstructive reading, affect, like
                            language, functions (or threatens to function) logocentrically to close
                            of its own complexity, whereas I might argue for a more Kristevan
                            reading in which affect, like the semiotic, persistently disrupts any
                            symbolic or representational system. That is to say, affect at once
                            perpetuates the ocular transference of affect, but circumvents the
                            coercive power of the gaze. </note> Asia instructs Panthea to “Lift up
                        thine eyes / And let me read thy dream” (55–56), which is actually two
                        dreams, one of which, tellingly, she “remember[s] not” (61). In the other
                        dream Panthea envisions the liberation of Prometheus’ body, coerced by the
                        feeling of Jupiter’s tyranny, to reveal “the glory of that form / Which
                        lives unchanged within,” through which “his voice fell / Like music which
                        makes giddy the dim brain / Faint with intoxication of keen joy” (64–67).
                        Imploring Panthea to “lift thine eyes on me,” she “[feels] / His presence
                        flow and mingle through my blood / Till it became his life and his grew mine
                        / And I was thus absorbed” (70, 79–82). To Asia, the transmission of these
                        “words” are at first “as the air”: “I feel them not . . . oh, lift / Thine
                        eyes that I may read his written soul!” (108–10). This exchange materializes
                        feeling, not as emotion, but as the situation or event of its own unfolding,
                        the “written” quality of this experience as “soul” being the shape it takes
                            <emph>as </emph>it unfolds. The interchange between Panthea and Asia
                        thus transpires as through a glass darkly, a mirror without surface in which
                        the transmission of affect is “dark, far, measureless / Orb within orb, and
                        line through line inwoven” (116–17). </p>
                    <p> This transmission having been enacted in the first scene, the sound of
                        echoes is then transported in the second scene through a Semichorus of
                        Spirits, which revives the melancholy voice of Earth as it fades, “Till some
                        new strain of feeling bear / The song” (2.2.34–35) into the third scene,
                        where music materializes on Earth a sound “Awful as silence” (2.3.36). Asia
                        describes this event as the “sun-awakened avalanche” that unleashes the
                        “thought by thought . . . piled” by “Heaven-defying minds,” “till some great
                        truth / Is loosened, and the nations echo round / Shaken to their roots”
                        (37, 39–42). Asia and Panthea are carried as if to the previously
                        “tongueless caverns” of the Earth, specifically the cave of Demogorgon in
                        which “A spell is treasured but for thee alone” (88). Here they confront “a
                        mighty Darkness / Filling the seat of power,” “Ungazed upon and
                        shapeless:—neither limb / Nor form nor outline” (2.4.2–6). But, “[they] feel
                        it is / A living Spirit” (6-7). In her confrontation with Demogorgon, Asia
                        is told that, ultimately, “the Abysm / [Cannot] vomit forth its secrets,”
                        for “a voice / Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless” (114–16). In one of
                        the poem’s key statements of the ineluctability of necessity, it would
                        “avail [not] to bid thee <emph>gaze</emph> / On the revolving world” or “to
                        bid speak / Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change,” for “To these / All
                        things are subject but eternal Love” (117–20; my emphasis). In this way,
                        “eternal Love” comes to signify that moment in which feeling, as event,
                        ruptures things as they are to reveal, to return to Badiou, the truth of the
                        subject’s experience. Put another way, this truth <emph>of
                        </emph>experience, at the moment of its happening, becomes radically
                        incommensurate with the situation from which it emerged, yet within which it
                        remains ineluctably enmeshed except as it (potentially) shifts this
                        situation’s terms of reference.</p>
                    <p> The poem’s utopian thrust suggests that transformation attends this
                        evolution. As Asia ascends from her encounter, Panthea tells her she can
                        feel “How thou art changed!” but “dare not look on thee”: “I feel, but see
                        thee not” (2.5.16–17). Emissary of the atmosphere of love that is the Earth
                        transformed by a kind of cosmic “sympathy” (34), the voice of Spirits alone
                        now governs the poem’s unfolding, in which the “breath” of the “Life of
                        life” is exchanged “between” the “lips” they “enkindle,” and are then
                        “screen[ed] . . . / In those looks where whoso gazes / Faints, entangled in
                        their mazes” (2.5.48–53). Shelley’s use of “screen” means at once,
                        paradoxically, to obstruct, to divide, to protect, and (to borrow Shelley’s
                        own use in <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> [1813]), to “conceal, obscure,
                        or disguise” (OED). Taken together, the “screen” also evokes for us as
                        contemporary readers an instance of cinematic encounter in which neither
                        gaze holds the other captive but instead suggests a reciprocity, not between
                        bounded subjects, but of an agency without agents. In this moment of
                        Heideggerian <foreign>Schein</foreign>, existence simultaneously reveals
                        itself to and hides itself from our grasp,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the

                            <emph>of </emph>spirit: “And all feel, yet see thee never / As I feel
                        now, lost forever!” Emotion and affect, mind and body, thought and sense are
                        inextricable from one another in these matrices of feeling in which Asia
                        experiences her “soul [as] an enchanted boat”: “Till like one in slumber
                        bound / Borne to the Ocean, I float down, around, / Into a Sea profound, of
                        ever-spreading sound” (82–84). Here the two-way circuit of desire that keeps
                        subjects in their place through a Jupiterian transmission of affect is now
                        “Without a course—without a star— / But by the instinct of sweet Music
                        driven” (89–90).</p>
                    <p> It is in light of the disembodied materiality of sound accomplished in Act
                        Two that we then read the dramatic irony of Jupiter’s opening speech in Act
                        Three. Here he anticipates a spirit “which unbodied now / Between us,
                        floats, felt although unbeheld, / Waiting the incarnation” (3.1.44–46),
                        shortly after which Demogorgon arrives to take Jupiter to “dwell together /
                        Henceforth in darkness” (55–56). Instead, Hercules arrives to unbind
                        Prometheus, enacted without fuss in a stage direction at the opening of
                        Scene Three. This apparently negligible event at same time signifies the
                        quantum and cosmic space and time of transformation itself between the at
                        once adamantine and utterly ephemeral nature of a Jupiterian emotional
                        tyranny. In the cave to which Prometheus and Asia will retire (which journey
                        remains at the level of prophecy in the poem), Prometheus enjoins Ione to
                        “chant fragments of sea-music,” which shall resonate with “echoes of the
                        human world, which tell / Of the low voice of love, almost unheard” (27,
                        44–45): <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> Yet as if to scatter these “fragments” of “wandering
                        voices” and “shadows . . . / Of all that man becomes” (57–58), Prometheus
                        then implores her to give to the Spirit of the Hour the “curved shell that
                        Proteus old / Made Asia’s nuptial boon,” which contains a “voice to be
                        accomplished” (3.3.65–67). Thus “Loosening its mighty music . . . it shall
                        be / As thunder mingled with clear echoes” (81–82), what Act Four calls “an
                        Ocean / Of clear emotion” (96–97). Echoes that are “clear” are at once pure,
                        bright, transparent, unclouded, capable of allowing sound to pass without
                        obstruction—again, screens both through and upon which sound might transfer.
                        As Prometheus then bends to kiss the ground, Earth responds, “I hear—I
                        feel—” (84). Here the “sound” and “look” of feeling mobilize its meta-global
                        economy as Prometheus’s “touch runs down / Even to the adamantine central
                        gloom / Along these marble veins” (“stony veins” [1.153]) as “The Warmth of
                        an immortal youth shoots down / Circling” (3.3.85–90). Like Panthea’s
                        absorption by and in Prometheus, or Prometheus by and in Asia, unbound
                        Prometheus becomes the avatar of an unrestrained feeling that is at once the
                        blood and breath of the earth’s affective ecology, the agency of its sound
                        and sight. Or as Prometheus says to the Spirit of the Hour, “We feel what
                        thou hast heard and seen” (97). As if further to mark this final
                        transformation of feeling, the Spirit, prophesying the “mighty change as I
                        had felt within / Expressed in outward things” (129–30), acknowledges how
                        humans will be “Speaking the wisdom once they could not think, / Looking the
                        emotions once they feared to feel” (157–58). This last phrasing visualizes
                        emotion, as in Bell or Darwin, as if to mark the image’s capacity to
                        register and thus fix feeling, yet also as if to fulfill the poem’s promise
                        of an unrestrained emotional life, the migration of feeling across
                        subjective borders, unchecked throughout the world and beyond.<note

                            indebted to Alan Bewell’s essay in <title level="m">Marking Time:

                    </p>
                    <p> Yet in a final, remarkable turn, Act Three “[tears] aside” the “painted veil
                        . . . called life” that “mimicked, as with colours idly spread, / All men
                        believed and hoped” to reveal man “Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed—but
                        man” (190–92, 194–95). To leave man “but man” is to reclaim a feeling
                        humanity lost through Jupiter’s tyranny but regained through the possibility
                        of love. Yet man also remains “Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like
                        slaves, / From chance and death and mutability,” the “clogs of that which
                        else might oversoar / The loftiest star of unascended Heaven / Pinnacled dim
                        in the intense inane” (200–01, 202–04). In Act Two, as we have seen,
                        Demogorgon tells Asia that “All things are subject to [Fate, Time, Occasion,
                        Chance and Change] but eternal Love.” Within this penultimate context,
                        feeling materializes, not the utopianism of love, which would be once again
                        to trap “All men” in what they “believed and hoped,” but a future to come in
                        (as Reiman and Fraistat annotate “intense inane”) a “formless void of
                        infinite space” (269n). Here what remains incommensurate nonetheless
                        registers with “intense” force, the indistinguishable locus of feeling
                        itself as the air we breathe. In this sense, although Shelley calls it love,
                        which is to invoke the political idealism of a society renovated by
                        sympathetic encounters without violence, terror, or tyranny, it is also love
                        as the inevitability and unavoidability <emph>of</emph> encounter that
                            <emph>is</emph> our feeling life. Like drive as the difference between
                        desire in Freud’s psychic economy, feeling moves always with an
                        unanticipated trajectory. Or as Shelley writes in “On Love,” “It is that
                        powerful attraction towards all that we conceive or fear or hope beyond
                        ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                        void and seek to awaken in all things that are a community with what we
                        experience within ourselves” (503). Love materializes this desire to have
                        “another’s nerves . . . vibrate to our own, . . . the beams of their eyes .
                        . . kindle at once and melt into our own” (503). </p>
                    <p>Here, however, the feeling mode that would transform the world is a
                        “perpetual Orphic song, / Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng / Of
                        thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapes were” (415–17). In this
                        “work [that] shall be called the Promethean” (158), feeling is (necessarily)
                        in constant flux, what Sha calls the “motion of emotion”: “Break the dance,
                        and scatter the song; / Let some depart and some remain” (159–60); or, “Even
                        whilst we speak / New notes arise . . . What is that awful sound?” (184–85).
                        In such gaps Ione hears “under-notes, / Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening
                        tones / Which pierce the sense and live within the soul” (189–91), a
                        labyrinthine reality—Earth’s “multitudinous Orb” (253)—described at length
                        (194–318). Yet we can recall that Daedalus, who built the ground upon which
                        Ariadne danced or the labyrinth into which Theseus carried Ariadne’s golden
                        thread so that he could slay the Minotaur and get back out, also created
                        wings for Icarus to fly to the sun, a story without a happy ending.
                        Shelley’s conceptualization of feeling as a labyrinthine matrix from which
                        it is impossible to extract ourselves because there is no “beyond” to this
                        world, one in which feeling traces Deleuzian lines of flight between things
                        that are themselves in flight, is haunted by the specter of fallen
                            gods.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his reading of <title level="m">The Triumph

                        emotion that transpires within and sustains the poem’s environment by Act
                        Four, like that between Asia, Ione, and Panthea, materializes a circuitry in
                        which no one knows whose desire is whose. </p>
                    <p> That is as feeling should be, which carried even to its cosmic dimension
                        produces an endlessly generative movement between beings and things—or
                        rather things <emph>as </emph>beings; or as the Moon says, illuminated by
                        the light of an earth renovated by the love between Prometheus and Asia,
                        “Gazing on thee I feel, I know” (4.363). This loss of identity is not a
                        problem insofar as it signifies a kind of unrestrained communication between
                        people and things that is Shelley’s ideal of a world liberated from the
                        Jupiterian tyranny of words and looks, the uninhibited flow of a “wordless
                        converse” that finds Shelley inspired by the spirit of Godwin’s ideal of
                        unrestrained conversation. Yet Shelley’s description in “On Love,” and the
                        Moon’s subsequent statement that “a lover or chameleon / Grows like what it
                        looks upon” (4.483–84), encrypts the possibility of subjects at once formed
                        and trapped in the mirror stage of their own constitution. In this world of
                        “A universal sound like words” (518), Demogorgon’s final speech rings rather
                        ominously. It speaks of “Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom and Endurance” as
                        “spells by which to reassume / An empire o’er the disentangled Doom” (562,
                        568–69). This is to register the <emph>entangled </emph>labyrinth of feeling
                        as the <emph>only </emph>spell we have, the drive of affect reflecting a
                        mindless force that is our being without Being. Here I am reminded of
                        Khalip’s notion of the inhuman automaticity or relationality between things.
                        In this way the poem re-invokes the complex Lacanian circuit of desire in
                        which we only know our desire as that of the other, through which neither
                        sides owns desire but rather circulates in the non-space of transference
                        between their subjectivities. Put another way, in the “wordless converse”
                        that is the exchange of feeling, we are eternally left to find our own way.
                        This is neither tragedy, nor comedy, nor farce, but it does locate feeling
                        itself as incompossible with any experience that is the very situation it
                        materializes and by which it is materialized.</p>
                    <p> Perhaps this is where Shelley means to leave us. In Act One the Chorus of
                        Spirits sing, “Though Ruin now Love’s shadow be” (780), as if, like
                        Benjamin’s Angel of History, we proceed into the future, like Orpheus
                        walking away from Eurydice, always by virtue of the past disaster of a
                        feeling incommensurate with itself. In <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>,
                        Shelley’s vision, torn between idealism and skepticism, is over-ambitiously
                        cosmic, as if (unintentionally, but inevitably) out of touch with the world
                        it seeks to express and thus reform. The empiricism of the poem’s
                        labyrinthine footnotes threaten to deflate the poem’s otherwise lofty
                        visionary spirit, like Shelley’s warning in <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry </title>(1821) that the world threatens to bury us with our
                        knowledge. Certainly the political dimension of Shelley’s verse, especially
                        as he envisions its devastating progress in <title level="m">The Triumph of
                            Life</title> (1824), imagines an idealism without absolutes. In this
                        sense, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is resolutely earthbound,
                        though anything but terrestrial, for here Shelley envisions nothing less
                        than an ecology sustained by its own emotional life, a vitality of cosmic
                        expansiveness that marks the inextricable link between human and nonhuman
                        sensoria. We remain unable to grasp this broader feeling network because we
                        exist in its midst as both its products and generators. Feeling sustains the
                        poem’s atmosphere as part of a global emotional ecology. This ecology
                        indicates not just the transfer between subjects and the world, but the
                        movement of affective transference that is literally the air we breathe, the
                        very mode and matrix of our existence. Subjects call the world into
                        emotional existence and this existence materializes their emotional
                        lives—the life <emph>of </emph>emotion—in turn. Joy, hope, happiness
                        constitute the possible fulfillment of the poem’s emotional life as
                        something devoutly to be wished for but ruinously possible, an existence in
                        which, as Shelley concludes the poem, we must “love” and “bear” and “hope,
                        till Hope creates / From its own wreck the thing it contemplates” (573–74).
                        Which is to say that Shelley also seems aware that affect shatters the
                        subject. Leo Bersani argues that “Freud’s most profound originality . . . is
                        to propose . . . that the sexualizing of the ego is identical to the
                        shattering of the ego” (66). In this catastrophe “affect [is set] free from
                        psychic organization; unbound affect produces the excitement of
                            <foreign>jouissance</foreign>,” which at its most extreme is that of a
                        “satisfied aggression [that] at once hyperbolizes the ego and risks
                        shattering its boundaries” (67). Put another way, only this catastrophe of
                        feeling—this feeling <emph>of </emph>catastrophe--reminds us we are alive.
                        Shelley’s lyrical drama labours resolutely against aggression. And yet, the
                        poem’s <foreign>jouissance </foreign>of unrestrained feeling works by a
                        shattering or “scattering” that refuses to let subjects settle—refuses
                        subjects altogether except as they are conscripted into being by the event
                        of feeling itself. The truth of this event disrupts things as they are, but
                        means always tarrying with Jupiterian desire to know this meaning’s—this
                        feeling’s—truth.</p>
