                <p rend="noCount"> This essay argues that recent criticism in affect theory
                    emphasizing the “strictly biological portion of emotion” offers a new
                    interpretive window into a much-neglected Gothic novel by an important though
                    still relatively unknown writer. Its major claim is that <title level="m"
                        >Secresy</title>’s emphasis on bodiliness, the extent to which characters
                    share and absorb the same affective environment, undercuts important critical
                    accounts of the novel—by Terry Castle, Patricia Cove, Julia Wright, and
                    others—which claim that each of its characters occupies his or her own
                    inalienable rhetorical or “generic” world to which the other characters have
                    little or no access. </p>

                <p>In the final volume of Eliza Fenwick’s 1795 novel <title level="m">Secresy; or,
                        The Ruin on the Rock</title>, Clement Montgomery, a ne’er-do-well dandy who
                    has left his lover Sibella Valmont in the lurch, offers one morning to sell a
                    miniature portrait of her (whose original he painted) to one of her richer, more
                    genteel suitors, the Lord Filmar. Filmar “positively refuse[s] to accept” the
                    gift, thanks to a “double dose of prudence” on his part. (At this point in the
                    novel, Filmar has recently broken into Valmont Castle in a botched attempt to
                    kidnap Sibella, an heiress expecting £6,000 a year. To keep the miniature on his
                    person would therefore be to possess incriminating evidence.) Yet the lord
                    recounts that, even as he “positively refuse[s]” it, his “fingers had a kind of
                    tremulous impulse towards the picture” (Fenwick 299). By <emph>impulse
                    </emph>Filmar means a “[s]udden or involuntary inclination or tendency to act,
                    without premeditation or reflection” (“impulse”). In itself his comment is
                    probably unremarkable: Filmar simply notices his lordly fingers trembling toward
                    the portrait of a woman he knows little about save that she has a fortune and he
                    wants it. But considered in the context of the entire novel, this tiny incident
                    gains special significance. </p>
                <p>Characters in <title level="m">Secresy </title>tend to be affected
                    non-cognitively by intensities emanating from nearby objects and bodies.
                    Caroline Ashburn, for instance, denied entrance to Valmont Castle, secures the
                    permission of its proprietor, the honorable George Valmont, to correspond with
                    his niece Sibella whom Valmont keeps secluded within his estate. Caroline
                    rightly predicts, albeit ironically, that “the spirit of . . . affection
                    breathed” into her letters will ultimately “waft down” the “drawbridges” of the
                    castle and “disenchant . . . [Sibella] from the all-powerful spell” of her
                    uncle’s “authority” (Fenwick 39). Lord Filmar declares that a “square piece of
                    paper” on which he has written, “in large characters £6000 <foreign>per
                        annum</foreign>, placed . . . exactly opposite” him, will act as “a charm of
                    infinite value” to goad him into his kidnapping scheme (216). In one of her
                    letters to Caroline, Sibella insists that if the truant Clement would write her
                    a note with “only three words, ‘<emph>Bless my Sibella</emph>;’ . . . [she] will
                    wear it next . . . [to her] heart—a charm to hold disease and foreboding at
                    defiance” (256–57). These apparently trivial statements about “charming”
                    letters, notes, and pictures form part of a larger pattern in the novel whereby
                    the sensibilities of characters are directed (or described as if they are
                    directed) by the intensities enfolded in and emanating from material bodies and
                    objects. The physical signs of feeling—tears, sighs, faintness—and hence the
                    psychological states they presumably indicate are effectively “caught” from
                    physical phenomena in shared spaces. The men and women in <title level="m"
                        >Secresy</title> are thus little more than bodies adrift in an atmosphere
                    full of viral affect. It is, of course, nothing new to say that a novel
                    published in the 1790s denies its characters the full privileges of the
                    autonomous Enlightenment subject. But <title level="m">Secresy
                    </title>dramatizes the impersonality of emotion in ways and to extents arguably
                    unparalleled among novels of its time. One could say that it is a text
                    tailor-made for the application of affect theory. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Secresy </title>is a relatively slim, three-volume epistolary
                    novel with a somewhat convoluted plot. The tyrannical gentleman George Valmont
                    is scorned by a lady at an early age and grows to resent the prerogatives of
                    high society. He raises his niece Sibella as his daughter and his illegitimate
                    son Clement as the adopted son of poor laborers. Valmont secludes the two on his
                    estate for nearly all their lives, insists that they think of one another as
                    brother and sister, sees to their education, and exacts unflinching obedience
                    from both. All the while, his real intention is to unite them in marriage.
                    Sibella possesses an independent fortune and is the rightful heir to Valmont
                    estate (though her uncle leads her to believe she is penniless). Valmont keeps
                    her docile and tractable so that she will stay at home and fall in love with
                    Clement, his natural son, thus securing for Clement both the estate and the
                    independent fortune of its heiress—a veritable “economic powerhouse” (Cannon
                    543). Unfortunately for Valmont, all goes awry. Sibella and Clement fall in love
                    prematurely and consummate their relationship in secret, out of wedlock (after
                    which point Sibella fondly considers Clement her “husband”). Valmont, ignorant
                    of the consummation, sends his nineteen-year-old son Clement out into the world
                    as a kind of test to ensure that he is sufficiently misanthropic. But Clement
                    becomes a dissipated rake, enamored with the very high society that Valmont
                    intended he should hold in contempt. Angered, Valmont gives Clement £500 and
                    tells him to earn his living in London. Since Clement has developed an aversion
                    to work and a love of gambling, he squanders the money and ends up marrying
                    Caroline Ashburn’s wealthy, materialistic, and pretentious mother (disregarding
                    his unofficial “marriage” to Sibella). Meanwhile, after Valmont rejects the
                    proposed aristocratic marriage of his niece to Lord Filmar, the latter decides
                    to kidnap Sibella “whether her uncle pleases or not” (Fenwick 183). His first
                    kidnapping attempt is thwarted by the presence of Arthur Murden, a gentleman
                    sneaking about the castle disguised as a hermit. Murden, professedly in love
                    with Sibella for reasons other than her money, manages to rescue her from
                    Valmont castle only to lose her to Filmar at a nearby inn. Having absconded with
                    the rescued heiress, Filmar soon realizes that she is pregnant with Clement’s
                    child and therefore wants nothing to do with her. He returns her to her friend
                    Caroline. Murden eventually dies in Sibella’s arms. Sibella gives birth to a
                    stillborn child and dies herself shortly thereafter. </p>
                <p>Though having gone through four editions and received generally favorable reviews
                    in its time, the novel was more or less relegated to the shadows of literary
                    history until it became a Broadview Press book in 1994 edited by Isobel Grundy.
                    Since then a wide range of articles and book chapters have been devoted to it,
                    though the novel remains understudied and relatively unknown. Critics have
                    studied <title level="m">Secresy </title>as a gothic, Jacobin, and/or radically
                    feminist novel concerned variously with female education, motherhood and
                    childbirth, marriage laws, British India, female desire and sexuality, madness,
                    and contemporary medicine.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Bunnell; Mandell; Snow;
                        Chatterjee; Close; Fisk; Bundock; Burke; Ledoux; and Golightly.</note> I am
                    primarily interested in a strain of criticism that views its characters as
                    rhetorically or psychologically hyper-compartmentalized. Julia Wright has
                    claimed that each major character in the novel is locked in her own fictional
                    genre and given an inflexible “perspective . . . coded as literary” (Wright
                    154). Caroline Ashburn, for instance, speaks in the general rhetorical mode of
                    didactic fiction. She “cannot understand” the intense passions of someone like
                    Arthur Murden (who is the quintessential man of feeling), and so she claims that
                    he is excessively “romantic” in the Johnsonian senses of “wild,” “false,”
                    “fanciful” (Wright 153; Johnson 440). According to Wright, “no one voice” in the
                    text “stands above the rest, secure from critique, contradiction, or generic
                    classification” (154). The “various genres” in <title level="m">Secresy</title>
                    “do not mingle, but collide to mark separations in cultural perspectives” (153).
                    Patricia Cove likewise claims that the sensibilities of main characters are
                    discrete and incapable of inter-assimilation. Murden is “Fenwick’s victim of
                    excessive sensibility” and the “object of Caroline’s rational critique of
                    sensibility” (Cove 667). Each character “adhere[s] to opposite value systems”
                    that cannot interpenetrate (678). For Terry Castle, none of this should surprise
                    us: early female fiction was full of examples of “psychic compartmentalization,”
                    the “splitting up of emotional possibilities into different characters,” a sort
                    of “schizoid reductionism” (Castle 140). Thus Wright, Cove, and Castle all agree
                    that characters in <title level="m">Secresy</title> are more or less

                    rhetorical worlds. </p>
                <p>I want to suggest that this line of thinking, though reasonable, ignores the
                    novel’s emphasis on bodiliness and how its characters share and absorb the same
                    affective environment—despite what some critics have called the characters’
                    impermeable “generic” differences. The men and women represented in <title
                        level="m">Secrecy</title> are bodies that share spaces with other bodies and
                    act as if according to the causal properties circulating in those spaces. These
                    causal properties move in and out of mental and physical domains. Jonathan
                    Kramnick has observed that eighteenth-century philosophers and literary writers
                    were preoccupied with the possibility that material objects could cause human
                    actions just as much as mental phenomena (like intentions) could. Perhaps
                    “mental states . . . ultimately make their way to the social and physical
                    environment” (6) until that environment absorbs the causal properties of the
                    mental states—until, in other words, “material entities” acquire “some sort of
                    consciousness,” enabling them to have an equal role in determining human
                    behavior (10). Not that the causal properties of objects need to come strictly
                    or directly from human minds and vice versa. Both objects and minds are subject
                    to a shared environment. As Kevis Goodman has more recently argued, late
                    eighteenth-century Scottish medical writing suggested that the “custom, memory,
                    imagination, and discourse” of a given culture clung to bodies within that
                    culture—became “archived” in them (352)—so that bodies “became . . . historical
                    event[s],” “malleable site[s] structured by past and present history” (353). To
                    read <title level="m">Secresy</title> in light of these ideas is to emphasize
                    the extent to which the centered subject was presumed dead long before
                    poststructuralist theory insisted that it was dead.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Rei Terada
                        has implied that the death of the subject was only fully realizable through
                        the discursive efforts of Derrida and de Man. See her <title level="m"
                            >Feeling in Theory</title>.</note> It is to see how the novel inherited
                    and inflected certain ideologies operative in the eighteenth century that ran
                    against that century’s more familiar emphasis on “inwardness or subjectivity”
                    (Kramnick 2). </p>
                <p> Most of us are familiar with what is now called the “affective turn” in literary
                    studies. In their 2014 collection of essays, <title level="m">Romanticism and
                        the Emotions</title>, Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha observe that “a renewed
                    interest in the emotions is transforming how we view history, culture, and
                    science” (1). Though affect is closely related to emotion, the two are not one
                    and the same. Affect refers to the “vital” or “visceral forces beneath,
                    alongside, or generally <emph>other than </emph>conscious knowing” that “drive
                    us toward movement . . . thought and extension.” These forces operate at the
                    level of “miniscule or molecular events,” traveling “into and out of the
                    inorganic and non-living, the intracellular divulgences of sinew, tissue, and
                    gut economies, and the vaporous evanescences of the incorporeal (events,
                    atmospheres, feeling-tones)” (Gregg and Seigworth 1–2). Brian Massumi has
                    popularized the term “intensities” within affect studies to refer to forces that
                    are “irreducibly bodily and autonomic,” “asocial,” the stuff of “incipient
                    action and expression” existing in the “superlinear, super-abstract realm of
                    potential” (28, 20, 31). That is, affect is altogether beyond “linear” accounts
                    of mental processes—accounts resembling narratives and relying on notions of
                    cause and effect—as well as beyond the “abstract” emotional states we claim to
                    experience as a result of what is consciously happening around us: for Massumi,
                    when we “register” an emotional “state” we are really “re-register[ing] an
                    already felt state” that is purely bodily and non-conscious (25). Emotions are
                    second-order affect. </p>
                <p>A general consensus among scholars of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    literature and culture is that although “[t]he romantic period and the era that
                    precedes it often appear to us as eras in which people increasingly learned to
                    claim their emotions as the guarantors of their individuality,” these periods
                    simultaneously “characterize[d] feelings as transpersonal,” as “wander[ing]
                    extravagantly from one person to another” like “viruses” (Pinch 3, 1). All
                    supposedly private, indwelling emotions were often thought to originate, even at
                    the turn of the nineteenth century, in shared affective atmospheres, “unformed
                    and unstructured” “resonances independent of content or meaning” (Shouse par. 5,
                    par. 14). And it is precisely because these “resonances” have neither form nor
                    content that they can be transmitted between bodies and subsequently interpreted
                    as the meaningful psychological states we recognize as personal feelings. Hence,
                    I cannot feel precisely what it is you feel—the mental content of your feeling.
                    But both my body and yours interact dynamically within the same affective field,
                    within what Thomas Pfau has called “mood,” which he defines as the “horizon
                    wherein all conscious practice . . . is being transacted, a horizon that
                    therefore can never come into view as such.” This horizon or mood “operate[s] at
                    a level logically anterior to the business of discrete reference,
                    object-representation, and analytic, discrete knowledge” (Pfau 10, 12). In a
                    word, affect comprises the infinitesimal and infinite points of contact between
                    organic and inorganic entities within a shared environment. The work of Pinch
                    and Pfau tends more toward the literary and the historical, whereas critics of
                    the Massumi and Tomkins schools have emphasized the scientific and the
                    theoretical sides of affect—what Donald L. Nathanson has called “the strictly
                    biological portion of emotion”—in such a way as to develop the older, more
                    literary-historical scholarship. One of the main contentions of this essay is
                    that <title level="m">Secresy </title>illuminates the more recent,
                    physiological-theoretical work in affect theory as much as that work illuminates
                    how characters interact in the novel. </p>
                <p><title level="m">Secresy </title>positions its characters as semi-autonomous
                    bodies that catch, enfold, and circulate affective intensities in shared social
                    spaces. This process is repeatedly described in terms of contagion. Clement, for
                    instance, is mortified when Sibella learns—without his actually having told
                    her—that he must earn his bread in London: “she sees misery in my looks. She
                    hears it in my sighs, and the contagion has reached her” (Fenwick 126). Caroline
                    suspects, as it happens, that Sibella should worry less about Clement’s miseries
                    than about the temptations he will face in London, “amidst allurements such as
                    virtue had seldom rejected, had seldom turned from without contamination” (60).
                    Usually viewing all other characters from a conspicuous moral high ground,
                    Caroline also fears that young English girls like the Davenport sisters are too
                    easily “infected” with patriarchal “maxim[s],” such as that female “weakness and
                    defect” are primarily responsible for sexual incontinence (165). The ever
                    class-conscious George Valmont is afraid to leave his estate lest he expose his
                    “high-born” body to the “contaminating mixture” of the middle classes (62).
                    News, vice, maxims, class: all such abstractions in <title level="m"
                        >Secresy</title> are described in terms of communicable diseases.</p>
                <p>The presence of affect in <title level="m">Secresy</title> becomes clearer as it
                    continues to dramatize “the way the sensual world greets the sensate body,” the
                    “affective forces … generated in such meetings” (Highmore 121). At one point in
                    the novel, Caroline, Murden, and a company of aristocrats decide to take a
                        “<emph>rural </emph>expedition” to a spot where they can fish, eat ices, and
                    listen to costly music (Fenwick 82). Caroline and Murden are riding along a
                    rural road when <quote>a pretty country girl on a horse loaded with paniers drew
                        up to the hedge-side, while the cavalcade passed her. I was in Mr. Murden’s
                        phaeton; and we were the last carriage but one. The girl, in making her
                        awkward obeisance to the company, no sooner lifted her eyes to Mr. Murden,
                        than she blushed deeper than scarlet. It was a blush of such deep shame, of
                        such anguish, that I felt a sudden pain like a shock of electricity.
                        (83–84)</quote> Murden is shocked too, although he has more reason to be
                    than Caroline, since he actually knows the girl and turns out, as we discover
                    later in the novel, to be her protector. Caroline, for her part, is simply
                    struck with a “sudden pain like a shock of electricity” for no demonstrable
                    reason. On another occasion the young Henry Davenport, penniless but “related to
                    several noble families,” pledges to marry Caroline’s mother, Mrs. Ashburn, in a
                    misguided effort to provide for his impoverished, ostracized, consumptive
                    childhood sweetheart Arabella and their illegitimate infant (143). Caroline
                    requests one hour of conversation with Henry in order to talk him out of his
                    foolish decision. She eventually settles the business by providing Davenport
                    with a yearly income (until he can earn enough on his own) and an opportunity to
                    study medicine, thanks to the kindness and connections of the well-to-do Murden.
                    But at their first meeting, an “unusual softness” in Davenport’s voice, the
                    “hectic colour” of his cheek and his melodramatic bodily attitude insinuate
                    their way into Caroline’s otherwise unforgiving view of maudlin behavior:
                        <quote>He rose; and walked towards the widow. “Love is a romance; a cant; a
                        whine; a delirium; a poison; a rankling wound that festers here, here!” he
                        layed [sic] his hand on his heart, and leaned against the wainscot. . . . I
                        sighed too: for the under tone of voice in which he pronounced the last few
                        words was in[de]scribably affecting. (143–45)</quote> Not his embittered
                    sentiments about love, but the “under tone of voice in which he pronounce[s]”
                    them is “in[de]scribably affecting” to Caroline, so that she has no choice but
                    to “sig[h] too.” Thus even a woman who spends most of the novel morally
                    critiquing the passions of others can be electrocuted by a blush, or induced to
                    mirror one sigh with another. Caroline seems more affected in this case by the
                    soft voice, flushed cheek, and leaning, melancholy body of Davenport than by the
                    actual story of his misfortune that he subsequently relates. Her body enfolds
                    affective intensities into itself in and through an environment shared with
                    Clement. Something similar, though perhaps a bit stranger, happens between
                    Sibella and her uncle Valmont. On one cold, windy day Sibella is alone in the
                    woods near Valmont Castle, when a <quote>chill, oppressive gripe seemed to
                        fasten on my heart.—My uncle happened to pass in from the park.—He spoke,
                        but I could not reply. I waved my hand, which he took in his; but, while he
                        pressed it, he reproved me in an ungentle manner, for sitting on the damp
                        stone, and exposed to the raw air.—Tears <emph>unbidden and almost
                            unexcited</emph>, roll down my cheeks. He called Andrew; and I was borne
                        in, and laid on a sopha in the breakfast parlour. (250–51, emphasis
                        mine)</quote> I find it interesting that Sibella’s description of the
                    “chill, oppressive gripe” upon her “heart” precedes her description of Valmont’s
                    entrance: effect precedes cause. Were the sentences reversed, or were the dash
                    replaced with a colon, the statements might make more logical sense. But the
                    body here seems to have anticipated or “intuited” the object of fear before the
                    mind knew what was happening. I suppose one could argue that Sibella’s letter is
                    just creating suspense: i.e., “Fear no sooner gripped my heart than—behold!—my
                    uncle entered the scene.” But the dash between the sentences enables us to read
                    the physiological response to Valmont’s presence as instantaneous, instinctual,
                    irrelevant to whether or not Sibella actually sees or hears her uncle
                    approaching. More striking, however, is the fact that as Sibella writes the
                    above passage in a letter to Caroline, her tears begin to flow “unbidden and
                    almost unexcited.” Grundy interprets the word “unexcited” to mean “[u]nprovoked”
                    (250). The <title level="m">OED </title>defines “unexcited” similarly as “[n]ot
                    mentally stirred or moved” (“unexcited”). In this case, one could say that
                    Sibella is calmly writing in her room and cries when she remembers the touch of
                    her uncle’s hand, his “ungentle” reproof, his removal of her from her beloved
                    wood into the gloomy breakfast parlor. And yet she describes her tears as
                    “unbidden and almost unexcited.” They surface in the present moment, as she is
                    writing her letter, but seem alienated from the memory presumed to evoke them.
                    Their origin is strangely displaced or obscured. This is not to say that there
                    are no alternative, sensible explanations for her reported weeping: Clement is
                    gone at this point and Sibella is pregnant and forced to keep the secret from
                    her tyrannical uncle. But she describes her tears less as the signifiers of an
                    internal signified (a definable feeling with a clear “origin” or stimulus) and
                    more as the product of unknown, mysterious forces. </p>
                <p>Perhaps the presence and operation of affect in <title level="m">Secresy</title>
                    is most pronounced, palpable, and manifest in spaces shared by three members of
                    a central love-triangle: Caroline, Sibella, and Murden. Early in volume one, a
                    frantic Bengali mother sells everything she owns and travels to London to be
                    reunited with her son, who used to work for the nabob Sir Thomas Marlowe (a
                    friend of Mrs. Ashburn and, it follows, her daughter Caroline). Unfortunately,
                    the mother arrives in London only to learn that her son is absent. Upon hearing
                    the news, she “falls ill of an ague and fever,” “languish[ing] in the extreme of
                    misery and disease” for eight weeks. She then visits the country seat of Sir
                    Thomas at Barlowe Hall, where he, Caroline, and all their mutual friends are
                    present. Her emotions are so “wild and extravagant” when she arrives that
                    Caroline “wonder[s] that her intellects survived.” The other guests at Barlowe
                    Hall “expres[s] their disgust at so miserable an object” (Fenwick 85). The
                    Indian woman “wrought a passionate flood of tears,” “wrung her hands, gnashed
                    her teeth,” and “tore her hair” (86). Caroline compares her both to a corpse and
                    an infant. Sir Thomas “saw himself in the utmost danger, and half his family
                    dead or dying of the mortal disease” (which he seems to suspect is malaria)
                    (87). Arthur Murden, who is Sir Thomas’s nephew, is the only gentleman willing
                    to offer the woman any assistance. He accompanies her chaise in the rain to the
                    next village and sees her to bed. Murden returns to Barlowe Hall “pale with
                    fatigue, and want of food; his linen soiled; and his hair disordered” (88). Sir
                    Thomas suspects that the Indian woman has infected him with something. Caroline
                    notes that “[a]s Murden shut one door”—retiring from the drawing room—“a servant
                    opened another,” bearing a letter to her from Sibella (89). The letter, as it
                    turns out, places Murden in another infectious position. It excites such a
                    “pleasurable glow of feeling,” such “visible pleasure” in Caroline that she is
                    obliged to read it aloud that evening to her audience—which once again includes
                    Murden—and to describe the person of Sibella in anatomical detail (90, 91).
                    Murden freezes as she reads. He refuses to eat, which makes Sir Thomas suspect
                    that “nothing but <emph>the fever</emph>” has seized him (96). That evening
                    Murden whispers to Caroline: “My mind is my disease.” Caroline, in turn,
                    observes that “<emph>his mind was </emph>also <emph>my disease</emph>” (96). </p>
                <p>What I find interesting is that by this point the novel has effectively blurred
                    the distinction between physical and mental infection. The Bengali woman is
                    thought to have infected Murden with malaria or hysteria or both. This happens
                    just as Murden is introduced to the character of Sibella, whose letter to

                    he passes his disorder on to Caroline. What does she mean when she claims that
                        “<emph>his mind was </emph>also <emph>my disease</emph>?” Is she is struck
                    with some fatal curiosity about Murden thanks to his charming, good-natured
                    madness? Is it a case of love at first sight? It does turn out—much, I would
                    say, to the surprise of most readers of this novel—that Caroline develops strong
                    feelings for him. One is tempted to conclude, the more one learns about the
                    universe of <title level="m">Secresy</title>, that she “catches” the stuff of
                    these feelings at this precise point; that her desire for Murden is no more than
                    a form or reflex of his own desire for Sibella: the affective intensities having
                    been encountered, enfolded, and subsequently privatized.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The

                        “contemporary social commentators . . . identify clandestine marriage as a

                        end” when “Sibella and her infant are sacrificed to the dictates of the
                        dominant social order that might be able to accommodate the sexual woman but
                        has no space for the diseased mother” (561).</note>

                    observes that Fenwick uses “three different lengths of dash: short, to replace
                    or reinforce a period . . . medium, to indicate material absent from the text .
                    . . and very long for the inarticulacy of intense emotion” (Grundy 36). Sibella,
                    who at various points in the novel is called “unformed,” “half insane,” “queer,”
                    “deranged” and a “lovely lunatic,” admits that she is subject to “emotions . . .
                    which [she] cannot describe or explain” (Fenwick 55, 92, 207, 229, 175). Her
                    first letter to Caroline—the one that enthralled Murden—is filled with Grundy’s
                    “very long” dashes, signifying a “heart expand[ing] with swelling emotion” (41).
                    It is telling that the recorded speech of Murden never includes a long dash
                    until he encounters Sibella for the first time in the wood near Valmont Castle.
                    After that his prose is full of them. Sibella writes to Caroline of the
                    encounter that <quote>

                    this bizarre meeting is over Murden grows more and more inarticulate and
                    enigmatic. Both the letters that he himself writes and the letters that others
                    write about him punctuate his speech with long dashes. In one of his subsequent
                    letters to Caroline, for instance, he replaces the unutterable name of Sibella
                    with a long dash: “neither prudence, honour, friendship, nor aught else could
                    stay me in my course—not even the heavenly ——.”</p>
                <p>Murden does not run into Sibella accidentally on her uncle’s property. He had
                    already formed and executed a plan to cloister himself within the ruins of an
                    old monastery near Valmont Castle so as to be close to Sibella during her
                    nocturnal walks. He surprises her twice in the guise of a hermit and then
                    communicates with her as a celestial spirit, all the while exacerbating his
                    “disease.” It reaches its height at the end of volume one, when Murden discovers
                    that Sibella has consummated her relationship with Clement. When Sir Thomas
                    arranges a “numerous and brilliant party” in the Assembly Rooms at Bath, all the
                    alarmed guests witness Murden “rush[ing]” into the ballroom “distorted with some
                    species of passion, his hair deranged, and the powder showered on his dress as
                    if he had been dashing his head against some hard substance in a paroxysm of
                    rage.” He groans, curses, flushes, and pales by turns, “gnash[es] his teeth,”
                    “snatch[es] a crumpled letter from his pocket” only to “tea[r] it into a
                    thousand pieces” and “das[h] the fragments on the floor,” stares at everyone
                    “malignant[ly], “carefully gather[s] up every fragment” of paper and then
                    “dart[s] out of the room.” Sir Thomas presumes he is “mad” and “infect[ed]”
                    (151–52). The symptoms of his emotional breakdown—down to the very gnashing of
                    teeth—mirror those of the Bengali woman who fell into extravagant fits upon her
                    arrival in London. Caroline is the person who reports this wild incident in the
                    second letter of the second volume of the novel. It turns out that the “crumpled
                    letter” that Murden dramatically tears to pieces is a “billet” written by
                    Sibella to Clement, which Clement enclosed in his own letter to Murden at the
                    end of volume one. In that “billet” Sibella invites Clement to her apartment,
                    where with “pure hearts and hands, we will plight our fervent unspotted faith.
                    Say I am your’s [sic], and you are mine, and sorrow and jealousy will vanish as
                    a mist. You shall go the transported confiding husband” (131). Murden seems to
                    realize in the ballroom at Bath that he has spent more time “stalk[ing],”
                    “prying,” and “watching” Sibella than actually courting her in any remotely
                    appropriate fashion. He has spent his time prowling about the ruins in Valmont
                    estate and accosting Sibella in outlandish disguises. Perhaps he was foolishly
                    convinced, as he writes in one of his now dash-heavy letters to Caroline, that
                    Sibella was preserving herself as the “reward of a deserving ventrous [sic] hero
                    like myself——Oh! I have embraced a cloud, and the tormenting wheel rolls round
                    with a rapid motion!” (133).</p>
                <p>Both Murden and Sibella are gradually destroyed by a toxic interexchange of
                    affect. From the point of his first meeting with the “lunatic” Sibella, Murden
                    himself becomes “lunatic-like” (229, 160). He calls himself Sibella’s “shadow,”
                    who “sigh[s] to her sigh” (269). Eventually her body wastes away as she broods
                    on the unfaithfulness of her ex-lover Clement, and the body of Murden follows
                    suit. In fact, the more physical contact the two have, the more they seem to
                    become somatic equals. When Murden and his friend Richardson steal into
                    Sibella’s private chamber in Valmont Castle in order to rescue her, Murden can
                    barely stand: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">She opened the door. She came out to us. – “Ah! what, what

                            falling. . . . I recoiled <emph>from her</emph> . . . and, as I leaned
                            on Richardson’s shoulder, I closed my dim eyes, and wished they might

                        <p rend="noCount">“Shame!” whispered Richardson, “you are unmanned!”</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">And so I am, Miss Ashburn. . . . I feel a rankling glow of

                            [that] I cannot look up and behold her. (322)</p></quote> After her
                    rescuers arrive, Sibella expresses her gratitude and her continued unrequited
                    affection for Clement. At this point, the merger of her own body with Murden’s
                    seems to crystalize: “[a]s she spoke,” Murden writes, “I turned my eyes from her
                    now haggard and jaundiced face to my own, reflected in the mirror by which I was
                    standing. ‘Moving corpses!’ said I to myself—‘Why encumber ye the fair earth?’”
                    (322). In the next few paragraphs, Murden scores his own and Sibella’s speech
                    with long dashes. </p>
                <p>The act of sympathetic exchange in <title level="m">Secresy </title>is indeed
                    more of a death sentence than an opportunity for benevolent action,
                    than—according to an eighteenth-century ideal—a means to “transform social
                    distance into union, social difference into identity” (McGowen 314). As the
                    novel winds to a close, Murden and Sibella find themselves on the verge of
                    madness and death in a small country inn. Each is lodged in separate quarters
                    for reasons of safety. The landlord—reluctant though desperate—suggests that
                    Sibella finally be allowed to see Murden in the hopes that his “pity-moving
                    countenance” may possibly “affect her” and “call forth a sympathy which must
                    produce tears” (Fenwick 353). (Sibella has not cried for a long time; Grundy
                    notes that “<emph>[n]ot </emph>to weep in intense sorrow was held to have
                    damaging physical effects” [Grundy 353]). Slowly, cautiously, Murden is ushered
                    into her room. As he “gaze[s] intently on Sibella, his countenance under[goes] a
                    striking alteration.” He either faints or falls asleep at her knees, and his
                    hand falls upon the bed. Sibella places his hand in hers and finds that “[s]he
                    could not . . . separate his sufferings from her own.” She “continued to hold
                    his hand” until “her emotions were kindling into agony.” After two “loud and
                    dreadful groan[s]” she exclaims: “‘Give me not a name . . . . I own none! What
                    am I? a shadow! A dream! . . . Oh! Your touch is ice!’ . . . you have chilled my
                    blood!’” Murden explains to Sibella that his body is cold because “[he] too [is]
                    but a shadow.” He sinks in her arms and “never . . . rise[s] again.” Sibella
                    dies shortly afterward and both are entombed together (355–56). There is indeed
                    something wildly odd and arresting about the role that the
                        <emph>hand-holding</emph> plays in Sibella’s Murden-killing paroxysm of
                    existential despair. The harder and longer she grips his soon-to-be-lifeless
                    hand, the more her feelings seem to accumulate inside of her—until she cries
                    aloud in what becomes both her own and Murden’s swan song. </p>
                <p>As far back as 1978, René Girard observed that “the dearest of all our illusions”
                    is the “intimate conviction that our desires are really our own, that they are
                    truly original and spontaneous.” For Girard, desire is not original but
                    imitative—not to mention “eminently contagious.” One “‘catches’ a nearby desire
                    just as one would catch the plague or cholera, simply by contact with the
                    infected person” (Girard ix, 96, 99). One of the strangest plot twists in <title
                        level="m">Secresy </title>is that the hyper-sensible Caroline falls in love
                    with the absurdly sentimental Murden. This is a man who Caroline claims has
                    “refined upon romance; who can give . . . as much enthusiasm to the affections,
                    and carve misery for himself as ingeniously, as though he had passed his days
                    under the safeguard of Mr. Valmont’s walls and drawbridges” (Fenwick 188). The
                    irony here is that Murden <emph>has</emph>, in fact, passed his days hiding on
                    the Valmont estate: dressing up in various costumes to woo Sibella through
                    enigmatic hints and notes. He first appears in the wood as an old hermit, the
                    “tall figure of a venerable man, with a white and flowing beard,” “wrapped in a
                    sort of loose gown” and wearing a “broad hat” (101). He identifies himself as
                    the ghost of an old inhabitant of the ruined monastery who can “‘renovate old
                    age’” (a power he demonstrates by removing his beard, hat and mantle to reveal
                    “a young man of graceful form”) (102). Sibella stumbles upon Murden a second
                    time loitering in the armory of Valmont Castle, to which he has gained access
                    via an underground passage that connects the monastery outside to the armory
                    within the castle. This time (still disguised as a hermit) he appears
                    “disfigured by dust and cobwebs,” carrying a sword and speaking in “disjointed”
                    words “with a rapidity which made him almost unintelligible” (119). Eventually
                    Murden seems to realize that speaking to Sibella in the guise of a hermit will
                    get him nowhere. Some time after these false starts he folds several pieces of
                    paper into a ball, weighted with a pebble, and rolls it toward Sibella while she
                    is walking about in the wood. In one of the enfolded notes he identifies himself
                    as an angel or celestial spirit inhabiting a lower planetary sphere, charging
                    Sibella to “set [her] desires” on one of the papers he has provided (i.e., to
                    tell him if she is free to love him or if she loves someone else) and to leave
                    it on a nearby tomb (179). </p>
                <p>The fact that Caroline falls in love with someone like Murden is completely at
                    odds with her self-presentation throughout <title level="m">Secresy</title>. She
                    has professed to disdain all self-indulgent, blatantly irrational sentiment as
                    any good Wollstonecraftian would. Others have called her “pedantic, inflexible,
                    opinionated . . . severe, misjudging” (284). She accordingly refers to Murden as
                    “a being more variable, more inexplicable, than any being within [her]
                    knowledge,” a “baby” of “false delicacy,” “false refinement,” “ferment[ed] . . .
                    senses,” “fevered fancy,” “burning brain,” “artificial refinements,” and so on:
                    in short, he and Sibella, according to Caroline, are enthusiasts, romantic
                    “victims of erroneous educations” (143, 285–86). How then could she possibly
                    fall in love with him? One satisfying explanation is that her desires were never
                    really her own, but <emph>his</emph> (both, at any rate, the product of the same
                    affective “mood”). What Caroline claims to feel for Murden is a version of what
                        <emph>he</emph> claims to feel for Sibella. At one point she even adopts
                    Murden’s emotionalized language and extreme sensuality. In one of her letters to
                    Sibella, Caroline reveals that she knows who the mysterious “wood-wanderer” is.
                    She presents herself in the letter as a kind of hovering spectator in Valmont
                    wood, spying on the disguised Murden as he, in turn, has been spying on Sibella:
                        <quote> I see him gliding through the paths you had trodden. The tree which
                        screened him from your view cannot conceal him from mine. I see him listen
                        almost breathless to your prayer. The new-born colour on his cheek hangs
                        trembling . . . the throbbings of his agonized bosom collect themselves
                        while restrained . . .. I see him dart the ball forward to meet your feet;
                        and then he rushes into the thickest gloom to hide himself. . . . did
                        symmetry ever mould a statue in finer proportions than his form can boast?
                        His eye in its passive state is a clear grey, its shape long; and the finest

                        colour . . . retires as you perceive it, or suffuses the whole of his fine
                        countenance. (187–88)</quote> And so on. As Murden was once entranced by
                    what Caroline had spoken of the physical features of Sibella—her “face,” “form,”
                    “attitude,” “eyes,” “forehead,” “mouth,” unset and unpowered hair “parted from
                    the top of the head and always uncovered,” neck “one of the finest . . . that
                    ever belonged to a human figure”—now Caroline indulges in her own blazon of
                    Murden (92–93). The above passage may be somewhat ironically delivered, but it
                    may also be evidence of how material bodies in shared spaces circulate the raw
                    material of “private” feeling. Nor is this phenomenon exclusive to Caroline. One
                    critic notes that “[a]lthough Clement accuses Murden of having “absurd dreams of
                    romantic useless perfections” which hinder his appreciation of women, he himself
                    is guilty of idealizing Sibella’s “lovely face” and “enchanting unresisting
                    form” (Emsley 492). Sensual desire spreads everywhere in <title level="m"
                        >Secresy</title>, in spite of what characters say or think about it. </p>
                <p>The characters in Fenwick’s novel may therefore <emph>appear</emph> to live in
                    “polarized” emotional environments, as others have argued (Castle 140): the
                    sentimental-Burkean-chivalric Murden meets the cool Wollstonecraftian Caroline
                    and neither seems able to navigate outside of a generic emotional script. But to
                    me it is seems equally evident that these mental or rhetorical “types” have a
                    strongly corporeal presence in the novel, that the bodies to which they belong
                    interact dynamically in a physicalized space described repeatedly in metaphors
                    of contagion. Every character in <title level="m">Secresy </title>is entitled,
                    of course, to articulate her emotional state as she pleases. And every character
                    may presume, according to the Enlightenment view of sympathy advanced variously
                    by Locke, Hume, and Smith, that she can sympathize with other characters by
                    imaginatively participating in and possessing their feelings in a personal and
                    private capacity. But the novel makes it relatively clear that individual
                    feelings are more like what William Reddy calls <emph>emotives</emph>—culturally
                    codified descriptions rather than private, indwelling energies.<note

                        >Secresy </title>are the impersonal and inarticulable ones: “the affective
