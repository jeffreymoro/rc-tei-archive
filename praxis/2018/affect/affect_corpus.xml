               <head>Introduction: Romanticism and Affect Studies</head>
               <p>This volume presents new work by scholars working at the intersection of British
                    Romanticism and affect studies. The past two decades have seen a growing
                    interest in the use of affect theory, cognitive science, phenomenology, and
                    neuroscience to reconceptualize theories of feeling and emotion in British
                    Romantic writing. This “affective turn” has renewed emphasis on emotion, which
                    experienced relative marginalization in new historicist scholarship throughout
                    the 1980s and 90s. Once dismissed as ideologically suspect, emotion has been put
                    to increasingly sophisticated use by literary critics, often in relation to
                    affect’s effects on the body and its relationship to emotion, cognition, and
                    action. Much more than a passing trend, affect studies has transformed the study
                    of emotion for a generation of scholars.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One recent example
                        of affect studies’ far-reaching influence on a wide range of disciplines is
                        Palgrave’s massive <title level="m">Handbook on Affect Studies and Textual
                            Criticism</title>. See Wehrs and Blake, eds.</note>
               </p>
               <p>While much of the foundational work in affect studies tends toward the
                    theoretical and scientific, an influential group of Romanticists has shaped the
                    field in relation to literature, culture, and history. In particular, scholars
                    such as Joel Faflak, Mary Favret, Steven Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch,
                    Alan Richardson, and Richard Sha have applied affect theory and cognitive
                    science to the study of Romantic texts, revising our understanding of the
                    emotions in relation to thought and action.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Favret;
                        Goldsmith; Pfau; Pinch; Richardson; and Sha and Faflak, eds.</note> This
                    unique exchange between Romanticism and affect studies has produced a body of
                    important scholarship that fruitfully crosses disciplinary boundaries. The
                    essays in this volume both capitalize on and extend this scholarship in new and
                    exciting ways, demonstrating the broad application and theorization of “affect”
                    in Romantic-era studies. Each essay takes a different approach to affect and
                    emotion, from a piece on Joanna Baillie’s passion plays, co-written by a
                    literary scholar and a cognitive psychologist, to a piece by Mark Lussier that
                    utilizes affect theory and rhythmic studies in a reading of William Blake’s
                        <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title> (1793). This volume
                    does not propose a single definition of “affect” or “emotion,” but all of the
                    essays share the conviction that the kind of interdisciplinary work demanded by
                    affect studies is beneficial to both Romantic studies <emph>and </emph>affect
                    studies.</p>
               <p>While “affect studies” refers to a broad range of scholarship rather than a
                    unified movement with a shared theoretical or methodological perspective, affect
                    theory has taken two general trajectories relevant to British Romanticism. The
                    first reflects interest in the writings of American psychologist Silvan Tomkins,
                    who argued for nine “primary affects” rooted in biology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                        Tomkins.</note> Tomkins’s writings on emotion and affect from the 1960s have
                    inspired a range of studies on the physiological basis of affect, including work
                    by Eve Sedgwick and Patricia Clough, as well as research in affective
                        neuroscience.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Sedgwick; and Clough.</note> Scholars
                    in this group propound the Basic Emotions paradigm, which asserts that primary
                    affects operate on a different system than cognition. Primary
                        <emph>affects</emph> such as fear and joy are automatic responses to
                    external triggers, as opposed to <emph>emotions</emph> like love or hate, which
                    require memory, reflection, and awareness. </p>
               <p>This Basic Emotions paradigm presents perhaps the most contentious debate within
                    affect studies: cognitivist vs. anti-intentionalist arguments. Are we really in
                    control of our thoughts, actions, and responses to external stimuli? Or are we
                    pre-programmed, in a sense, feeling and responding <emph>before</emph> cognition
                    and volition? The Basic Emotions paradigm suggests the latter, and, in doing so,
                    brings up pressing questions about agency, ethics, and action. Theorists and
                    scientists continue research in these areas without consensus.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In general, there are four major theories of emotion in the cognitive
                        sciences that bear on affect theory in literary and cultural studies: (1)
                        James-Lang theory understands emotion as an interpretive result of autonomic
                        physiological response; (2) Cannon-Bard theory understands autonomic
                        response and emotion as occurring simultaneously; (3) Schachter and Singer’s
                        cognitive-arousal theory understands emotion as the result of both autonomic
                        response and cognitive attributions; and (4) Lazarus’ theory argues that
                        thought precedes emotion and physiological arousal. For a useful essay on
                        debates and findings within cognitive studies and neuroscience related to
                        affect and theories of emotion, see Hamann. For a recent neuroscientific
                        study that challenges the Basic Emotions paradigm, see Barrett.</note>
                    Meanwhile, scholars such as Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ruth Leys, and Richard Sha see
                    too much agreement among affect theorists. Why is it, Leys asks, that so many
                    affect theorists champion anti-intentionalism, while philosophers,
                    psychologists, and literary scholars gravitate toward a neglected cognitivism?
                    Barrett and Sha also worry about this anti-intentionalist strand, which
                    essentially argues for emotion and cognition as separate systems wherein
                    “concepts like the human, the subject, and agency” are left behind (Sha, “The
                    Turn to Affect” 260). Leys suggests that we need more social and cognitive
                    psychological research, and, significantly, that we also need to embrace
                    literary approaches to affect: one hesitation among affect theorists to abandon
                    the Basic Emotions paradigm is that “intentionalist interpretations of the
                    affects” require “thick descriptions of life experiences of the kind that are
                    familiar to anthropologists and novelists but are widely held to be inimical to
                    science” (Leys 471). This is the kind of affective-literary project taken up in
                    studies such as Joel Faflak and Richard Sha’s <title level="m">Romanticism and
                        the Emotions</title> (2014) and Lisa Ottum and Seth T. Reno’s <title level="m">Wordsworth and the Green Romantics: Affect and Ecology in the
                        Nineteenth Century</title> (2016). It is also the approach modeled by the
                    essays in this volume.</p>
               <p>A literary approach to the affects, then, is much needed, and it reflects a
                    second trajectory in affect theory: renewed interest in philosopher Baruch
                    Spinoza, a figure familiar to Romanticists. Spinoza’s influential <title level="m">Ethics</title> (1677) presented the affects as “confused ideas”
                    rooted in both mind and body, a concept that thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze,
                    Felix Guattari, and Brian Massumi have revisited and revised.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Deleuze and Guattari; and Massumi, <title level="m">Parables for the
                            Virtual</title>.</note> These “new affect theorists” tend toward the
                    philosophical and theoretical, though neuroscience also plays an important role
                    in their work. For example, in his seminal study <title level="m">Parables for
                        the Virtual</title> (2002), Massumi draws from both Spinoza and neuroscience
                    in his argument for the autonomy of affect. Several of the authors in this
                    volume take up Massumi’s ideas in diverse ways. </p>
               <p>Given Spinoza’s influence on Romantic-era writers and scientists, Massumi and the
                    new affect theorists have much to offer Romanticists. While scholars have long
                    studied Spinoza’s influence on the Romantics’ conceptions of nature, we have
                    only recently begun to examine his theories of affect and emotion. In <title level="m">Ethics</title>, Spinoza defines the affects as “affections of the
                    Body by which the Body’s power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or
                    restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections. . . . affects
                    are confused ideas of <title level="m">the Mind and Body at once</title>” (493,
                    501; italics original). This dual process of corporeal and cognitive response
                    inspired the work of the new affect theorists. Much of the <title level="m">Ethics</title> involves outlining and explaining the various kinds of
                    affects and their effects on us, and many contemporary scholars locate the basis
                    of contemporary affect theory in Spinoza’s ideas. Through readings of Spinoza,
                    these scholars have opened up new possibilities for understanding Romantic
                    figurations of affect and emotion. For example, echoing Spinoza, Eric Shouse
                    describes affect as “a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from
                    one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or
                    diminution in that body’s capacity to act.” Massumi similarly defines affect as
                    a non-conscious “intensity” that the mind later “qualifies” as emotion (<title level="m">Parables </title>28). An emotion is only “a very partial
                    expression of affect” that cannot “encompass all the depth and breadth” of our
                    experiences (Massumi, <title level="m">Politics</title> 5). For both scholars,
                    Spinoza’s theory of the affects is key, as it incorporates both cognition and
                    sensory stimulation. Many scholars thus distinguish affect from emotion:
                        <emph>affect</emph> is an innate biological response, or physiological
                    intensity, while <title level="m">emotion</title> involves awareness of affect
                    through memories, or narratives of accumulative experiences.</p>
               <p>For Shouse, Massumi, and others, Spinoza’s insights have great significance for
                    politics, especially when coupled with neuroscientific research. For instance,
                    Massumi argues that most political influence occurs at the level of
                    pre-linguistic and sub-personal affect, and not “ideology” as is commonly
                    assumed. Affect generates thoughts, feelings, and modes of knowing prior to
                    conscious awareness; we feel affect before we know it. According to Leys,
                    theorists in the Massumi camp believe that “political campaigns, advertising,
                    literature, visual images, and the mass media are all mechanisms for producing
                    such effects below the threshold of meaning and ideology” (451).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As Leys suggests, such a view extends to aesthetics as well:
                        if experience trumps content, the structures and intentional meanings of
                        artworks are of no consequence.</note> Affective intensities exceed
                    language, and thus transcend ideology. This kind of reading pushes Romantic
                    studies beyond the modes of ideology critique and hermeneutics of suspicion that
                    have dominated scholarship since the 1980s. However, other theorists have taken
                    a different approach to Spinoza and affect, treating “affect” as “neither a
                    solely biological phenomenon nor a solely ideological one” (Ottum and Reno 6).
                    Elsewhere, I have shown how affective neuroscience helps us to rethink
                    Wordsworth’s poetry, which is more scientific and ecological than many readers
                        acknowledge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Reno.</note> Such an understanding of
                    affect helps to reconceptualize concepts such as nature and imagination. But of
                    course, affect is also political. Philosopher and affect theorist Martha
                    Nussbaum argues that we need to revive an emphasis on affect and emotion into
                    politics: justice, she argues, necessitates the cultivation of love and
                        compassion.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Nussbaum.</note> In many ways, this is a
                    return to Romantic-era poetry and politics, but the ground in shifting: rather
                    than ideology critique as the dominant methodology, affect studies offers a more
                    complex picture of the interacting forces of bodies, feelings, emotions,
                    language, and ideas that constitute cognition and subjectivity.</p>
               <p>The amorphous nature of affect, as well as affect studies’ still-evolving
                    trajectory, is precisely what makes it so ripe for exploration by scholars of
                    British Romanticism. Indeed, as the essays in this volume show, the study of
                    affect was incipient in the nineteenth century: following their
                    eighteenth-century forbearers, the Romantics were deeply interested in matters
                    such as the transmission and mediation of “sympathy.” In the first essay,
                    Soledad Caballero and Aimee Knupsky highlight connections between Joanna
                    Baillie’s “sympathetic curiosity” and recent work in cognitive psychology on
                    “emotion regulation.” These connections open up new readings of Baillie’s theory
                    of drama, as well as the particular work of <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
                    (1798), and they also inspire more scientific-affective research. This is the
                    kind of interdisciplinary work called for by affect studies: Caballero and
                    Knupsky use scientific research to study a literary text <emph>and</emph> use a
                    literary text to direct new scientific research. As they point out, Baillie’s
                    “Introductory Discourse” was influential and groundbreaking not only for its
                    contributions to dramatic theory but also for her use of Romantic-era science,
                    and so a cognitive approach to her work makes perfect sense. By highlighting the
                    relationship between De Monfort and Jane in the play, Caballero and Knupsky
                    re-envision investigations into social emotion regulation (SER) models.
                    Specifically, they explore moments in the play “that highlight both the
                    functioning and dysfunctioning of SER with an eye towards identifying those
                    areas that are not currently modeled within constrained empirical
                    investigations.” In their application and analysis of SER to <title level="m">De
                        Monfort</title>, with a particular emphasis on hatred, they show how affect
                    is both biological and cultural, a process that operates within, as well as
                    among, individual feeling subjects. Cognitive psychology suggests that affective
                    and cognitive processes occur simultaneously in an intricate and sophisticated
                    manner, which both challenges the conclusions of Massumi and pushes beyond the
                    Basic Emotions paradigm.</p>
               <p>In the second essay, Renee Harris also draws from the cognitive humanities in a
                    rereading of John Keats’s <title level="m">Isabella</title> (1818). While
                    scholars have traditionally read the poem’s digressions as evidence of Keats’s
                    youthful and immature poetic style, Harris argues that this critique doesn’t
                    hold up when we consider the digressions in light of nineteenth-century reading
                    practices: though the kinds of “passive” or “immersive” reading that Keats
                    practices were disparaged by Wordsworth and other high arbiters of literary
                    taste, a counter-tradition reveals the cultural work of such reading, which
                    modern cognitive psychology helps to illuminate. Keats breaks down the
                    structural norms of the text and calls attention to the reading experience
                    itself. In doing so, he “unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that allow
                    for absorption in the narrative,” fostering psychic development and intellectual
                    growth in the reader. Harris links this practice to Keats’s concept of the
                    “material sublime,” which he adopts and adapts from Coleridge. In poems like
                    “Kubla Khan” (1797) and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (1798), Coleridge
                    models an immersive, affective reading that moves between fiction and reality in
                    ways analogous to what cognitive scientists call Theory of Mind. Both poets,
                    then, reveal an interest in the regulation and circulation of affect within the
                    literary text, and they do so in an eerie manner, through narratives of ghosts,
                    nightmares, deaths, dreams, and sleepwalking, all Gothic elements that figure
                    the immersive reading experience “in which the reader is absorbed, lost in the
                    automaticity of the affect”—not absorbed forever, but rather awakening to a more
                    enlightened state.</p>
               <p>Moving from canonical figures to a lesser-known author, Jonas Cope’s essay
                    focuses on Eliza Fenwick, whose understudied gothic novel <title level="m">Secresy</title> (1795) shows unparalleled dramatization of the
                    impersonality of emotion as compared to other novels of the same period. What’s
                    more, the novel illustrates several core tenets of contemporary affect theory in
                    surprising ways—surprising, I say, given its relative obscurity amongst most
                    readers and scholars. In contrast to existing scholarship that situates
                    characters in the novel as specific “types” isolated from one another, Cope’s
                    affective approach shows how their bodies interact in intimate, non-cognitive
                    ways, in the shared space of affect. Cope also intervenes in affect studies by
                    arguing that <title level="m">Secresy</title> “illuminates the more recent,
                    physiological-theoretical work in affect theory” espoused by Massumi “as much as
                    that work illuminates” the benefits of the literary-historical strand of affect
                    studies—that is, how characters interact in the novel. Cope thus advances
                    existing scholarship on the novel to show how affect theory can contribute to
                    the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers.</p>
               <p>In the fourth essay, Mark Lussier draws from both affect theory and rhythmic
                    studies to shed new light on what is arguably William Blake’s greatest and most
                    complex work: <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>. In an
                    essay dazzling in its theoretical breadth and critical understanding of Blake,
                    Lussier uses his unique critical lens to make sense of Blake’s continuing
                    influence on and engagement with each new age (Blake, as Lussier points out, is
                    cited more than any other Romantic poet in popular culture), weaving together
                    the poem’s reception history, scholarly history, and his own personal
                    relationship with the poem, from his Master’s thesis to the present project.
                    This is perhaps what is most novel about the essay: while affect studies tends
                    to take an almost detached approach to the emotions—treating them historically,
                    theoretically, or scientifically—Lussier takes a personal approach, for what is
                    more personal than our emotions and our bodies? Indeed, Lussier reads <title level="m">Marriage </title>as a textual body itself, one that transmits
                    affects to its reader through its structure and rhythm, a process of “affect
                    contagion.” Blake’s material text embodies affective intensities that work on
                    the reader prior to cognition. The text is an “affect-generating machine” that
                    continues indefinitely as it is a body that cannot die. Yet, as Lussier makes
                    clear, <title level="m">Marriage</title> cannot represent affect but only trace
                    affect through poetic form: affect remains outside of conscious thought. But the
                    movement and rhythm of the work unveils the presence of affect at work.</p>
               <p>In the final essay, Joel Faflak rereads Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> (1820) as the poet’s ultimate statement on the global and
                    cosmic intersections of affect, emotion, and feeling. By drawing from a range of
                    recent work in affect theory, Faflak presents a masterful close reading of
                    Shelley’s lyrical drama wherein emotion is “the event” (via Badiou) that
                    “materializ[es] subjects <emph>as</emph> subjects.” The movement of the drama is
                    the movement of emotion itself, the transmission of affect that constitutes “a
                    world moving both within and beyond its own boundaries.” In a kind of affective
                    feedback loop, subjects “call the world into emotional existence,” and that
                    existence in turn materializes the emotional lives of the subjects. In <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, Shelley images this complex matrix,
                    this “broader feeling network” that we are unable to grasp fully because we
                    exist in its midst. By reading affect theory through Shelley and Shelley through
                    affect theory, Faflak offers a new understanding of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> as more material and much less idealized. Importantly, the
                    essay helps to illuminate key concepts and arguments in affect studies as much
                    as it illuminates Shelley’s poem.</p>
               <p>We still have much to learn about affect and emotion, and, as the essays in this
                    volume make clear, Romantic literature continues to offer significant sites for
                    such critical inquiry. In sum, these essays offer a representative example of
                    how affect studies has transformed the study of Romanticism, and how
                    Romanticists continue to shape the trajectory of affect studies. They also
                    represent the future of Romantic scholarship: Caballero and Knupsky’s essay on
                    Baillie is part their ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration and publication
                    program on the intersections of Romantic literature and cognitive psychology;
                    Harris’s essay on Keats stems from her award-winning dissertation, which will
                    likely appear as a monograph in the near future; Cope’s piece on Fenwick speaks
                    to the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers of the Romantic period;
                    Lussier’s essay on Blake is one in a cluster of essays just published or
                    forthcoming on Blake, affect, and rhythmic studies; and Faflak’s piece on
                    Shelley is one of two forthcoming essays on <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> emerging from his influential work in affect studies. This
                    kind of work will prove increasingly important in a world where emotion is
                    growing in critical and popular appeal. As we continue to reimagine Romanticism
                    during this renaissance of emotion facilitated by the affective turn, the
                    Romantics will continue to teach us how to feel, and we can teach others how to
                    love and make sense of that feeling.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Portions of this essay

                  <p>In her 1798 “Introductory Discourse,” Joanna Baillie argues that sympathetic
                        curiosity is what makes people care about others in the world. Given this
                        innate “propensity,” her goal is to harness it to teach audiences how to
                        “handle” the passions. In contemporary parlance, Baillie wants to use
                        sympathetic curiosity for “emotion regulation,” a concept used in
                        socio-cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In this essay, we consider how
                        conversations in affect studies could inform the concept of emotion
                        regulation. In doing so, we move beyond a conversation about <emph>what
                        </emph>affect is to a conversation about <emph>how</emph> it functions. As
                        Seigworth and Gregg ask, “how does a body . . . come to shift its affections
                        (its being-affected) into action (capacity to affect)?” (2).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Similarly, affect scientist Kuppens argues,
                            “The study of affect dynamics aims to describe the principles and
                            regularities behind these changes, uncover the processes driving them,
                            and understand the implications they bear for psychological functioning”
                            (298).</note> Before analyzing Bailie’s play <title level="m">De Montfort</title> (1798) to critique models of emotion regulation, we
                        provide context for the rationale of this project by 1) positioning
                        sympathetic curiosity as a tool for emotional education, 2) disentangling
                        affect, emotion, and cognition, and 3) exploring the social in the
                        management of emotion. Ultimately, we model an ethical, interdisciplinary
                        approach and champion its value for integrated conversations among the
                        humanities and the sciences. The partnership we developed (as a literary
                        historian and a cognitive psychologist) pursues what we call “ethical
                        interdisciplinarity”—interdisciplinary partnerships that allow scholars to
                        learn <emph>with</emph> one another rather than to learn <emph>about</emph>
                        each other in isolation.</p>
                  <p>We were initially inspired by the model of the cognitive humanities and Lisa
                        Zunshine’s “cognitive cultural project,” which she describes as
                        understanding “the evolving relationship between two immensely complex
                        historically situated systems—the human mind and cultural artifacts”
                        (“Introduction” 3). Thus far, this relationship has been mostly
                        unidirectional with cognitive psychology applied to literary studies rather
                        than literary studies inspiring work in the cognitive sciences.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For notable exceptions of psychologists who
                            bring literary analyses into scientific conversations, see Crozier, who
                            applies literary analyses to inform psychological models of blushing;
                            and Oatley, who explores the power of fictional construction on emotion
                            and now also writes fiction. </note> We imagine scholarly exchanges that
                        are not simply “sciences saving the humanities,” but are instead bi- or
                        multi- directional exchanges that challenge and push the work of all
                        disciplines. Indeed, Zunshine advises “a student of cognitive cultural
                        studies would thus do well to think of herself as a
                            <foreign>bricoleur</foreign> who reaches out for the best mix of
                        insights that cognitive theory as a whole has to offer without worrying
                        about blurring lines between its various domains” (“Introduction” 3). </p>
                  <p>More recently, our work has been informed by the research and methods used in
                        the emerging field of cognitive literary science (CLSci).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a comprehensive history and extensive methodological
                            examples of CLSci, see Burke and Troscianko.</note> As defined by Burke
                        and Troscianko, in this field work unfolds in a variety of ways such that,
                        “literary scholars draw on some aspect of cognitive science to offer a new
                        viewpoint on literature . . . literary scholars use literary materials or
                        conceptual frameworks to contribute to cognitive-scientific debates . . .
                        [or] cognitive scientists engage with literature and literary-critical
                        methods to shed light on questions in their home discipline and/or those in
                        literary studies” (4). We find much to value in this field, especially its
                        diversity of approaches, although the resultant complication is that there
                        is a lot of ground to cover in each new project. Burke and Troscianko note,
                        “sceptics may say that this heterogeneity is the field’s fatal flaw, but it
                        must also be its forte” (8). </p>
                  <p>Both the cognitive humanities and CLSci fields, then, celebrate a diverse,
                        messy interchange of ideas; we agree with this vision given that our path to
                        affect studies has been different from others in the field. We approach
                        conversations about “the general turn to affect,” with a freedom to explore
                        seemingly disparate positions for important points of intersection (Leys
                        434) and have discovered important moments of convergence among them. We
                        argue that exploring how Baillie’s theory of sympathetic curiosity is
                        portrayed in the sibling relationship in <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
                        informs modern cognitive studies of social affective interactions, enriching
                        an understanding of how people learn to regulate emotion together. This
                        interdisciplinary approach has the potential to reimagine how scholars read
                        Baillie and to shape future investigations of social emotion regulation
                            (SER).<note place="foot" resp="editors">We want to distinguish between
                            the disciplines of affective science and social emotion regulation
                            (SER). The latter is an area of research that falls under the broader
                            umbrella of cognitive neuroscience and utilizes behavioral and
                            physiological methodologies; the former has more explicit ties with
                            literary conversations and history. Currently there seems to be a
                            disconnect between these areas of research, although new fields such as
                            cognitive literary science and the cognitive humanities are working to
                            bring them more explicitly into conversation together. In the first part
                            of this essay, we rely more heavily on affective science; later in the
                            essay when describing models of emotion regulation, we rely on
                            SER.</note>

                  <p>Baillie is considered one of the most important playwrights of the British
                        Romantic era. She published her 1798 <title level="m">Plays on the
                            Passions</title> anonymously to great acclaim. Her intentions were to
                        continue to publish both tragedies and comedies focused on the primary
                        passions and their dangers if left unchecked. Baillie wanted her plays to be
                        performed, and, initially, when her first book of the plays on the passions
                        appeared, it seemed likely that they would go on to great commercial and
                        theatrical success.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on spectacle,
                            reception, and cognition in Baillie’s plays, see Burroughs, especially
                            chapters 2 and 4; Donkin; Whalen 665–81; and Richardson’s chapter in
                            Crochunis 130–45.</note> Kucich argues that the end of the eighteenth
                        century offered women dramatists the opportunity to write plays that would
                        “reinvigorate not only theatrical life but the entire national literature”
                        (25). He notes that the end of the eighteenth century gave women “an
                        unprecedented prominence in drama” despite concerns about the place and
                        influence of women on it and argues that women writers like Joanna Baillie,
                        Jane West, and Mary Russell Mitford were attracted to historiography and the
                        historical drama as a genre that could “infuse” “the dynamics of justice and
                        mercy in the national politics of the present” (24, 23).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on Baillie, drama and gender see Kucich’s
                            chapter in Crochunis 108–29; chapter 5 of Puriton; and Mellor
                            559–67.</note> Indeed, as Cox indicates in his review of Romantic drama,
                        “From Baillie to Hemans, women are in fact central to the drama of the
                        period,” noting that “Baillie . . . was the key tragedian of the day” (4).
                        If only moderately successful at having her plays performed, Baillie was,
                        even in her own time, considered to be a giant of the genre.</p>
                  <p>Baillie believed dramatic literary works like <title level="m">De Monfort
                        </title>moved readers and allowed her audiences to see the evolution and
                        effects of hatred on the body and the mind of its titular character while
                        being free from the passion itself. This experience would offer them insight
                        about the passions and how to avoid being overcome by them. As she wrote in
                        the “Introductory Discourse,” “the characters of the drama must speak
                        directly for themselves” (82). Baillie argued that in drama audiences look
                        for “creatures like ourselves” who offer them “characteristick [sic] truth,”
                        making them “intoxicated with it.” A good play “convinces” viewers “of the
                        author’s great knowledge of the human heart” (“Introductory Discourse” 82).
                        Baillie is particularly invested in drama, as she thinks it is the most
                        direct form of literary engagement for an audience. But she is also careful
                        to provide a framework within which drama has maximal impact. Characters
                        should not be idealized and unrealistically heroic; they should speak for
                        themselves, and drama should focus on the “heart” of human nature rather
                        than be mired down in distractions of spectacle. Baillie anticipates what
                        psychological research on the impact of narrative has identified as the
                        importance of transportation (of an audience into the narrative) and the
                        factors that heighten its impact. By transporting, the audience can be
                        persuaded to change existing belief systems.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more information on the psychological concept of

                  </p>
                  <p>Baillie’s “Introductory Discourse” is astute in its generic understanding and
                        in its assessment of the aesthetic and pedagogical value of the theater.
                        Baillie anchors this piece on the concept she calls “sympathetic curiosity,”
                        using it to explore what she considers people’s desire to learn about
                        themselves through others. She argues that everyone has a “propensity” to be
                        curious about the spectacle of the passions and also to have innate sympathy
                        when witnessing the suffering of others, suggesting, “from that strong
                        sympathy which most creatures, but humans above all, feel for others of
                        their kind, nothing has become so much an object of man’s curiosity as
                        himself” (67). People are curious about many things, but at the foundation,
                        their curiosity and empathy lie in observing and learning from others like
                        themselves. They are intrigued about others’ quotidian dramas, and that
                        curiosity opens them up to “self-knowledge”: “it is only from creatures like
                        ourselves that we feel, and therefore only from creatures like ourselves
                        that we receive instruction” (87). </p>
                  <p>The curiosity to observe in intimate detail others’ experiences, whether they
                        are painful or joyful, is tempered by the animation of sympathy. Though it
                        is a spring of potential good, sympathetic curiosity is not inherently good
                        or evil. Sympathetic curiosity, as Baillie argues, must be directed; it must
                        be given proper management, care, and instruction. Permitting audiences to
                        watch the evolution of the primary passions on stage while not being
                        affected by them directly allows Baillie to harness their sympathetic
                        curiosity so that they learn from, rather than merely enjoy, the spectacle
                        of others’ suffering, perhaps in a way no other experience can provide: “In
                        examining others we know ourselves. With limbs untorn, with head unsmitten,
                        with senses unimpaired by despair, we know what we ourselves might have been
                        on the rack, on the scaffold, and in the most afflicting circumstances of
                        distress.” Ultimately, this knowledge of self through and by others allows
                        people to “becom[e] more just, more merciful, more compassionate”
                        (“Introductory Discourse” 74). Sympathetic curiosity makes them receptive to
                        their own struggles and to the suffering of others.</p>
                  <p>In constructing her ideas of sympathetic curiosity and highlighting it as a
                        human “propensity” Baillie is clearly influenced by and connected to a
                        complex and long-standing conversation about sympathy, in particular to the
                        ideas of David Hume in his <title level="m">Treatise of Human Nature</title>
                        (1739–40) and Adam Smith in his <title level="m">Theory of Moral
                            Sentiments</title> (1759).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One
                            suggestion that her work may have been influenced by Hume is their
                            similar construction of sympathy as a propensity. Hume argued “No
                            quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its
                            consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others,
                            and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments,
                            however different from, or even contrary to our own,” while Baillie
                            argued, “how sensible are we of this strong propensity within us, when
                            we behold any person under the pressure of great and uncommon calamity”
                            (Hume 367; “Introdoctory Discourse,” Baillie 72). For more on the
                            history of sympathy in the seventeenth century and its connections to
                            Smith and Hume in the eighteenth century, see Lobis.</note> In
                        particular their work may have been of interest given their goals to make
                        scientific the study of sympathy (Broadie 151, Lobis 291–92). While there
                        are differences in how Hume and Smith ultimately define the mechanism of
                        sympathy, both connect its relevance to the positive workings of human
                        social interactions and justice. Specifically, Frazer notes, “Hume most
                        often uses the word sympathy to refer to a specific faculty of emotional
                        communication” (41). For Hume this emotional communication operates as the
                        spectator reads external signs and gestures on another’s body and face and
                        then infers that these signs and gestures arise from the effect of an
                        emotion (Frazer 41). In essence, according to Hume, the impression of a
                        passion in another becomes an idea of the passion in the spectator that is
                        ultimately “enlivened” so that the spectator feels some of the passion
                        herself (Broadie 173, Frazer 41). In Hume we see the precursors to
                        contemporary discussions of how people “read” emotion in others, a process
                        that is now called Theory of Mind (ToM) or Mind Reading. Hume’s conception
                        of sympathy as an emotional communicator provides a stepping-stone for
                        Baillie’s use of sympathetic curiosity as an instructor. </p>
                  <p>The intricate complexities of the functions of sympathy for Hume and Smith
                        are beyond the scope of this essay, but we pause here to focus on two areas
                        that intersect with Baillie’s concept of sympathy curiosity. First, for both
                        Hume and Smith, sympathy operates differently when the spectator feels more
                        connected to the actor. In Hume’s case he discusses the idea of resemblance,
                        e.g., nationality, race, etc., (Broadie 173–74) while Smith focuses on the
                        closeness of relationships (Frazer 100). The intensity of the passion felt
                        by the spectator may increase or judgments of propriety may be biased. In
                        both cases the take away is that sympathy is not uniformly applied to all
                        people or situations. Similarly, we see Baillie contend with uneven
                        activations of sympathetic curiosity as she argues that audiences are more
                        compelled by imperfect characters that seem more like them than historical,
                        perfect, and distant heroes. She argues that “the transactions of men become
                        interesting to us only as we are made acquainted with men themselves”
                        (“Introductory Discourse 76). Baillie argues that emotional lessons will be
                        more memorable if they are conveyed using accounts of “men subject to like
                        weaknesses and passions with ourselves” (“Introductory Discourse” 77).
                        Overall then, attention to the similarity between spectator and actor matter
                        in all these explanations of the process of sympathy.</p>
                  <p>In addition to acknowledging that sympathy’s uneven activation could impact
                        learning, Baillie also stresses that learning via sympathetic curiosity
                        happens because the spectator is not in the throes on the passion itself.
                        This fits with Hume’s and Smith’s ideas that sympathy can only evoke an echo
                        of the emotion felt by the actor in the spectator. In describing Smith’s
                        process of sympathy Frazer emphasizes that “it is essential to Smith’s
                        theory that sympathy can never be perfect” because if the spectator
                        sympathized perfectly, i.e., felt the emotion in exactly the same way, she
                        would not have “the distance necessary for an appraisal of the actor’s
                        reactions to his situation” (Frazer 101). Our reading of Hume also suggests
                        that the intensity of an emotion for the spectator would be less than the
                        emotion felt by the actor. This is because for Hume sympathy for the actor
                        is conveyed as an idea in the spectator rather than as an impression. This
                        difference matters because “an impression has greater liveliness,
                        forcefulness, or vivacity” than an idea (Broadie 152). In other words, in
                        all of these conceptions of the function of sympathy some distance between
                        the felt emotion of the actor and the felt emotion of the spectator is
                        unavoidable and necessary. </p>
                  <p>Finally, for our purposes, situations are a key component in the social
                        elements of the transmission of sympathy. As Smith argues, “sympathy,
                        therefore, does not arise so much from the view of the passion, as from that
                        of the situation which excites it” (16). The primacy of situation is an
                        important aspect of Baillie’s experiment of recreating the evolution of a
                        passion across time on stage: the activation of the spectator’s imagination
                        allows her to “put” herself “in his case” (Smith 16). It is this act of
                        imagining oneself “on the rack” that Baillie believes provides the capacity
                        for emotional instruction. </p>
                  <p>As previously stated, we are using the methods of the cognitive humanities
                        and CLSci to demonstrate how Baillie’s experiment with <title level="m">Plays on the Passions</title> can inform contemporary models of social
                        emotion regulation. Baillie’s work seems particularly well-suited for such
                        an examination because while Hume and Smith explore the ways that sympathy
                        might impact behavior, Baillie’s explicit goal was to use sympathetic
                        curiosity to educate the audience about how to modify their emotions. In
                        addition, what makes Baillie’s examination of the passions compelling for an
                        interdisciplinary investigation is that as a dramatist she was also immersed
                        in scientific conversations of the day, especially those that examined the
                        nature of emotion and its expression. While we do not with certainty know if
                        Baillie knew the work of Charles Bell directly, we see his ideas about the
                        expression of emotion as grounded in the body (as opposed to just the face)
                        reflected in her detailed stage directions which paint clear pictures of
                        shaking fists, collapsing bodies, and expanding/contracting chests. As Dwyer
                        argues, Baillie’s series of plays were certainly influenced by the work of
                        her uncles, Doctors John and William Hunter, and by the development of what
                        Hume, Smith, Dugald Stewart, and others called “the science of man.” If her
                        uncles and other eminent scientists of the day were focusing on anatomy and
                        physiology, so was Baillie: “Writing in the wake of the scientific
                        revolution and operating within a broad psychosocial framework, Baillie
                        sought to <emph>stage </emph>the external anatomy of passion and imagine its
                        unseen psychological depths” (Dwyer 32). Indeed, Baillie understood that
                        “there is perhaps, no employment which the human mind will with so much
                        avidity pursue, as the discovery of concealed passion, as the tracing [sic]
                        the varieties of a perturbed soul” (“Introductory Discourse” 73). </p>
                  <p>Baillie wanted more than simply to show or display a passion. She was
                        invested in distilling primal passions, what she called “the most powerful
                        passions,” to offer a classification of their development. In doing so, she
                        allows others to observe and learn from their evolution, to understand how
                        to avoid them in their own lives, and to recognize the moments of failure to
                        control them as exhibited by the protagonists in the throes of them
                        (“Introductory Discourse” 92). In other words, Baillie was invested in “the
                        empirical investigations of the body as well as the mind and its passions”
                        (Dwyer 32). As such, her plays allowed not only for the charting of the
                        evolution of a passion, but also for recognition that self-knowledge is
                        intricately informed by and happens in relation to others. We learn because
                        we observe others, think about them, think about us, and think about us and
                        them all at the same time.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more on

                  </p>
                  <p>An interdisciplinary consideration of Baillie’s theory of sympathetic
                        curiosity suggests a natural connection to modern psychological and
                        neuroscientific conversations about emotion expression and regulation.
                        Baillie’s desire to dissect the evolution of an emotion over its time
                        course, to illustrate its impact on the body and mind, and to engage the
                        audience’s attention to a character’s wrestling with an emotion all speak to
                        the ongoing research of affect scientists. Baillie’s contention that
                        “tracing the progress of passion points out to us those stages in the
                        approach of the enemy, <emph>when he might have been combatted most
                            successfully</emph>” (emphasis ours) suggests that by engaging the
                        audience’s sympathetic curiosity, her <title level="m">Plays on the

                        (“Introductory Discourse” 94). In particular, her attention to the
                        interactions amongst key characters in her plays indicates her valuation of
                        how these social relationships matter in the managing of emotions.</p>

                        Scherer’s interdisciplinary conception of “a working definition of emotion.”
                        As they argue, “There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of emotion in
                        any of the disciplines that study this phenomenon. This fact leads to
                        endless debates and hampers the cumulative progress of research. It also
                        constitutes a major impediment to interdisciplinary dialogue and research
                        collaboration” (345).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> There are two large
                            camps in psychological debates about the nature of emotion: one that
                            identifies emotions as “basic” or “natural kinds,” following Ekman, and
                            one that aligns with Barrett’s Conceptual Act Theory. In the former,
                            seven to eight unique, basic emotions are identified (i.e., anger,
                            sadness, joy, etc.), while in the latter, there are no “distinct”
                            emotions but a categorization based on associations between physical
                            changes and conceptual knowledge. However, the move towards Barrett’s
                            theory has gained ascendancy; neuroscientists like LeDoux have clarified
                            that his views align more with cognitive than with basic emotions
                            perspective and studies by Touroutoglou et al. and Kragel &amp; LaBar
                            argue that the neural circuitry for emotion supports the Conceptual Act
                            Theory. </note> The multiplicity of conceptions of affect and emotion is
                        echoed in affect studies. As Seigworth and Gregg argue, “there can only ever
                        be infinitely multiple iterations of affect and theories of affect” (3–4).
                        Despite the differences across these conceptions of emotion and its
                        appraisal, it is possible to identify points of contact across the competing
                        models and to synthesize aspects considered in some of these research
                        programs that are not under investigation in others. The strength in the
                        diversity of research on emotion is that we can hold these different models
                        up next to one another, distill their relevant features, and develop an
                        operational definition of emotion that allows for continued and novel
                        interrogation. Moreover, because we take an interdisciplinary approach, we
                        are leveraging aspects of these models that converge with conversations in
                        historical and literary criticism. Doing so allows us to bring to bear the
                        combined thinking about the complex notion of emotion across diverse
                        perspectives, historical periods, and approaches. To be clear then, the
                        purpose of this essay is not to provide a new, overarching definition of
                        emotion itself but to consider how we can use Baillie’s literary experiment
                        to critique contemporary models of the process of regulating emotional
                        experience. That is, we are focused on how emotions may be managed, not of
                        what they are made.</p>
                  <p>In this essay, we will reserve the word emotion for affect that has been
                        appraised. What we mean by “appraised affect” (i.e., emotion) is the
                        activation of affect that has become conscious which allows a person to
                        focus on the portion of affect that she can “act upon” (i.e.,
                            regulate).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Three cognitive
                            psychological principles frame our understanding of the connections
                            among affect, emotion, and cognition that include the following: 1)
                            affect and cognition are separable but interweaved systems; 2) affect is
                            flexible and “residual”; and 3) affect can have an unconscious impact on
                            cognition. First, for the idea of “separable,” consider the functioning
                            of the human perceptual process; there are systems for processing both
                            local features (i.e., the eyes, nose, and mouth of a face) and global
                            features of an object (i.e., the eyes are above the nose which is above
                            the mouth). These are “separable” physiological systems in that one can
                            be disrupted and the other will still function. However, they must
                            function together to “see” a “whole” face. Second, we think of the
                            flexibility of affect using connectionist models of memory wherein
                            working memory (currently conscious) is the activated part of long-term
                            memory (unconscious, yet accessible). Activation is the neural process
                            generated when attention is given to a particular memory and that fades
                            as attention shifts or wanes. Decades-old lyrics to a song tucked up in
                            memory can be activated by the first few notes of its music. In this
                            way, affect is “there” and “not there” all the time—some part active and
                            inactive. Third, we think of affect’s impact on cognition by thinking
                            about the theory of constructive perception. In this theory, top-down
                            factors (physiological states like hunger and emotional states like
                            fear) act upon perception simultaneously with (or prior to) the
                            processing of bottom-up factors in a physical scene (like the lines,
                            angles, shapes, and shadows of objects). So, research shows that in
                            moments of strong affect, people perceive fingerprint “matches” that are
                            not there (Dror et al.); that when in a bad mood, young adults tend to
                            look at negative objects while older adults tend to look at positive
                            objects (Isaacowitz et al.); and that emotional and affective valences
                            influence perceptual processing of vocal and visual stimuli at neuronal
                            levels (see Hensel et al. and Vogel et al.). From a constructive
                            perception approach, affect impacts our cognitive processing without our
                            conscious knowledge. Given this framework, we do not see a dissonance
                            between Tomkins’ early conceptions of the relation between affect and
                            cognition and Leys’ important critique of the “general turn to affect”
                            which has separated the body from the mind, i.e. affect from cognition.
                            We agree that this separation is counterproductive to understanding the
                            impact of affect on human thought and behavior. For more about these
                            aspects of cognition, see Sternberg’s highly readable, introductory
                            textbook, <title level="m">Cognitive Psychology</title>.</note> In other
                        words, in order to study the process of emotion regulation, we must
                        necessarily focus on the portion of emotional experience that can be
                        reflected upon and, perhaps, modified. This definition does not deny that
                        residual (un-appraised) affect remains and influences thought and behavior;
                        un-appraised affect still impacts people’s experience, even if they cannot
                        name it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In her review essay, Favret also
                            discusses the “affective residue” that poets struggle with as
                            “unknowable” but there (1164).</note> As affect theorists Seigworth and
                        Gregg remind us, “In practice, then, affect and cognition are never fully
                        separable—if for no other reason than that thought is itself a body,
                        embodied” (2–3). So, the uncontrollable, unconscious function of emotion is
                        a vital part of human survival and the human experience. Indeed,
                        philosophers like Nussbaum have argued for the centrality of emotion and its
                        purposeful contributions to human thought and behavior not just as a
                        motivator, but as an essential aspect of how people experience the internal
                        and external world. Nussbaum sees the impact of feeling on human behavior as
                        an inevitable and necessary aspect of human experience—an aspect that should
                        not be “contained” but valued for its contributions to concepts like justice
                        and compassion. As she argues, “Emotions are not just the fuel that powers
                        the psychological mechanism of a reasoning creature, they are parts, highly
                        complex and messy parts, of this creature’s reasoning itself” (3). </p>
                  <p>Debates about the relationship between affect and cognition harken to
                        eighteenth century conversations about reason and the passions.
                        Specifically, Hume famously argued that, “reason is, and ought only to be
                        the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to
                        serve and obey them” (462). As Broadie explains, Hume sees the relation
                        between reason and the passions as one of “mutual dependence” such that
                        “reason without passion does not know where to go and passion without reason
                        does not know how to get there” (178–79).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Because he thought his argument might be “somewhat extraordinary,” Hume
                            continues, “Since a passion can never, in any sense, be called
                            unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition, or when it chuses
                            means insufficient for the designed end, it is impossible, that reason
                            and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the government of
                            the will and actions” (464). </note> And in keeping with our notion of
                        emotion as appraised affect, meaning capable of being acted upon, Nazar
                        notes that, “Hume and Smith take moral judgment to be
                            <emph>deliberative</emph> processes that mobilize both feeling and
                        reason” (23). While the process of emotion regulation is distinct from the
                        larger notion of moral judgment, what we pull from these early discussions
                        is that reason (i.e., cognition) is necessary for feeling (i.e., affect) to
                        be acted upon. </p>
                  <p>Returning to more contemporary conversations in the realm of affective
                        science, Tomkins’ early conception of affect conceives of a motivational
                        system separate from but intimately tied to the driving of cognitive
                        functioning (i.e., a feedback system): “Feedback and affect are two distinct
                        mechanisms which may operate independent of each other in human beings”
                            (37).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The inherent intertwining of
                            affect and cognition despite their separateness is emphasized by
                            Tomkins, who stresses that “reason without affect would be impotent,
                            affect without reason would be blind. The combination of affect and
                            reason guarantees man’s higher degree of freedom” (37). For a more
                            recent description of how affect (as a separate system) motivates action
                            via a series of interconnected feedback loops, see Carver
                            301-307.</note> This conception fits both with Hume and Smith’s notion
                        of the relationship between reason and feeling and with Mulligan and
                        Scherer’s contemporary interdisciplinary model that defines emotion as a
                        product of a componential system that includes (among others) a cognitive
                        component and a neurophysiological component (352).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> There is a long-standing line of philosophical work that
                            has pushed against the notion of emotion (affect) and reason (cognition)
                            as separate systems. For example, Solomon has argued that, “the passions
                            are not to be separated from reason; they are to be welded together into
                            a single unit” (15). In his “new Romanticism” perspective, Solomon
                            claims, “Emotions are said to distort our reality; I argue that they are
                            responsible for it. Emotions are said to divide us from our interests
                            and lead us astray; I argue that emotions create our interests and our
                            purposes” (15). In his work, Solomon rejects the pathologizing of
                            emotions. Our own understanding of the purpose of emotion fits with his
                            conception—we do not consider emotion “bad” or “hurtful” to human
                            cognition. In fact, recent psychological investigations have
                            re-emphasized that “negative” emotions are just as important to human
                            thought and behavior as “positive” emotions. What we take from the work
                            of Hume, Tomkins, and Barrett is the notion that emotion provides the
                            underlying motivation for all we do. Without emotion, there is no
                            driving force for human behavior. But this does not require a “melded”
                            system unless “melded” refers to the kind of integrated, parallel
                            processing system we see in most contemporary scientific conceptions of
                            the relation between cognition and emotion. </note> Ultimately,
                        grounding affect and cognition as “separate” but interconnected systems
                        aligns with current cognitive psychological and neuroscientific conceptions
                        of cognition—a brain-based, embodied network comprised of a multitude of
                        independent systems that work interactively and in parallel to influence one
                        another and to generate human thought and behavior. Emotion can have its own
                        un-appraised impact or be appraised and influenced by reason.</p>
                  <p>Finally, because the play under analysis focuses on hatred, we must also
                        acknowledge and consider the complexity of the relationship among anger,
                        rage, and hatred. Romantic studies has historically focused on grief,
                        terror, and horror (the sublime), especially as tied to the French
                        Revolution and Gothic Studies, but Stauffer has revisited anger as a central
                        and paradoxical emotion during the late eighteenth century and especially
                        after the Terror.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more about the
                            Gothic and masculine and feminine emotion, see Williams, especially
                            parts one and two. For more on masculinity and the Gothic, see
                            Hendershot. For the emotion of pain and the Gothic, see Bruhm,
                            especially chapters 2 and 3. For terror and the Gothic, see Bloom,
                            especially chapter 1. For the connections between the French Revolution
                            and fear, see Wright. For connections between terror, terrorism, the
                            Gothic, and the Reign of Terror, see Crawford.</note> On the one hand,
                        “anger was generally demonized as irrational, destructive rage—as an all but
                        uncontrollable passion visited upon its victims”; on the other hand, anger
                        was seen as related to “authenticity and justice” (Stauffer 4, 11). As
                        Stauffer notes, rage, anger, hatred, and related concepts have murky
                        distinctions in a post-Terror world. </p>
                  <p>In the “Introductory Discourse,” Baillie distinguishes among these dark
                        emotions, recognizing that hatred is a long-term and long-lasting “passion.”
                        Like Baillie, emotion scientist Ekman also distinguishes between anger and
                        hatred, noting that “Hate: is an enduring state marked by anger towards a
                        person, but not the acts of that person. Unlike anger, fury, or rage, it
                        does not subside. Rather, hate persists over time and is easily called forth
                        by any stimulus” (366).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We note the
                            uncanny connection between Ekman and Baillie’s definition of hatred and
                            anger and their effects on people. Again, this convergence across the
                            centuries convinces us of the importance to have interdisciplinary
                            conversations.</note> As noted by Heylen et al., while anger is often
                        conceived of as a “short-lasting emotion,” it can also be “late-blooming”
                        with an “intensity [that] accumulates over a sizable amount of time—the
                        episodes last[ing] longer and reach[ing] their peak relatively late”
                            (175).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent psychological and
                            neuroscientific studies of anger have identified the neural signatures
                            of anger, the feedback loop in angry rumination that prolongs the
                            emotion, and the fact that anger can sometimes be purposefully selected
                            by an individual, despite its negative affect, in order to accomplish
                            behavioral goals. See Fabiansson et al. 2974–81; and Tamir et al.
                            324–28.</note> Likewise, we situate hate as a long-term, slowly building
                        passion that develops over time and is comprised of individual fits of
                        anger.</p>
                  <p>While Classical scholars argued that individuals expressing anger and fits of
                        rage were “not a candidate for normal sympathetic response,” Baillie’s
                        project nevertheless intends to engage audiences’ sympathetic curiosity
                        while playing out the rise and fall of hatred in the character of De Monfort
                        (Stauffer 21). Baillie recognizes the potential problems with creating
                        sympathetic curiosity in her audience for someone who is under “a passion so
                        baleful, so unamiable, . . . [and] reprehensible,” but she aspires to show
                        the “pernicious and dangerous nature” of this passion upon the “good gifts”
                        that De Monfort has (“Introductory Discourse” 108). In other words, her goal
                        is to “consider that it is the passion and not the man which is held up to
                        our execration” (“Introductory Discourse” 108). Her experiment with the
                        passions allows her to do so by illustrating the development of hatred over
                        time in a character who is not “decidedly wicked,” allowing audiences to
                        perhaps identify with De Monfort’s demise (“Introductory Discourse”
                        108).</p>

                  <head>We Are Who We Use: Constructing Social Emotion Regulation</head>
                  <p>At the heart of emotion regulation is a tension among physiological, mental,
                        and social influences of emotion and the extent to which that emotion is
                        enacted, decreased, increased, or maintained. In some settings, the
                        expression of a particular emotion is socially acceptable and even
                        evolutionarily beneficial. In others, the expression of that emotion is not
                        sanctioned. The regulation of this unwanted expression is a culturally
                        grounded skill set, learned over time, with decided individual differences.
                        Emotion regulation requires a consideration of how that process is learned
                        and how it could be enhanced. </p>
                  <p>The foundational and prevailing model of emotion regulation, devised by Gross
                        and his colleagues over the past three decades, is the “process model,”
                        which delineates an arc of emotion and identifies regulation strategies that
                        could effectively disrupt emotional processes at different stages (Gross,
                        “Emotion Regulation” 6). In other words, there are multiple points in time
                        during which emotional experiences can be avoided, modified, or heightened.
                        And, there are different emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) that are more
                        or less effective depending upon when they are used along the arc of the
                        emotional experience. For example, if one is fearful about flying, the ERS
                        “situation selection” could be used by simply avoiding air travel all
                        together; one can “regulate” the emotion of fear by not being in the
                        position to have a fearful experience in the first place. Alternatively, if
                        one is already in the throes of an emotion, then other ERSs would be
                        required. For example, one could decide to fly with a friend (ERS situation
                        modification), listen to music (ERS attentional deployment), learn about how
                        airplanes work (ERS reappraisal), or white-knuckle it (ERS expressive
                        suppression). The upshot of the process model is that successful emotion
                        regulation requires the ability to match the ERS with the temporal emotional
                        circumstance.</p>
                  <p>Bonnano and Burton argue that some people are better at negotiating this
                        process than others. This “regulatory flexibility” requires the ability to
                        read a room to determine whether emotion expression is warranted
                        (sensitivity to context); the ability to access a range of different
                        regulation strategies (repertoire); and the ability to monitor whether a
                        regulation strategy has been effective (responsiveness to feedback). Still,
                        their model underappreciates the social nature and motivation of emotion
                        regulation. Currently, affective scientists are working to consider how
                        emotion regulation may be impacted by social processes. For example,
                        Schmader and Berry Mendes suggest that emotion regulation may be influenced
                        by our consideration of whether “a certain emotional experience would
                        interfere with one’s social and personal goals” (116).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In evaluation of the achievement of one’s social goals,
                            we can think of the desires of others as a kind of emotional constraint,
                            a constraint that if ill-fitting could result in “a power strategy
                            designed to break through the constraints which enforced it” (Tomkins
                            73).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Considering the role of the “social” in the modification (i.e., regulation)
                        of emotion is not a new endeavor in moral philosophy. Specifically, in
                        Smith’s conception of sympathy there is a component of interpersonal
                        feedback. As Broadie notes, “the spectator qua moral agent has the ability
                        to affect a change in the person whom he observes by revealing to the person
                        his reaction to him” (211). In other words, the spectator’s approval of the
                        actor (specifically the actor’s emotional display) matters and is capable of
                        regulating the emotional experience of the actor “probably towards
                        conformity with the feelings of the spectator” (Broadie 212). Even the
                        intrapersonal feedback required in Smith’s conception of sympathy has some
                        social aspect to it. That is, an actor must judge “the propriety or merit”
                        of her own emotional acts by taking on the role of an impartial spectator
                        (Broadie 213–14). The impartial spectator is a third person perspective that
                        an individual adopts to determine the “appropriateness” of her behavior in a
                        given situation. The impartial spectator is called upon to avoid the bias
                        that would result in trying to judge one’s own actions. As Welsh notes, “As
                        he [Smith] contemplates the total picture, the figure of the impartial
                        spectator emerges as a means to keep before us the comparisons that need to
                        be made in order to judge ourselves and our actions rightly” (171). So, even
                        when judging their own actions, people are simulating the judgments others
                        would make of them. As Welsh clarifies, “On the whole, friends and the
                        ‘spectator’ whom they begin to embody exert a moderating influence on our
                        passions and rapid responses” (172). The centrality of “approval” in Smith’s
                        conception of sympathy highlights the social nature of behavior
                        modification. It makes sense, then, that contemporary models of emotion
                        regulation would come to consider the role of social pressures and
                        relationships as well. </p>
                  <p>Indeed, while most cognitive neuroscientific work has considered
                        intrapersonal features of emotion regulation (focus on self), newer research
                        examines interpersonal emotion regulation, or the role others play in the
                        expression and management of emotions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ironically, this is a moment where affect scientists are now catching
                            up to what literary scholars of affect have emphasized for some time,
                            given their grounding in the works of philosophers like Hume and Smith.
                            As Favret notes, Romantic scholars like Pinch have thought about passion
                            for some time as “a feeling operating between and among individuals, not
                            emanating from some private interiorized zone but from forms of social
                            and textual circulation” (1162). For more on the contagious role of
                            emotion in the period, see Pinch.</note> Zaki and Williams emphasize
                        that interpersonal regulation “may be the rule, not the exception,”
                        suggesting that “individuals often attempt to regulate others’ emotions
                        through empathic, supportive, and prosocial behaviors” (803). Specifically,
                        intrinsic interpersonal regulation occurs when people try to regulate
                            <emph>themselves </emph>through social contact; extrinsic interpersonal
                        regulation occurs when people try to regulate the emotions of
                            <emph>others</emph>. A response-dependent process requires that another
                        person respond with supportive feedback; a response-independent process
                        regulates emotion regardless of the feedback received. These distinctions
                        highlight the influence others can have on one’s own regulation. While the
                        use of intrinsic interpersonal regulation and of response-dependent
                        processes makes people vulnerable (i.e., the results of their emotion
                        regulation efforts are “in the hands” of others), there are potentially
                        valuable rewards to their selection. </p>
                  <p>Given these insights, we could modify Bonnano and Burton’s regulatory
                        flexibility by incorporating social considerations, influenced by
                        long-standing discussions of the social nature of sympathy and feeling. In
                        fact, they anticipated the need for such modifications, arguing that social
                        feedback would reflect cultural values and result in social costs or
                        benefits (603). In thinking about responsiveness to feedback, the success of
                        a regulation strategy might be driven by how those one values or fears have
                        responded. Likewise, context sensitivity and repertoire could be increased
                        by recruiting the resources and aid of others. However, the enhancement of
                        regulatory flexibility through social interactions may also depend upon
                        individual or relational differences (i.e., the intensity and length of a
                            relationship).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, Flores and
                            Berenbaum have found that the social regulation of emotion is influenced
                            by the desire someone has for emotional closeness. The desire for
                            emotional closeness might correlate with our familiarity with others,
                            our perceived similarity with others, and the personal experiences we
                            have had reaching out to others.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In perhaps the strongest contemporary argument for the primacy of
                        interpersonal affect dynamics, Butler argues that interactions with others
                        invariably involve the modulation of emotions, utilizing the concept of
                        contagion and “coconstruction of emotional meaning” to highlight the
                        inextricable link between one’s emotional experiences and those of others
                            (337).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more on classic and
                            contemporary conversations about contagion, see Pinch or Massumi.</note>
                        The social baseline model takes this social regulation of emotion as the
                        default in humans and other animals (Coan 618). Coan argues that
                        self-regulating emotion creates significant cognitive load, inherently
                        limiting people’s ability to negotiate successfully their own emotions. In
                        effect, the social regulation of emotion is cognitively “easier,” which
                        suggests “why individuals tend to invest less effort in self-regulation in
                        the presence of relational partners” (619). This aligns with affect
                        theorists Seigworth and Gregg, who argue, “At once intimate and
                        interpersonal, affect <emph>accumulates</emph> across both relatedness and
                        interruptions in relatedness,” and that affect “travers[es] the ebb and flow
                        of intensities that pass between ‘bodies,’” noting that these bodies
                        “reciprocate or co-participate in the passages of affect” (2). Combining
                        historical conceptions of the social in the operation of sympathy, the
                        debates of affect theorists about force relations, and recent integration of
                        the social in psychological processes of emotion regulation, it seems safe
                        to assume the supremacy of the social when managing and performing
                        affect-emotion. </p>
                  <p>Finally, recent psychological research empirically echoes the moral
                        philosophical idea that not only may social regulation be the default in
                        managing emotion, but that people are aware of the importance of negotiating
                        these exchanges. Cheung, Gardner, and Anderson found that people
                        strategically consider which friends or partners would be most effective at
                        helping them regulate specific emotional experiences. Moreover, their
                        research shows that individuals who have more diversified emotional
                        relationships (i.e., having a friend you go to when you are sad, another for
                        when you are mad, etc.) are healthier. The number of different kinds of
                        “emotionships” is more important for effective SER than the sheer quantity
                        of emotionships. These findings extend the earlier work of Coan, who argued
                        that, “prior experience with a close relational partner may provide a form
                        of ‘regulatory capital’ in the face of emotional stressor[s]” (616). The
                        importance of diversification in emotionships echoes the concept of a
                        diverse repertoire in Bonnano and Burton’s model of regulatory flexibility
                        and suggests a place to synthesize models of emotion regulation focused on
                        individual cognitive processes with the role of interpersonal affect
                        dynamics.</p>
                  <p>Because the empirical work examining interpersonal affect dynamics is
                        constrained to artificial lab environments, and the application to a rich,
                        complex, real-world engagement of SER is limited, using an interdisciplinary
                        lens provides the ability to consider SER <foreign>in situ</foreign>. Zaki
                        and Williams agree, arguing that questions of emotion regulation “may
                        require drawing from domains far afield from typical experimental psychology
                        but will also undoubtedly enrich our understanding of interpersonal
                        regulation in unanticipated ways” (808). Enter a consideration of the
                        dynamics of SER in <title level="m">De Monfort</title>, grounded in
                        Baillie’s concept of sympathetic curiosity, which itself was influenced by
                        the socio-scientific conversations of her day. In the following, we use an
                        interdisciplinary lens for a literary analysis highlighting exchanges
                        between the siblings in <title level="m">De Monfort </title>to inform
                        notions of SER.</p>
                  <p>Baillie’s foundational concept of sympathetic curiosity functions entirely
                        within a social context. Though everyone is imparted with this primary
                        “propensity,” it is only when engaging with others that people see it at
                        work. This “best instructor” is exercised through people’s interactions with
                        those around them, because of the need to “read” what others are feeling,
                        consider how they feel about that, and imagine how they might feel
                        themselves in that situation. In the following section, we highlight aspects

                            Monfort</title> that speak to how we envision future investigations into
                        SER models. Specifically, we explore moments that highlight both the
                        functioning and dysfunctioning of SER with an eye towards identifying those
                        areas that are not currently modeled within constrained empirical
                        investigations. We see Baillie’s program of work as particularly well-suited
                        to highlight these areas of SER given the precise and systematic,
                        one-emotion-at-a-time approach she uses, which is in line with both the
                        method taken in eighteenth-century medical investigations and with
                        twenty-first-century methodologies for exploring the neurocircuitry of
                        emotion (LeDoux 376).</p>

                  <head>Reading Social Contagion in <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
                  </head>
                  <p>Inherent in sympathetic curiosity is an interaction among self and others to
                        assess what another person feels and then adjust one’s own reactions in
                        light of that assessment. Below, we have two goals: 1) to provide converging
                        evidence from a literary text to socio-cognitive models of emotion
                        regulation (a kind of interdisciplinary “replication”); and 2) to
                        demonstrate areas of SER not yet recognized in empirical studies. <title level="m">De Monfort</title> is Baillie’s tragedy about the “passion” of
                        hatred and was the final play in her 1798 collection. <title level="m">De
                            Monfort </title>traces the protagonist’s attempts to escape his hatred
                        of his childhood nemesis Rezenvelt. As the tragedy progresses, others,
                        especially his sister, Jane, try to help him come to terms with his hatred
                        and redirect it, in the end to little avail. When De Monfort erroneously
                        hears that Jane and Rezenvelt are secretly lovers, he vows revenge by
                        following Rezenvelt on his ride through the forest, murdering him in a fit
                        of rage.</p>
                  <p>As we’ve noted, interpersonal regulation happens primarily through our
                        closest social ties; for De Monfort, this is with his sister Jane. From the
                        first scene, host Jerome and manservant Manuel reference the love Jane has
                        for her brother. Manuel notes that it is his loyalty to her that keeps him
                        by De Monfort’s side: “She would have griev’ed if I had left my Lord”
                        (1.1.59). The reader also learn that De Monfort left without telling Jane,
                        and that Manuel is concerned that “it would afflict her much” (1.1.63). Here
                        we have evidence that the siblings’ relationship is one of support and
                        regulation, the one benefiting from the other.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For a psychological consideration of this dynamic, see
                            Butler; for the literary-historical perspective of the dynamic, see
                            Pinch. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jane and De Monfort’s interdependency is further highlighted when Jane
                        arrives in town in search of her brother. She visits the Frebergs first,
                        confirming that De Monfort is in town. After some pleasantries, Count
                        Freberg tells Jane he finds De Monfort “well, but joyless” (2.1.59). Jane
                        resists that characterization by suggesting that this is just her brother’s
                        temperament, noting that usually his mind “opens not, but with the thrilling
                        touch / Of some strong-string o’the sudden press’d” (2.1.60–62). Yet, she
                        acknowledges that he is “a man in grief,” though no one seems aware of the
                        cause (2.1.66). This exchange demonstrates that SER can be accomplished
                        outside of oneself, without one’s knowledge, as others close to us do the
                        work of presenting our affect in socially acceptable terms. In other words,
                        regulation occurs with little to no cognitive and emotional costs for the
                        person described. While current models of SER describe how a person pulls
                        the resources of another to engage in self-regulation, they are limited to
                        regulation occurring in the physical presence of others. In contrast, we
                        highlight what we see as a kind of de-facto social emotion regulation that
                        has not yet been considered. Attention to Baillie’s systematic engagement
                        with emotion over time (rather than constrained within a moment of the
                        emotion in empirical studies) suggests that emotion regulation is not as
                        encapsulated as current models have suggested.</p>
                  <p>Jane recognizes that De Monfort’s emotional state is dependent on what Zaki
                        and Williams have called intrinsic interpersonal regulation. So, even though
                        whatever De Monfort has done thus far to try and regulate himself has not
                        worked, Jane is concerned that her presence would make things even worse,
                        and thus she initially declines Count Freberg’s invitation to stay for the
                        ball: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>JANE. Here he will find all that can woo the heart</l>
                           <l>To joy and sweet forgetfulness of pain;</l>
                           <l>The sight of me would wake his feeling mind . . . (2.1.84–86)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Jane signals two things about De Monfort’s emotional
                        prospects. First, she thinks he can find the necessary interpersonal
                        regulation to “woo his heart” from whatever “grief” he might have. Second,
                        she also indicates that her presence would “wake” him to things he might do
                        well to put aside. In both cases, Jane recognizes the intimate realities of
                        De Monfort’s “feeling mind,” addressing the fact that others are key to his
                        own regulation and noting she has particular effects on it. Here we see the
                        extent of Jane’s insight into De Monfort’s emotion regulation strategies and
                        her own role in them. In other words, she is a key emotionship for how her
                        brother engages with others in the world, and she knows it.</p>
                  <p>The most vivid example of the emotional impact both siblings have on each
                        other happens during the Frebergs’ masked ball, and the reader learns the
                        extent to which De Monfort values Jane above all people in his life.
                        Literary critics like Hoeveler and Kim have noted the powerful erotic and
                        mythic qualities of the siblings’ relationship.<note place="foot" resp="editors">While critics like Hoeveler and Kim highlight either the
                            incestuous erotics or the biblical echoes of De Monfort and Jane’s
                            relationship, we have used the dynamic they describe to emphasize the
                            intimate and highly influential nature of their relationship. </note>
                        For De Monfort, in fact, this is the only relationship that provides him
                        with any desire or willingness to reveal his feelings of hatred. Equally
                        significant, this appears to be the one relationship that inspires feelings
                        other than despair, anger, sullenness, or hatred. This highlights De
                        Monfort’s limited emotionships, a limitation that Cheung et al. associate
                        with lower well-being as illustrated by De Monfort’s growing anxiety and
                        depression.</p>
                  <p>When Jane first appears at the ball, she disguises herself, leaving De
                        Monfort unaware that he is speaking to his sister. They begin a conversation
                        about siblings and the fact that the person she seeks is “heedless of [her]
                        pain,” having “forsaken” her (2.1.210). As the conversation continues and De
                        Monfort talks about his sister to someone he thinks is a stranger, he
                        regulates himself <emph>out of </emph>hatred for Rezenvelt and
                            <emph>into</emph> his passionate feelings for Jane. Even the mere idea
                        of Jane pulls him out of his internal struggle. When the disguised Jane
                        notes that perhaps “All sisters are not to the soul entwin’d / With equal
                        band,” suggesting that his sister has not “Weep’d for thee, cheer’d thee,
                        shar’d thy weal and woe / As I have done for him” (2.1.222–23), De Monfort
                        immediately protests. Though gloomy up to this point, he becomes loquacious
                        when speaking about his sister: <quote>
                        <lg>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> He continues, exclaiming: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>DE MON. —But she of whom I speak</l>
                           <l>Is the dear sister of my earliest love;</l>
                           <l>In noble virtuous worth to none a second (2.1.229–31)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> We see for the first time in the play, the longest
                        exchange De Monfort has with anyone aside from his soliloquies about his
                        angst and rage, and it is about Jane.</p>
                  <p>For De Monfort, Jane functions as a central vehicle for self-regulation, and
                        though this exchange is structured around <emph>the idea of</emph> Jane
                        rather than an actual conversation with Jane, it pries open a different
                        possibility for De Monfort’s emotional terrain. Up to this point De Monfort
                        has either talked about his hatred for Rezenvelt or his feelings of anguish
                        at having to be around him, and for most of the rest of the play the stage
                        directions describing De Monfort’s physical actions echo words like
                        “agitation,” “angrily,” “impatiently” “distractedly,” “contemptuously,” and
                        “disordered” (313, 315, 317, 318, 326, 328). Yet, the idea of Jane coaxes
                        feelings like “eagerly” or “affectionately” out of De Monfort (327, 334).
                        The shift in De Monfort’s affect demonstrates that the memories of one’s
                        social emotion relationships may have the power to motivate our regulation
                        efforts when context requires what seems like intrapersonal regulation. In
                        other words, even when doing regulation work on their own, people may
                        actually be invoking the social relationships they have with others to
                        accomplish this work.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Remember our
                            previous discussion of Smith’s impartial spectator here as an earlier
                            consideration of the role others play in our modification of emotional
                            displays, even when we must invoke them in our imagination. </note>
                        Therefore, along with suggesting that SER models incorporate actions taken
                        on one’s behalf (de-facto social emotion regulation), we also argue that the
                        activation of memories of others may enhance one’s intrapersonal regulation
                        repertoire and motivations, what we consider an “imaginary social emotion
                            regulation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Fridlund and Russell argue
                            the same, noting, “we often imagine that others are present when they
                            are not” and that the imaginary audience can trigger facial expressions
                            of emotion (312).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jane is confident that she can regulate her brother’s emotions regardless of
                        what they are. In pleading with De Monfort to share the source of his
                        distress, Jane assures him that she will help him successfully wrestle with
                        his feelings. When De Monfort exclaims that his hatred “will not pass away:
                        ‘twill haunt me still,” Jane states that she will “haunt thee too” and that
                        she will “wrestle darkling with the fiend” and “o’ercome it” (2.2.52–56).
                        Jane explicitly offers to take on the emotion regulation work for her
                        brother convinced of her ability to do so. De Monfort, fearful and ashamed
                        of disappointing his sister, is motivated to control his expression of
                            hatred.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Emotion regulation motivated by
                            shame and fear are described in both Tomkins and Crozier. </note> We
                        know that this is an established dynamic, as Jane acknowledges to Freburg
                        that she has been De Monfort’s constant companion since early childhood and
                        the death of their parents. After De Monfort reveals his hatred for
                        Rezenvelt, Jane bemoans the fact that she was not present earlier to help
                        him. She says she came to him immediately when she discovered his duress,
                        telling him, “I heard a secret whisper, and resolv’d / Upon the instant to
                        return to thee” (2.2.143–44). She also blames herself for not being able to
                        allay her brother’s feelings sooner, exclaiming, “These absent months, have
                        brought us all this woe. / Had I remained with thee it had not been”
                        (2.2.148–49). We see that Jane thinks that if she had not left him alone, De
                        Monfort would not have dueled with Rezenvelt nor have the kind of saturated
                        hatred that now seems permanent.</p>
                  <p>In these exchanges it is also important to note that De Monfort is aware of
                        the critical role Jane plays in his emotional interactions with the world.
                        He hesitates to admit the cause of the change in his affect because he is
                        aware of the danger of losing his sister’s admiration and guidance. De
                        Monfort fears Jane’s reaction to his confession and indicates that when he
                        reveals the truth, “thou wilt despise me” (2.2.78). In other words, De
                        Monfort understands better than Jane that he is not the person she is
                        convinced he is; in this case, De Monfort knows the limitations of his
                        emotionship with Jane and tries not to disillusion her. Though Jane has
                        promised to listen to and support him, when he reveals his hatred, the
                        reader finds that he was correct and that she is startled at the vehemence
                        of it. She cannot understand how her brother hates a man who mercifully did
                        not kill him when they dueled and: <quote>
                        <lg>

                     </quote> Although Jane understands her influence over her brother,
                        she is mistaken about her image of him and about her ability to shift his
                        feelings of hatred. More important, this moment illustrates that De Monfort
                        is more aware of the nature of their emotionship than is Jane. When he
                        finally expresses the depth of his hatred, she rejects his feelings and who
                        he is at that moment, “De Monfort, this is fiend-like, frightful, terrible!”
                        and wonders “could in thy breast such horrid tempest wake / Who are thyself
                        his fellow?” (2.2.94, 97–98).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In Jane’s
                            reaction to De Monfort’s revelation of hatred, we perhaps see an example
                            of Stauffer’s analysis of anger as unsympathetic and frightening.

                  <p>Baillie’s careful dissection of an intense sibling relationship allows us to
                        see the limitations and multi-dimensionality of SER at work. The insights we
                        derive from this analysis suggest that models of SER should take into
                        consideration the work people do to avoid disrupting the relationships they
                        depend upon. In other words, just as regulatory flexibility models of
                        emotion break intrapersonal regulation into context sensitivity, repertoire,
                        and feedback, SER models could also be broken down into these components. In
                        addition to examining how people engage in the act of regulation with
                        others, we should also consider the meta-knowledge they have about who is
                        most appropriate to help them regulate certain kinds of emotions and how to
                        read the feedback they are getting from others during this work. We might
                        also consider the type of relationships that are more or less effective to
                        incorporate into people’s regulation strategies.</p>
                  <p>Again, looking at the intensity of SER highlights these issues. When De
                        Monfort finally confesses his hatred to Jane, we see Jane’s direct attempts
                        to regulate his emotional state. He asks his sister, “What shall I do?”
                        (2.2.196). Importantly, Baillie provides the reader with the stage direction
                        that De Monfort asks this “affectionately,” suggesting that he will do his
                        best to listen to her and that she will offer him strategies he cannot think
                        of himself. Jane implores him to “Repel the hideous foe. / Be great; be
                        valiant” (2.2.200). The force of Jane’s command is highlighted as she
                        responds to his hesitation, exclaiming, “Thou cans’t, thou may’st, thou
                        wilt. / We shall not part till I have turn’d thy soul” (2.2.205–06). </p>
                  <p>At this moment, Jane has stepped in to deliberately control De Monfort’s
                        emotional regulation attempts, a strong vision of the possibilities of SER.
                        Here, then, we note that, at least initially, De Monfort is willing to be
                        guided by Jane. She is convinced about her ability to affect change in her
                        brother as she says: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>JANE. Come to my closet; free from all intrusion,</l>
                           <l>I’ll school thee there; and thou again shalt be</l>
                           <l>My willing pupil, and my gen’rous friend; (2.2.210–13)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> All agency for emotion regulation is now laid upon Jane’s
                        shoulders as De Monfort relents, saying “Do as thou wilt; / I will not
                        grieve thee more” (2.2.216).</p>
                  <p>Although De Monfort does not think himself capable of shifting his feelings,
                        at Jane’s convincing he does calm himself enough to try to engage the
                        strategies she provides. At the beginning of Act III, the reader sees De
                        Monfort reading books Jane provides for his education and distraction. She
                        at first seems pleased, stating that in reading the Bible, De Monfort’s
                        “willing mind has been right well employ’d” and hopes that in this
                        meditation, his “heart warm[s] at the fair display / Of peace and concord
                        and forgiving love” (3.1.2–3). However, while De Monfort’s anger has been
                        ameliorated, he explains to her that it is a hard struggle, grounded in
                        childhood, and that he still harbors hatred toward Rezenvelt. He notes that
                        “nature herself doth lift her voice aloud, / And cries, it is impossible!”
                        to really do what Jane asks and have him “love thine enemy” (3.1.26–27,
                            15).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The powerlessness De Monfort
                            expresses here aligns with Tomkins’ ideas about affective control. He
                            argues, “affective responses seem to the individual to be aroused easily
                            by factors over which he has little control, with difficulty by factors
                            which he <emph>can</emph> control and to endure for periods of time
                            which he controls only with great difficulty if at all” (62).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That De Monfort is able to name and reflect upon the emotion with which he is
                        struggling is a small emotion regulation success (he is capable of assessing
                        feedback here). However, according to Baillie’s theory about the evolution
                        of hatred, it may be “too late” for Jane’s attempts at emotion regulation to
                        “cure” her brother.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Baillie’s sense that it
                            is “too late” in the development of hatred foreshadows the description
                            of “late-blooming” anger-come-hatred episodes, when the anger is at its
                            most intense in the second half of the arc (Heylen et al. 175).</note>
                        Indeed, Baillie notes that hatred “aided by circumstances of little
                        importance, grows at last into such antipathy and personal disgust as makes
                        him who entertains it, feel, in the presence of him who is the object of it,
                        a degree of torment and restlessness which is insufferable” (“Introductory
                        Discourse” 108). Jane encourages De Monfort to keep trying, asking, “And
                        canst thou do no more for love of heaven?” (3.1.30). Again, we see that De
                        Monfort’s attempts at emotion regulation are being guided almost solely
                        through his relationship with Jane as he responds that “But this, my Jane,
                        I’ll do for love of thee” (3.1.33). He offers to apologize to Rezenvelt but
                        anticipates that the event will cause him (De Monfort) great pain. He asks
                        Jane, “Will it suffice thee? More than this I cannot” (3.1.52). Jane accepts
                        this offer, perhaps seeing it as the beginning of more to come, saying, “I
                        hop’d a better change, and still will hope” (3.1.55). Jane’s attempts at
                        regulating De Monfort have gotten him to a point not reached earlier in the
                        play, but because this was not emotional work of his own, De Monfort seems
                        ill prepared to succeed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Heylen et al.
                            found that “late-blooming” anger activates emotion regulation strategies
                            such as catastrophizing and rumination, strategies not associated with
                            regulation success. This research suggests that De Monfort would be
                            “stuck” with these strategies if not for his sister’s
                        invention.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When De Monfort agrees to reconcile with Rezenvelt, the reader sees him
                        prepared to use the strategies Jane provides. However, because they are not
                        his own, he does not succeed. While awaiting Rezenvelt, De Monfort expresses
                        unease, perhaps sensing his future failure: “This morning is oppressive,
                        warm, and heavy: / There hangs a foggy closeness in the air;” (3.1.118–19).
                        Despite these misgivings, De Monfort and Rezenvelt’s exchange starts off
                        well enough. De Monfort tells Rezenvelt that in his “wayward moods” he has
                        “too oft forgot the due regard / Your rank and talents claim” (3.1.171–73).
                        De Monfort offers Rezenvelt his hand “with dignity” and says, “I will not
                        offer you an hand of concord,” but he will “declare” that his “spared life”
                        is owed to Rezenvelt’s “forbearance” (3.1.187, 190–92). This incomplete yet
                        honest and effortful apology seems to satisfy Jane, who we are told, “smiles
                        with great approbation” (345). But when Rezenvelt demands an embrace,
                        something more than Jane has schooled De Monfort to give, things take a turn
                        for the worst. A handshake was in the script practiced by the siblings; an
                        embrace would require greater emotion regulation progress than Jane has been
                        able to achieve. </p>
                  <p>Illustrated in these moments is the notion that although emotions can be
                        regulated by others, the regulated individual may not benefit beyond the
                        initial intervention.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This inability to
                            benefit from others may be due to “a residual form of the affect which
                            is at once heightened, distorted, and chronic and which is severely
                            punitive” (Tomkins 69).</note> In other words, his or her own regulatory
                        flexibility has not been expanded but only temporarily supported. So
                        although the social baseline theory would argue that SER is the default
                        method for dealing with emotions, it is insufficient for developing
                        additional emotion regulation skills that could be called upon in future
                        exchanges. We noted that the thought of one’s social emotionships would
                        animate self-regulation, and that certainly rings true in this sibling
                        dynamic. But here we also see that Baillie identifies a clarification for
                        this model. Although SER motivates the use of strategies one is already able
                        to perform, it is insufficient to lead to the development of
                            <emph>new</emph> regulation strategies that would permanently expand
                        one’s own repertoire; at best, they are only temporarily borrowed. Our
                        analysis of Baillie’s play suggests this limitation could be especially
                        problematic with an intractable passion like hatred.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the failed apology, Baillie’s stage directions indicate that
                        Jane and De Monfort “look expressively to one another, without speaking”
                        (347). This silent look is the last time both siblings are in contact with
                        each other until after De Monfort has murdered Rezenvelt. When they are
                        reunited, De Monfort makes one last attempt to regulate on behalf of his
                        sister saying: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>DE MON. I thought to sink in abject wretchedness:</l>
                           <l>But for thy sake I’ll rouse my manhood up,</l>
                           <l>And meet it bravely; no unseemly weakness, (5.2.76–78)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> The last time Jane sees De Monfort alive he “endeavors to
                        suppress his feelings” (378). Ultimately, without his sister, De Monfort is
                        unable to face his end “proudly,” and he dies from madness. Rezenvelt’s
                        murder and De Monfort’s breakdown and death at the end of the play occur in
                        Jane’s absence, indicating that De Monfort has become chronically dependent
                        upon her for regulation, and that perhaps her constraining influence has
                        exacerbated his hatred.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Kim warns about
                            “the danger of being unveiled” (722). She notes that in De Monfort’s
                            case it was others’ “curiosity” and “reckless seizing and laying bare of
                            the passion [that] proves fatal” and that “the revelation divests De
                            Monfort of his ennobling shroud of mysterious suffering and forces him
                            to deal openly with a passion he cannot manage” (721). This identifies a
                            dangerous limitation, one not yet incorporated into SER
                        models.</note>

                  <p>Overall, while we see key aspects of current SER models in the sibling
                        exchanges highlighted in our analysis, we emphasize aspects of these
                        interactions that are not yet incorporated fully into those models. First,
                        we note that with intense relationships, SER work can be carried out through
                        de-facto social emotion regulation on the part of one person for another.
                        Similarly, imagining the relationships one has with others can motivate the
                        emotion regulation strategies one selects. However, we also suggest that
                        when SER work is conducted on behalf of another person, this limits the
                        opportunities for learning and development. As we see with De Monfort, by
                        relinquishing responsibility for his emotion regulation work to Jane, he is
                        unable to develop and expand his regulatory flexibility. His ability to
                        engage in context sensitivity has not grown, his repertoire of strategies
                        has not expanded, and he has not become more responsive to feedback from
                        those around him. Although Coan argues that SER is the default because it is
                        cognitively easier, there are costs to outsourcing emotion regulation work.
                        Current models of SER should consider these costs and explore the limiting
                        effect they may have on the development of regulatory flexibility.</p>
                  <p>We also propose these costs exist along a continuum depending upon the
                        intensity and nature of the emotionship. In other words, with the kind of
                        intense sibling relationship we see between De Monfort and Jane, the effort
                        of conducting SER is one-sided, with less concern about damaging or
                        weakening the relationship. In contrast, if a relationship is not as
                        established, SER work may require more cognitive control in both parties,
                        thus allowing some opportunities for the development of new emotion
                        regulation strategies and skills. For example, De Monfort is able to stop
                        reading the room because the duration, constancy, and strength of their
                        relationship allow Jane to do that work for him without endangering it.</p>
                  <p>More broadly, we offer this integrated analysis of Baillie’s play and the
                        interactions of contemporary socio-cognitive models as an example of how an
                        interdisciplinary approach to affect studies can develop productive
                        conversations across disciplines. We are compelled by the arguments that
                        conversations mired in a consideration of what affect is keep us from
                        advancing our understanding of how affect works.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As Mesquita et al. argue, “By focusing on cultural
                            construction of emotion, we shift the focus toward how people from
                            different cultures ‘do’ emotions and away from which emotions they
                            ‘have’” (31).</note> Presenting the language and ideas of emotion
                        regulation as a way to think about the “yet-ness” of affect could open up
                        new areas of exploration in affect studies that move beyond either/or
                        conversations about cognition versus the body that have been the focus of
                        moral philosophers like Hume and Smith and contemporary scholars like
                        Nussbaum and Solomon (Seigworth and Gregg 3). In fact, interpreting the
                        early work of Tomkins alongside those of contemporary affect scientists such
                        as Fridland and Russell, Bonnano and Burton, and Zaki and Williams
                        emphasizes the problem with a potential “new-wave dualism” seen in the
                        framing of affect as “body” and cognition as “mind.” We see our
                        interdisciplinary exploration and integration as fitting with Leys’ call for
                        taking a more ethical and nuanced approach to the incorporation of
                        experimental findings in the building of affect theories.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Favret and Zunshine emphasize the tension between
                            wanting to use scientific studies and also fearing this incursion in
                            literary studies.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We believe our approach, perhaps more demanding and painstakingly slower, is
                        one that invites and requires scholars not only to read the works published
                        in each of their fields, but also to talk to and learn from each other as
                        they try to understand and negotiate points of similarity and difference.
                        Our approach also avoids the danger of consciously or unconsciously creating
                        “paradoxes where there [are] none” (Leys 467). Thus, literary scholars and
                        cognitive psychologists (for example) can work together to create an
                        understanding of human cognition, affect, emotion, and literature that would
                        not be built in isolation. Invoking Zunshine’s metaphor of the <title level="m">bricoleur</title>, we argue that this messy merging and
                        blurring will invite new “bloom-spaces” that encompass both established
                        disciplinary strongholds and yet to be imagined new ones (Seigworth and
                        Gregg 9). As Zunshine has called literary theorists into a conversation with
                        the cognitive scientists, we ask cognitive scientists to engage with fellow
                        humanists so that the exchange becomes bi- or multi- directional, generating
                        more enriching conversations about the nature of human behaviors and
                        cultures.</p>

               <p rend="noCount"> This essay argues that recent criticism in affect theory
                    emphasizing the “strictly biological portion of emotion” offers a new
                    interpretive window into a much-neglected Gothic novel by an important though
                    still relatively unknown writer. Its major claim is that <title level="m">Secresy</title>’s emphasis on bodiliness, the extent to which characters
                    share and absorb the same affective environment, undercuts important critical
                    accounts of the novel—by Terry Castle, Patricia Cove, Julia Wright, and
                    others—which claim that each of its characters occupies his or her own
                    inalienable rhetorical or “generic” world to which the other characters have
                    little or no access. </p>

               <p>In the final volume of Eliza Fenwick’s 1795 novel <title level="m">Secresy; or,
                        The Ruin on the Rock</title>, Clement Montgomery, a ne’er-do-well dandy who
                    has left his lover Sibella Valmont in the lurch, offers one morning to sell a
                    miniature portrait of her (whose original he painted) to one of her richer, more
                    genteel suitors, the Lord Filmar. Filmar “positively refuse[s] to accept” the
                    gift, thanks to a “double dose of prudence” on his part. (At this point in the
                    novel, Filmar has recently broken into Valmont Castle in a botched attempt to
                    kidnap Sibella, an heiress expecting £6,000 a year. To keep the miniature on his
                    person would therefore be to possess incriminating evidence.) Yet the lord
                    recounts that, even as he “positively refuse[s]” it, his “fingers had a kind of
                    tremulous impulse towards the picture” (Fenwick 299). By <emph>impulse
                    </emph>Filmar means a “[s]udden or involuntary inclination or tendency to act,
                    without premeditation or reflection” (“impulse”). In itself his comment is
                    probably unremarkable: Filmar simply notices his lordly fingers trembling toward
                    the portrait of a woman he knows little about save that she has a fortune and he
                    wants it. But considered in the context of the entire novel, this tiny incident
                    gains special significance. </p>
               <p>Characters in <title level="m">Secresy </title>tend to be affected
                    non-cognitively by intensities emanating from nearby objects and bodies.
                    Caroline Ashburn, for instance, denied entrance to Valmont Castle, secures the
                    permission of its proprietor, the honorable George Valmont, to correspond with
                    his niece Sibella whom Valmont keeps secluded within his estate. Caroline
                    rightly predicts, albeit ironically, that “the spirit of . . . affection
                    breathed” into her letters will ultimately “waft down” the “drawbridges” of the
                    castle and “disenchant . . . [Sibella] from the all-powerful spell” of her
                    uncle’s “authority” (Fenwick 39). Lord Filmar declares that a “square piece of
                    paper” on which he has written, “in large characters £6000 <foreign>per
                        annum</foreign>, placed . . . exactly opposite” him, will act as “a charm of
                    infinite value” to goad him into his kidnapping scheme (216). In one of her
                    letters to Caroline, Sibella insists that if the truant Clement would write her
                    a note with “only three words, ‘<emph>Bless my Sibella</emph>;’ . . . [she] will
                    wear it next . . . [to her] heart—a charm to hold disease and foreboding at
                    defiance” (256–57). These apparently trivial statements about “charming”
                    letters, notes, and pictures form part of a larger pattern in the novel whereby
                    the sensibilities of characters are directed (or described as if they are
                    directed) by the intensities enfolded in and emanating from material bodies and
                    objects. The physical signs of feeling—tears, sighs, faintness—and hence the
                    psychological states they presumably indicate are effectively “caught” from
                    physical phenomena in shared spaces. The men and women in <title level="m">Secresy</title> are thus little more than bodies adrift in an atmosphere
                    full of viral affect. It is, of course, nothing new to say that a novel
                    published in the 1790s denies its characters the full privileges of the
                    autonomous Enlightenment subject. But <title level="m">Secresy
                    </title>dramatizes the impersonality of emotion in ways and to extents arguably
                    unparalleled among novels of its time. One could say that it is a text
                    tailor-made for the application of affect theory. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Secresy </title>is a relatively slim, three-volume epistolary
                    novel with a somewhat convoluted plot. The tyrannical gentleman George Valmont
                    is scorned by a lady at an early age and grows to resent the prerogatives of
                    high society. He raises his niece Sibella as his daughter and his illegitimate
                    son Clement as the adopted son of poor laborers. Valmont secludes the two on his
                    estate for nearly all their lives, insists that they think of one another as
                    brother and sister, sees to their education, and exacts unflinching obedience
                    from both. All the while, his real intention is to unite them in marriage.
                    Sibella possesses an independent fortune and is the rightful heir to Valmont
                    estate (though her uncle leads her to believe she is penniless). Valmont keeps
                    her docile and tractable so that she will stay at home and fall in love with
                    Clement, his natural son, thus securing for Clement both the estate and the
                    independent fortune of its heiress—a veritable “economic powerhouse” (Cannon
                    543). Unfortunately for Valmont, all goes awry. Sibella and Clement fall in love
                    prematurely and consummate their relationship in secret, out of wedlock (after
                    which point Sibella fondly considers Clement her “husband”). Valmont, ignorant
                    of the consummation, sends his nineteen-year-old son Clement out into the world
                    as a kind of test to ensure that he is sufficiently misanthropic. But Clement
                    becomes a dissipated rake, enamored with the very high society that Valmont
                    intended he should hold in contempt. Angered, Valmont gives Clement £500 and
                    tells him to earn his living in London. Since Clement has developed an aversion
                    to work and a love of gambling, he squanders the money and ends up marrying
                    Caroline Ashburn’s wealthy, materialistic, and pretentious mother (disregarding
                    his unofficial “marriage” to Sibella). Meanwhile, after Valmont rejects the
                    proposed aristocratic marriage of his niece to Lord Filmar, the latter decides
                    to kidnap Sibella “whether her uncle pleases or not” (Fenwick 183). His first
                    kidnapping attempt is thwarted by the presence of Arthur Murden, a gentleman
                    sneaking about the castle disguised as a hermit. Murden, professedly in love
                    with Sibella for reasons other than her money, manages to rescue her from
                    Valmont castle only to lose her to Filmar at a nearby inn. Having absconded with
                    the rescued heiress, Filmar soon realizes that she is pregnant with Clement’s
                    child and therefore wants nothing to do with her. He returns her to her friend
                    Caroline. Murden eventually dies in Sibella’s arms. Sibella gives birth to a
                    stillborn child and dies herself shortly thereafter. </p>
               <p>Though having gone through four editions and received generally favorable reviews
                    in its time, the novel was more or less relegated to the shadows of literary
                    history until it became a Broadview Press book in 1994 edited by Isobel Grundy.
                    Since then a wide range of articles and book chapters have been devoted to it,
                    though the novel remains understudied and relatively unknown. Critics have
                    studied <title level="m">Secresy </title>as a gothic, Jacobin, and/or radically
                    feminist novel concerned variously with female education, motherhood and
                    childbirth, marriage laws, British India, female desire and sexuality, madness,
                    and contemporary medicine.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Bunnell; Mandell; Snow;

                    primarily interested in a strain of criticism that views its characters as
                    rhetorically or psychologically hyper-compartmentalized. Julia Wright has
                    claimed that each major character in the novel is locked in her own fictional
                    genre and given an inflexible “perspective . . . coded as literary” (Wright
                    154). Caroline Ashburn, for instance, speaks in the general rhetorical mode of
                    didactic fiction. She “cannot understand” the intense passions of someone like
                    Arthur Murden (who is the quintessential man of feeling), and so she claims that
                    he is excessively “romantic” in the Johnsonian senses of “wild,” “false,”
                    “fanciful” (Wright 153; Johnson 440). According to Wright, “no one voice” in the
                    text “stands above the rest, secure from critique, contradiction, or generic
                    classification” (154). The “various genres” in <title level="m">Secresy</title>
                    “do not mingle, but collide to mark separations in cultural perspectives” (153).
                    Patricia Cove likewise claims that the sensibilities of main characters are
                    discrete and incapable of inter-assimilation. Murden is “Fenwick’s victim of
                    excessive sensibility” and the “object of Caroline’s rational critique of
                    sensibility” (Cove 667). Each character “adhere[s] to opposite value systems”
                    that cannot interpenetrate (678). For Terry Castle, none of this should surprise
                    us: early female fiction was full of examples of “psychic compartmentalization,”
                    the “splitting up of emotional possibilities into different characters,” a sort
                    of “schizoid reductionism” (Castle 140). Thus Wright, Cove, and Castle all agree
                    that characters in <title level="m">Secresy</title> are more or less
                    hermetically sealed Theophrastan types who live in isolated emotional and
                    rhetorical worlds. </p>
               <p>I want to suggest that this line of thinking, though reasonable, ignores the
                    novel’s emphasis on bodiliness and how its characters share and absorb the same
                    affective environment—despite what some critics have called the characters’
                    impermeable “generic” differences. The men and women represented in <title level="m">Secrecy</title> are bodies that share spaces with other bodies and
                    act as if according to the causal properties circulating in those spaces. These
                    causal properties move in and out of mental and physical domains. Jonathan
                    Kramnick has observed that eighteenth-century philosophers and literary writers
                    were preoccupied with the possibility that material objects could cause human
                    actions just as much as mental phenomena (like intentions) could. Perhaps
                    “mental states . . . ultimately make their way to the social and physical
                    environment” (6) until that environment absorbs the causal properties of the
                    mental states—until, in other words, “material entities” acquire “some sort of
                    consciousness,” enabling them to have an equal role in determining human
                    behavior (10). Not that the causal properties of objects need to come strictly
                    or directly from human minds and vice versa. Both objects and minds are subject
                    to a shared environment. As Kevis Goodman has more recently argued, late
                    eighteenth-century Scottish medical writing suggested that the “custom, memory,
                    imagination, and discourse” of a given culture clung to bodies within that
                    culture—became “archived” in them (352)—so that bodies “became . . . historical
                    event[s],” “malleable site[s] structured by past and present history” (353). To
                    read <title level="m">Secresy</title> in light of these ideas is to emphasize
                    the extent to which the centered subject was presumed dead long before
                    poststructuralist theory insisted that it was dead.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Rei Terada
                        has implied that the death of the subject was only fully realizable through
                        the discursive efforts of Derrida and de Man. See her <title level="m">Feeling in Theory</title>.</note> It is to see how the novel inherited
                    and inflected certain ideologies operative in the eighteenth century that ran
                    against that century’s more familiar emphasis on “inwardness or subjectivity”
                    (Kramnick 2). </p>
               <p> Most of us are familiar with what is now called the “affective turn” in literary
                    studies. In their 2014 collection of essays, <title level="m">Romanticism and
                        the Emotions</title>, Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha observe that “a renewed
                    interest in the emotions is transforming how we view history, culture, and
                    science” (1). Though affect is closely related to emotion, the two are not one
                    and the same. Affect refers to the “vital” or “visceral forces beneath,
                    alongside, or generally <emph>other than </emph>conscious knowing” that “drive
                    us toward movement . . . thought and extension.” These forces operate at the
                    level of “miniscule or molecular events,” traveling “into and out of the
                    inorganic and non-living, the intracellular divulgences of sinew, tissue, and
                    gut economies, and the vaporous evanescences of the incorporeal (events,
                    atmospheres, feeling-tones)” (Gregg and Seigworth 1–2). Brian Massumi has
                    popularized the term “intensities” within affect studies to refer to forces that
                    are “irreducibly bodily and autonomic,” “asocial,” the stuff of “incipient
                    action and expression” existing in the “superlinear, super-abstract realm of
                    potential” (28, 20, 31). That is, affect is altogether beyond “linear” accounts
                    of mental processes—accounts resembling narratives and relying on notions of
                    cause and effect—as well as beyond the “abstract” emotional states we claim to
                    experience as a result of what is consciously happening around us: for Massumi,
                    when we “register” an emotional “state” we are really “re-register[ing] an
                    already felt state” that is purely bodily and non-conscious (25). Emotions are
                    second-order affect. </p>
               <p>A general consensus among scholars of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    literature and culture is that although “[t]he romantic period and the era that
                    precedes it often appear to us as eras in which people increasingly learned to
                    claim their emotions as the guarantors of their individuality,” these periods
                    simultaneously “characterize[d] feelings as transpersonal,” as “wander[ing]
                    extravagantly from one person to another” like “viruses” (Pinch 3, 1). All
                    supposedly private, indwelling emotions were often thought to originate, even at
                    the turn of the nineteenth century, in shared affective atmospheres, “unformed
                    and unstructured” “resonances independent of content or meaning” (Shouse par. 5,
                    par. 14). And it is precisely because these “resonances” have neither form nor
                    content that they can be transmitted between bodies and subsequently interpreted
                    as the meaningful psychological states we recognize as personal feelings. Hence,
                    I cannot feel precisely what it is you feel—the mental content of your feeling.
                    But both my body and yours interact dynamically within the same affective field,
                    within what Thomas Pfau has called “mood,” which he defines as the “horizon
                    wherein all conscious practice . . . is being transacted, a horizon that
                    therefore can never come into view as such.” This horizon or mood “operate[s] at
                    a level logically anterior to the business of discrete reference,
                    object-representation, and analytic, discrete knowledge” (Pfau 10, 12). In a
                    word, affect comprises the infinitesimal and infinite points of contact between
                    organic and inorganic entities within a shared environment. The work of Pinch
                    and Pfau tends more toward the literary and the historical, whereas critics of
                    the Massumi and Tomkins schools have emphasized the scientific and the
                    theoretical sides of affect—what Donald L. Nathanson has called “the strictly
                    biological portion of emotion”—in such a way as to develop the older, more
                    literary-historical scholarship. One of the main contentions of this essay is
                    that <title level="m">Secresy </title>illuminates the more recent,
                    physiological-theoretical work in affect theory as much as that work illuminates
                    how characters interact in the novel. </p>
               <p>
                  <title level="m">Secresy </title>positions its characters as semi-autonomous
                    bodies that catch, enfold, and circulate affective intensities in shared social
                    spaces. This process is repeatedly described in terms of contagion. Clement, for
                    instance, is mortified when Sibella learns—without his actually having told
                    her—that he must earn his bread in London: “she sees misery in my looks. She
                    hears it in my sighs, and the contagion has reached her” (Fenwick 126). Caroline
                    suspects, as it happens, that Sibella should worry less about Clement’s miseries
                    than about the temptations he will face in London, “amidst allurements such as
                    virtue had seldom rejected, had seldom turned from without contamination” (60).
                    Usually viewing all other characters from a conspicuous moral high ground,
                    Caroline also fears that young English girls like the Davenport sisters are too
                    easily “infected” with patriarchal “maxim[s],” such as that female “weakness and
                    defect” are primarily responsible for sexual incontinence (165). The ever
                    class-conscious George Valmont is afraid to leave his estate lest he expose his
                    “high-born” body to the “contaminating mixture” of the middle classes (62).
                    News, vice, maxims, class: all such abstractions in <title level="m">Secresy</title> are described in terms of communicable diseases.</p>
               <p>The presence of affect in <title level="m">Secresy</title> becomes clearer as it
                    continues to dramatize “the way the sensual world greets the sensate body,” the
                    “affective forces … generated in such meetings” (Highmore 121). At one point in
                    the novel, Caroline, Murden, and a company of aristocrats decide to take a
                        “<emph>rural </emph>expedition” to a spot where they can fish, eat ices, and
                    listen to costly music (Fenwick 82). Caroline and Murden are riding along a
                    rural road when <quote>a pretty country girl on a horse loaded with paniers drew
                        up to the hedge-side, while the cavalcade passed her. I was in Mr. Murden’s
                        phaeton; and we were the last carriage but one. The girl, in making her
                        awkward obeisance to the company, no sooner lifted her eyes to Mr. Murden,
                        than she blushed deeper than scarlet. It was a blush of such deep shame, of
                        such anguish, that I felt a sudden pain like a shock of electricity.
                        (83–84)</quote> Murden is shocked too, although he has more reason to be
                    than Caroline, since he actually knows the girl and turns out, as we discover
                    later in the novel, to be her protector. Caroline, for her part, is simply
                    struck with a “sudden pain like a shock of electricity” for no demonstrable
                    reason. On another occasion the young Henry Davenport, penniless but “related to
                    several noble families,” pledges to marry Caroline’s mother, Mrs. Ashburn, in a
                    misguided effort to provide for his impoverished, ostracized, consumptive
                    childhood sweetheart Arabella and their illegitimate infant (143). Caroline
                    requests one hour of conversation with Henry in order to talk him out of his
                    foolish decision. She eventually settles the business by providing Davenport
                    with a yearly income (until he can earn enough on his own) and an opportunity to
                    study medicine, thanks to the kindness and connections of the well-to-do Murden.
                    But at their first meeting, an “unusual softness” in Davenport’s voice, the
                    “hectic colour” of his cheek and his melodramatic bodily attitude insinuate
                    their way into Caroline’s otherwise unforgiving view of maudlin behavior:
                        <quote>He rose; and walked towards the widow. “Love is a romance; a cant; a
                        whine; a delirium; a poison; a rankling wound that festers here, here!” he
                        layed [sic] his hand on his heart, and leaned against the wainscot. . . . I
                        sighed too: for the under tone of voice in which he pronounced the last few
                        words was in[de]scribably affecting. (143–45)</quote> Not his embittered
                    sentiments about love, but the “under tone of voice in which he pronounce[s]”
                    them is “in[de]scribably affecting” to Caroline, so that she has no choice but
                    to “sig[h] too.” Thus even a woman who spends most of the novel morally
                    critiquing the passions of others can be electrocuted by a blush, or induced to
                    mirror one sigh with another. Caroline seems more affected in this case by the
                    soft voice, flushed cheek, and leaning, melancholy body of Davenport than by the
                    actual story of his misfortune that he subsequently relates. Her body enfolds
                    affective intensities into itself in and through an environment shared with
                    Clement. Something similar, though perhaps a bit stranger, happens between
                    Sibella and her uncle Valmont. On one cold, windy day Sibella is alone in the
                    woods near Valmont Castle, when a <quote>chill, oppressive gripe seemed to
                        fasten on my heart.—My uncle happened to pass in from the park.—He spoke,
                        but I could not reply. I waved my hand, which he took in his; but, while he
                        pressed it, he reproved me in an ungentle manner, for sitting on the damp
                        stone, and exposed to the raw air.—Tears <emph>unbidden and almost
                            unexcited</emph>, roll down my cheeks. He called Andrew; and I was borne
                        in, and laid on a sopha in the breakfast parlour. (250–51, emphasis
                        mine)</quote> I find it interesting that Sibella’s description of the
                    “chill, oppressive gripe” upon her “heart” precedes her description of Valmont’s
                    entrance: effect precedes cause. Were the sentences reversed, or were the dash
                    replaced with a colon, the statements might make more logical sense. But the
                    body here seems to have anticipated or “intuited” the object of fear before the
                    mind knew what was happening. I suppose one could argue that Sibella’s letter is
                    just creating suspense: i.e., “Fear no sooner gripped my heart than—behold!—my
                    uncle entered the scene.” But the dash between the sentences enables us to read
                    the physiological response to Valmont’s presence as instantaneous, instinctual,
                    irrelevant to whether or not Sibella actually sees or hears her uncle
                    approaching. More striking, however, is the fact that as Sibella writes the
                    above passage in a letter to Caroline, her tears begin to flow “unbidden and
                    almost unexcited.” Grundy interprets the word “unexcited” to mean “[u]nprovoked”
                    (250). The <title level="m">OED </title>defines “unexcited” similarly as “[n]ot
                    mentally stirred or moved” (“unexcited”). In this case, one could say that
                    Sibella is calmly writing in her room and cries when she remembers the touch of
                    her uncle’s hand, his “ungentle” reproof, his removal of her from her beloved
                    wood into the gloomy breakfast parlor. And yet she describes her tears as
                    “unbidden and almost unexcited.” They surface in the present moment, as she is
                    writing her letter, but seem alienated from the memory presumed to evoke them.
                    Their origin is strangely displaced or obscured. This is not to say that there
                    are no alternative, sensible explanations for her reported weeping: Clement is
                    gone at this point and Sibella is pregnant and forced to keep the secret from
                    her tyrannical uncle. But she describes her tears less as the signifiers of an
                    internal signified (a definable feeling with a clear “origin” or stimulus) and
                    more as the product of unknown, mysterious forces. </p>
               <p>Perhaps the presence and operation of affect in <title level="m">Secresy</title>
                    is most pronounced, palpable, and manifest in spaces shared by three members of
                    a central love-triangle: Caroline, Sibella, and Murden. Early in volume one, a
                    frantic Bengali mother sells everything she owns and travels to London to be
                    reunited with her son, who used to work for the nabob Sir Thomas Marlowe (a
                    friend of Mrs. Ashburn and, it follows, her daughter Caroline). Unfortunately,
                    the mother arrives in London only to learn that her son is absent. Upon hearing
                    the news, she “falls ill of an ague and fever,” “languish[ing] in the extreme of
                    misery and disease” for eight weeks. She then visits the country seat of Sir
                    Thomas at Barlowe Hall, where he, Caroline, and all their mutual friends are
                    present. Her emotions are so “wild and extravagant” when she arrives that
                    Caroline “wonder[s] that her intellects survived.” The other guests at Barlowe
                    Hall “expres[s] their disgust at so miserable an object” (Fenwick 85). The
                    Indian woman “wrought a passionate flood of tears,” “wrung her hands, gnashed
                    her teeth,” and “tore her hair” (86). Caroline compares her both to a corpse and
                    an infant. Sir Thomas “saw himself in the utmost danger, and half his family
                    dead or dying of the mortal disease” (which he seems to suspect is malaria)
                    (87). Arthur Murden, who is Sir Thomas’s nephew, is the only gentleman willing
                    to offer the woman any assistance. He accompanies her chaise in the rain to the
                    next village and sees her to bed. Murden returns to Barlowe Hall “pale with
                    fatigue, and want of food; his linen soiled; and his hair disordered” (88). Sir
                    Thomas suspects that the Indian woman has infected him with something. Caroline
                    notes that “[a]s Murden shut one door”—retiring from the drawing room—“a servant
                    opened another,” bearing a letter to her from Sibella (89). The letter, as it
                    turns out, places Murden in another infectious position. It excites such a
                    “pleasurable glow of feeling,” such “visible pleasure” in Caroline that she is
                    obliged to read it aloud that evening to her audience—which once again includes
                    Murden—and to describe the person of Sibella in anatomical detail (90, 91).
                    Murden freezes as she reads. He refuses to eat, which makes Sir Thomas suspect
                    that “nothing but <emph>the fever</emph>” has seized him (96). That evening
                    Murden whispers to Caroline: “My mind is my disease.” Caroline, in turn,
                    observes that “<emph>his mind was </emph>also <emph>my disease</emph>” (96). </p>
               <p>What I find interesting is that by this point the novel has effectively blurred
                    the distinction between physical and mental infection. The Bengali woman is
                    thought to have infected Murden with malaria or hysteria or both. This happens
                    just as Murden is introduced to the character of Sibella, whose letter to
                    Caroline “disease[s]” his “mind.” And no sooner is <emph>he </emph>diseased than
                    he passes his disorder on to Caroline. What does she mean when she claims that
                        “<emph>his mind was </emph>also <emph>my disease</emph>?” Is she is struck
                    with some fatal curiosity about Murden thanks to his charming, good-natured
                    madness? Is it a case of love at first sight? It does turn out—much, I would
                    say, to the surprise of most readers of this novel—that Caroline develops strong
                    feelings for him. One is tempted to conclude, the more one learns about the
                    universe of <title level="m">Secresy</title>, that she “catches” the stuff of
                    these feelings at this precise point; that her desire for Murden is no more than
                    a form or reflex of his own desire for Sibella: the affective intensities having
                    been encountered, enfolded, and subsequently privatized.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The

                        “contemporary social commentators . . . identify clandestine marriage as a
                        ‘disease’” (550). She also notes that “disease functions in the novel as a

                        end” when “Sibella and her infant are sacrificed to the dictates of the
                        dominant social order that might be able to accommodate the sexual woman but

                        signify madness or unendurable mental agony” (Barrell 60). </note> Grundy
                    observes that Fenwick uses “three different lengths of dash: short, to replace
                    or reinforce a period . . . medium, to indicate material absent from the text .
                    . . and very long for the inarticulacy of intense emotion” (Grundy 36). Sibella,
                    who at various points in the novel is called “unformed,” “half insane,” “queer,”
                    “deranged” and a “lovely lunatic,” admits that she is subject to “emotions . . .
                    which [she] cannot describe or explain” (Fenwick 55, 92, 207, 229, 175). Her
                    first letter to Caroline—the one that enthralled Murden—is filled with Grundy’s
                    “very long” dashes, signifying a “heart expand[ing] with swelling emotion” (41).
                    It is telling that the recorded speech of Murden never includes a long dash
                    until he encounters Sibella for the first time in the wood near Valmont Castle.
                    After that his prose is full of them. Sibella writes to Caroline of the
                    encounter that <quote>

                  </quote> As soon as
                    this bizarre meeting is over Murden grows more and more inarticulate and
                    enigmatic. Both the letters that he himself writes and the letters that others
                    write about him punctuate his speech with long dashes. In one of his subsequent
                    letters to Caroline, for instance, he replaces the unutterable name of Sibella
                    with a long dash: “neither prudence, honour, friendship, nor aught else could
                    stay me in my course—not even the heavenly ——.”</p>
               <p>Murden does not run into Sibella accidentally on her uncle’s property. He had
                    already formed and executed a plan to cloister himself within the ruins of an
                    old monastery near Valmont Castle so as to be close to Sibella during her
                    nocturnal walks. He surprises her twice in the guise of a hermit and then
                    communicates with her as a celestial spirit, all the while exacerbating his
                    “disease.” It reaches its height at the end of volume one, when Murden discovers
                    that Sibella has consummated her relationship with Clement. When Sir Thomas
                    arranges a “numerous and brilliant party” in the Assembly Rooms at Bath, all the
                    alarmed guests witness Murden “rush[ing]” into the ballroom “distorted with some
                    species of passion, his hair deranged, and the powder showered on his dress as
                    if he had been dashing his head against some hard substance in a paroxysm of
                    rage.” He groans, curses, flushes, and pales by turns, “gnash[es] his teeth,”
                    “snatch[es] a crumpled letter from his pocket” only to “tea[r] it into a
                    thousand pieces” and “das[h] the fragments on the floor,” stares at everyone
                    “malignant[ly], “carefully gather[s] up every fragment” of paper and then
                    “dart[s] out of the room.” Sir Thomas presumes he is “mad” and “infect[ed]”
                    (151–52). The symptoms of his emotional breakdown—down to the very gnashing of
                    teeth—mirror those of the Bengali woman who fell into extravagant fits upon her
                    arrival in London. Caroline is the person who reports this wild incident in the
                    second letter of the second volume of the novel. It turns out that the “crumpled
                    letter” that Murden dramatically tears to pieces is a “billet” written by
                    Sibella to Clement, which Clement enclosed in his own letter to Murden at the
                    end of volume one. In that “billet” Sibella invites Clement to her apartment,
                    where with “pure hearts and hands, we will plight our fervent unspotted faith.
                    Say I am your’s [sic], and you are mine, and sorrow and jealousy will vanish as
                    a mist. You shall go the transported confiding husband” (131). Murden seems to
                    realize in the ballroom at Bath that he has spent more time “stalk[ing],”
                    “prying,” and “watching” Sibella than actually courting her in any remotely
                    appropriate fashion. He has spent his time prowling about the ruins in Valmont
                    estate and accosting Sibella in outlandish disguises. Perhaps he was foolishly
                    convinced, as he writes in one of his now dash-heavy letters to Caroline, that
                    Sibella was preserving herself as the “reward of a deserving ventrous [sic] hero
                    like myself——Oh! I have embraced a cloud, and the tormenting wheel rolls round
                    with a rapid motion!” (133).</p>
               <p>Both Murden and Sibella are gradually destroyed by a toxic interexchange of
                    affect. From the point of his first meeting with the “lunatic” Sibella, Murden
                    himself becomes “lunatic-like” (229, 160). He calls himself Sibella’s “shadow,”
                    who “sigh[s] to her sigh” (269). Eventually her body wastes away as she broods
                    on the unfaithfulness of her ex-lover Clement, and the body of Murden follows
                    suit. In fact, the more physical contact the two have, the more they seem to
                    become somatic equals. When Murden and his friend Richardson steal into
                    Sibella’s private chamber in Valmont Castle in order to rescue her, Murden can
                    barely stand: <quote>
                     <p rend="noCount">She opened the door. She came out to us. – “Ah! what, what
                            is the matter?” cried she, extending her arms as if to save me from
                            falling. . . . I recoiled <emph>from her</emph> . . . and, as I leaned
                            on Richardson’s shoulder, I closed my dim eyes, and wished they might
                            never more open upon recollection.</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">“Shame!” whispered Richardson, “you are unmanned!”</p>
                     <p rend="noCount">And so I am, Miss Ashburn. . . . I feel a rankling glow of
                            satisfaction, as she walks past my chair, that I have so placed it
                            [that] I cannot look up and behold her. (322)</p>
                  </quote> After her
                    rescuers arrive, Sibella expresses her gratitude and her continued unrequited
                    affection for Clement. At this point, the merger of her own body with Murden’s
                    seems to crystalize: “[a]s she spoke,” Murden writes, “I turned my eyes from her
                    now haggard and jaundiced face to my own, reflected in the mirror by which I was
                    standing. ‘Moving corpses!’ said I to myself—‘Why encumber ye the fair earth?’”
                    (322). In the next few paragraphs, Murden scores his own and Sibella’s speech
                    with long dashes. </p>
               <p>The act of sympathetic exchange in <title level="m">Secresy </title>is indeed
                    more of a death sentence than an opportunity for benevolent action,
                    than—according to an eighteenth-century ideal—a means to “transform social
                    distance into union, social difference into identity” (McGowen 314). As the
                    novel winds to a close, Murden and Sibella find themselves on the verge of
                    madness and death in a small country inn. Each is lodged in separate quarters
                    for reasons of safety. The landlord—reluctant though desperate—suggests that
                    Sibella finally be allowed to see Murden in the hopes that his “pity-moving
                    countenance” may possibly “affect her” and “call forth a sympathy which must
                    produce tears” (Fenwick 353). (Sibella has not cried for a long time; Grundy
                    notes that “<emph>[n]ot </emph>to weep in intense sorrow was held to have
                    damaging physical effects” [Grundy 353]). Slowly, cautiously, Murden is ushered
                    into her room. As he “gaze[s] intently on Sibella, his countenance under[goes] a
                    striking alteration.” He either faints or falls asleep at her knees, and his
                    hand falls upon the bed. Sibella places his hand in hers and finds that “[s]he
                    could not . . . separate his sufferings from her own.” She “continued to hold
                    his hand” until “her emotions were kindling into agony.” After two “loud and
                    dreadful groan[s]” she exclaims: “‘Give me not a name . . . . I own none! What
                    am I? a shadow! A dream! . . . Oh! Your touch is ice!’ . . . you have chilled my
                    blood!’” Murden explains to Sibella that his body is cold because “[he] too [is]
                    but a shadow.” He sinks in her arms and “never . . . rise[s] again.” Sibella
                    dies shortly afterward and both are entombed together (355–56). There is indeed
                    something wildly odd and arresting about the role that the
                        <emph>hand-holding</emph> plays in Sibella’s Murden-killing paroxysm of
                    existential despair. The harder and longer she grips his soon-to-be-lifeless
                    hand, the more her feelings seem to accumulate inside of her—until she cries
                    aloud in what becomes both her own and Murden’s swan song. </p>
               <p>As far back as 1978, René Girard observed that “the dearest of all our illusions”
                    is the “intimate conviction that our desires are really our own, that they are
                    truly original and spontaneous.” For Girard, desire is not original but
                    imitative—not to mention “eminently contagious.” One “‘catches’ a nearby desire
                    just as one would catch the plague or cholera, simply by contact with the
                    infected person” (Girard ix, 96, 99). One of the strangest plot twists in <title level="m">Secresy </title>is that the hyper-sensible Caroline falls in love
                    with the absurdly sentimental Murden. This is a man who Caroline claims has
                    “refined upon romance; who can give . . . as much enthusiasm to the affections,
                    and carve misery for himself as ingeniously, as though he had passed his days
                    under the safeguard of Mr. Valmont’s walls and drawbridges” (Fenwick 188). The
                    irony here is that Murden <emph>has</emph>, in fact, passed his days hiding on
                    the Valmont estate: dressing up in various costumes to woo Sibella through
                    enigmatic hints and notes. He first appears in the wood as an old hermit, the
                    “tall figure of a venerable man, with a white and flowing beard,” “wrapped in a
                    sort of loose gown” and wearing a “broad hat” (101). He identifies himself as
                    the ghost of an old inhabitant of the ruined monastery who can “‘renovate old
                    age’” (a power he demonstrates by removing his beard, hat and mantle to reveal
                    “a young man of graceful form”) (102). Sibella stumbles upon Murden a second
                    time loitering in the armory of Valmont Castle, to which he has gained access
                    via an underground passage that connects the monastery outside to the armory
                    within the castle. This time (still disguised as a hermit) he appears
                    “disfigured by dust and cobwebs,” carrying a sword and speaking in “disjointed”
                    words “with a rapidity which made him almost unintelligible” (119). Eventually
                    Murden seems to realize that speaking to Sibella in the guise of a hermit will
                    get him nowhere. Some time after these false starts he folds several pieces of
                    paper into a ball, weighted with a pebble, and rolls it toward Sibella while she
                    is walking about in the wood. In one of the enfolded notes he identifies himself
                    as an angel or celestial spirit inhabiting a lower planetary sphere, charging
                    Sibella to “set [her] desires” on one of the papers he has provided (i.e., to
                    tell him if she is free to love him or if she loves someone else) and to leave
                    it on a nearby tomb (179). </p>
               <p>The fact that Caroline falls in love with someone like Murden is completely at
                    odds with her self-presentation throughout <title level="m">Secresy</title>. She
                    has professed to disdain all self-indulgent, blatantly irrational sentiment as
                    any good Wollstonecraftian would. Others have called her “pedantic, inflexible,
                    opinionated . . . severe, misjudging” (284). She accordingly refers to Murden as
                    “a being more variable, more inexplicable, than any being within [her]
                    knowledge,” a “baby” of “false delicacy,” “false refinement,” “ferment[ed] . . .
                    senses,” “fevered fancy,” “burning brain,” “artificial refinements,” and so on:
                    in short, he and Sibella, according to Caroline, are enthusiasts, romantic
                    “victims of erroneous educations” (143, 285–86). How then could she possibly
                    fall in love with him? One satisfying explanation is that her desires were never
                    really her own, but <emph>his</emph> (both, at any rate, the product of the same
                    affective “mood”). What Caroline claims to feel for Murden is a version of what
                        <emph>he</emph> claims to feel for Sibella. At one point she even adopts
                    Murden’s emotionalized language and extreme sensuality. In one of her letters to
                    Sibella, Caroline reveals that she knows who the mysterious “wood-wanderer” is.
                    She presents herself in the letter as a kind of hovering spectator in Valmont
                    wood, spying on the disguised Murden as he, in turn, has been spying on Sibella:
                        <quote> I see him gliding through the paths you had trodden. The tree which
                        screened him from your view cannot conceal him from mine. I see him listen
                        almost breathless to your prayer. The new-born colour on his cheek hangs
                        trembling . . . the throbbings of his agonized bosom collect themselves
                        while restrained . . .. I see him dart the ball forward to meet your feet;
                        and then he rushes into the thickest gloom to hide himself. . . . did
                        symmetry ever mould a statue in finer proportions than his form can boast?
                        His eye in its passive state is a clear grey, its shape long; and the finest
                        eye-brow and eye lash that ever adorned mortal face . . . Hold him in
                        conversation and you will see that eye almost emits fire. . . . Observe how
                        his hair, bursting from confinement into natural ringlets around his
                        temples, contrasts itself with the fairness of his complexion. . . . His
                        colour . . . retires as you perceive it, or suffuses the whole of his fine
                        countenance. (187–88)</quote> And so on. As Murden was once entranced by
                    what Caroline had spoken of the physical features of Sibella—her “face,” “form,”
                    “attitude,” “eyes,” “forehead,” “mouth,” unset and unpowered hair “parted from
                    the top of the head and always uncovered,” neck “one of the finest . . . that
                    ever belonged to a human figure”—now Caroline indulges in her own blazon of
                    Murden (92–93). The above passage may be somewhat ironically delivered, but it
                    may also be evidence of how material bodies in shared spaces circulate the raw
                    material of “private” feeling. Nor is this phenomenon exclusive to Caroline. One
                    critic notes that “[a]lthough Clement accuses Murden of having “absurd dreams of
                    romantic useless perfections” which hinder his appreciation of women, he himself
                    is guilty of idealizing Sibella’s “lovely face” and “enchanting unresisting
                    form” (Emsley 492). Sensual desire spreads everywhere in <title level="m">Secresy</title>, in spite of what characters say or think about it. </p>
               <p>The characters in Fenwick’s novel may therefore <emph>appear</emph> to live in
                    “polarized” emotional environments, as others have argued (Castle 140): the
                    sentimental-Burkean-chivalric Murden meets the cool Wollstonecraftian Caroline
                    and neither seems able to navigate outside of a generic emotional script. But to
                    me it is seems equally evident that these mental or rhetorical “types” have a
                    strongly corporeal presence in the novel, that the bodies to which they belong
                    interact dynamically in a physicalized space described repeatedly in metaphors
                    of contagion. Every character in <title level="m">Secresy </title>is entitled,
                    of course, to articulate her emotional state as she pleases. And every character
                    may presume, according to the Enlightenment view of sympathy advanced variously
                    by Locke, Hume, and Smith, that she can sympathize with other characters by
                    imaginatively participating in and possessing their feelings in a personal and
                    private capacity. But the novel makes it relatively clear that individual
                    feelings are more like what William Reddy calls <emph>emotives</emph>—culturally
                    codified descriptions rather than private, indwelling energies.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Reddy.</note> The only real energies in <title level="m">Secresy </title>are the impersonal and inarticulable ones: “the affective
                    forces . . . generated” as “the sensual world greets . . . sensate bod[ies].”

               <p rend="noCount"> Taking as its main focus Shelley’s lyrical drama <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, this essay examines the Romantic treatment of
                    feeling as a kind of affective ecology sustained by love. The poem reconstitutes
                    feeling, not as it indicates a subject formed by Enlightenment notions of words
                    or looks, but as an unrestrained <foreign>jouissance</foreign> that constitutes
                    the event of feeling itself. This event shatters the subject so that, as if to
                    tarry with a Jupiterian desire to conscript meaning, the subject can feel its
                    truth. </p>

                  <p> Many of Romanticism’s ur-texts, from <title level="m">The Sorrows of Young
                            Werther</title> (1774) to <title level="m">The Prelude</title> (1850),
                        apotheosize the eighteenth century’s increasing attention to feeling. Our
                        sensate response to the world—<foreign>sentio ergo sum—</foreign>spurred
                        Romanticism’s feeling enterprise as a part of its critical response <emph>to
                        </emph>feeling. Put another way, Romanticism struggles to understand affect
                        as expression, cognition, and cogitation, as when Wordsworth tempers the
                        spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling through the tranquil recollection
                        of emotion. This cognitive latency (feel first; think later) demanded a
                        measured response to feeling’s autonomous rhythms, the symptom of any number
                        of enthusiasms—religious, political, sexual, etc.—that excited concern.
                        Scholarship has long shared this (strangely passionate) distrust of feeling
                        (e.g., Wimsatt and Beardsley’s attack on affective criticism as Romantic
                            subjectivism).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Mary Favret reminds us of this
                            “attack” in “The Study of Affect and Romanticism.” </note> Spurred by,
                        among other things, a return to the body in feminist and queer theory and
                        the transformation of emotion into a scientific object, we are now
                        rethinking feeling in Romanticism as a complex matrix of representational
                        and cognitive possibilities. Feeling and thinking are far more interrelated
                        than previously felt or thought, and feeling itself is anything but
                        ancillary to being.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Faflak and Sha.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Part of this effort requires that we parse feeling’s difference from itself.
                        Rei Terada distinguishes emotion as “a psychologically, at least minimally
                        interpretive experience whose physiological aspect is affect” from feeling,
                        “a capacious term that connotes both physiological sensations (affects) and
                        psychological states (emotions)” (14–15). For Brian Massumi, feeling is
                        affect materialized as virtual existence, a “zone of indistinction” that he
                        reads as a kind of political ecology (66). Affect is a “system” of
                        “autonomic responses” that the cognition of emotions “may seize upon . . .
                        [in order to] . . . ‘qualify’ or name them, but in doing so it ‘dampens’
                        their force or ‘resonance.’” Emotion “is affect ‘owned and recognized’; it
                        translates affect into ‘conventional, consensual’ form, where it can be
                        given ‘function and meaning’” (cited in Favret 1159). Or as Michael Hardt
                        argues, feeling transforms the “ontology of the human” by “illuminat[ing] .
                        . . both our power to affect the world around us and our power to be
                        affected by it, along with the relationship between these two powers” (xi).
                        Each of these cases speaks implicitly to a Romantic impulse at once to
                        understand and thus name feeling, and to give it free rein as a kind of
                        psychochemical radical transferring and transforming of relations between
                        subjects and their world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Sha.</note> What we feel
                        along our pulses registers the natural and preternatural (uncanny)
                        psychosomatics of our sensorium as it touches and withdraws from the world.
                        As Wordsworth says, “we cannot chuse but feel / That [man’s works] must
                        perish” (<title level="m">The Prelude </title>[1805] 5.20), which rather
                        ambivalently prefers feeling to rational determination <emph>and
                        </emph>marks feeling as our unavoidable lot tied to a death that we
                        unavoidably must feel. Our “works” are rather beside the point, for feeling
                            <emph>is </emph>our work, whether we like it or not.</p>
                  <p> This essay takes its cue from these authors as well as from accounts more
                        specifically targeting Romanticism. For Julie Carlson, Percy Shelley’s use
                        of simile, as embodied thought, unlike metaphor, which subordinates reality,
                        registers language’s affective pull as the feeling relationality among
                        selves as others. By enacting their difference from reality, similes offer a
                        non-defensive, non-coercive relation to the very antagonism they stage.
                        Richard C. Sha reads this relation in terms of the motion or force of
                        emotion as a “metalepsis” of the human and nonhuman (both mechanical and
                        divine), an unstable but productive relational matrix that subjectivity
                        materializes: “Emotions . . . literally matter because of the force they
                        contain,” Sha writes, “the mechanism by which the mental becomes somatic and
                        emotion is communicated” (23, 22). Emotions lack agency, but not
                        intentionality, and thus confuse the “border between matter and sociality,”
                        so that “affinities are necessarily multiple, and by implication, transient”
                        and “fungible” (31). This paradoxical transfer informs Terada’s sense of how
                        passion undoes “intentional subjectivity” to mark the “nonsubjectivity
                        within the very concept of the subject” (4–5), the non-human within the
                        human. And for Jacques Khalip, the above lines from Book Five of <title level="m">The Prelude </title>suggest an inhuman automaticity that
                        expresses an “extreme kind of purposiveness without purpose—a zero-degree
                        relation of carelessness, a relation without relation” (631). </p>
                  <p> What does feeling “mean” as a form of inhuman cognition that at once locates
                        us in and beyond the world? I ask this question of Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), in which the global effects
                        of feeling are writ large as cosmic phenomenon. Feeling is the eruption and
                        rupture of a material happening embodied through its subjects as feeling’s
                        virtual presences, feeling <emph>as </emph>virtual presence. Alain Badiou
                        describes this rupture as “the event.” For Badiou, within the givenness of
                        any situation, delimited by the dominant ideology of its social order, what
                        that order excludes and thus renders invisible threatens to erupt. “The
                        structure of situations” does not itself “deliver any truths”; rather, the
                        rupture constitutes the truth of “rupturing with the order which supports
                        it, never as an effect of that order” (xii). The event is thus a random,
                        local, subjective breach that calls attention to whatever exclusions made
                        and sustain the situation, a defamiliarizing moment that calls it to its
                            <emph>situatedness</emph>.</p>
                  <p> For my present purposes, I would argue that emotion carries the event’s
                        rupturing force, as in the spontaneity of Wordsworthian feeling. But to
                        Badiou’s sense of the event’s radical, incommensurate singularity, I would
                        add that emotion’s sheer immanence is at the same time tied to that which
                        incites it or to the situation in which it erupts—Wordsworth’s sense of
                        emotion’s recollection. In the simplest terms, emotion at once explodes and
                        gauges the situation it explodes, is at once apart from and embedded within,
                        and thus responsive to and responsible for, the situation. Put another way,
                        by materializing subjects <emph>as </emph>subjects, emotion registers their
                        embeddedness within any situation’s ideological constraints, but also marks
                        them as exceptions to its (and to the subject’s) rule. In the “perpetual
                        Orphic Song” (4.415) that is the fourth act of Shelley’s lyrical drama,
                        Panthea and Ione are awakened by the Voice of Unseen Spirits, who bring news
                        of Prometheus’ unbinding and subsequent union with Asia, a marriage and
                        transformation of unfathomable proportions.<note place="foot" resp="editors">All quotations

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Here, the entire earth constitutes, and is constituted by,
                        an affective ecology whose happiness at once agitates and is agitated by
                        “Storm” and “panic.” Contrary to the poem’s otherwise idealist and
                        idealistic slant, Shelley’s environment is both self-possessed and possessed
                        by the agents of its unfolding—who are, in turn, possessed by its autonomous
                        functioning and self-possessed enough at once to be shaped by and to endure
                        its arbitrary purposiveness. </p>
                  <p> The key word here is “shake,” which marks the power of emotional response in
                        excess of itself, something that exceeds cognitive recognition. It also
                        marks the ambivalence of one’s feeling response to the world as an agency
                        without agents, a force materialized through the expressions that it
                        generates in turn. Coincidentally, the OED defines “emotion” as “movement,
                        disturbance, perturbation, or instance of this” by citing Shelley’s “Love’s
                        Philosophy,” first published in <title level="m">Posthumous Poems
                        </title>(1824): “The fountains mingle with the river, / And the rivers with
                        the ocean, / The winds of heaven mix forever / With a sweet emotion” (1–4).
                        Emotion also means “an agitation of mind; an excited mental state.
                        Subsequently: any strong mental or instinctive feeling, as pleasure, grief,
                        hope, fear, etc., deriving esp. from one's circumstances, mood, or
                        relationship with others.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">In “Tintern Abbey,” Wordsworth
                            writes that he has “felt / A presence that disturbs me with the joy / Of
                            elevated thoughts, a sense sublime / Of something far more deeply
                            interfused” (<title level="m">Poetical Works </title>94–97).</note>
                        “Sweet emotion” and “shake with emotion” thus suggest both Heraclitean
                        contingency and pantheistic interconnection (in “Love’s Philosophy,” Shelley
                        continues: “Nothing in the world is single; / All things by a law divine /
                        In one another’s being mingle” [5–7]). Here an emotive nature is not the
                        world humanized, as in a nature rendered “instinct with feeling” by the
                        poet, to borrow a common (by Shelley’s time even hackneyed) phrase, but
                        rather (to borrow another Shelleyan word) enkindled by and as its own
                        sensorium. “Instinct” signifies an autonomous, unwilled self-fashioning, a
                        nature imbued with or animated by feeling but also an innate, spontaneous
                        impulse that disturbs or resists rational cognition, as in Darwin’s account
                        of species formation. Eventually emotion becomes a transitive verb: “to
                        cause to move; to make emotional” and “to affect or imbue with emotion; to
                        make emotional” (OED), which denotes our current understanding of “emoting”
                        as performance. Ironically, this aesthetics of feeling partly recalls
                        Aristotle’s purgation of emotion (<foreign>katharsis ton
                            pathematon</foreign>) and reminds us that feeling stages our
                        subjectivities without our knowing: we only come to know feeling once we
                        feel or see it “staged” for us in turn.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jungian analyst

                  <p> Put differently, in and through feeling we both find and lose our bearings
                        in the world. Shelley’s rejoinder, “But where are ye?”, asked directly of
                        Ione and Panthea, also addresses all of us as subjects, a dilemma embedded
                        in the ultimate question of Shelley’s truncated final poem: “Then, what is
                        Life?” To say that the cognition of where we fit in the world is
                            <emph>more</emph> than a feeling, to name this essay’s title, suggests a
                        super-addition that makes feeling relevant, understandable—an
                            <foreign>Aufhebung </foreign>in which affect and emotion meet to become
                        cognizable, in which we become cognizant of feeling <emph>as </emph>feeling.
                        But <emph>more</emph> also indicates the event of emotion that feeling
                        itself cannot sublate or render normative, feeling as an excess beyond
                        itself. Feeling is thus both superfluity, something that neither
                        rationality, mental cognition, nor understanding can easily assimilate, and
                        a superabundance that imbricates us within the larger affective matrix that
                        situates us within the world. Binding the above etymologies is emotion as
                        “political agitation, civil unrest” (which again echoes Badiou’s sense of
                        the event), but also of “a movement from one place to another, a migration”
                        (OED). Shelley’s poem senses a world moving both within and beyond its own
                        boundaries. Feeling registers this migratory impulse as a threat that also
                        leads humanity, and its detrimental effects, beyond itself to a brighter but
                        also radically unknown (and thus equally terrifying) future. <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, perhaps the most intensely
                        idealistic of Shelley’s texts, expresses an “idealism without
                            absolutes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I borrow this phrase from the title of a
                            volume of essays edited by Tilottama Rajan and Arkady Plotnitsky on the
                            afterlife of German Idealism. They speak of Romanticism an “idealism
                            without absolutes, rather than any kind of absolute materialism or
                            idealism,” which is also to read the influence of German Idealism as
                            “not only configured by materiality but also” as something that “itself
                            reconstitutes the material: both ‘materiality’ as a concept, and the
                            material with which philosophy deals” (2).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> In his Preface to the poem, Shelley speaks of poets as “the combined product
                        of such internal powers as modify the nature of others.” They express the
                        power of poetry as a “mimetic art” that “creates by combination and
                        representation,” to produce “some intelligible and beautiful analogy with
                        those sources of emotion and thought,” by which he means “the mind of man”
                        and “nature” (208). For Shelley this “analogy” takes the form of “imagery .
                        . . drawn from the operations of the human mind, or from those external
                        actions by which they are expressed” (207). This creative reciprocity
                        between mind and world immediately (dis)locates images of the brain, like
                        those of a dream, to a transitional space that is at once communal and
                        nowhere, which is to prompt the question of where such images reside and
                        what effect they might have. Shelley locates the poem’s impetus in an effort
                        to “annihilate” the “moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully
                        sustained by the sufferings and endurance of Prometheus,” by attempting to
                        “conceive of him as unsaying his high language” (206). This rethinking of
                        language’s power to convey, control, and coerce thought is an attempt to
                        discover and explore a radically different vocabulary that would express
                        “some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement
                        it” (208). That the future remains “unimagined” suggests Shelley’s “‘passion
                        for reforming the world,’” yet without a plan to do so, which invokes the
                        customary disparagement of a Shelleyan politics out of touch with reality.
                        But to mark change as “unimagined” is to mark the negative potentiality of
                        three possibilities: a catastrophic outcome avoided, as in the recurrence of
                        despotism against all resistance to the contrary; a future that may or will
                        never come, as in the frustrated hope for political change; or, most
                        radically in Shelley, an event left unfulfilled so as precisely to make way
                        for its possible occurrence. This unimagined “something evermore about to
                        be” evokes a sense of threat that haunts Act One as Prometheus struggles to
                        recall his curse against Jupiter. Yet as we shall see, it haunts the poem’s
                        movement toward its future—toward the future—as a progress without
                            <foreign>telos</foreign>, a trajectory that materializes as if from and
                        within the motions of its own immanence, which is to say the immanence of
                        emotion itself. </p>

                  <p>In his opening speech, Prometheus rails against Jupiter for the toxic
                        emotions—“fear and self-contempt and barren hope” (1.8); “mine own misery
                        and thy vain revenge” (11)—over which Prometheus “Hast [been] made [to]
                        reign and triumph, to thy scorn” (10). For Jupiter’s attempt to legislate
                        another’s emotional life—for how Jupiter’s tyranny tries to make Prometheus
                            <emph>feel—</emph>Prometheus, who refuses to accept the emotions that
                        result from the affect transmitted by Jupiter’s reign, feels not “Disdain”
                        but “pity” for Jupiter (53). Hence, in Act One Prometheus is no longer made
                        to endure but actively <emph>asks </emph>to endure, not <emph>what
                        </emph>his curse said, but <emph>how </emph>it was said, how it might now be
                        recalled in order to transform its effect. Which is why the Phantasm of
                        Jupiter, not of Prometheus, repeats the curse, to which Prometheus replies,
                        in one of the poem’s most moving statements of the ethics of affect, “It
                        doth repent me” (303). Having been “made” to rule an emotional “empire” not
                        of his making, and thus reluctantly estranged from an emotional life he
                        longs to claim, Prometheus, who nonetheless “endure[s],” turns outward to
                        “Earth” and “Heaven” to ask if they have “seen” or “heard [his] agony” (15,
                        24, 25, 26, 27, 29). This gesture is less to gain sympathetic witness to his
                        eternal “pain” than to reclaim, not the words, which “are quick and vain,”
                        but the toxic affect that fueled and sustained the curse’s utterance, the
                        breath of which left Earth’s “wan breast . . . dry / With grief,” and “the
                        thin air . . . stained / With the contagion of a mother’s hate / Breathed on
                        her child’s destroyer” (30, 303, 176–79). </p>
                  <p> Earth and Heaven are thus impoverished by the <emph>sound </emph>of the
                        curse, at first repeated in the four Voices of mountains, springs, air, and
                        whirlwinds. On one hand, Earth resounds with the “dying fall” that encrypts
                        the curse’s ruinous effect. On the other hand, Earth’s “Caverns” remain
                        “tongueless,” except to hear the “hollow Heaven” and “Ocean’s purple waves”
                        cry “Misery!” to the “pale nations” (107, 108, 109, 111). Between Philomel
                        and Echo, that is to say, affect might be heard—sounded—in either violent or
                        transformational ways. More particularly, in the transmission of affect<note place="foot" resp="editors">I borrow this phrase, of course, from the title of Teresa
                            Brennan’s trenchant book, which asks us to re-think, non-pathologically,
                            how affect and its energy of feeling is absorbed by and between
                            subjects, and thus both permeates and blurs the boundary between mind
                            and body. </note> that eventually transforms the life of the poem’s
                        emotional landscape, the text emphasizes the sound of echoes, an odd
                        displacement that paradoxically marks the very thing that echoes are, the
                        mode of their difference from themselves as difference itself, and the echo
                        as sound’s difference from itself. This is why Prometheus “hear[s] <emph>a
                            sound</emph> of voices—not <emph>the</emph> voice / Which [he] gave
                        forth” (112–13; my emphasis), as if to take ethical and moral responsibility
                        for the effect his emotions have, not just on others, but on the environment
                        that both marks him and upon which his existence inevitably leaves its mark.
                        Prometheus accuses the Earth of not knowing him, and implores her not to
                        “deny” him his “dreadful words” (185). But this is only to mark her
                        “inorganic voice” (135). It is more critical that he hears the “melancholy”
                        (152) carried by that voice in order to mourn the mourning of its past
                        effects and affect. That is to say, Prometheus would move past the cycle of
                        mourning itself, emblazoned as what Panthea, having heard the Chorus of
                        Furies come to tempt Prometheus to despair, calls “A woeful sight—a youth /
                        With patient looks nailed to a crucifix” (584–85). Such is the logic of
                        Jupiter’s emotional tyranny that “In each human heart terror survives / The
                        ravin it has gorged” (618–19) and men “live among their suffering fellow men
                        / As if none felt” (630–31). This is at once to legislate the self-predatory
                        nature of affect (not unlike Freud’s notion of guilt internalized as the
                        superego in the name of a self-lacerating and thus self-governing
                        conscience) and to atomize subjects so as to pre-empt any movement of
                        feeling and thus neutralize its potential resistance.</p>
                  <p> His immortality at first keeps Prometheus from hearing the sound of his own
                        (past) voice; as the Earth reminds him, “How canst thou hear / Who knowest
                        not the language of the dead?” (137–38). But his eternal nature reflects a
                        broader emotional landscape, less the timeless utopianism that uncannily
                        depends upon an equally endless cycle between hope and despair for its
                        possible apocalypse (hence the Christian redemptive eschatology that
                        Prometheus eschews), than “merely” the harbinger of things to come, in which
                        the future remains radically unknown so as not to predetermine and thus
                        constrain its emotional life. This is, paradoxically, why dread and terror
                        as much as love and hope sustain this life as a “voice to be accomplished”
                        (3.3.67). Earth, who “dare[s] not speak” the words of the curse, instead has
                        been “mediat[ing]” upon them “In secret joy and hope” (184–86),
                        “Preserve[d], a treasured spell,” among “the inarticulate people of the
                        dead” (183–84). Like the frozen affect of the melancholic, she encrypts the
                        source of her lament, the refuge, as Shelley writes in <title level="m">Adonais</title>, of “what is still dear” as that which “Attracts to
                        crush, repels to make thee wither” (473, 474). The curse is thus “dreadful”
                        because it bears the hope of a secret that, as Nietzsche suggests in “On
                        Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense,” becomes the empty center around which
                        a mobile army of metaphors and metonymies orchestrate themselves in order to
                        exert the force of truth. Arriving to “execute” a “doom of new revenge,”
                        Jupiter’s son Mercury compels Prometheus to “Clothe . . . in words” the
                        “secret known” to Prometheus of the term of Jupiter’s tyranny (355, 375,
                        371). Like the Foucauldian psychiatrist who feeds the discursive regimes of
                        power by coaxing the confessant’s internal life into the open, Mercury’s
                        promise of redemption and thus happiness, signified by the remedial
                        authority of his “serpent-cinctured wand” (324), feels to Prometheus like
                        the Sword of Damocles (396–405). </p>
                  <p> Yet Prometheus tarries with the <foreign>pharmakon</foreign> in other ways,
                        for he risks re-agitating the same emotional pestilence he was unwillingly
                        made to incite, like a toxin injected into bodies—given bodily
                        form—(hopefully) to mobilize antibodies against the poison it cultivates.
                        That is to say, he must claim the curse’s affect <emph>as his own</emph> in
                        order both to reject and to transform its affective coding. He calls up the
                        archive or Wayback Machine (as it were) of his emotional life in order, like
                        Shelley’s notion of poetry’s re-creative effects from existing causes, to
                        envision this life’s hardwiring otherwise. Very early in the poem Prometheus
                        pities and thus disavows Jupiter’s tyranny. But again, only once he
                        “endures” the variously toxic causes and effects that lead to pity do the
                        various Furies, sent to torment his desire back into bodily (i.e., verbal)
                        form, vanish (634). The text allegorizes this excoriating process when the
                        Earth says that the words of Prometheus’ curse “shall be told” (191), a
                        powerfully passive construction that immediately displaces the force and
                        thus potential affect of their saying: <quote>

                     </quote> The passage reads as an uncanny template of Lacanian
                        self-encounter. In cursing Jupiter, Prometheus became what he beheld, as if
                        to enter the mirror stage in which we witness for the first time the
                        symbolic contours of our selfhood <emph>as </emph>self, yet simultaneously
                        recognize that our desire <emph>for </emph>this self is constituted
                        precisely by the desire <emph>of </emph>self we witness in the other. Such
                        an encounter turns both sides of the reflection into a specular exchange or
                        transference from which it seems impossible to escape. We might say that the
                        poem begins with Prometheus recognizing this trap. Put another way, the
                        passage invites the subject to witness his own (“sole”) death as the burial
                        of a potential (“unimagined”) life that is less the site of a possible
                        repression (for Shelley repression signals inevitable death) than the
                        unconscious that psychoanalysis can never presume to know. Or to paraphrase
                        Prometheus answering Mercury asking about the “period of Jove’s power,” “I
                        know but this, that it must come” (412–13).</p>
                  <p> The Earth invites passage through the mirror stage to a different
                        constitution of things that does not depend upon the tyrannical power of the
                        gaze in which the other and its Jupiterian authority hope to catch subjects.
                        This “Infinity [that] shall be / A robe of envenomed agony” (288–89)
                        signifies the endless cycle of a possible redemption calcified in the image
                        of a crucified saviour. Gazing upon the Phantasm of Jupiter, Prometheus
                        “see[s] the curse on gestures proud and cold, / And looks of firm defiance,
                        and calm hate, / And such despair as mocks itself with smiles, / Written as
                        on a scroll” (258–61). Shelley’s hermeneutics of facial anatomy suggests
                        Charles Bell’s <title level="m">Essays on the Anatomy and Philosophy of
                            Expression</title> (1824), which reads in the face’s visual topography a
                        spiritual dimension. And Bell’s text anticipates Charles Darwin’s <title level="m">The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals</title> (1872),
                        which re-thinks the relationship between mind and body in terms of a biology
                        of emotion that links mental states to the human and animal movement across
                        and between species through time and space. Like Bell, Darwin uses
                        illustrations as well as photographs to visualize and materialize emotion in
                        process. Yet Shelley’s poem avoids this materialization precisely for its
                        desire (as Massumi notes) to “capture” affect as emotion. As Ione notes
                        after the appearance of Jupiter’s Phantasm, this image of emotion is “but
                        some passing spasm” that would have us, in the words of the First Fury, “die
                        with our desire” (314, 351).</p>
                  <p> In this way, the melancholy of Earth’s voice, which is the echo of
                        Prometheus’ own desire, carries a transforming, semiotic energy. Julia
                        Kristeva accounts for language’s unsteadily disruptive but renewable force
                        as the semiotic <foreign>chora</foreign>, an “essentially mobile and
                        extremely provisional articulation constituted by movements and their
                        ephemeral stases” (<title level="m">Revolution </title>24). Similar to the
                        primary processes in Freudian dreamwork, the <emph>chora</emph> is comprised
                        of “‘energy’ charges as well as ‘psychical’ marks” (25), both the force of
                        the drives and the impressions they leave behind. Associated with the
                        infant’s biological attachment to mother, and thus constellating the matrix
                        of all intersubjective relationships, the semiotic denotes the psychic
                        “binding” of our instinctual and libidinal “motility.” It thus registers the
                        inextricable link of the material and the psychic as part of a
                            “<foreign>signifying process</foreign>” into which all subjects are born
                        and out of which they emerge (25). The semiotic marks the residual
                        materiality of the mother’s body, which is also to say of any primordial
                        sustaining presence or force that registers the subject’s first bodily
                        experience. It thus also marks the matrix of our environmental disposition
                        in the world, the transferential space of our attachment to things, and the
                        energy that at once sustains this relation and perpetually disrupts and
                        (re)generates its manifestation <foreign>as </foreign>relation. The semiotic
                        denotes the reciprocal movement of melancholy itself, of how we are at once
                        born from a past without origin and borne toward a future with trajectory
                        but without <foreign>telos</foreign>. Or as Kristeva writes, without “a bent
                        for melancholia there is no psyche,” for “there is no imagination that is
                        not, overtly or secretly, melancholy,” an “<emph>impossible mourning</emph>”
                        for “an inaccessible—and inaccessibly lost—object” (<title level="m">Black
                            Sun </title>6, 9). Melancholic semiosis—the melancholy <emph>of
                        </emph>semiosis—thus also sustains the affect of sound—the sound <emph>of
                        </emph>affect—that carries the work of affect itself in the poem, the echoes
                        of sound that mark the intrinsic movement through space of sound as an
                        object “inaccessibly lost.”</p>
                  <p> At the end of Act One we anticipate the arrival in Act Two of Asia’s
                        “transforming presence—which would fade / If it were mingled not with [that
                        of Prometheus]” (832–33), which is to say the affective life Act One has
                        worked hard to release—or rather, to keep “unregarded” (3.4.179), to borrow
                        a word from a different context in Act Three. Once the last of the Furies
                        vanishes, Prometheus invokes “two woes: / To speak and to behold” (646–47).
                        Earth having “spare[d]” (647) him one by re-calling the echoes of his curse,
                        the poem now tackles the second vehicle by which emotion has transferred
                        itself: the Enlightenment power of the gaze. Earth thus calls upon “those
                        subtle and fair spirits / Whose homes are the dim caves of human thought”;
                        who “behold / Beyond that twilight realm, as in a glass, / The future”
                        (658–63); and who “breathe, and sicken not, / The atmosphere of human
                        thought” (675–76). This glimpse into, as opposed to gaze upon, the future
                        carries the affective force of “despair / Mingled with love, and then
                        dissolved in sound” (756–57) before it can calcify into image. The force of
                        affect in the poem will now be carried by the materiality of sound that
                        contains it, not as emotion, but as a feeling in which, as Panthea says
                        struggling to speak, “all . . . words are drowned” (758). This “form of
                        Love” (763), like Shelley’s “shape all light” in <title level="m">The
                            Triumph of Life</title>, is constituted by the “sense” of sound that
                        “Remains . . . like the Omnipotence / Of music when the inspired voice and
                        lute / Languish” but carries on “through the deep and labyrinthine soul”
                            (801–05).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Here I mark my indebtedness, again, to
                            Julie Carlson’s analysis of Shelley’s similes as invoking the “feel” of
                            love, and to an unpublished essay on <title level="m">The Triumph of
                                Life </title>by Chris Washington that reads the poem as what I would
                            call the triumph of, to borrow a word from Deleuze, an incompossible
                            love: love <emph>as </emph>incompossible. Washington writes: “Shelley’s
                            theory of love suggests not the egoistic chaos of a world lost to
                            political anarchy but rather a radical politics of love that creates
                            worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests new types of life,
                            of living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world
                            without us we could never have possibly anticipated because those worlds
                            do not yet exist” (courtesy of the author).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The force of this form, which is to say the form that the force itself takes
                        as feeling—the form <emph>of</emph> feeling—is Ione and Panthea’s reading of
                        the turmoil in Prometheus’ soul while sitting at his feet throughout Act
                        One. Specifically, Panthea reads this affect as it is registered by Ione,
                        then carried by Panthea to Asia as the “wordless converse” (2.1.52) that has
                        all along been transpiring between Asia and Prometheus.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            My ensuing reading of this “wordless converse” is indebted to Rajan’s
                            account of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound </title>in <title level="m">The Supplement of Reading</title>. For Rajan,
                            communication through the eyes bypasses language, yet offers an exchange
                            equally complex. In Rajan’s deconstructive reading, affect, like
                            language, functions (or threatens to function) logocentrically to close
                            of its own complexity, whereas I might argue for a more Kristevan
                            reading in which affect, like the semiotic, persistently disrupts any
                            symbolic or representational system. That is to say, affect at once
                            perpetuates the ocular transference of affect, but circumvents the
                            coercive power of the gaze. </note> Asia instructs Panthea to “Lift up
                        thine eyes / And let me read thy dream” (55–56), which is actually two
                        dreams, one of which, tellingly, she “remember[s] not” (61). In the other
                        dream Panthea envisions the liberation of Prometheus’ body, coerced by the
                        feeling of Jupiter’s tyranny, to reveal “the glory of that form / Which
                        lives unchanged within,” through which “his voice fell / Like music which
                        makes giddy the dim brain / Faint with intoxication of keen joy” (64–67).
                        Imploring Panthea to “lift thine eyes on me,” she “[feels] / His presence
                        flow and mingle through my blood / Till it became his life and his grew mine
                        / And I was thus absorbed” (70, 79–82). To Asia, the transmission of these
                        “words” are at first “as the air”: “I feel them not . . . oh, lift / Thine
                        eyes that I may read his written soul!” (108–10). This exchange materializes
                        feeling, not as emotion, but as the situation or event of its own unfolding,
                        the “written” quality of this experience as “soul” being the shape it takes
                            <emph>as </emph>it unfolds. The interchange between Panthea and Asia
                        thus transpires as through a glass darkly, a mirror without surface in which
                        the transmission of affect is “dark, far, measureless / Orb within orb, and
                        line through line inwoven” (116–17). </p>
                  <p> This transmission having been enacted in the first scene, the sound of
                        echoes is then transported in the second scene through a Semichorus of
                        Spirits, which revives the melancholy voice of Earth as it fades, “Till some
                        new strain of feeling bear / The song” (2.2.34–35) into the third scene,
                        where music materializes on Earth a sound “Awful as silence” (2.3.36). Asia
                        describes this event as the “sun-awakened avalanche” that unleashes the
                        “thought by thought . . . piled” by “Heaven-defying minds,” “till some great
                        truth / Is loosened, and the nations echo round / Shaken to their roots”
                        (37, 39–42). Asia and Panthea are carried as if to the previously
                        “tongueless caverns” of the Earth, specifically the cave of Demogorgon in
                        which “A spell is treasured but for thee alone” (88). Here they confront “a
                        mighty Darkness / Filling the seat of power,” “Ungazed upon and
                        shapeless:—neither limb / Nor form nor outline” (2.4.2–6). But, “[they] feel
                        it is / A living Spirit” (6-7). In her confrontation with Demogorgon, Asia
                        is told that, ultimately, “the Abysm / [Cannot] vomit forth its secrets,”
                        for “a voice / Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless” (114–16). In one of
                        the poem’s key statements of the ineluctability of necessity, it would
                        “avail [not] to bid thee <emph>gaze</emph> / On the revolving world” or “to
                        bid speak / Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change,” for “To these / All
                        things are subject but eternal Love” (117–20; my emphasis). In this way,
                        “eternal Love” comes to signify that moment in which feeling, as event,
                        ruptures things as they are to reveal, to return to Badiou, the truth of the
                        subject’s experience. Put another way, this truth <emph>of
                        </emph>experience, at the moment of its happening, becomes radically
                        incommensurate with the situation from which it emerged, yet within which it
                        remains ineluctably enmeshed except as it (potentially) shifts this
                        situation’s terms of reference.</p>
                  <p> The poem’s utopian thrust suggests that transformation attends this
                        evolution. As Asia ascends from her encounter, Panthea tells her she can
                        feel “How thou art changed!” but “dare not look on thee”: “I feel, but see
                        thee not” (2.5.16–17). Emissary of the atmosphere of love that is the Earth
                        transformed by a kind of cosmic “sympathy” (34), the voice of Spirits alone
                        now governs the poem’s unfolding, in which the “breath” of the “Life of
                        life” is exchanged “between” the “lips” they “enkindle,” and are then
                        “screen[ed] . . . / In those looks where whoso gazes / Faints, entangled in
                        their mazes” (2.5.48–53). Shelley’s use of “screen” means at once,
                        paradoxically, to obstruct, to divide, to protect, and (to borrow Shelley’s
                        own use in <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> [1813]), to “conceal, obscure,
                        or disguise” (OED). Taken together, the “screen” also evokes for us as
                        contemporary readers an instance of cinematic encounter in which neither
                        gaze holds the other captive but instead suggests a reciprocity, not between
                        bounded subjects, but of an agency without agents. In this moment of
                        Heideggerian <foreign>Schein</foreign>, existence simultaneously reveals
                        itself to and hides itself from our grasp,<note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the

                        inextricable from one another in these matrices of feeling in which Asia
                        experiences her “soul [as] an enchanted boat”: “Till like one in slumber
                        bound / Borne to the Ocean, I float down, around, / Into a Sea profound, of
                        ever-spreading sound” (82–84). Here the two-way circuit of desire that keeps
                        subjects in their place through a Jupiterian transmission of affect is now
                        “Without a course—without a star— / But by the instinct of sweet Music
                        driven” (89–90).</p>
                  <p> It is in light of the disembodied materiality of sound accomplished in Act
                        Two that we then read the dramatic irony of Jupiter’s opening speech in Act
                        Three. Here he anticipates a spirit “which unbodied now / Between us,
                        floats, felt although unbeheld, / Waiting the incarnation” (3.1.44–46),
                        shortly after which Demogorgon arrives to take Jupiter to “dwell together /
                        Henceforth in darkness” (55–56). Instead, Hercules arrives to unbind
                        Prometheus, enacted without fuss in a stage direction at the opening of
                        Scene Three. This apparently negligible event at same time signifies the
                        quantum and cosmic space and time of transformation itself between the at
                        once adamantine and utterly ephemeral nature of a Jupiterian emotional
                        tyranny. In the cave to which Prometheus and Asia will retire (which journey
                        remains at the level of prophecy in the poem), Prometheus enjoins Ione to
                        “chant fragments of sea-music,” which shall resonate with “echoes of the
                        human world, which tell / Of the low voice of love, almost unheard” (27,
                        44–45): <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Yet as if to scatter these “fragments” of “wandering
                        voices” and “shadows . . . / Of all that man becomes” (57–58), Prometheus
                        then implores her to give to the Spirit of the Hour the “curved shell that
                        Proteus old / Made Asia’s nuptial boon,” which contains a “voice to be
                        accomplished” (3.3.65–67). Thus “Loosening its mighty music . . . it shall
                        be / As thunder mingled with clear echoes” (81–82), what Act Four calls “an
                        Ocean / Of clear emotion” (96–97). Echoes that are “clear” are at once pure,
                        bright, transparent, unclouded, capable of allowing sound to pass without
                        obstruction—again, screens both through and upon which sound might transfer.
                        As Prometheus then bends to kiss the ground, Earth responds, “I hear—I
                        feel—” (84). Here the “sound” and “look” of feeling mobilize its meta-global
                        economy as Prometheus’s “touch runs down / Even to the adamantine central
                        gloom / Along these marble veins” (“stony veins” [1.153]) as “The Warmth of
                        an immortal youth shoots down / Circling” (3.3.85–90). Like Panthea’s
                        absorption by and in Prometheus, or Prometheus by and in Asia, unbound
                        Prometheus becomes the avatar of an unrestrained feeling that is at once the
                        blood and breath of the earth’s affective ecology, the agency of its sound
                        and sight. Or as Prometheus says to the Spirit of the Hour, “We feel what
                        thou hast heard and seen” (97). As if further to mark this final
                        transformation of feeling, the Spirit, prophesying the “mighty change as I
                        had felt within / Expressed in outward things” (129–30), acknowledges how
                        humans will be “Speaking the wisdom once they could not think, / Looking the
                        emotions once they feared to feel” (157–58). This last phrasing visualizes
                        emotion, as in Bell or Darwin, as if to mark the image’s capacity to
                        register and thus fix feeling, yet also as if to fulfill the poem’s promise
                        of an unrestrained emotional life, the migration of feeling across
                        subjective borders, unchecked throughout the world and beyond.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> I take my sense of the motion of emotion, again, from Sha,

                  </p>
                  <p> Yet in a final, remarkable turn, Act Three “[tears] aside” the “painted veil
                        . . . called life” that “mimicked, as with colours idly spread, / All men
                        believed and hoped” to reveal man “Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed—but
                        man” (190–92, 194–95). To leave man “but man” is to reclaim a feeling
                        humanity lost through Jupiter’s tyranny but regained through the possibility
                        of love. Yet man also remains “Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like
                        slaves, / From chance and death and mutability,” the “clogs of that which
                        else might oversoar / The loftiest star of unascended Heaven / Pinnacled dim
                        in the intense inane” (200–01, 202–04). In Act Two, as we have seen,
                        Demogorgon tells Asia that “All things are subject to [Fate, Time, Occasion,
                        Chance and Change] but eternal Love.” Within this penultimate context,
                        feeling materializes, not the utopianism of love, which would be once again
                        to trap “All men” in what they “believed and hoped,” but a future to come in
                        (as Reiman and Fraistat annotate “intense inane”) a “formless void of
                        infinite space” (269n). Here what remains incommensurate nonetheless
                        registers with “intense” force, the indistinguishable locus of feeling
                        itself as the air we breathe. In this sense, although Shelley calls it love,
                        which is to invoke the political idealism of a society renovated by
                        sympathetic encounters without violence, terror, or tyranny, it is also love
                        as the inevitability and unavoidability <emph>of</emph> encounter that
                            <emph>is</emph> our feeling life. Like drive as the difference between
                        desire in Freud’s psychic economy, feeling moves always with an
                        unanticipated trajectory. Or as Shelley writes in “On Love,” “It is that
                        powerful attraction towards all that we conceive or fear or hope beyond
                        ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                        void and seek to awaken in all things that are a community with what we
                        experience within ourselves” (503). Love materializes this desire to have
                        “another’s nerves . . . vibrate to our own, . . . the beams of their eyes .
                        . . kindle at once and melt into our own” (503). </p>
                  <p>Here, however, the feeling mode that would transform the world is a
                        “perpetual Orphic song, / Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng / Of
                        thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapes were” (415–17). In this
                        “work [that] shall be called the Promethean” (158), feeling is (necessarily)
                        in constant flux, what Sha calls the “motion of emotion”: “Break the dance,
                        and scatter the song; / Let some depart and some remain” (159–60); or, “Even
                        whilst we speak / New notes arise . . . What is that awful sound?” (184–85).
                        In such gaps Ione hears “under-notes, / Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening
                        tones / Which pierce the sense and live within the soul” (189–91), a
                        labyrinthine reality—Earth’s “multitudinous Orb” (253)—described at length
                        (194–318). Yet we can recall that Daedalus, who built the ground upon which
                        Ariadne danced or the labyrinth into which Theseus carried Ariadne’s golden
                        thread so that he could slay the Minotaur and get back out, also created
                        wings for Icarus to fly to the sun, a story without a happy ending.
                        Shelley’s conceptualization of feeling as a labyrinthine matrix from which
                        it is impossible to extract ourselves because there is no “beyond” to this
                        world, one in which feeling traces Deleuzian lines of flight between things
                        that are themselves in flight, is haunted by the specter of fallen
                            gods.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In his reading of <title level="m">The Triumph

                            disaster, meaning “fallen star,” very movingly expresses this notion in
                            terms of us, like Shelley, inhabiting the time of falling and fallen
                            stars in which the only possibility left is love.</note> The transfer of
                        emotion that transpires within and sustains the poem’s environment by Act
                        Four, like that between Asia, Ione, and Panthea, materializes a circuitry in
                        which no one knows whose desire is whose. </p>
                  <p> That is as feeling should be, which carried even to its cosmic dimension
                        produces an endlessly generative movement between beings and things—or
                        rather things <emph>as </emph>beings; or as the Moon says, illuminated by
                        the light of an earth renovated by the love between Prometheus and Asia,
                        “Gazing on thee I feel, I know” (4.363). This loss of identity is not a
                        problem insofar as it signifies a kind of unrestrained communication between
                        people and things that is Shelley’s ideal of a world liberated from the
                        Jupiterian tyranny of words and looks, the uninhibited flow of a “wordless
                        converse” that finds Shelley inspired by the spirit of Godwin’s ideal of
                        unrestrained conversation. Yet Shelley’s description in “On Love,” and the
                        Moon’s subsequent statement that “a lover or chameleon / Grows like what it
                        looks upon” (4.483–84), encrypts the possibility of subjects at once formed
                        and trapped in the mirror stage of their own constitution. In this world of
                        “A universal sound like words” (518), Demogorgon’s final speech rings rather
                        ominously. It speaks of “Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom and Endurance” as
                        “spells by which to reassume / An empire o’er the disentangled Doom” (562,
                        568–69). This is to register the <emph>entangled </emph>labyrinth of feeling
                        as the <emph>only </emph>spell we have, the drive of affect reflecting a
                        mindless force that is our being without Being. Here I am reminded of
                        Khalip’s notion of the inhuman automaticity or relationality between things.
                        In this way the poem re-invokes the complex Lacanian circuit of desire in
                        which we only know our desire as that of the other, through which neither
                        sides owns desire but rather circulates in the non-space of transference
                        between their subjectivities. Put another way, in the “wordless converse”
                        that is the exchange of feeling, we are eternally left to find our own way.
                        This is neither tragedy, nor comedy, nor farce, but it does locate feeling
                        itself as incompossible with any experience that is the very situation it
                        materializes and by which it is materialized.</p>
                  <p> Perhaps this is where Shelley means to leave us. In Act One the Chorus of
                        Spirits sing, “Though Ruin now Love’s shadow be” (780), as if, like
                        Benjamin’s Angel of History, we proceed into the future, like Orpheus
                        walking away from Eurydice, always by virtue of the past disaster of a
                        feeling incommensurate with itself. In <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>,
                        Shelley’s vision, torn between idealism and skepticism, is over-ambitiously
                        cosmic, as if (unintentionally, but inevitably) out of touch with the world
                        it seeks to express and thus reform. The empiricism of the poem’s
                        labyrinthine footnotes threaten to deflate the poem’s otherwise lofty
                        visionary spirit, like Shelley’s warning in <title level="m">A Defence of
                            Poetry </title>(1821) that the world threatens to bury us with our
                        knowledge. Certainly the political dimension of Shelley’s verse, especially
                        as he envisions its devastating progress in <title level="m">The Triumph of
                            Life</title> (1824), imagines an idealism without absolutes. In this
                        sense, <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> is resolutely earthbound,
                        though anything but terrestrial, for here Shelley envisions nothing less
                        than an ecology sustained by its own emotional life, a vitality of cosmic
                        expansiveness that marks the inextricable link between human and nonhuman
                        sensoria. We remain unable to grasp this broader feeling network because we
                        exist in its midst as both its products and generators. Feeling sustains the
                        poem’s atmosphere as part of a global emotional ecology. This ecology
                        indicates not just the transfer between subjects and the world, but the
                        movement of affective transference that is literally the air we breathe, the
                        very mode and matrix of our existence. Subjects call the world into
                        emotional existence and this existence materializes their emotional
                        lives—the life <emph>of </emph>emotion—in turn. Joy, hope, happiness
                        constitute the possible fulfillment of the poem’s emotional life as
                        something devoutly to be wished for but ruinously possible, an existence in
                        which, as Shelley concludes the poem, we must “love” and “bear” and “hope,
                        till Hope creates / From its own wreck the thing it contemplates” (573–74).
                        Which is to say that Shelley also seems aware that affect shatters the
                        subject. Leo Bersani argues that “Freud’s most profound originality . . . is
                        to propose . . . that the sexualizing of the ego is identical to the
                        shattering of the ego” (66). In this catastrophe “affect [is set] free from
                        psychic organization; unbound affect produces the excitement of
                            <foreign>jouissance</foreign>,” which at its most extreme is that of a
                        “satisfied aggression [that] at once hyperbolizes the ego and risks
                        shattering its boundaries” (67). Put another way, only this catastrophe of
                        feeling—this feeling <emph>of </emph>catastrophe--reminds us we are alive.
                        Shelley’s lyrical drama labours resolutely against aggression. And yet, the
                        poem’s <foreign>jouissance </foreign>of unrestrained feeling works by a
                        shattering or “scattering” that refuses to let subjects settle—refuses
                        subjects altogether except as they are conscripted into being by the event

               <p rend="noCount"> This essay examines the cognitive underpinnings of affect
                    circulation in the poetry of Coleridge and Keats, poets who sought to shape the
                    reading experiences of their contemporary and future audiences. Both poets
                    utilized the automaticity inherent in reading popular genres like the Gothic and
                    Romance, as they immerse their readers in a flood of sensation. Yet,
                    interruptions to the narrative flow complicate moments of composition and
                    reading, ultimately highlighting a complex cognitive and affective work
                    happening through passive reading. While such sensational forms of reading were
                    often disparaged during the Romantic period, modern cognitive psychology shows
                    these “passive” or “immersive” forms are actually complex in their affective
                    work. By structurally regulating the sensory experience, controlling the
                    affective overflow, and calling attention to the cognitive and cultural
                    processes at work underneath the fiction, these authors ensure we will not be
                    caught in a dream world for long without awaking more enlightened. </p>

                  <p>Medical science and literature converged in eighteenth-century and early
                        nineteenth-century debates over embodied reading experiences. For
                        Romantic-era thinkers, reading was not simply an intellectual pursuit but a
                        bodily exercise, and this belief has conflicting implications. The
                        physiological element of reading facilitates an intimate connection between
                        the bodies involved in acts of reading—those of the author, reader, and
                        text. These newly understood levels of intimacy open possibilities for the
                        transformative work of literature; however, the danger of such physiological
                        connection is the ease with which a reader’s body and mind can be
                        influenced. Immersive reading—getting lost in the affective throes of
                        narrative—seems to include a loss of the thinking, reasoning self. Immersive
                        reading perhaps even leaves the reader at the mercy of the text. </p>
                  <p>In the Romantic era, the mind itself becomes increasingly embodied, located
                        at the site of the brain instead of existing as an immaterial entity.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Many early eighteenth-century medical texts sought to
                            prove the immateriality of the soul. For instance, Thomas Branch’s
                                <title level="m">Thoughts on Dreaming </title>(1738) explores
                            dreaming as proof that the soul exists as a “separate state” from the
                            body (2). Likewise, Walter Charlton’s <title level="m">A Natural History
                                of the Passions </title>(1701) distinguishes between the Rational
                            and the Sensitive souls, both of which can influence the body, though
                            “made of substance purely spiritual” (8). However, Andrew Fyfe writes
                                <title level="m">A System of Anatomy and Physiology</title> in 1795
                            in which he compiles medical research and claims that the soul must be
                            in the head alone, not descending into the spinal marrow (67-68).
                        </note> Alan Richardson traces this line of thinking through theorists and
                        scientists like Edmund Burke and Joseph Priestley to poets like Percy Bysshe
                        Shelley and John Keats, demonstrating their belief that the mind is an organ
                        subject to growth and expansion. In the same way one would build up a muscle
                        through strategic use, the brain can be enlarged through a sort of “mental
                        calisthenics” (Richardson 28). As Priestley explains in his 1777 lecture on
                        the sublime, the mental organ dilates to “conceive a great object” (119).
                        Romantic poets take up the responsibility for the growth of the reader’s
                        mind, debating upon and experimenting with ways to engage their audience in
                        effective mental exercises. Romantic-era poets such as William Wordsworth
                        and Samuel Taylor Coleridge rated the novel as senseless entertainment meant
                        for mindless consumption by a public whose sensibilities were dull and
                        unrefined. In Book II of <title level="m">The Friend</title> (1809),
                        Coleridge writes: “The habit of receiving pleasure without any exertion of
                        thought, by the mere excitement of curiosity and sensibility, may be justly
                        ranked among the worst effects of habitual novel reading” (2:151). Coleridge
                        goes on to say that absorption in the plot and sensory experience of the
                        tale—taking pleasure from “mere excitement of curiosity and
                        sensibility”—“dwarf[s]” cognitive capacity (2:151). According to Coleridge,
                        passive reading (absorption without intellectual and imaginative
                        contribution) inhibits the development of a reader’s brain. Here we see that
                        passive or immersive reading fails to properly engage the brain in exercise.
                        Instead of enlarging the organ, improper reading practices lead to brain
                        atrophy. Wordsworth and Coleridge believed an epidemic of novel readers
                        meant sensational stories sold best because these tales are what can excite
                        the dulled sensibilities of dwarfed brains. How could literature perform
                        transformative work on the psyche of a reader who was unable to sense and
                        feel, to engage the affect of a text? </p>
                  <p>While such popular genres were often disparaged, recent cognitive psychology
                        shows these forms that encourage passive or immersive reading are actually
                        complex in their affective work. A cognitive mechanism for “reading” social
                        situations enables the passivity that Romantic writers feared. The immersed
                        attitude of a passive reader can be attributed to the cognitive architecture
                        humans evolved to navigate social environments. In Theory of Mind theory
                        (ToM), cognitive psychologists point to ways we read people through their
                        actions and behaviors, attributing emotion, motivation, and beliefs to them
                        automatically. This seems obvious, but, in fact, connecting outward signs to
                        inward states is an evolved skill. In <title level="m">Why We Read
                            Fiction</title> (2006), Lisa Zunshine writes that when we engage fiction
                        using ToM, we do so in the same way we engage and contextualize social
                        situations in the real world. As we read the actions and the dialogue of
                        fictional characters, we ascribe complicated internal systems of memory,
                        emotion, and motivation them. She explains: <quote>[T]he cognitive
                            mechanisms that evolved to process information about thoughts and
                            feelings of human beings are constantly on the alert, checking out their
                            environment for cues that fit their input conditions. On some level,
                            then, works of fiction manage to “cheat” these mechanisms into
                            “believing” that they are in the presence of material that they were
                            “designed” to process, that is, that they are in the presence of agents
                            endowed with a potential for a rich array of intentional stances.

                        minds are cheated into the same kind of cognitive processing of fiction as

                        neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene (7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Dehaene explains
                            that the brain has no specific hardware solely evolved to reading, but
                            rather the human brain’s neural architecture recycles existing pathways
                            in order to create the meaning of words on the page (7).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To expand our understanding of the cognitive architecture at work as a reader
                        employs ToM, let us consider recent revelations in cognitive linguistics.
                        Key to the cognitive process of reading is the recruitment of the motor and
                        sensory regions of the brain to make sense of and even replicate the affect
                        in language. Noting recent experiments by Pulvermuller and his colleagues,
                        Dehaene explains:
                    <quote>Some verbs such as “bite” or “kiss” evoked mouth movements, others hand
                        actions (“write,” “throw”), and yet others actions performed by legs and
                        feet (“kick,” “walk”). A remarkable fragmentation of meaning was observed:
                        each of the verb types activated a distinct sector of the premotor cortex,
                        at the location represented in the “motor homunculus,” or map of our body.
                        Thus word meaning seems to be literally embodied in our brain networks. A
                        string of letters only makes sense if it evokes, in a few hundred
                        milliseconds, myriad features dispersed in the sensory, motor, and abstract
                        brain maps for location, number, intention. (113)</quote>
                    The ease with which humans comprehend the written word (comprehension takes
                        only a few hundred milliseconds) and how comprehension relies upon a
                        translation through the body is truly striking, and Dehaene uses the analogy
                        of a tidal bore to describe the rush of processing systems that engage in
                        translating word on the pages into meaning (114). </p>
                  <p>These findings seem to offer an anatomical basis for the fears held by
                        eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century writers for the passive novel
                        reader’s vulnerability should he be caught up in a dream world. Feeling the
                        text on his body, a passive reader could easily forget the distinctions
                        between fiction and reality. Given the effortlessness in translation of the
                        literary to nonliterary signification, we know the reverse is equally
                        probable: we mentally process actual events as if they were analogous to the
                        virtual comings and goings of imagined characters. Indeed, this possibility
                        inspires the anxiety surrounding literature’s influence on an unthinking
                        readership. Zunshine elaborates this point: <quote>It seems to me that our
                            unease on this occasion stems from our intuitive realization that on
                            some level our evolved cognitive architecture indeed does not fully
                            distinguish between real and fictional people. Faced with Elizabeth
                            Bennet and Mr. Darcy, our Theory of Mind jumps at the opportunity (so to
                            speak) to speculate about their past, present, and future states of
                            mind, even as we realize that these “airy forms [and] phantoms of
                            imagination” do not deserve such treatment. (18–19)</quote> If we are
                        passive readers of fiction (especially irresponsibly written novels that
                        present overwrought sentiment or sensational events), we allow the phantoms
                        of imagination to infiltrate our everyday interactions. We see from Jane
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1817), as it parodies
                        the genre and its readers, how this is the perceived danger of reading too
                        many Gothic novels.  </p>
                  <p>Though historically we have ascribed a failure to distinguish between fiction
                        and reality to the lost control over one’s rational mind, the most recent
                        findings of cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology find that the
                        mind has evolved in ways that make the mental confluence of fiction and
                        reality healthful. Zunshine examines how readers become aware of their
                        cognitive processing in the reading experience. She concludes that the
                        pleasure derived from reading fiction is satisfaction in recognizing our
                        cognitive mastery of the material, our ability to operate ToM. Fiction is a
                        space where we can experience an automatic (though advanced) activity of the
                        mind, but the pleasure derived is from seeing ourselves being immersed,
                        being automatic.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Similarly, Richardson identifies a
                            phenomenon in the Romantic era that he calls the “neural sublime.” In
                            moments of disruption, the subject is “not marveling at the power of
                            Reason [as with the Kantian sublime] but rather stunned by the capacity
                            and complexity of the human brain” (Richardson 29). </note> Through
                        narrative, our minds are allowed to both work and see themselves work. In
                        this we are stunned and even made uncomfortable by how much of our cognition
                        is inaccessible. Perhaps the inaccessibility is due to the automaticity with
                        which our brains process information on the page or in our social worlds. As
                        readers we hold two contrasting states of mind: we are performing a
                        cognitive task automatically, and we are aware of that automaticity though
                        we cannot fully untangle the neuronal pathways. We are not, then, entirely
                        passive readers: we are aware of our own “passivity” on some level. </p>
                  <p>In what follows, I will show how immersive, affective reading experiences of
                        works by Coleridge and Keats facilitate the movement between the imagined
                        and the real. Absorption in the text happens so readily that the cognitive
                        work resembles the ease of social cognition in ToM. Yet, these Romantic
                        writers utilize structural abnormalities to disrupt the immersion and call
                        attention to the embodied cognitive process of immersive reading, thus
                        encouraging the growth of the reader’s mind. By placing themselves at a site
                        of cooperative reading with alongside their audience, Coleridge and Keats
                        reaffirm the intimate connection between the bodies involved in acts of
                        reading. </p>

                  <head>Immersive Reading and Material Sublimity</head>
                  <p>Eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century writers saw the slippage between
                        fiction and reality happening as reading habits changed with the
                        proliferation of popular fiction. In response, Wordsworth sought to teach
                        his readers how to maintain distance between the emotional and the rational.
                        If Wordsworth’s mode is, as Keats said, the “egotistical sublime,” a
                        defensive position that distances a reader from immediate sensation in order
                        to maintain the integrity of the thinking self, Keats’s “material sublime”
                        offers a counter-model to the Wordsworthian poet: the material sublime
                        embraces the overflow of powerful emotion in the moments of aesthetic
                        experience. The idea of the material sublime emerges in a poem to John
                        Hamilton Reynolds (“To J.H. Reynolds, Esq.”), written on 25 March 1818 in
                        the midst of <title level="m">Isabella</title>’s composition: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,</l>
                           <l>Would all their colours from the sunset take,</l>
                           <l>From something of material sublime,</l>
                           <l>Rather than shadow our own soul’s daytime</l>
                           <l>In the dark void of night. (Keats l. 67–71)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Notably, this exaltation longs to join a passive openness
                        to sensory input with the active play of the mind’s store. While the wish
                        for a dreaming state may appear initially passive, the forceful action
                        “take” stressed at the end of line 68 contrasts with the weaker feminine
                        meter of the opposing verb “shadow.” Dreaming, whether in sleep or in a
                        waking dream, is a joint act of sensual imprint and imaginative projection,
                        while shadowing is a flat, colorless reiteration of the self, the shadow of
                        “our own soul’s daytime.” And while a familiar daytime shadow may provide
                        comfort in “the dark void of night,” Keats’s ideal poet relishes
                        “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact
                        &amp; reason” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II. 213). For Keats, a poet
                        is capable of existing in negative space, the space of immersion and
                        passivity, and, for him, this space fosters growth. </p>
                  <p>Coleridge also advocates for sensory immersion, a radical openness to
                        material (and textual) excess. For example, in “Kubla Khan,” (1816) the muse
                        overtakes the poet while in an unconscious dream state. Here, Coleridge
                        imagines himself as the vehicle for a larger message, a truth that differs
                        in effect from Wordsworthian self-reflection in the egotistical sublime.
                        Where the egotistical sublime positions the poet prominently as the
                        interpreter and philosopher, always in control of the emotions and message
                        being transferred, the Coleridgean poet dissolves into an ether of affect
                        and impressions. The feelings and impressions cohere to form ideas. Rather
                        than emerging from a disembodied mind, the body of the poet cannot be
                        disentangled from the mind as together they translate meaning to the
                        audience. </p>
                  <p>This Coleridgean vision of the poet can be read as a model for Keats’s idea
                        of the material sublime, and I argue that Keats uses this Coleridgean poet
                        in his own Gothic Romance <title level="m">Isabella; or the Pot of
                            Basil</title> (1818). Coleridge establishes a poet figure both in the
                        narrative itself and in the bibliographic material that frames and
                        contextualizes the narrative. The poet of the narrative seems to have been
                        overtaken by the material excess of sensation, but, importantly, Coleridge’s
                        sensual excess in “Kubla Khan” results from the act of reading “Purchas’s
                        Pilgrimage.” Like an immersed reader of narrative, the poet has invited the
                        material and textual into his body and has consequently abdicated control to
                        the text. The literary and the nonliterary become confused for the entranced
                        poet/reader. Nevertheless, a sensually immersive poetic state is fraught
                        with difficulties. The poet is an imperfect medium for the dream vision
                        because of his existence in the modern world. At any moment, he may be woken
                        from his trance state into his conscious reality. With a knock at the door,
                        Coleridge is brought back to a self-consciousness where the
                            <foreign>cogito</foreign> resumes control over sensory experience and
                        the boundaries between self and outside, the literary and the nonliterary,
                        are reasserted. Yet, Coleridge’s waking is a narrative structure, designed
                        to both allow and disallow the analogous slippage between fiction and
                        reality. Immersive reading engages the reader in the affective ecology of
                        the text: the reader feels as if she is participating in the narrative,
                        experiencing the movement and the emotion through ToM. By reasserting the
                        authorial voice, in a seeming Wordsworthian move, Coleridge calls attention
                        to the cognitive processes and the narrative devices that have allowed for
                        the immersive experience in the first place. </p>
                  <p> “Kubla Khan” immerses its reader in a sublimity of movement and sensation,
                        until, like the poet himself, she awakes to remember that this is a
                        constructed experience. “Kubla Khan” seeks a balance between sensation and
                        sensibility by creating a safe space for the free movement of affect within
                        the poem or dream and then calling attention to this designed space of
                        immersive reading. The movement through Coleridge’s poem takes the reader
                        down the river Arve, deeper and deeper into the dream space until we reach a
                        vision of a poet at the center of a chasm—his “flashing eyes” and “floating
                        hair” suggest an otherworldly trance. He is caught up in the sublimity of
                        ice caves, geysers, incense, and ancient forests. The reader and dreamer
                        alike are smothered in sensual imagery, absorbed in the sexual arc of the
                        narrative, until the poem reaches a climactic threat of eruption. Here, the
                        speaker halts the narrative action. Outside of the narrative and its sensual
                        excess, the speaker shifts his focus from the sublime scene he was
                        transcribing to a desire to build his own sunny domes in air. This is
                        canonically read as a desire to compose his own poetry. However, the speaker
                        doesn’t compose his own fantasy tale at this point, but rather speculates on
                        the audience’s reaction to his poetic process: “And all who heard should see
                        them there, /And all should cry, Beware! Beware!” (48–49). The repeated
                        exclamation, “Beware! Beware!” and the repetition of “And all” indicate the
                        poet’s anxiety over how he will be received. He will be misunderstood by all
                        who encounter his poem. The audience will believe he has lost control not
                        only over his poem but also over himself. These repeated phrases, just like
                        the circles to be woven round him, contain the poet like a straight-jacket,
                        wrapping him up for the safety of himself and his readers. This is the
                        danger inherent in being immersed in aesthetic experience: losing control in
                        an automaticity of emotions (flashing eyes) and body (floating hair). </p>
                  <p>As a way of containing the space for immersive reading, Coleridge imposes
                        multiple circles of context for the poem’s composition. These circles spread
                        outward from the visionary poet of the narrative to form multiple levels of
                        authorship. Closest to the vision, of course, is the speaker of the poem,
                        presumably the sleeping Coleridge, though his identity is only established
                        in the prefatory note. In fact, the speaker is only given a first-person
                        pronoun at the end of the fragment when he steps outside of the narrative
                        motion and action to reflect: “A damsel with a dulcimer / In a vision once I
                        saw” (37–38). The sudden appearance of a first-person speaker calls
                        attention to the poem as a material object, constructed by an author, and
                        the invisible cognitive processes involved in this act of reading are
                        brought to the surface of the text for inspection. The reader is confronted
                        with her own act of reading and the fact of her subconscious immersion in
                        the poem’s atmosphere up to this point. Absorbed in the sensual immediacy
                        and the movement of the poem, the reader does not realize the poem is
                        composed in tranquility, as a recollection. The poem seems to have been
                        composed organically, in real time, as the reader (and speaker of the poem)
                        travels along the Arve. However, outside of the text itself, we see that the
                        woken poet Coleridge writes from a future time of reflection upon his
                        interrupted dream state. He attempts (but fails) to recall the complete poem
                        that was composed in full during his dream. The poem is a constructed space,
                        and its multiple layers of authorship further complicate its history. In a
                        prefatory note titled “Of the Fragment of Kubla Khan,” Coleridge attributes
                        his subject matter to falling asleep while reading about Kubla Khan’s palace
                        and gardens in “Purchas’s Pilgrimage,” thus adding another layer of
                        authorship to this synthetic dream production. Finally, outside of the
                        author and his source tale, we get a second poet called upon to validate the
                        worth of this fragment. Lord Byron, “a poet of great and deserved
                        celebrity,” and his publisher John Murray are named as patrons of “Kubla
                            Khan.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Holmes explains that “Kubla Khan,”
                            though written in 1797, was not published until 1816, when it appeared
                            alongside <title level="m">Christabel</title> and <title level="m">The
                                Pains of Sleep</title>, at the behest of Lord Byron. Coleridge had
                            recited the poem one morning while visiting Byron in Piccadilly
                            (426).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Coleridge’s imposition of these multiple layers of authorship attempts to
                        control the reception of his poem, to ensure the narrative gets understood
                        in a particular way that protects the poet and his unconventional model of
                        composition from scrutiny. He showcases a model that counters the
                        imperatives to rationality and composure characteristic of
                        post-Enlightenment culture. The abandon modeled in Coleridge’s dream vision
                        goes against the reigning model of poetry, exemplified by Wordsworth. The
                        levels of authority that encircle the poet figure in “Kubla Khan” depict a
                        poet actively engaging a literary tradition through reading Purchas and
                        associating with Byron. In this way, Coleridge offloads responsibility for
                        the poem to his environment and his friends. However, these protective
                        layers do more than preempt critique. The layers of context impose
                        boundaries for the reading experience: they establish a socially (and
                        professionally) acceptable environment where sensation can enjoy a free play
                        of sorts. The poet is entranced for the composition of the poem, and thus
                        without the direction of his conscious mind. He is a reader, engaging in the
                        same sort of absorption in a text as his own readers do. He, too, finds
                        himself immersed in seductive tales that take him out of reality. Though he
                        criticizes passive reading in<title level="m"> The Friend</title> and
                        elsewhere, here Coleridge embraces the affective and cognitive openness that
                        is characteristic of reading a sensual and sensational text. In Coleridge’s
                        model, the poet’s body takes precedence over the mind. However, Coleridge
                        imposes a balance between sensation and sensibility by creating a space for
                        the free movement of affect within the poem or dream and by calling
                        attention to this constructed space of immersive reading. By halting the
                        forward movement of the poem and imposing structures to contextualize the
                        composition of “Kubla Khan” as a history of reading, Coleridge ensures that
                        his audience recognizes the cognitive mechanisms at work. By creating this
                        revelatory moment for his reader, Coleridge anticipates Zunshine’s take on
                        ToM, as the pleasure of mind-reading is being able to see yourself perform
                        the task. Coleridge’s poem facilitates sensual absorption for its readers,
                        rather than disallowing a phenomenological experience of the fiction as
                        Wordsworth’s egotistical sublime does. In fact, the prefatory note to “Kubla
                        Khan” mourns the failure of the poet to transcribe the poem in full. He
                        regrets the interruption of his literary space by a nonliterary reality,
                        but, in replicating this interruption for his readers, Coleridge forces them
                        to evaluate the way their bodies and minds have been at work and learn from
                        it, as he shows he has done himself. </p>

                  <head>Digressing from Boccaccio</head>
                  <p>In <title level="m">Isabella; or the Pot of Basil</title>, Keats positions
                        himself as a self-conscious translator of Boccaccio, becoming the vehicle
                        for another’s transformative aesthetic experience. Keats’s careful attention
                        to this task peeks through the text as he digresses from the narrative to
                        offer apologies for the liberties he takes with his source tale. Begging the
                        forgiveness of Boccaccio and lamenting the disappearance of the Old Romance
                        tradition Boccaccio comes to represent, these interruptions of the tale have
                        often been described as evidence of his youth and immaturity as a poet.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Kurt Heinzelman explains Keats’s sustained attempt at
                            translation with Isabella, that the poet deemed his attempt a failure,
                            and how historically critics have agreed with Keats’s own assessment.
                            Along these lines, see also Ridley 56. Nigel Wood (reads Keats as a
                            “most self-conscious narrative poet;” however, he calls Isabella’s
                            romance narrative apparatus “unsavory by design,” ultimately defending
                            the seeming immaturity as a “calculated narrative tactic” (90). Susan
                            Wolfson argues that scholars should consider digressions more seriously,
                            that “these suspensions of story-telling are not displays of humorous
                            narrative incompetence” (249). </note> Rather, these authorial
                        interludes have a deliberate function, serving to position Keats himself as
                        a reader alongside the readers of genres like Romance and the Gothic,
                            <foreign>en masse</foreign>. Keats’s many interruptions call attention
                        to genre conventions of the grotesque and indecorous by stepping outside of
                        the text at the moments where sensation verges on the sensational. Keats
                        transports the reader out of the text when the narrative becomes most
                        gripping and unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that allow for
                        absorption in the narrative. Ostensibly censoring the text, Keats adopts a
                        seemingly Wordsworthian mode with his interruptions. He stops the forward
                        movement of the narrative and extricates the reader from their absorption in
                        the text, transporting him or her back to the present moment and encouraging
                        a more reflective reading experience. Arguably, Keats regulates the
                        circulation of affect by reasserting the boundary between the literary and
                        nonliterary. The interruptions ensure the reader acknowledges the text is
                        fictional and confined to the space of the page. Like the frames of “Kubla
                        Khan,” the structural abnormalities of this rendering of Boccaccio’s <title level="m">Decameron</title> (c. 1353) show the poet as a reader himself
                        and give the tale a specific history as a reincarnation. They point to a
                        larger literary tradition of Old Romance that precedes and transcends the
                        historical specificity of Boccaccio.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his seminal study
                            of the poem, “Keats and Romance: The ‘Reality’ of <title level="m">Isabella</title>,” Jack Stillinger reads the digressions as Keats’s
                            attempt to modernize the genre of Old Romance with the addition of
                            realism, noting the tension within the poem between Keats’s translation
                            and the original tale. Objecting to the way Stillinger reads the text as
                            “divided against itself,” Susan Wolfson proposes an interpretation that
                            “sees Keats taking advantage of his ambivalence [to the values of ‘old
                            Romance’] to devise a genre of tale-telling whose designs are both
                            narrative and deconstructive” (“Keats’s ‘Isabella’ and the 'Digressions'
                            of 'Romance'"). For Wolfson, creating an immersive reading experience
                            and interrogating the structure of that experience are not necessarily
                            competing objectives within the poem. She writes, “Keats is concerned .
                            . . to reform the way we read romance, even as he entertains us with a
                            romance of sorts” (251). My own interpretation can reconcile Stillinger
                            and Wolfson, as I see the realism in Keats’s revisions working to
                            disrupt the reader’s experience of the sensational narrative.</note>
                        Moreover, the digressions implicate Keats in the very sentimentalism he
                        calls out in the genres of Romance and the Gothic. However, this
                        self-implication opens channels of sympathy between the author and reader,
                        and, through his digressions, Keats establishes <title level="m">Isabella</title> as a joint act of reading a popular form. </p>
                  <p> Among Keats’s first interjections is an apologetic interlude to Boccaccio in
                        which the poet reflects upon the contrast of his own Gothic framing of the
                        tale with the tradition of Old Romance. Here, he first calls the reader’s
                        attention to the text as a constructed space with a history preceding its
                        current iteration: <quote>

                        </lg>
                     </quote> Keats asks forgiveness of Boccaccio and mourns the passing
                        away of Boccaccio’s Italy, the edenic surroundings that first inspired and
                        then listened dutifully to his song. Flattering the author in a move that
                        reads like the epic convention of invoking his muse, Keats declares he is
                        not making the original tale <emph>“more sweet,”</emph> but rather honoring
                        and preserving the writer and his legacy. Indeed, he wishes to “greet” the
                        “gone spirit” through his own song, thus imagining a social introduction to
                        the author. Yet, he fears he has overstepped the social and literary decorum
                        required of his task. By setting up this pastoral context for the source
                        tale, Keats implies the unnaturalness of his sensational additions to the
                        original. The Gothic “glooms” portrayed in Keats’s version of the tale are
                        far from “quiet,” and being so are seemingly ill-suited for a representation
                        of Boccaccio’s theme. </p>
                  <p>Despite acknowledging his failed decorum, Keats makes significant changes to
                        the source tale in order to adapt it for his own context. These adaptations,
                        in turn, call attention to the social nature of cognition and the inherent
                        co-creation of the narrative as the reader’s own minds translates the text
                        to create meaning. If we look back to the main clause of the stanza, we see
                        the poet uses the plural pronoun “we” instead of taking sole responsibility
                        for any wrongs committed. Like the first-person “I” used by Coleridge to
                        halt forward movement down the River Arve, Keats’s “we” presents an
                        immediacy that transports the reader outside of the narrative flow and into
                        a reflective position alongside the poet. No longer is the reader feeling
                        the sensual excess of former passages when the lovers pine over each other
                        to the point of physical sickness or when the lovers meet under the perfume
                        and musk of the hyacinth bower. Together, reader and poet are thinking about
                        the poem as a written text with a history of composition. “We” are aware of
                        the sensual excesses already experienced (those for which the text is
                        currently apologizing), and we may even be prepared to spot further
                        co-opting of our senses and bodies in future passages. A sense of shared
                        responsibility is important as we come to understand the power of reading in
                        shaping the intellectual and moral life of a populace. Keats’s revisions
                        introduce some of the most atrocious historical misdeeds that have made
                        Boccaccio’s song, and all it represents of the idyllic in nature and
                        culture, something long forgotten in nineteenth-century England. From the
                        “we,” the reader begins to see their own responsibility alongside that of
                        the author. Indeed, an author’s responsibility to his or her readership
                        extends beyond the development of an individual reader’s sensibilities as
                        the individual reader can now recognize the atrocities of their contemporary
                        moment and act in response.</p>
                  <p>Keats’s emphasis on institutionalized capitalism is a wholly new addition to
                        the original tale. The brothers’ exploits have long intrigued Romantic

                     </quote> Isabella’s brothers fragment their workers into functional
                        parts, and such objectification figures synecdochically in the poem: the
                        employees are represented as little more than hands, ears, eyes, and loins.
                        As their employers perceive them, the workers’ body parts make up the
                        industrial machine. The famous “Why were they proud?” interjection (Stanza
                        XVI) follows this series of modern tortures and introduces a
                        nineteenth-century critique of the socio-economic system these brothers
                        represent. Keats continues his list of the brother’s wrongs, punctuating it
                        with the repeated question, “Why were they proud?” There is no answer from
                        Boccaccio, nor is there any anticipated answer from his modern reader. The
                        atrocities multiply and the momentum builds, but Keats breaks the stanza’s
                        rhythm with another grasp at communal identity. He cries, “and again
                            <emph>we</emph> ask aloud, / Why in the name of Glory were they proud?”
                        (128, my emphasis). This interjection performs two critical tasks. Like the
                        apologetic digression, this passage, and Keats’s use of the plural pronoun
                        in particular, suggests that the author and reader together object to the
                        liberties taken with the source tale. Traveling the narrative together and
                        then stepping outside of the fiction to examine it at work, the author and
                        reader critique the way emotion has gotten the better of them. Their decorum
                        has devolved into disgust and outrage. The second and more important task
                        this interjection performs is to show that the author and reader alike
                        object to the abuse of a corrupt socio-economic system. Though “we” are
                        responsible for the loss of Boccaccio’s pastoral paradise, “we” are equally
                        able to recognize the horrors of our modern moment.</p>
                  <p>Keats has inserted a bold critique of the modern setting that informs his
                        own tale, and returning to the apologetic stanzas XIX and XX, we must note
                        the self-consciousness of “succeed the verse or fail,” in light of this
                        audacious revision. Conspicuously set off from the main clause with dashes
                        and located in the middle of Stanza XX, this aside is reminiscent of
                        Coleridge’s self-conscious speaker, who anticipates his own reception at the
                        end of “Kubla Khan.” But Keats’s audience is as multi-faceted as his layers
                        of authorship. The address to Boccaccio contextualizes his anxiety as a fear
                        of failing the master or muse; however, “succeed . . . or fail” implies the
                        pressure of Keats’s contemporary literary market as well. This poem is
                        widely held to be inspired by Hazlitt’s lecture on 3 February 1818, in which
                        he declared that a rewriting of <title level="m">The Decameron</title>
                        “could not fail to succeed in the present day” (Hazlitt qtd. in Heinzelman
                        168). Moreover, Keats hails this poem as his “new Romance,” following from
                            <title level="m">Endymion</title> 1818), which he hastily shrugs off as
                        a “feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished.” Penned the month
                        before he began <title level="m">Isabella</title>, the “Preface” to <title level="m">Endymion</title>characterizes the epic as a “failure.” Thus,
                        Keats’s digression here in <title level="m">Isabella</title> registers fear
                        that resurrecting the past for the present literary market will fail as he
                        believes his most recent publication to have done. He fears for its success
                        in the modern market because the grotesque and titillating are what sell.
                        Popular texts sell because of their ability to provide mindless
                        entertainment. As noted above, texts like gothic novels and sensational
                        romances encourage a passive reading posture without interrupting it to
                        improve the condition of the modern mind or the modern society more
                        generally. In navigating the practical need for success in the modern
                        literary market, Keats plays at a balancing act where he must at once
                        titillate and educate. He must weigh the moments where the slippage between
                        fiction and reality is productive, as when it teaches us to recognize
                        corruption and abuse of power, against the moments when the slippage makes
                        the passive reader vulnerable to that corruption and abuse. This seems a
                        crucial threshold to the reading (and writing) experience being created in
                            <title level="m">Isabella</title>. </p>

                  <p>Lorenzo’s ghost serves as the most halting interruption of Keats’s poem. Like
                        the poetic digressions themselves, Lorenzo’s ghost disrupts and unweaves the
                        fiction Isabella’s brothers perpetuate, calling attention to the mechanisms
                        underneath their lies. When Lorenzo’s ghost visits Isabella, he is described
                        in terms similar to Coleridge’s Mariner. His bright eyes and strange voice
                        captivate. Like the poet from “Kubla Khan,” Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner is a
                        vehicle for a prophetic message. Doomed to wander the margins of society
                        alone, he is distanced from humanity and forced to propagate his tale. He is
                        entranced and entrancing. The Mariner circulates his narrative by holding
                        his audience with a hypnotic eye, compelling the audience to listen until
                        the tale is complete.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Importantly, the Mariner interrupts
                            a love story to convey his truth. His audience is a wedding guest who is
                            wrenched out of his own narrative trajectory, walking to the
                            chapel.</note> Lorenzo’s eyes, too, are “wild,” and he is “upon the
                        skirts of human-nature dwelling” (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 289,
                        306). He “chant[s] alone the holy mass,” cut off from community but obeying
                        a higher power’s demands to pay heed to truth. And like the Ancient Mariner,
                        Lorenzo’s act of storytelling leaves his auditor “a sadder and a wiser”
                        person for having heard the tale (<title level="m">Rime</title> 625).
                        Describing the ghost’s strange voice, Keats writes it was like a “palsied
                        Druid’s harp unstrung,” and his tale “did unthread the horrid woof / Of the
                        late darken’d time” (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 286, 292–93). The
                        negating prefix in each of these lines suggests the work Lorenzo’s tale
                        performs: it repeals the magic of Old Romance and uncovers a disturbing
                        reality. </p>
                  <p>As in Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime</title>, what is most compelling in
                        the scene with Lorenzo’s ghost is not the message itself, but rather the
                        pattern of transference, how the tale moves between the bodies engaged in
                        its telling and its transformative effect after the moment of its telling.
                        Most interesting is the way both the Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost interrupt
                        and disrupt. In <title level="m">Isabella</title> and <title level="m">Rime</title>, the integrity of the tale itself doesn’t seem to be
                        fragile; rather, the moment of its transference is endangered. If we look
                        again to Coleridge’s bibliographic layers, he seems almost as anxious as
                        Wordsworth, with his controlling authorial hand in the egotistical sublime,
                        to ensure the tale itself be received in a certain way. Coleridge’s marginal
                        glosses added to the poem in 1817 seek to direct the interpretation of his
                        poem and add a moral and philosophical explanation for the otherworldly,
                        mythological events of the Mariner’s tale. Yet, these marginal glosses occur
                        outside of the act of storytelling within the poem. These glosses are not
                        aides for the wedding guest’s lesson, but rather for a modern audience’s
                        understanding of the tale itself (as it has been translated by the speaker
                        who witnesses its transmission in one particular instance), the moral
                        imperative to circulate the tale, and its circulation within the text. The
                        glosses and the reception anxiety they imply, then, suggest that the tale’s
                        meaning is very much constructed in the moment of transfer from writer to
                        reader. Success and failure are not determined by the soundness of the text
                        itself or even the poet’s maturity and talent. Rather, they are measurements
                        of the co-creation that happens in acts of reading, when the reader’s brain
                        meets the words on the pages and writer and reader work together in the
                        space of the text (and even beyond) to create meaning. Indeed, the anxiety
                        represented in “Kubla Khan” and <title level="m">Rime</title> studied
                        together suggests that the very composition of the poem actually takes place
                        at its moment of translation from the written word through the reader’s
                        neural processing as a cerebral tidal bore (Dehaene 114). When the poet is
                        distracted from the transcription of his vision, the composition fails, and
                        its communication will always be incomplete. If we can say that composition
                        fails here, then for <title level="m">Rime</title>, a poem in which the
                        anxiety is ostensibly located after the point of composition in the moment
                        of the tale’s circulation, we might conclude that the tale is complete from
                        the very beginning, that it comes to the poet and the reader and the text at
                        the same moment—that it pre-exists what would traditionally be called its
                        composition, the moment pen hits the page. </p>
                  <p>Like the stories circulated by the Ancient Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost, the
                        act of reading, for Keats, stages an uncanny re-emergence of thoughts
                        repressed, hidden, and seemingly lost. Keats writes in an 1818 letter to his
                        publisher John Taylor, “Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by
                        Singularity—it should strike the Reader as a wording of his own highest
                        thoughts, and appear almost a Remembrance” (<title level="m">Letters</title>
                        I. 238). Poetry should seem an extension or an uncovering of the reader’s
                        own thoughts. This formula imagines poetry as a form of simulation rather
                        than an actual transmission of the author’s thoughts in the reader’s own
                        mind. Reading, therefore, acts as an elusive sleight of hand working in such
                        a way that the text seems at once to convey both the writer’s and reader’s
                        thoughts. This letter also positions reading as an experience of recovery of
                        high thoughts forgotten. The thoughts are like the reader’s, though they
                        seem to have been lost in the cobwebbed corners of the mind. With this brief
                        formula in mind, reading for Keats seems necessarily a gothic experience, an
                        uncanny re-emergence of thoughts always already in existence. They are at
                        once of the reader and not of the reader, unfamiliar but coming upon
                        Isabella and the wedding guest in a surprising excess of strange
                        familiarity. These thoughts disrupt both the narrative and the everyday life
                        of the characters. They prevent the wedding guest from attending the
                        ceremony. They teach their readers or listeners a nightmarish truth. They
                        call attention to the cognitive mechanisms under which the reader has been
                        operating, the state of sleepwalking in which the reader has existed and can
                        no longer exist. To see how this plays out in Keats’s Gothic Romance, let us
                        turn to the most sensational moment in the poem.</p>
                  <p>Laboring for three hours with a nurse by her side, Isabella appears to be a
                        woman giving birth, a point that would not have been lost on Keats, the
                        trained physician. Moreover, Isabella carefully tends the basil plant as
                        though it is her child. Having exhumed his body, she decapitates Lorenzo.
                        She carries his head home, combs its hair, straightens its eyelashes, and
                        wraps it in a perfumed silk scarf, all the while kissing it and crying over
                        it. Finally, Isabella entombs the head in a garden pot and plants basil over
                        top of it. All day and night, she tends the plant with a “continual shower”
                        of tears “from her dead eyes” (452-53). Isabella’s tears fertilize Lorenzo’s
                        head, and, from this, the two lovers (re)produce a lush plant. While
                        understanding this as a symbolic childbirth is compelling and valuable,
                        Isabella’s exhumation of Lorenzo’s body can also be understood as an act of
                        reading and writing. Isabella fills the old skull and dead bones with life
                        to resurrect their old romance. Keats interrupts her labor at the grave with
                        a rhetorical question for all readers of Romance: <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Who hath not loiter’d in a green church-yard,</l>
                           <l>And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,</l>
                           <l>Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,</l>
                           <l>To see scull, coffin’d bones, and funeral stole;</l>
                           <l>Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr’d,</l>
                           <l>And filling it once more with human soul?</l>
                           <l>Ah! this is holiday to what was felt</l>
                           <l>When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt. (353–60)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Reading Gothic Romance (or even reading tombstones in an
                        actual churchyard) is here figured as resurrection from the grave. A reader
                        revitalizes the corpse with his imagination. Sending forth his spirit to dig
                        through clayey soil and gravel hard, the reader immerses himself in the
                        material sublime of the grave. He uncovers the emptied body of a text to
                        fill it again with imagined life. He joins the negative with capability,
                        marries sensation and memory. </p>
                  <p>As she cries over the pot, the basil thrives. Her emotional response to
                        Lorenzo’s murder is all-consuming and self-destructive. Indeed, crying over
                        the relic of her dead lover is the most sentimental and overwrought image in
                        the entire poem. She is so overwhelmed with her sentiment that she becomes
                        insensible to her surroundings. Keats records how Isabella “forgot the
                        stars, the moon, and sun, / And she forgot the dells where waters run, / And
                        she forgot the chilly autumn breeze” (417–19). She has no awareness of life
                        outside of her replacement romance. She is out of sync with nature, having
                        “no knowledge when the day was done,” and not knowing when the new day began
                        (421). Having lost herself in a flood of emotion, Isabella is vulnerable to
                        the outside disruption. But, why does the plant, which represents a
                        co-creation of meaning like poetry itself, flourish in the midst of her
                        excess sentimentality? Can we critique this scene’s mawkishness given that
                        the plant thrives? Or to bring this line of inquiry back to ToM and seeing
                        our cognition laid bare, is absorption in the affective excess actually
                        dangerous if the immersive reading allows for growth? </p>
                  <p>Perhaps the most famous of Keats’s interjections occurs at Lorenzo’s
                        graveside. Keats halts the narrative during the disentombment to justify his
                        obsessive attention to the grotesque scene. He exclaims, “Ah! wherefore all
                        this wormy circumstance? / Why linger at the yawning tomb so long? / O for
                        the gentleness of old Romance, / The simple plaining of a minstrel’s song!”
                        (385–88). Once again, this digression anticipates his audience’s objection
                        to overt sensationalism. Importantly, the audience he anticipates here must
                        be a literary one, for a reader of modern romance would not likely question
                        these common conventions of popular gothic narratives. Yet this digression
                        serves a dual purpose in calling attention to the sensationalism for the
                        common reader’s benefit and justifying his choices to a skeptical literary
                        peer. With his predictable nostalgia, Keats waxes upon the traditional form
                        of Old Romance that modern society has ravaged. But a closer examination
                        shows that this passage goes beyond mere lament. Old Romance is the simple
                        plaining of a minstrel’s song. The word “simple” here echoes the “simple
                        misery” that was Isabella’s lovesickness before learning of Lorenzo’s murder
                            (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 330). The pleasure of Old Romance is
                        like a passive reading experience in which the reader is absorbed, lost in
                        the automaticity of the affect. Keats criticizes those simple reading
                        experiences that engage sensory immersion without the interruption, without
                        halting the forward movement of narrative to show the mechanisms at work
                        underneath the fiction. If then simple misery is all sensation and sentiment
                        without sensibility, Keats’s digressions offer the necessary space for
                        sensibility to return. </p>
                  <p>Awaking the morning after her vision, Isabella gives her only speech in the
                        entire poem:   <quote>
                        <lg>
                           <l>“Ha! ha!” said she, “I knew not this hard life,</l>
                           <l>I thought the worst was simple misery;</l>
                           <l>I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife</l>
                           <l>Portioned us—happy days, or else to die;</l>
                           <l>But there is crime—a brother’s bloody knife!</l>
                           <l>Sweet Spirit, thou hast schooled my infancy.” (Keats 329–34)</l>
                        </lg>
                     </quote> Here, Lorenzo’s ghost has called Isabella out of her
                        absorption in their romance to educate her in the reality of the world’s
                        corruption. Until now, she naively believed “misery”—the term used for their
                        lovesickness earlier in the poem—to be the worst experience in life, but,
                        learning of Lorenzo’s murder, she understands there is crime, betrayal, and,
                        worse yet, having to live on after waking to this knowledge. “New romance,”
                        then, takes on a particular meaning; more than just a fresh start for Keats
                        after <title level="m">Endymion</title>, it is reinventing the way tales are
                        told and read. The richness of new romance, narrative synthesized with
                        reality, engenders a reading experience that moves us beyond the immaturity
                        of Old Romance to arrive at a state of awareness that can inspire action and
                        change (Keats, <title level="m">Isabella</title> 391).</p>

                  <head>Conclusion</head>
                  <p>Despite their maligned reputation in the cultural debates of the Romantic
                        era, passive reading postures require complex cognitive and affective work.
                        In a matter of a few hundred milliseconds, the human brain translates the
                        written word into bodily meaning, producing a physiological intimacy between
                        bodies involved in acts reading. Through a material sublime of instantaneous
                        cognitive translation, narrative is brought to affective life and the text
                        is co-created by poet and reader. Both Coleridge and Keats utilized the
                        automaticity inherent in reading popular genres like the Gothic and Romance,
                        as they immerse themselves and their readers in a flood of sensation. And
                        yet, interruptions to the narrative flow complicate moments of composition
                        and reading, ultimately highlighting the complex cognitive and affective
                        work of passive reading. By structurally regulating the sensory experience,
                        controlling the affective overflow, and calling attention to the cognitive
                        and cultural processes at work underneath the fiction, these authors ensure
                        we will not be caught in a dream world for long without awaking more
                        enlightened. </p>

               <p rend="noCount"> William Blake’s perpetually protean <title level="m">Marriage of
                        Heaven and Hell</title> has proven somewhat elusive for those seeking to
                    articulate “what” the work means. Given its unusual form/s (organized along both
                    verbal and visual axes), its visionary commitments (evoked through its
                    apocalyptic imagery), and its intertextual engagements (from Aristotle and Jesus
                    through Milton to Swedenborg [Blake’s primary focus]), one cannot arrive at a
                    singular textual meaning. However, when one asks a different question—“How does
                    the text make its meaning?”—the dynamic aims of the work do emerge. The fusion
                    of these and other elements creates an art object with an overt gaze woven
                    through affective textualities, and this dynamic and interactive presence
                    strives to transform the very subjectivities of those readers who enter its
                    entangled zones of semiotic operations. Thus, affect forms the boundary
                    conception of such a textual condition, and its apprehension transforms them
                    into subjective effects. </p>

                  <p>William Blake’s <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>
                        (1793) has long held a special place in Blake Studies, following from those
                        “under late Victorian sponsorship” who undertook the textual recovery and
                        secured, via critical extension, both Blake’s work and the place occupied by
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> (Eaves et al. 116).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Citations will be to Erdman’s standard edition, <title level="m">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</title>,

                        Rossetti figure prominently in the recovery, and Algernon Charles Swinburne,
                        who published the first book-length interpretation of Blake’s prophetic
                        works, dedicated his critical essay to the latter. Swinburne, a friend of
                        the family, was intimately familiar with the first Blake biography by
                        Alexander Gilchrist and had direct access to the illuminated works.
                        Swinburne pronounced <title level="m">The Marriage</title> “the greatest of
                        all his books” and the work that best brought into view “the high water mark
                        of his intellect” (204). By the end of the century, Edwin Ellis and William
                        Butler Yeats published their famous “three-volume annotated edition, with
                        lithographic reproductions of a fair number of illustrations,” which, in
                        Edward Larrissy’s view, offered “The greatest tribute paid to Blake at the
                        end of the nineteenth century” (69). The volume provided <emph>the</emph>
                        Blake transmitted to modernity and taken up by some of its strongest
                        advocates and exemplars (e.g., Yeats, as well as James Joyce and André

                        experimental work” (Wittreich 198) was, from the beginning, perceived to
                        capture an unusually acute and intense convergence of aesthetical,
                        authorial, cultural, historical, material, philosophical, political,
                        psychological, and theological concerns and strategies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Blake’s affective textual strategies align well with those proposed by
                            Knudson and Stage: “The <emph>inventive experiment</emph> creat[es]
                            either a) artificial environments (e.g., a laboratory) in which tests of
                            various sorts are conducted to develop, falsify/verify or discuss
                            hypotheses, or b) natural everyday environments (e.g., peoples’ homes,
                            classrooms or the street) that the researcher, designer, artist or
                            social activist influences or modifies in order to investigate
                            participants’ emotional and affective responses to a particular
                            stimulation [Marres, 2012]” (<title level="m">Affective
                                Materialities</title> 12). Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title>
                            falls in the latter group.</note>
                     <title level="m">The Marriage</title> powerfully delivers—through a fusion
                        of the verbal and visual fields (the illuminated book)—“a strange work, a
                        kind of philosophical manifesto” (Nurmi 59) that immediately became the
                        measure of Blake’s genius—and often even of genius itself—as it plunged
                        readers “into a vigorous Beethovenish coda [which was] big with portents of
                        the movement[s] to follow [in perpetuity]” (Frye, “Thief” 35). </p>
                  <p> The reception accorded the transmission, which periodically assumes material
                        bodies that are quantifiable, can be seen in recent research by Roger
                        Whitson and Jason Whittaker, who mapped the flow of Blake citations (versus
                        those of the other “big five” poets) in the narrowed discursive arena of
                        Twitter citations. Within this eddy of the digital environment, Blake
                        quotations far outstrip the other authors (17,970 quotations in a 27-week
                        span). Of these citations, <title level="m">The Marriage</title> provides
                        the majority, with the collision of the heavenly and hellish accounting for
                        almost 40% of those evocations (4,523 citations). Of course, given the
                        constant unfolding into potential fields of representational force, the
                        amount of “Blakespotting” one could now undertake is almost infinite, even
                        though it has only been less than a decade since the publication of Mike
                        Goode’s splendid and influential <title level="m">PMLA</title> essay. The
                        evidence seems to confirm that Blake, furthered when harnessed to those
                        mechanical horses of instruction—the computational engines of digital
                        knowledge and the machinic mills within the worldwide web—seemingly captures
                        the spirit of every age, but one measured by the rhythms of the body in
                        relation to the pulsation of social process, providing an individuated
                        experience of the event of being for eternity and cultivating via
                        transference an incident of incipient identity. Steven Goldsmith speaks best
                        in current criticism to this undercurrent, the strange pulse writhing
                        beneath the surface of the work in the depths of its textuality, a
                        substratum “mimicking in sound and meaning the cardiac rhythms that expands
                        and contracts an artery” and predicated on “activity and passivity [being] a
                        shared rhythm” (228, 245).</p>
                  <p>During this project, I have periodically returned to contemplate Frye’s
                        analogy to the animating energies of Beethoven, since the phrase provided
                        early recognition of the affective functions embedded in work and since the
                        material underlying the analogy—a revolutionary rhythmic presence that moves
                        successive generations—can be measured by new methods to assess how this
                        poetic presence was caught as “a condition of daily labor for Blake”
                        (Goldsmith 38). Consider, quickly, one level of textual operation analyzed
                        below at greater detail, the function of the I-persona and its reinforcement
                        in the entangled fields of the verbal and visual. The first-person persona
                        speaks only in memorable fancies, with the first leading into the proverbs
                        of hell. After the proverbs, on plate ten, the design decodes the narrative
                        process just conveyed to and negotiated by a reader: the devil dictates, the
                        I-persona captures those dictates, and a reader accesses the operation of
                        the work by passing through the devilish wings. In this way, one plane of
                        rhythmic manifestation must be the sequential assessment of what we do when
                        entering though this narrative function to participate in the work of the
                        text, which is a material operation of rhythm, since the “I” vacillates
                        between active and passive modes and reaches a peak on plate twenty-four
                        with the formation of prophetic character. The periodicity of this presence
                        is a material textuality function, providing only one way that Blake brings
                        this rhythmic presence into experience, since the verbal evocation of
                        recording that leads into the proverbs concludes with visual analysis of the
                        textual operation itself.</p>
                  <p>The techniques that embody this ethereal presence pulsate beneath the
                        composite text, like blood in arteries, and methodologies associated with
                        current affect theory and rhythmic studies provide strategies for recovering
                        this rhythmic aspect, which seemingly occurs on every plateau of possibility
                        within the work as the spirit beneath Blake’s embrace of the bounding line.
                        The evidence suggests that the perennial popularity of <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> is grounded in this elusive yet material presence,
                        since the work encodes a “certain rhythm or order” (Shelley 512) that
                        transfers its pulsations through an assemblage of affective devices (e.g.,
                        the narrative functions of the I), whose analytic plateaus provide vectors
                        (or in current parlance de/territorializing and re/territorializing lines of
                        flight) capable of moving the mind into motion (as Kant proposed in the
                        third critique). The text conveys the rhythm of Blake’s thought in a work
                        packed with projections from both the current time and the long traditions
                        that inform it. Literally, the rhythm of the work captures the spirit of its
                        own age (something only perceived across its literal and symbolic
                        reconstruction from obscurity), but, more importantly, <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> continues to catch like a corresponding breeze the
                        rhythms of almost every age, including our own (e.g., through Patti Smith).
                        The work evinces something perennial and important arising from the
                        harnessed energies undergirding the dialogic superstructure of the work,
                        which forms the “aspect of poetic form” (i.e., products of poetic genius in
                        poetry and prose) “that escape the conventions of meaning” (Aviram 83).
                        Rhythm defines the technique, provides the theme, and delineates its
                        textuality in ways with profound implications for those who read this
                        work.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps another specific example can help gesture at the play of pulsations,
                        providing a local example of rhythmic emergence in a more traditional place,
                        the shortest proverb which occupies the measured center of The Proverbs of
                        Hell: “One thought, fills immensity.” A dimension of rhythm resides in its
                        elusive metrics (made more complicated by the insertion of the comma), since
                        no matter where one places emphasis, the prior monosyllabic terms (either
                        dactyl or anapest) are swept away by the closing polysyllabic
                        double-accented solitary term. The metrics of the poetic line model the
                        sentiments expressed by the proverb, yet the second pulse of this rhythm
                        occurs with the passage of the eye from the term “immensity” to the
                        micro-visualization that follows to complete the line, where a ship, wind
                        filling its sails, sweeps towards the horizon at the edge of the page. Like
                        the metric of the poetic line, the visual tableau also enacts or embodies
                        what the proverb proposes through the image. </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Marriage </title>propagates this rhythm within a work
                        seemingly packed with meaning and through analytic and visionary “utterance
                        designed in such a way as to draw attention simultaneously to its dimensions
                        of pure sound and to that of meaning, creating a sustained tension between
                        the two forces; and which achieves that effect of tension by means of
                        structuring its language according to rhythm” (Aviram 37). The scopic-driven
                        operations of the text create yet another layer of potential for affective
                        interactions, which proceeding along lines defined by textual tracks open to
                        participation, with the resulting spectrum of the self (an individual
                        pattern of interference and reception, a discrete perception of the work)
                        varying according to the hidden variables brought to bear by its readers and
                        spectators in these phenomenological acts of perception and reception. Thus,
                        the inscriptive process (image and word inscribed inversely on copper
                        plates) embodies this rhythm, the order (sequence of plates) and
                        organizational decisions (plate subsets) contain this rhythm, the pace of
                        narrative (vacillation across varied forms) enfolds this rhythm, and the
                        reader embodies, through suspension in narrative techniques, a transmission
                        of energies that moves from alterity to interiority.</p>

                  <p> Blake’s perennially protean proem exerted an immediate impact on my views,
                        especially in light of its emanation from my cultural and social
                        environment, with first contact coming through snippets from other authors
                        and writers (e.g., Huxley or Ginsberg), musical devotees (e.g., The Doors or
                        Emerson, Lake, and Palmer), and even book covers for classes (e.g., <title level="m">World Religions </title>or <title level="m">A History of
                            Prophecy in Israel</title>). <title level="m">The Marriage </title>also
                        arrived at a moment of personal crisis where the confluence of external and
                        internal forces necessitated radical changes in my life, and, following this
                        engagement, a quantum shift in my thinking took hold in relation to the
                        repetitive daily pursuits of studying the classically oriented curriculum at
                        the University of St. Thomas and performing the nightly work in the county
                        trauma center in Houston. Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title>
                        literally served “as equipment for living” (Burke 645) through the dark and
                        often tragic occurrences that arrived to the late-night emergency room
                        (between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM), which was cast into relief by juxtaposition
                        with the tranquil beauty of the campus and its deliberate pace through
                        knowledge—a passage often only separated by thirty minutes. Several years
                        later, when the time came to write my MA thesis, I predictably turned to
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> and its multi-dimensional analysis
                        and evocation of the prophetic tradition, which even in this relatively
                        early text (c. 1790–03) seemed to enfold fable, folklore, and myth (plate
                        11); the history of printing and its relationship to the transmission of
                        “knowledge” (plate 15); the con/fusion of the poetic and prophetic
                        (throughout but especially plates 12 and 13); and the re/cognition of the
                        triangulated interplay of desire projected onto “Vegetable Glass of Nature”
                        (E 555) and the ways drives and ideologies assume material bodies (plates
                        25-7).</p>
                  <p>Even after writing the thesis (“‘Rintrah Roars’: Anti-structural Prophetics
                        in <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>”), I felt my
                        assessment missed as much as it struck, but the impact of its textual gaze
                        during reception and interpretation stuck. The work continued to hail or
                        interpellate from the inside out, no surprise given that “such
                        interpellation [resides] in all acts of reading” (Bracher 177), and figured
                        prominently in my dissertation.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The work has continued to
                            exert a fascination on/to me, and if books were banned and burned, as in
                            Ray Bradbury’s <title level="m">Fahrenheit 451</title> or, potentially,
                            the current political situation, I would select Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> to memorize—both designs and words.</note> As Mark
                        Bracher has observed, the function of interpellation takes on added
                        intensity within the entangled fields of the work and its ability by
                        “textual codes” (170) to rouse the faculties of those who encounter it,
                        literally by the genesis of affect. Blake builds a work with textual
                        features that both recognizes the presence of appellation (and its
                        ideological functions) and re/cognizes its ability to achieve through the
                        marshalling of literary and textual techniques a transformation of readers
                        by its “gaze.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The gaze in its Lacanian and Blakean
                            permutations will accompany more detailed reading (below). Blake’s
                            experimental textual methods (its gaze and its elements) do reflect
                            current thinking on artistic intervention “in social life by [creating
                            and deploying] certain forms of controlled sensual stimulation” through
                            dramatizing “particular epistemic and aesthetic events in order” to
                            render visible “affective liveliness” capable of extending “current
                            understandings” (Knudson and Stage 11).</note>

                  <p>The impulse to use material operations and narrative techniques for
                        transformational ends finds the perfect textual platform within the rapidly
                        evolving interactive semiotic field of the verbal and visual specifically
                        designed to engage readers and court the “capacity to produce significant
                        transformations in a reader’s psychic economy” (183).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                            term “appellation” is primarily borrowed from Louis Althusser: “all
                            ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete
                            subjects, by the functioning of the category of the subject” (173). My
                            dissertation confirms the continued call of <title level="m">The
                                Marriage</title>, since it dedicates a chapter to the Lacanian
                            echoes and essences embedded in the work and its deployment of “mirror
                            stage” apparatus like identification and projection, and the following
                            analysis owes much to Mark Bracher’s work (see below). </note> According
                        to most of my students (at all levels), the work continues to “hail” them
                        well after our studies concluded, whether they took delight, became enraged,
                        and/or felt provoked, but they all agreed that the work evinced the ability
                        to engage them where they live (the dynamic conditions of the real), while
                        manifesting a trans-temporal textual plasticity of great power that emanates
                        from complex and dynamic operations in the method best termed an “affective
                        mechanics” (“Mirrored Text” 16).</p>
                  <p>Having taught Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> at all levels of
                        instruction for about thirty-five years, I still marvel at the ability of
                        the work to stimulate receptive activities across a broad spectrum of
                        cultural/social belief and concerns through its activated semiotic textual
                        environment, and the analysis of this matter (the material base for the
                        textual generation of this stimulation) requires a shift from “what” the
                        work means to a question seemingly long resolved: “How does the text make
                        its meaning?’’ Such a question of <emph>praxis</emph> “turns on [Blake’s]
                        manifold involvement with the many modes of the sign’s operation, the ways
                        of setting alight a signifier . . . and the various ways readers have of
                        making sense of that involvement” (Hilton [2006] 86). Blake fuses from these
                        interactive sign systems “a new art form,” a dynamic textual object that
                        eliminates “the key division between conception and execution” (Jones 32),
                        and thereby offers the opportunity to traverse a plentitude of hermeneutic
                        plateaus in route to the closing “Song of Liberty.” Perhaps the most overt
                        line of flight, the “affective stylistics” built into the material of the
                        text, announces its operational function as “kinetic art [that] forces you
                        to be aware of ‘it’ as a changing object—and therefore no ‘object’ at
                        all—and also to be aware of yourself as correspondingly changing” (Fish
                        82-3). </p>
                  <p>My extended examination, then, takes up an inquiry into the affective
                        functionalities at work within <title level="m">The Marriage</title>,
                        beginning with those dialogic and dynamic exchanges (even the plateaus have
                        polarities implanted in content and form) for which the work is well-known
                        and through the energized interchanges between the “I” active within its
                        memorable fancies and the eye reading the “event” of the work. This direct
                        narrative node operates both linguistically and psychologically through
                        identification at the preliminary point of exchange and becomes the vehicle
                        for the emergence of a “larger I individual participate in a specific form
                        of subjectivity” posited by Michon in the epigraph to this essay. The
                        technique opens a receptive path for forms of transference and
                        counter-transference at the event-horizon of reception (an effect enhanced
                        through repeated reading). Through such methodic techniques, the gaze of the
                        work functions as generator of an affect (thus an affect machine), which
                        renders it an early experiment in and continuing exemplar of what is best
                        termed “affective textuality.”</p>
                  <p>Strangely enough, it has now been “thirty-three years since [the] advent” (E
                        34) of the thesis and its defense, and I feel methodologically better
                        informed to explore precisely how a physical textual object implants itself
                        in consciousness like a reoccurring infection that leaps out to inflect and
                        reflect across the spectrum of the real, symbolic, and imaginary registers
                        of the subject and its projections techniques onto the screen of alterity.
                        Although initially undertaken with typical critical instrumentation (in
                        succession, the rhetorical thrust of the prophetic [MA] and the
                        incorporation of post-structural psychoanalytic methodologies into textual
                        operations [PhD]), the excavation and exploration of such an intricate
                        object eventually extended to spatial/temporal planes of reception/response
                        (the space-time of critical analysis in which the affective aspects of the
                        work’s activated textuality operate), which extends the hermeneutic
                        possibilities to infinite planes and therein establishes what Alain Badiou
                        termed “a new idiom” by which the subject is newly positioned, speaking
                        existentially, as “being-for-the-infinite” (in contradistinction to “being
                        for death” [137]).</p>

                  <p>Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> announces a formal opening to an
                        ever-evolving pursuit of a new type of textuality, where (in this case)
                        narrative and generic play, through the guise of parody and satire, are
                        transformed into operational instrumentation directed towards analytic,
                        pedagogical, and spiritual ends (something previously analyzed in two prior
                        essays). While illuminated works precede <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title>, the work synthesized those earlier efforts into a form
                        where intellectual and technological dimensions achieve a refined unity
                        reflected “in a Part as in the Whole” (E 269) transmitted to the Lambeth
                        (balanced between historical and psychological concerns) and Felpham periods
                        (the last effort to synthesize all concerns into illuminated prophetic
                        form). This essay, then, represents the third of four analyses designed to
                        bring into view the operational elements of what is best described as
                        Blake’s highly successful “experiment in affective textuality” (Knudson and
                        Stage 2–5).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> My interest extends backward to an early
                            essay, “‘Vortext’ as Philosopher’s Stone: Blake’s Textual Mirrors and

                     <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </title>opens the most
                        creative and productive decade of Blake’s life and provides an assemblage of
                        forms, sources, and voices filtered through a scathing satiric imagination
                        guided by an impulse akin to Heideggerian <foreign>Destruktion</foreign>, a
                        “de-structuring of the history of ontology,” to gain purchase on the
                        “onto-theological” embedded in metaphysics as a necessary prelude for any
                        state of dwelling capable of abiding, aspiring, surviving, and thriving
                        (Heidegger 20; Economides 17). Blake the “bricoleur” (Mee 3) functions as
                        artist, engraver, painter, philosopher, poet, printer, and publisher—a
                        rather audacious stance relative to the sophisticated semiotic seas in which
                        he swam—and pursues an imaginary exploration of desires and drives,
                        constructs symbolic repetitions of these conflicts of varied layers of
                        representation and signification, deconstructs the foundational binaries
                        beneath them, renders the mythic and psychologic dynamic and interactive,
                        and traces them through history, myth, and other bearers of tradition into
                        the realm of the real. </p>
                  <p>Blake’s multi-formulaic approach is informed by a dizzying array of
                        intertextual references primarily focused on the Old and New Testaments and
                        its secondary “interpreters” John Milton and Emmanuel Swedenborg, with
                        everyone from Aristotle and Jesus through Ezekiel and Isaiah to Dante and
                        Shakespeare mentioned in its twenty-seven pages. However, this typical
                        referential apparatus is supplemented by an incipient intratextual dimension
                        established with the earlier tracts <title level="m">Songs of
                            Innocence</title> (1789) and the later <title level="m">Songs of
                            Experience</title> (1794) (i.e., their combination), as well as the
                        Lambeth prophecies (especially<title level="m"> America, A Prophecy</title>
                        [1793] and <title level="m">The Book of Urizen</title> [1794]), creating a
                        work of great plasticity capable of incorporating retrospectively an
                        evolving mythology placed within an entangled field of verbal and visual
                        representation, where even interlinear flourishes serve to support larger
                        hermeneutic and ideological interpellations within their micro-narratives
                        and where insistent apocalyptic and visionary language is capable of a
                        sustained frontal assault on all forms of what Lacan would term the symbolic
                            order.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lacan clearly establishes, given its function
                            as the repository or “register [of] signifiers, in the sense developed

                            differential elements, in themselves without meaning, which acquire
                            value only in their mutual relations, and forming a closed order”
                                (<title level="m">Four </title>279).</note> The complications are
                        legion, occur at many levels of the work, and are quite well known, given
                        its unusual textual features (organized along both verbal and visual axes,
                        each entangled with the other amidst supplemental interlinear flourishes)
                        and its transhistorical and prophetic commitments (evoked through its
                        apocalyptic and visionary imagery yet grounded in historical specificity). </p>
                  <p>This assemblage of collective concerns confronted upon encountering the
                        creative aspects of characters and their contexts suspends readers in an
                        affective textuality and its operational modalities, which provide the
                        method of propagation to those “future generations” to which his “sublime
                        allegory” seems to be addressed (E 730). Each layer of intricacy has a
                        quasi-fractal nature of iteration and re/iteration, manipulating the reader
                        through discretely constructed sets: argument, demonstration, vocalization,
                        and visualization. Thus, rather than having little or no structure, the work
                        deploys a hyper-structuration designed “to restore difference in thought [in
                        order] to untie this first knot, which consists of representing difference
                        through the identity of the concept and the thinking subject,” a process
                        unfolding continually in <title level="m">The Marriage</title> and
                        reflecting its commitment to an “affirmation of differences,” which
                        throughout the work provides “a primary” impulse assuming “material and
                        bare” forms that are reflected in all encounters with “every . . . variant,
                        a difference, a disguise or a displacement” (Deleuze, <title level="m">Repetition</title> 266, 267, 271).</p>

                     <title level="m">The Marriage</title> mostly seems to inspire, to ignite
                        aspirations, yet in almost any class at least one student experiences the
                        work as psychologically disturbing (and perhaps even dangerous), seemingly
                        offering substantiation to Bracher’s argument across that spectrum of
                        response that reception of this work often creates subjective alterations,
                        tends to unveil mental instabilities in the process, and often produces
                        existential/spiritual shifts as one alters one’s opinion in relation to the
                        textual gaze. The event of reading/reception unfolds relative to endless
                        variables woven into the cultural information comprising the content with
                        which the work and its spectator is concerned (within), and every reader
                        must engage textual conditions governed by principles of uncertainty
                        (without) that “activate[] the [spectators’] participation” (while
                        “destabilizing . . . singular identities”), thereby positioning its
                        consumers within a constantly shifting hyper-activated event horizon
                        (Badiou, <title level="m">Being</title> 304–05; Piccitto 80, 149). These
                        dynamic aspects of creation and reception “co-exist and co-function” (as
                        contraries) and depend on “discrete perceptions/cognitions” within this
                        event-horizon, which is shaped by the shared energies of author and reader
                        and provide a path through “productive interference” (mutual imposition) to
                        an infinity of “potential forms/configurations” (those “Unnam’d forms”
                        contained within the fifth chamber of the printing house of hell [E 40: 15])
                        response to “discrete perceptions/cognitions” (Massumi 197). </p>
                  <p>The lines of hermeneutic flight track something somewhat elusive (but
                        hopefully not illusive)—the ways Blake finds to capture and communicate the
                        rhythm of thought in the material operations of <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> (the first full-bore illuminated book of prophecy) and
                        to engineer paths of perpetuation within the work’s textual conditions—and
                        serve as routes to transferences and counter-transferences as the primary
                        sought outcome of its textuality. In this and other ways, Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> operates “as a machine conceived in order to
                        elicit interpretation” (Eco 85). This affect-generating machine encloses a
                        plenitude of dimensions, providing paths for intellectual interventions into
                        the cultural processes of subject formation and runs along governing
                        dynamics capable “of directly modifying the neurodynamics of the SELF” (see
                        second epigram) during acts of reading and reception. The textual condition
                        Blake establishes places semiotic complementarity at the foundation of
                        textual functions, with the verbal and visual languages positively writhing
                        within the framing engraved rectangle of representation whose energies
                        depend upon fields of semiotic force manifesting principles of
                        complementarity, which serves as the steady state of the illuminated books
                        generally. The textual field of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>
                        deploys what can only be described as a “gaze” in the full affect/effect
                        given that term in current critical discourse, although manifest at the
                        individual level of aesthetic object is significant for an affect-oriented
                        approach to Blakean textuality. Through at least two layers of its material
                        operations (one visual and one verbal), the work modulates its figural and
                        linguistic languages to effect a shift or transference of perception “from
                        the point of view of the object [to see] . . . from the subject’s point of
                        view” (Merleau-Ponty, <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 226) and must
                        maneuver within the knowledge of what W. J. T. Mitchell termed the
                        “composite” dimension of the text (Otto 42–44). Blake’s textuality form
                        evinces an overt gaze woven through affective textualities, and this dynamic
                        and interactive presence strives to transform the very subjectivities of
                        those readers who enter its entangled zones of semiotic operations. Thus,
                        affect forms the boundary condition for this new textual state, and its
                        apprehension undertakes forms of transforms designed to create subjective
                        effects.</p>

                  <p>As Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker suggest, the verbal and visual images
                        enter the subject of contemplation like “viruses, worms and memes” that
                        infect the reader/viewer locally but that equally establish a wider host
                        when they “circulate through cyberspace” (Dent and Whittaker 174), where
                        textual virtuality provides the precise threads for the shaping of affective
                        outcomes through effective techniques continually communicated within and
                        without the work. Obviously, the hidden variables at play cannot be
                        definitively mapped; however, the textual operations can be observed.
                        Blake’s activated mode of mimetic representation produces significant local
                        (and often immediate) affects, not a surprising outcome in light of Anna
                        Gibb’s description of such textual operations quite relevant to the case of
                        the illuminated books (although in periodic manifestation and so with
                        unequal measure): <quote>At the heart of mimesis is affect contagion, the
                            bioneurological means by which particular affects are transmitted from
                            body to body. The discrete innate affects of which Silvan Tomkins speaks
                            are powerful purveyors of affect contagion, since they are communicated
                            rapidly and automatically via the face, as well as the voice. (“After
                            Affect” 91)</quote> The face of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> is
                        clearly the title plate, and, as Leo Damrosch notes, the bounding lines of
                        the design yield “the shape of a human head” (102), which, in light of the
                        plateaus of experience reflective of polarities, offers (for the experienced
                        reader) a visual x-ray of the dynamic symmetries in existential play
                        erupting within all individuals. The design also assumes the function of a
                        mirror, providing a mimetic representation of a visionary head wherein all
                        textual dynamics operate to create a mirror-stage encounter, escalating
                        affective intensities with every encounter (one can only once be innocent in
                        the face of this gaze textual) through identification. The design provides a
                        view of interior process of a human head, and with this mirror in the text
                        (i.e., another form of the <title level="m">mise en abyme</title> trope)
                        proffered as aesthetic antidote to the maladies of selfhood (a concern taken
                        up in later works but here in incipient form). Since the “contraries battle”
                        in all (poet and audience alike), the title page presents an archetypal,
                        universal man (an <title level="m">ur</title>-form of Albion), and the
                        mirrored aspects of the construct operate in opposition to “the mundane
                        world, the world built by nature and memory, a crazy house of false mirrors”
                        (Adams 188, 196). </p>
                  <p> The varied “voice[s] of the Devil[s],” forged within the complex interplay
                        of <foreign>parole</foreign> and <foreign>écriture</foreign> (in real,
                        symbolic and imaginary spaces), help structure the work and provide the
                        alluring discourse of contrariness that powers the work’s ability to impact
                        readers within varied spatiotemporal situations and, when transmitted,
                        across varied cultural processes of signification. In the first “Memorable

                        Devil” not only serves as a front to un/veil Blake’s corrosive inverse
                        printing method but also articulates the governing query by which to
                        contemplate improvement through multiversical forms of affective experience: <quote>

                     </quote> This interrogative mode recurs throughout <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, and, as Nelson Hilton long ago perceived, it (and
                        other forms of enigmatic wisdom [i.e., parables, proverbs and prophecies])
                        functions in ways similar to Zen <foreign>koan</foreign> (197–200) by
                        “rouzing the faculties” (E 560) as a method for intellectual development in
                        the constant conversion of knowledge into wisdom. While the devil writes
                        corrosively to inscribe this couple, the I-persona records it, providing the
                        other voice while functioning as the vehicle for incorporation and,
                        thereafter, participation. Given my contention that the work functions as an
                        affect-generating machine by design, the relevance of this quote should be
                        obvious; Blake’s theory of the text uses material elements to unravel
                        ideological manacles and, in the process, rewrite the process of subject
                        formation, which comes equipped with affective aspirations and promises to
                        open “the door of perception” (E 39).</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="m">The Marriage</title> takes up residence in the psyche as a
                        symptom of reception (probably at all three topological layers of Freudian
                        psychoanalytic experience); as in the literary, philosophical, and
                        theological layers of the book, the psychological layers also pursue the
                        unveiling cultural elements and operations (i.e., ideological production) in
                        order to redirect those energies as a vehicle to alter the
                        reader/spectator/subject through implication and participation. The work
                        crafts “an intraorganic mirror” (Lacan, <title level="m">Ecrits</title>
                        79)—to adopt the well-known operation at the foundation of Lacan’s mirror
                        stage—which generates through identification an <foreign>imago</foreign>
                        (Blake’s term is “spectre”), thus initially stabilizing subjectivity by an
                        imaginary sense of totality (i.e., constructed from the outside in).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In essence, Blake’s textuality operates through similar
                            dynamics as Lacan’s famous mirror-stage, although the textual mirror
                            Blake presents is a screened window upon which both writer and reader
                            project from different spots in the spacetime continuum, while
                            transmitting the physical and psychological mechanics needed to
                            annihilate the <foreign>imago</foreign>, a process that reaches its best
                            expression in <title level="m">Milton</title>. Of course, in the mirror
                            stage described by Lacan, the subject assumes an illusory identity; in
                            the textual mirror of Blake, the <emph>specter </emph>is unveiled
                            through a process of mimetic representation, thereafter deconstructed,
                            and then restructured through techniques of transformation piloted in
                                <title level="m">The Marriage</title> (although precede by the
                            tractates). The mirror, for Blake, must shatter to reveal the work as a
                            window, since one should look through a text and not with it (like one
                            should look through the eye and not with it). </note> Blake directed the
                        mirrored textual dynamics towards dismantling the initial
                            <foreign>imago</foreign> (of ideology), allowing a new form of
                        subjectivity to assert itself by embracing the contrary aspects of “the body
                        and the soul” to achieve a visionary outlook more contestatory in
                        commitment. More specifically, Blake fashions his mirror through interactive
                        semiotic fields (i.e., the “head” of the title page and the “I” of the
                        narrative) dedicated to “the formation of [] prophetic character” (Wittreich
                        216) as the sought outcome for any passage through a dynamic process of
                        subject formation predicated on participation (a path of development related
                        to that mapped by Lacan’s Schema L).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lacan discusses this
                            map of “intersubjective dialectics [and dialogics]” in his seminar of
                            Poe’s “The Purloined Letter” (<title level="m">Écrits</title> 6–48) and
                            in a brief closing commentary to the compilation to establish why “the
                            quaternary [structure] is fundamental” to the functions “of the
                            unconscious” in order to map “a subjective ordering” (<title level="m">Écrits</title> 904).</note> The successful venture, from the other
                        side of the screen (i.e., locus of the author), ideally results in the
                        formation and emergence of an altered state of consciousness, the opening
                        place from which to begin the long struggle with the
                            <foreign>imago</foreign> embraced, in Lacan’s view, as early as eighteen
                        months. Yet, as André Green suggests, the process, once internalized, must
                        be recognized not as a singular “pinpoint chronologically as a stage than to
                        designate [it] as a structuring situation” (166), the point of entry for
                        affective textual techniques. </p>
                  <p> Generally, all illuminated books—when performing at the peak of their
                        potential—operate in similar ways, but the techniques deployed by <title level="m">The Marriage</title> provide a baseline of affective
                        operations, beginning with mimetic representation predicated upon “the
                        presence of others.” Those “others” are interpellated in the process of
                        reception through Blake’s version of “the larger I” posited by Michon
                        (above), the I-persona, which supplements the imagistic mirror of the title
                        page with a linguistic mirror upon which the contraries of material reality
                        (within and without) are projected. This two-fold mode opens the possibility
                        of a counter-identification that would have some chance of neutralizing the
                        freeplay of the <foreign>imago</foreign> or Blake’s spectre, although that
                        task awaits Milton in <title level="m">Milton</title>, a work driven by
                        reception dynamics. Reception, then, <emph>always</emph> occurs within an
                        event-horizon involving the intersection of linguistic and scopic properties
                        that <emph>always</emph> alters neurological conditions, therein creating a
                        corresponding shift from object relations (author/work or reader/book) to a
                        “subject to subject” relationship that defines, in part, its “gaze” (Lacan,
                            <title level="m">Fundamentals</title> 84). These techniques work
                        somewhat covertly in <title level="m">The Marriage</title>; after all, only
                        educated or experienced readers would know that the “corrosive” process that
                        concludes the first “Memorable Fancy” or the “thirty-three years” (on plate
                        three) are both self-referential and hence meta-textual. However, the
                        affective textual functions become increasingly overt in the vibrant
                        semiotic fields of <title level="m">Milton</title> (1804) and <title level="m">Jerusalem</title> (1820): both include direct addresses to
                        readers, and both periodically unveil the mirrored textual dynamics at the
                        foundation of the illuminated form itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jane Bennett’s
                            description of “vibrant matter” works well with the dynamics built into
                            the illuminated books: “I am looking for a materialism in which matter
                            is figured as a vitality at work both inside and outside of selves, and
                            is a force to be reckoned with without being purposive in any strong
                            sense” (42).</note>

                  <p>The techniques for the performance of such textual operations—which achieve
                        their full fruition within the final illuminated epics and which are forged
                        within the properties of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>—are
                        distributed across several layers of mimetic representation to assure the
                        widest semiotic propagation, something especially acute for Blake’s passage
                        beyond postmodernism and posthumanism alike. Through the transmission of
                        viral strains of verbal, visual, and interlinear forms of representation,
                        textual functionalities infect the reader during reception and therein
                        inflect the neurological conditions to create an intensified mental
                        environment within which affective modulations can take hold.</p>
                  <p>Given its collision of ideas and traditions, the content of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> was often seen as “‘a scrapbook of Blake’s
                        philosophy’” held in stasis within a “‘structureless structure’,” a state
                        that seemingly impeded, rather than facilitated, understanding for “readers

                        experience, Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> has perhaps the most
                        trackable structure in the canon, unfolding as a fourfold structure
                        constructed in relation to the affective dimension informing subject
                        formation earlier established: <list type="simple">

                        Subject”), which unveils a rare structural use of the technical trope termed
                            “<foreign>mise en abyme</foreign>,” which Lucien Dällenbach argues
                        represents “a structured reality, despite [its] apparent variety and
                        randomness,” yet in such a manifestation actually provides a way “to trace
                        its diachronic evolution” (165).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lucien

                            dramatic, and narratological dimensions of this complicated trope, and
                            Blake’s enhanced semiotic field creates new possibilities for its
                            incorporation as a technique used at different plateaus within a single
                            “structured reality.” Diane Piccitto has discussed the dramatic
                            dimension of the trope in Blake’s illuminated canon and shares my
                            observations for the potential for this trope (74-81). </note> The
                        section begins with a visual thesis that equally reflects the current state
                        of subjectivity (an energized eternal now of dynamic events occurring at
                        every topology of the psyche and every sense of the body), follows with a
                        poetic “Argument” (organized temporally from “Once” through “Then” and
                        “Till” to “Now”—the time of the prior title design), and proceeds into a
                        zone of negative dialectics (which strives to occupy an intellective
                        position “that is historical and critical but not dogmatic” [<title level="m">Stanford</title> February 2017]).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “I am not

                            nor with its action itself—I am a product that exceeds up to the limit
                            of the mental. . . . The intellective hypothesis allows us to recognize
                            the constraints that are brought by the genetic, physical, and chemical
                            structure of our brain, its synaptic functions and its plasticity, and
                            its acquired system of connections” (29).</note> The last component of
                        this subset, already briefly discussed, is the inaugural “Memorable Fancy,”
                        which introduces the I-persona, unveils the printing method, and propels the
                        work into the unruly and wild “Proverbs of Hell.”</p>
                  <p> In the opening seven plates of the work, Blake stages energetic exchanges of
                        “contraries” (plate three) to test intellectual and spiritual systems,
                        seeking to unveil inconsistences and inconstancies while advancing
                        “unlearning” as the sought pedagogical outcome. These collisions (which
                        occur across numerous plateaus of activity) shape the epistemological
                        framework of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, providing the
                        reiterative set of elements that reflects the use of <foreign>mise en
                            abyme</foreign> helping to create a force field woven, in part, from
                        dialogic imperatives.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The form of dialogism pursued
                            through <title level="m">The Marriage</title> is not a tame
                            “give-and-take” seeking the acknowledgement of difference as
                            “unresolvable but is nonetheless reconciled” but rather the strident
                            “condition of fierce social struggle outlined by Bakhtin . . . in which
                            dialogical forces of language actively contest the social and political
                            centralization of their culture” (Hirschkop 74). My sole revision would
                            be to replace “language” with “semiotics” as the deeper and wider system
                            of signs open to Blake given the verbal and visual fields of the
                            illuminated books. </note> The work proceeds through the fourfold
                        structure by beginning in unlearning (plates 1–7), unleashing a burst of
                        unfettered creativity (plates 7–10) through which any reader must travel
                        (akin to Satan’s swimming across chaos in <title level="m">Paradise
                            Lost</title> [1667]), with Blake positioning immediately after the
                        “Proverbs of Hell” the key to decode the process that follows—the visual
                        design that mediates the passage from the tumultuous imaginary realm of
                        proverbial wisdom and his effort to restructure the way the subject is
                        shaped. </p>
                  <p> The third section, which begins a rather deliberative process to reconstruct
                        the subject (a realignment to effect a shift from passive to active reading
                        habits and then to extend this into the structure of everyday life), unfolds
                        in a fourfold movement established through the function of the I-persona and
                        predicated on the phenomenological encounter with the textual gaze which it
                        bears (plates 11–24). The manifestation of this new state of subjectivity is
                        found in the voice that sings “The Song of Liberty” concluding the work
                        (plates 25–27), and the numbered biblical verses (the culminating form of
                        utterance) perform visionary work conveying Blake’s reinterpretation of
                        prophetic discourse (a shift from the predictive to the psychoanalytic). The
                        “Song” sung presents the preliminary mytheme of Blake’s evolving mythopoetic
                        map of mental processes (the interactions of the nuclear family: “The
                        Eternal Female,” “The newborn terror,” and “the starry king” [E 44: 25–26])
                        and announces the vehicle (the illuminated book of prophecy) designed to
                        serve as method itself and to exploit lines of de- and re-territorializing
                        lines of flight forged in reception, leading directly to the assumption of a
                        deliberately crafted visionary perspective yet crafted through difference
                        and repetition rather than solidified mimetic representation and symbolic
                        similitude.</p>
                  <p> Blake reinforced these broad structural elements though an act of repetition
                        with a difference, since the third section of the work (plates 11–24)
                        manifests its own four-part organization (including the elements of the set
                        comprising the first section) and thereby transforms the deployment of an
                        occasional use of a <foreign>mise en abyme</foreign> structure within its
                        surface examination of tradition into a treatment in the form of an active
                        textuality, recommending treatment for the condition (within the narrative)
                        and narrative operation and textual techniques and technologies as the
                        prescription for the inherent divisions at play in all areas of the work
                        (Dällenbach 43–53) into both a narrative operation and a textual technique.
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> undertakes nothing less than
                        simultaneously diagnosing the maladies of subject formation (based upon
                        known means of reception) and articulating an antidote to the dis/ease
                        resident in the process of subject formation, embracing the semiotic as the
                        cure for the symbolic (in contemporary critical language). The modes of
                        correction assume a fractal-like façade founded in repetition and
                        reiteration that charts the trajectory of method, the evolutionary and
                        revolutionary aspects of the physical body through which Blake staged these
                        often <emph>carnivalesque</emph> exchanges (i.e., the memorable fancies),
                        where the illuminated book itself provides a dynamic textual environment
                        within which to transfix any reader’s attention and entangle affective
                        operations within these semiotic layers through the rhythmic elements
                        distributed throughout the plateaus of Blake’s formative multiverse.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> “It is this rhythm that gives a temporary form to these
                            diverse elements, holds them together for so long as it lasts, . . .
                            creating a writing that resonates with it, simultaneously describing and
                            performing it. Rhythm, I think is a critical key to thinking writing as
                            an affective methodology” (Anna Gibbs 227).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> Jerome McGann associated Blake’s illuminated books with the emergence of a
                        quantum textuality, since the work in hand really does open onto “infinity”
                        within and without: “Holding the book you hold ‘Infinity in the palm of your
                        hand,’ as Blake precisely remarked” (163). The interplay of these dialogic
                        and dynamic elements within any given illuminated book encodes forms of
                        uncertainty at several levels (including form itself) and operates through
                        principles of complementarity (throughout the enriched semiotic environment
                        shaped by the entangled energies of intersecting verbal and visual fields).
                        The affective textual forms and techniques analyzed here—which were uniquely
                        designed to shift “the scene of instruction” into any reader’s mind—does so
                        by discrete textual operations that take hold during acts of reception and
                        response and are shaped with sound psychoanalytic principles in mind (a
                        point already addressed elsewhere). The interplay of these textual forces
                        are supplemented by other aspects of the work, creating an assemblage of
                        interactive generic forms produced from interwoven poetic philosophical
                        argument, prosaic analysis, parodic yet pointed memorable fancy, proverbial
                        wisdom, and numbered biblical verse bound together to articulate patterns
                        that trace, but do not and cannot represent, affect: “The rhythm of poetry
                        [in all its permutations and vacillations] compels affect, which can then be
                        put into words; rhythm does not represent affect”: <quote>Physical rhythm
                            can be said to have meaning only in a very limited way, insofar as it
                            alludes to well-known rhythms that are in turn attached to certain
                            ideas, conventions, and moods, and therefore to words and images. . . .
                            Physical rhythm is quite different in kind from either words or images,
                            which are fundamental to the economy, codes, and values of ordinary
                            social life. The ideas and images of poetry are historical; they
                            construct the immediate physical reality of the rhythm that their words
                            simultaneously embody. (Aviram 226–28)</quote> Blake’s textual
                        strategies aspire to unveil this presence through an assemblage that places
                        affect at the foundation of textuality itself, since such a move “is that
                        the specific joys and pleasures of poetry are preserved” (Aviram 244) but
                        would also operate unveil “writing itself is an affect-laden process: driven
                        by interest and desire, subject to frustration and misery as well as
                        productive of joy and excitement” (Gibbs 223).</p>
                  <p> Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> exploits “the stability of print
                        as a platform and the linearity of text in the codex form,” therein
                        extending “speech beyond the body of the writer [and] producing the effect
                        of an inner voice and with a psychodynamics of interiority” (Gibbs, <title level="m">Affective Materialities</title> 228). Blake’s experimental
                        text and the textual theory behind its strategies operate relative to the
                        unseen while hailing those who come into its gaze, a peculiar tactic again
                        aligned with scopic drives and one that acknowledges the specular nature of
                        subjectivity itself: <quote>What we have to circumscribe, by means of the
                            path [Blake] indicates for us, is the pre-existence of the gaze—I see
                            only from one point, but in my existence I am looked at from all sides.
                            . . . The eye and the gaze—this is for us the split in which the drive
                            is manifested at the level of the scopic field (Lacan, <title level="m">Four </title>72–73)</quote> Within the accumulation of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> as assemblage, from its opening titular
                        mirror and its dedicated exploitation of the “I” as our narrative guide
                        through both heaven and hell, readers both transfer (via internalization)
                        the subject-function and thereby continuously pronounce themselves the “I”
                        of the text, which operates through countertransference. Returning this
                        reflection into the textual field of Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title>, affective techniques provide a mechanism for a
                        transference of consciousness within the dynamics described by Georges
                        Poulet (I-persona as a vehicle of interiorization and subsequent
                        ex/pression) and evoked by Lacan in his discussion of the gap between the
                        “eye and the gaze.” For both Blake and Lacan, “this split constitutes the
                        characteristic dimension of analytic discovery and experience” (Lacan,
                            <title level="m">Four </title>69), and it clearly informs Blake’s
                        attempt to provide an experience and ex/pression of rhythm through effects
                        and techniques that deploy affect as the vehicle of subjective
                        transformation.</p>
