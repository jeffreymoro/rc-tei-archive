                <p rend="noCount"> In her 1798 “Introductory Discourse,” Joanna Baillie argues that
                    sympathetic curiosity is what makes us care about others in the world. In
                    contemporary parlance, Baillie wants to use sympathetic curiosity for “emotion
                    regulation,” a concept used in socio-cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In
                    this essay, we analyze Baillie’s play <title level="m">De Monfort</title> to
                    critique models of emotion regulation by 1) positioning sympathetic curiosity as
                    a tool for emotional education, 2) disentangling affect, emotion, and cognition,
                    and 3) emphasizing the social in the management of emotion. Ultimately, we
                    consider how the concept of emotion regulation informs conversations in affect
                    studies. </p>

                    <p>In her 1798 “Introductory Discourse,” Joanna Baillie argues that sympathetic
                        curiosity is what makes people care about others in the world. Given this
                        innate “propensity,” her goal is to harness it to teach audiences how to
                        “handle” the passions. In contemporary parlance, Baillie wants to use
                        sympathetic curiosity for “emotion regulation,” a concept used in
                        socio-cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In this essay, we consider how
                        conversations in affect studies could inform the concept of emotion
                        regulation. In doing so, we move beyond a conversation about <emph>what
                        </emph>affect is to a conversation about <emph>how</emph> it functions. As
                        Seigworth and Gregg ask, “how does a body . . . come to shift its affections
                        (its being-affected) into action (capacity to affect)?” (2).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors">Similarly, affect scientist Kuppens argues,
                            “The study of affect dynamics aims to describe the principles and
                            regularities behind these changes, uncover the processes driving them,
                            and understand the implications they bear for psychological functioning”
                            (298).</note> Before analyzing Bailie’s play <title level="m"
                            >De Montfort</title> (1798) to critique models of emotion regulation, we
                        provide context for the rationale of this project by 1) positioning
                        sympathetic curiosity as a tool for emotional education, 2) disentangling
                        affect, emotion, and cognition, and 3) exploring the social in the
                        management of emotion. Ultimately, we model an ethical, interdisciplinary
                        approach and champion its value for integrated conversations among the
                        humanities and the sciences. The partnership we developed (as a literary
                        historian and a cognitive psychologist) pursues what we call “ethical
                        interdisciplinarity”—interdisciplinary partnerships that allow scholars to
                        learn <emph>with</emph> one another rather than to learn <emph>about</emph>
                        each other in isolation.</p>
                    <p>We were initially inspired by the model of the cognitive humanities and Lisa
                        Zunshine’s “cognitive cultural project,” which she describes as
                        understanding “the evolving relationship between two immensely complex
                        historically situated systems—the human mind and cultural artifacts”
                        (“Introduction” 3). Thus far, this relationship has been mostly
                        unidirectional with cognitive psychology applied to literary studies rather
                        than literary studies inspiring work in the cognitive sciences.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> For notable exceptions of psychologists who
                            bring literary analyses into scientific conversations, see Crozier, who
                            applies literary analyses to inform psychological models of blushing;
                            and Oatley, who explores the power of fictional construction on emotion
                            and now also writes fiction. </note> We imagine scholarly exchanges that
                        are not simply “sciences saving the humanities,” but are instead bi- or
                        multi- directional exchanges that challenge and push the work of all
                        disciplines. Indeed, Zunshine advises “a student of cognitive cultural
                        studies would thus do well to think of herself as a
                            <foreign>bricoleur</foreign> who reaches out for the best mix of
                        insights that cognitive theory as a whole has to offer without worrying
                        about blurring lines between its various domains” (“Introduction” 3). </p>
                    <p>More recently, our work has been informed by the research and methods used in
                        the emerging field of cognitive literary science (CLSci).<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> For a comprehensive history and extensive methodological
                            examples of CLSci, see Burke and Troscianko.</note> As defined by Burke
                        and Troscianko, in this field work unfolds in a variety of ways such that,
                        “literary scholars draw on some aspect of cognitive science to offer a new
                        viewpoint on literature . . . literary scholars use literary materials or
                        conceptual frameworks to contribute to cognitive-scientific debates . . .
                        [or] cognitive scientists engage with literature and literary-critical
                        methods to shed light on questions in their home discipline and/or those in
                        literary studies” (4). We find much to value in this field, especially its
                        diversity of approaches, although the resultant complication is that there
                        is a lot of ground to cover in each new project. Burke and Troscianko note,
                        “sceptics may say that this heterogeneity is the field’s fatal flaw, but it
                        must also be its forte” (8). </p>
                    <p>Both the cognitive humanities and CLSci fields, then, celebrate a diverse,
                        messy interchange of ideas; we agree with this vision given that our path to
                        affect studies has been different from others in the field. We approach
                        conversations about “the general turn to affect,” with a freedom to explore
                        seemingly disparate positions for important points of intersection (Leys
                        434) and have discovered important moments of convergence among them. We
                        argue that exploring how Baillie’s theory of sympathetic curiosity is
                        portrayed in the sibling relationship in <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
                        informs modern cognitive studies of social affective interactions, enriching
                        an understanding of how people learn to regulate emotion together. This
                        interdisciplinary approach has the potential to reimagine how scholars read
                        Baillie and to shape future investigations of social emotion regulation
                            (SER).<note place="foot" resp="editors">We want to distinguish between
                            the disciplines of affective science and social emotion regulation
                            (SER). The latter is an area of research that falls under the broader
                            umbrella of cognitive neuroscience and utilizes behavioral and
                            physiological methodologies; the former has more explicit ties with
                            literary conversations and history. Currently there seems to be a
                            disconnect between these areas of research, although new fields such as
                            cognitive literary science and the cognitive humanities are working to
                            bring them more explicitly into conversation together. In the first part
                            of this essay, we rely more heavily on affective science; later in the
                            essay when describing models of emotion regulation, we rely on

                    <p>Baillie is considered one of the most important playwrights of the British
                        Romantic era. She published her 1798 <title level="m">Plays on the
                            Passions</title> anonymously to great acclaim. Her intentions were to
                        continue to publish both tragedies and comedies focused on the primary
                        passions and their dangers if left unchecked. Baillie wanted her plays to be
                        performed, and, initially, when her first book of the plays on the passions
                        appeared, it seemed likely that they would go on to great commercial and
                        theatrical success.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on spectacle,

                        century offered women dramatists the opportunity to write plays that would
                        “reinvigorate not only theatrical life but the entire national literature”
                        (25). He notes that the end of the eighteenth century gave women “an
                        unprecedented prominence in drama” despite concerns about the place and
                        influence of women on it and argues that women writers like Joanna Baillie,
                        Jane West, and Mary Russell Mitford were attracted to historiography and the
                        historical drama as a genre that could “infuse” “the dynamics of justice and
                        mercy in the national politics of the present” (24, 23).<note place="foot"

                        “From Baillie to Hemans, women are in fact central to the drama of the
                        period,” noting that “Baillie . . . was the key tragedian of the day” (4).
                        If only moderately successful at having her plays performed, Baillie was,
                        even in her own time, considered to be a giant of the genre.</p>
                    <p>Baillie believed dramatic literary works like <title level="m">De Monfort
                        </title>moved readers and allowed her audiences to see the evolution and
                        effects of hatred on the body and the mind of its titular character while
                        being free from the passion itself. This experience would offer them insight
                        about the passions and how to avoid being overcome by them. As she wrote in
                        the “Introductory Discourse,” “the characters of the drama must speak
                        directly for themselves” (82). Baillie argued that in drama audiences look
                        for “creatures like ourselves” who offer them “characteristick [sic] truth,”
                        making them “intoxicated with it.” A good play “convinces” viewers “of the
                        author’s great knowledge of the human heart” (“Introductory Discourse” 82).
                        Baillie is particularly invested in drama, as she thinks it is the most
                        direct form of literary engagement for an audience. But she is also careful
                        to provide a framework within which drama has maximal impact. Characters
                        should not be idealized and unrealistically heroic; they should speak for
                        themselves, and drama should focus on the “heart” of human nature rather
                        than be mired down in distractions of spectacle. Baillie anticipates what
                        psychological research on the impact of narrative has identified as the
                        importance of transportation (of an audience into the narrative) and the
                        factors that heighten its impact. By transporting, the audience can be
                        persuaded to change existing belief systems.<note place="foot"

                    <p>Baillie’s “Introductory Discourse” is astute in its generic understanding and
                        in its assessment of the aesthetic and pedagogical value of the theater.
                        Baillie anchors this piece on the concept she calls “sympathetic curiosity,”
                        using it to explore what she considers people’s desire to learn about
                        themselves through others. She argues that everyone has a “propensity” to be
                        curious about the spectacle of the passions and also to have innate sympathy
                        when witnessing the suffering of others, suggesting, “from that strong
                        sympathy which most creatures, but humans above all, feel for others of
                        their kind, nothing has become so much an object of man’s curiosity as
                        himself” (67). People are curious about many things, but at the foundation,
                        their curiosity and empathy lie in observing and learning from others like
                        themselves. They are intrigued about others’ quotidian dramas, and that
                        curiosity opens them up to “self-knowledge”: “it is only from creatures like
                        ourselves that we feel, and therefore only from creatures like ourselves
                        that we receive instruction” (87). </p>
                    <p>The curiosity to observe in intimate detail others’ experiences, whether they
                        are painful or joyful, is tempered by the animation of sympathy. Though it
                        is a spring of potential good, sympathetic curiosity is not inherently good
                        or evil. Sympathetic curiosity, as Baillie argues, must be directed; it must
                        be given proper management, care, and instruction. Permitting audiences to
                        watch the evolution of the primary passions on stage while not being
                        affected by them directly allows Baillie to harness their sympathetic
                        curiosity so that they learn from, rather than merely enjoy, the spectacle
                        of others’ suffering, perhaps in a way no other experience can provide: “In
                        examining others we know ourselves. With limbs untorn, with head unsmitten,
                        with senses unimpaired by despair, we know what we ourselves might have been
                        on the rack, on the scaffold, and in the most afflicting circumstances of
                        distress.” Ultimately, this knowledge of self through and by others allows
                        people to “becom[e] more just, more merciful, more compassionate”
                        (“Introductory Discourse” 74). Sympathetic curiosity makes them receptive to
                        their own struggles and to the suffering of others.</p>
                    <p>In constructing her ideas of sympathetic curiosity and highlighting it as a
                        human “propensity” Baillie is clearly influenced by and connected to a
                        complex and long-standing conversation about sympathy, in particular to the
                        ideas of David Hume in his <title level="m">Treatise of Human Nature</title>
                        (1739–40) and Adam Smith in his <title level="m">Theory of Moral
                            Sentiments</title> (1759).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One
                            suggestion that her work may have been influenced by Hume is their
                            similar construction of sympathy as a propensity. Hume argued “No
                            quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its
                            consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others,
                            and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments,
                            however different from, or even contrary to our own,” while Baillie
                            argued, “how sensible are we of this strong propensity within us, when
                            we behold any person under the pressure of great and uncommon calamity”
                            (Hume 367; “Introdoctory Discourse,” Baillie 72). For more on the
                            history of sympathy in the seventeenth century and its connections to
                            Smith and Hume in the eighteenth century, see Lobis.</note> In
                        particular their work may have been of interest given their goals to make
                        scientific the study of sympathy (Broadie 151, Lobis 291–92). While there
                        are differences in how Hume and Smith ultimately define the mechanism of
                        sympathy, both connect its relevance to the positive workings of human
                        social interactions and justice. Specifically, Frazer notes, “Hume most
                        often uses the word sympathy to refer to a specific faculty of emotional
                        communication” (41). For Hume this emotional communication operates as the
                        spectator reads external signs and gestures on another’s body and face and
                        then infers that these signs and gestures arise from the effect of an
                        emotion (Frazer 41). In essence, according to Hume, the impression of a
                        passion in another becomes an idea of the passion in the spectator that is
                        ultimately “enlivened” so that the spectator feels some of the passion
                        herself (Broadie 173, Frazer 41). In Hume we see the precursors to
                        contemporary discussions of how people “read” emotion in others, a process
                        that is now called Theory of Mind (ToM) or Mind Reading. Hume’s conception
                        of sympathy as an emotional communicator provides a stepping-stone for
                        Baillie’s use of sympathetic curiosity as an instructor. </p>
                    <p>The intricate complexities of the functions of sympathy for Hume and Smith
                        are beyond the scope of this essay, but we pause here to focus on two areas
                        that intersect with Baillie’s concept of sympathy curiosity. First, for both
                        Hume and Smith, sympathy operates differently when the spectator feels more
                        connected to the actor. In Hume’s case he discusses the idea of resemblance,
                        e.g., nationality, race, etc., (Broadie 173–74) while Smith focuses on the
                        closeness of relationships (Frazer 100). The intensity of the passion felt
                        by the spectator may increase or judgments of propriety may be biased. In
                        both cases the take away is that sympathy is not uniformly applied to all
                        people or situations. Similarly, we see Baillie contend with uneven
                        activations of sympathetic curiosity as she argues that audiences are more
                        compelled by imperfect characters that seem more like them than historical,
                        perfect, and distant heroes. She argues that “the transactions of men become
                        interesting to us only as we are made acquainted with men themselves”
                        (“Introductory Discourse 76). Baillie argues that emotional lessons will be
                        more memorable if they are conveyed using accounts of “men subject to like
                        weaknesses and passions with ourselves” (“Introductory Discourse” 77).
                        Overall then, attention to the similarity between spectator and actor matter
                        in all these explanations of the process of sympathy.</p>
                    <p>In addition to acknowledging that sympathy’s uneven activation could impact
                        learning, Baillie also stresses that learning via sympathetic curiosity
                        happens because the spectator is not in the throes on the passion itself.
                        This fits with Hume’s and Smith’s ideas that sympathy can only evoke an echo
                        of the emotion felt by the actor in the spectator. In describing Smith’s
                        process of sympathy Frazer emphasizes that “it is essential to Smith’s
                        theory that sympathy can never be perfect” because if the spectator
                        sympathized perfectly, i.e., felt the emotion in exactly the same way, she
                        would not have “the distance necessary for an appraisal of the actor’s
                        reactions to his situation” (Frazer 101). Our reading of Hume also suggests
                        that the intensity of an emotion for the spectator would be less than the
                        emotion felt by the actor. This is because for Hume sympathy for the actor
                        is conveyed as an idea in the spectator rather than as an impression. This
                        difference matters because “an impression has greater liveliness,
                        forcefulness, or vivacity” than an idea (Broadie 152). In other words, in
                        all of these conceptions of the function of sympathy some distance between
                        the felt emotion of the actor and the felt emotion of the spectator is
                        unavoidable and necessary. </p>
                    <p>Finally, for our purposes, situations are a key component in the social
                        elements of the transmission of sympathy. As Smith argues, “sympathy,
                        therefore, does not arise so much from the view of the passion, as from that
                        of the situation which excites it” (16). The primacy of situation is an
                        important aspect of Baillie’s experiment of recreating the evolution of a
                        passion across time on stage: the activation of the spectator’s imagination
                        allows her to “put” herself “in his case” (Smith 16). It is this act of
                        imagining oneself “on the rack” that Baillie believes provides the capacity
                        for emotional instruction. </p>
                    <p>As previously stated, we are using the methods of the cognitive humanities
                        and CLSci to demonstrate how Baillie’s experiment with <title level="m"
                            >Plays on the Passions</title> can inform contemporary models of social
                        emotion regulation. Baillie’s work seems particularly well-suited for such
                        an examination because while Hume and Smith explore the ways that sympathy
                        might impact behavior, Baillie’s explicit goal was to use sympathetic
                        curiosity to educate the audience about how to modify their emotions. In
                        addition, what makes Baillie’s examination of the passions compelling for an
                        interdisciplinary investigation is that as a dramatist she was also immersed
                        in scientific conversations of the day, especially those that examined the
                        nature of emotion and its expression. While we do not with certainty know if
                        Baillie knew the work of Charles Bell directly, we see his ideas about the
                        expression of emotion as grounded in the body (as opposed to just the face)
                        reflected in her detailed stage directions which paint clear pictures of
                        shaking fists, collapsing bodies, and expanding/contracting chests. As Dwyer
                        argues, Baillie’s series of plays were certainly influenced by the work of
                        her uncles, Doctors John and William Hunter, and by the development of what
                        Hume, Smith, Dugald Stewart, and others called “the science of man.” If her
                        uncles and other eminent scientists of the day were focusing on anatomy and
                        physiology, so was Baillie: “Writing in the wake of the scientific
                        revolution and operating within a broad psychosocial framework, Baillie
                        sought to <emph>stage </emph>the external anatomy of passion and imagine its
                        unseen psychological depths” (Dwyer 32). Indeed, Baillie understood that
                        “there is perhaps, no employment which the human mind will with so much
                        avidity pursue, as the discovery of concealed passion, as the tracing [sic]
                        the varieties of a perturbed soul” (“Introductory Discourse” 73). </p>
                    <p>Baillie wanted more than simply to show or display a passion. She was
                        invested in distilling primal passions, what she called “the most powerful
                        passions,” to offer a classification of their development. In doing so, she
                        allows others to observe and learn from their evolution, to understand how
                        to avoid them in their own lives, and to recognize the moments of failure to
                        control them as exhibited by the protagonists in the throes of them
                        (“Introductory Discourse” 92). In other words, Baillie was invested in “the
                        empirical investigations of the body as well as the mind and its passions”
                        (Dwyer 32). As such, her plays allowed not only for the charting of the
                        evolution of a passion, but also for recognition that self-knowledge is
                        intricately informed by and happens in relation to others. We learn because
                        we observe others, think about them, think about us, and think about us and
                        them all at the same time.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more on

                    <p>An interdisciplinary consideration of Baillie’s theory of sympathetic
                        curiosity suggests a natural connection to modern psychological and
                        neuroscientific conversations about emotion expression and regulation.
                        Baillie’s desire to dissect the evolution of an emotion over its time
                        course, to illustrate its impact on the body and mind, and to engage the
                        audience’s attention to a character’s wrestling with an emotion all speak to
                        the ongoing research of affect scientists. Baillie’s contention that

                    <p>One of the challenges in cross-disciplinary conversations is terminology; how
                        “emotion” and “affect” are defined or understood creates the potential for
                        misunderstanding. As historian Dixon reminds us about the etymology of
                        emotion, this word is vexed with overlaying theoretical debates that reflect
                        an evolution from passions to affections to the more “sanitized” notion of
                        emotion that is now in common parlance.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                            >Mary Favret notes, “affect is often bundled with a cluster of related
                            terms: feeling, mood, sense or sensation, emotion, and—acknowledging an
                            intellectual debt to eighteenth century moral philosophy—passion”
                            (1159).</note> We are entering this conversation using Mulligan and
                        Scherer’s interdisciplinary conception of “a working definition of emotion.”
                        As they argue, “There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of emotion in
                        any of the disciplines that study this phenomenon. This fact leads to
                        endless debates and hampers the cumulative progress of research. It also
                        constitutes a major impediment to interdisciplinary dialogue and research
                        collaboration” (345).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> There are two large
                            camps in psychological debates about the nature of emotion: one that
                            identifies emotions as “basic” or “natural kinds,” following Ekman, and
                            one that aligns with Barrett’s Conceptual Act Theory. In the former,
                            seven to eight unique, basic emotions are identified (i.e., anger,
                            sadness, joy, etc.), while in the latter, there are no “distinct”
                            emotions but a categorization based on associations between physical
                            changes and conceptual knowledge. However, the move towards Barrett’s
                            theory has gained ascendancy; neuroscientists like LeDoux have clarified
                            that his views align more with cognitive than with basic emotions
                            perspective and studies by Touroutoglou et al. and Kragel &amp; LaBar
                            argue that the neural circuitry for emotion supports the Conceptual Act
                            Theory. </note> The multiplicity of conceptions of affect and emotion is
                        echoed in affect studies. As Seigworth and Gregg argue, “there can only ever
                        be infinitely multiple iterations of affect and theories of affect” (3–4).
                        Despite the differences across these conceptions of emotion and its
                        appraisal, it is possible to identify points of contact across the competing
                        models and to synthesize aspects considered in some of these research
                        programs that are not under investigation in others. The strength in the
                        diversity of research on emotion is that we can hold these different models
                        up next to one another, distill their relevant features, and develop an
                        operational definition of emotion that allows for continued and novel
                        interrogation. Moreover, because we take an interdisciplinary approach, we
                        are leveraging aspects of these models that converge with conversations in
                        historical and literary criticism. Doing so allows us to bring to bear the
                        combined thinking about the complex notion of emotion across diverse
                        perspectives, historical periods, and approaches. To be clear then, the
                        purpose of this essay is not to provide a new, overarching definition of
                        emotion itself but to consider how we can use Baillie’s literary experiment
                        to critique contemporary models of the process of regulating emotional
                        experience. That is, we are focused on how emotions may be managed, not of
                        what they are made.</p>
                    <p>In this essay, we will reserve the word emotion for affect that has been
                        appraised. What we mean by “appraised affect” (i.e., emotion) is the
                        activation of affect that has become conscious which allows a person to
                        focus on the portion of affect that she can “act upon” (i.e.,
                            regulate).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Three cognitive
                            psychological principles frame our understanding of the connections
                            among affect, emotion, and cognition that include the following: 1)
                            affect and cognition are separable but interweaved systems; 2) affect is
                            flexible and “residual”; and 3) affect can have an unconscious impact on
                            cognition. First, for the idea of “separable,” consider the functioning
                            of the human perceptual process; there are systems for processing both
                            local features (i.e., the eyes, nose, and mouth of a face) and global
                            features of an object (i.e., the eyes are above the nose which is above
                            the mouth). These are “separable” physiological systems in that one can
                            be disrupted and the other will still function. However, they must
                            function together to “see” a “whole” face. Second, we think of the
                            flexibility of affect using connectionist models of memory wherein
                            working memory (currently conscious) is the activated part of long-term
                            memory (unconscious, yet accessible). Activation is the neural process
                            generated when attention is given to a particular memory and that fades
                            as attention shifts or wanes. Decades-old lyrics to a song tucked up in
                            memory can be activated by the first few notes of its music. In this
                            way, affect is “there” and “not there” all the time—some part active and
                            inactive. Third, we think of affect’s impact on cognition by thinking
                            about the theory of constructive perception. In this theory, top-down
                            factors (physiological states like hunger and emotional states like
                            fear) act upon perception simultaneously with (or prior to) the
                            processing of bottom-up factors in a physical scene (like the lines,
                            angles, shapes, and shadows of objects). So, research shows that in
                            moments of strong affect, people perceive fingerprint “matches” that are
                            not there (Dror et al.); that when in a bad mood, young adults tend to
                            look at negative objects while older adults tend to look at positive
                            objects (Isaacowitz et al.); and that emotional and affective valences
                            influence perceptual processing of vocal and visual stimuli at neuronal
                            levels (see Hensel et al. and Vogel et al.). From a constructive
                            perception approach, affect impacts our cognitive processing without our
                            conscious knowledge. Given this framework, we do not see a dissonance
                            between Tomkins’ early conceptions of the relation between affect and
                            cognition and Leys’ important critique of the “general turn to affect”
                            which has separated the body from the mind, i.e. affect from cognition.
                            We agree that this separation is counterproductive to understanding the
                            impact of affect on human thought and behavior. For more about these
                            aspects of cognition, see Sternberg’s highly readable, introductory
                            textbook, <title level="m">Cognitive Psychology</title>.</note> In other
                        words, in order to study the process of emotion regulation, we must
                        necessarily focus on the portion of emotional experience that can be
                        reflected upon and, perhaps, modified. This definition does not deny that
                        residual (un-appraised) affect remains and influences thought and behavior;
                        un-appraised affect still impacts people’s experience, even if they cannot
                        name it.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In her review essay, Favret also
                            discusses the “affective residue” that poets struggle with as
                            “unknowable” but there (1164).</note> As affect theorists Seigworth and
                        Gregg remind us, “In practice, then, affect and cognition are never fully
                        separable—if for no other reason than that thought is itself a body,
                        embodied” (2–3). So, the uncontrollable, unconscious function of emotion is
                        a vital part of human survival and the human experience. Indeed,
                        philosophers like Nussbaum have argued for the centrality of emotion and its
                        purposeful contributions to human thought and behavior not just as a
                        motivator, but as an essential aspect of how people experience the internal
                        and external world. Nussbaum sees the impact of feeling on human behavior as
                        an inevitable and necessary aspect of human experience—an aspect that should
                        not be “contained” but valued for its contributions to concepts like justice
                        and compassion. As she argues, “Emotions are not just the fuel that powers
                        the psychological mechanism of a reasoning creature, they are parts, highly
                        complex and messy parts, of this creature’s reasoning itself” (3). </p>
                    <p>Debates about the relationship between affect and cognition harken to
                        eighteenth century conversations about reason and the passions.
                        Specifically, Hume famously argued that, “reason is, and ought only to be
                        the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to
                        serve and obey them” (462). As Broadie explains, Hume sees the relation
                        between reason and the passions as one of “mutual dependence” such that
                        “reason without passion does not know where to go and passion without reason
                        does not know how to get there” (178–79).<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Because he thought his argument might be “somewhat extraordinary,” Hume
                            continues, “Since a passion can never, in any sense, be called
                            unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition, or when it chuses
                            means insufficient for the designed end, it is impossible, that reason
                            and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the government of
                            the will and actions” (464). </note> And in keeping with our notion of
                        emotion as appraised affect, meaning capable of being acted upon, Nazar
                        notes that, “Hume and Smith take moral judgment to be
                            <emph>deliberative</emph> processes that mobilize both feeling and
                        reason” (23). While the process of emotion regulation is distinct from the
                        larger notion of moral judgment, what we pull from these early discussions
                        is that reason (i.e., cognition) is necessary for feeling (i.e., affect) to
                        be acted upon. </p>
                    <p>Returning to more contemporary conversations in the realm of affective
                        science, Tomkins’ early conception of affect conceives of a motivational
                        system separate from but intimately tied to the driving of cognitive
                        functioning (i.e., a feedback system): “Feedback and affect are two distinct
                        mechanisms which may operate independent of each other in human beings”
                            (37).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The inherent intertwining of
                            affect and cognition despite their separateness is emphasized by
                            Tomkins, who stresses that “reason without affect would be impotent,
                            affect without reason would be blind. The combination of affect and
                            reason guarantees man’s higher degree of freedom” (37). For a more
                            recent description of how affect (as a separate system) motivates action
                            via a series of interconnected feedback loops, see Carver
                            301-307.</note> This conception fits both with Hume and Smith’s notion
                        of the relationship between reason and feeling and with Mulligan and
                        Scherer’s contemporary interdisciplinary model that defines emotion as a
                        product of a componential system that includes (among others) a cognitive
                        component and a neurophysiological component (352).<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> There is a long-standing line of philosophical work that
                            has pushed against the notion of emotion (affect) and reason (cognition)
                            as separate systems. For example, Solomon has argued that, “the passions
                            are not to be separated from reason; they are to be welded together into
                            a single unit” (15). In his “new Romanticism” perspective, Solomon
                            claims, “Emotions are said to distort our reality; I argue that they are
                            responsible for it. Emotions are said to divide us from our interests
                            and lead us astray; I argue that emotions create our interests and our
                            purposes” (15). In his work, Solomon rejects the pathologizing of
                            emotions. Our own understanding of the purpose of emotion fits with his
                            conception—we do not consider emotion “bad” or “hurtful” to human
                            cognition. In fact, recent psychological investigations have
                            re-emphasized that “negative” emotions are just as important to human
                            thought and behavior as “positive” emotions. What we take from the work
                            of Hume, Tomkins, and Barrett is the notion that emotion provides the
                            underlying motivation for all we do. Without emotion, there is no
                            driving force for human behavior. But this does not require a “melded”
                            system unless “melded” refers to the kind of integrated, parallel
                            processing system we see in most contemporary scientific conceptions of
                            the relation between cognition and emotion. </note> Ultimately,
                        grounding affect and cognition as “separate” but interconnected systems
                        aligns with current cognitive psychological and neuroscientific conceptions
                        of cognition—a brain-based, embodied network comprised of a multitude of
                        independent systems that work interactively and in parallel to influence one
                        another and to generate human thought and behavior. Emotion can have its own
                        un-appraised impact or be appraised and influenced by reason.</p>
                    <p>Finally, because the play under analysis focuses on hatred, we must also
                        acknowledge and consider the complexity of the relationship among anger,
                        rage, and hatred. Romantic studies has historically focused on grief,
                        terror, and horror (the sublime), especially as tied to the French
                        Revolution and Gothic Studies, but Stauffer has revisited anger as a central
                        and paradoxical emotion during the late eighteenth century and especially

                        “anger was generally demonized as irrational, destructive rage—as an all but
                        uncontrollable passion visited upon its victims”; on the other hand, anger
                        was seen as related to “authenticity and justice” (Stauffer 4, 11). As
                        Stauffer notes, rage, anger, hatred, and related concepts have murky
                        distinctions in a post-Terror world. </p>
                    <p>In the “Introductory Discourse,” Baillie distinguishes among these dark
                        emotions, recognizing that hatred is a long-term and long-lasting “passion.”
                        Like Baillie, emotion scientist Ekman also distinguishes between anger and
                        hatred, noting that “Hate: is an enduring state marked by anger towards a
                        person, but not the acts of that person. Unlike anger, fury, or rage, it
                        does not subside. Rather, hate persists over time and is easily called forth
                        by any stimulus” (366).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We note the
                            uncanny connection between Ekman and Baillie’s definition of hatred and
                            anger and their effects on people. Again, this convergence across the
                            centuries convinces us of the importance to have interdisciplinary
                            conversations.</note> As noted by Heylen et al., while anger is often
                        conceived of as a “short-lasting emotion,” it can also be “late-blooming”
                        with an “intensity [that] accumulates over a sizable amount of time—the
                        episodes last[ing] longer and reach[ing] their peak relatively late”
                            (175).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Recent psychological and
                            neuroscientific studies of anger have identified the neural signatures
                            of anger, the feedback loop in angry rumination that prolongs the
                            emotion, and the fact that anger can sometimes be purposefully selected
                            by an individual, despite its negative affect, in order to accomplish
                            behavioral goals. See Fabiansson et al. 2974–81; and Tamir et al.
                            324–28.</note> Likewise, we situate hate as a long-term, slowly building
                        passion that develops over time and is comprised of individual fits of
                        anger.</p>
                    <p>While Classical scholars argued that individuals expressing anger and fits of
                        rage were “not a candidate for normal sympathetic response,” Baillie’s
                        project nevertheless intends to engage audiences’ sympathetic curiosity
                        while playing out the rise and fall of hatred in the character of De Monfort
                        (Stauffer 21). Baillie recognizes the potential problems with creating
                        sympathetic curiosity in her audience for someone who is under “a passion so
                        baleful, so unamiable, . . . [and] reprehensible,” but she aspires to show
                        the “pernicious and dangerous nature” of this passion upon the “good gifts”
                        that De Monfort has (“Introductory Discourse” 108). In other words, her goal
                        is to “consider that it is the passion and not the man which is held up to
                        our execration” (“Introductory Discourse” 108). Her experiment with the
                        passions allows her to do so by illustrating the development of hatred over
                        time in a character who is not “decidedly wicked,” allowing audiences to
                        perhaps identify with De Monfort’s demise (“Introductory Discourse”
                        108).</p>

                    <head>We Are Who We Use: Constructing Social Emotion Regulation</head>
                    <p>At the heart of emotion regulation is a tension among physiological, mental,
                        and social influences of emotion and the extent to which that emotion is
                        enacted, decreased, increased, or maintained. In some settings, the
                        expression of a particular emotion is socially acceptable and even
                        evolutionarily beneficial. In others, the expression of that emotion is not
                        sanctioned. The regulation of this unwanted expression is a culturally
                        grounded skill set, learned over time, with decided individual differences.
                        Emotion regulation requires a consideration of how that process is learned
                        and how it could be enhanced. </p>
                    <p>The foundational and prevailing model of emotion regulation, devised by Gross
                        and his colleagues over the past three decades, is the “process model,”
                        which delineates an arc of emotion and identifies regulation strategies that
                        could effectively disrupt emotional processes at different stages (Gross,
                        “Emotion Regulation” 6). In other words, there are multiple points in time
                        during which emotional experiences can be avoided, modified, or heightened.
                        And, there are different emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) that are more
                        or less effective depending upon when they are used along the arc of the
                        emotional experience. For example, if one is fearful about flying, the ERS
                        “situation selection” could be used by simply avoiding air travel all
                        together; one can “regulate” the emotion of fear by not being in the
                        position to have a fearful experience in the first place. Alternatively, if
                        one is already in the throes of an emotion, then other ERSs would be
                        required. For example, one could decide to fly with a friend (ERS situation
                        modification), listen to music (ERS attentional deployment), learn about how
                        airplanes work (ERS reappraisal), or white-knuckle it (ERS expressive
                        suppression). The upshot of the process model is that successful emotion
                        regulation requires the ability to match the ERS with the temporal emotional
                        circumstance.</p>
                    <p>Bonnano and Burton argue that some people are better at negotiating this
                        process than others. This “regulatory flexibility” requires the ability to
                        read a room to determine whether emotion expression is warranted
                        (sensitivity to context); the ability to access a range of different
                        regulation strategies (repertoire); and the ability to monitor whether a
                        regulation strategy has been effective (responsiveness to feedback). Still,
                        their model underappreciates the social nature and motivation of emotion
                        regulation. Currently, affective scientists are working to consider how
                        emotion regulation may be impacted by social processes. For example,
                        Schmader and Berry Mendes suggest that emotion regulation may be influenced
                        by our consideration of whether “a certain emotional experience would
                        interfere with one’s social and personal goals” (116).<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors">In evaluation of the achievement of one’s social goals,
                            we can think of the desires of others as a kind of emotional constraint,
                            a constraint that if ill-fitting could result in “a power strategy
                            designed to break through the constraints which enforced it” (Tomkins
                            73).</note></p>
                    <p>Considering the role of the “social” in the modification (i.e., regulation)
                        of emotion is not a new endeavor in moral philosophy. Specifically, in
                        Smith’s conception of sympathy there is a component of interpersonal
                        feedback. As Broadie notes, “the spectator qua moral agent has the ability
                        to affect a change in the person whom he observes by revealing to the person
                        his reaction to him” (211). In other words, the spectator’s approval of the
                        actor (specifically the actor’s emotional display) matters and is capable of
                        regulating the emotional experience of the actor “probably towards
                        conformity with the feelings of the spectator” (Broadie 212). Even the
                        intrapersonal feedback required in Smith’s conception of sympathy has some
                        social aspect to it. That is, an actor must judge “the propriety or merit”
                        of her own emotional acts by taking on the role of an impartial spectator
                        (Broadie 213–14). The impartial spectator is a third person perspective that
                        an individual adopts to determine the “appropriateness” of her behavior in a
                        given situation. The impartial spectator is called upon to avoid the bias
                        that would result in trying to judge one’s own actions. As Welsh notes, “As
                        he [Smith] contemplates the total picture, the figure of the impartial
                        spectator emerges as a means to keep before us the comparisons that need to
                        be made in order to judge ourselves and our actions rightly” (171). So, even
                        when judging their own actions, people are simulating the judgments others
                        would make of them. As Welsh clarifies, “On the whole, friends and the
                        ‘spectator’ whom they begin to embody exert a moderating influence on our
                        passions and rapid responses” (172). The centrality of “approval” in Smith’s
                        conception of sympathy highlights the social nature of behavior
                        modification. It makes sense, then, that contemporary models of emotion
                        regulation would come to consider the role of social pressures and
                        relationships as well. </p>
                    <p>Indeed, while most cognitive neuroscientific work has considered
                        intrapersonal features of emotion regulation (focus on self), newer research
                        examines interpersonal emotion regulation, or the role others play in the
                        expression and management of emotions.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                            >Ironically, this is a moment where affect scientists are now catching
                            up to what literary scholars of affect have emphasized for some time,
                            given their grounding in the works of philosophers like Hume and Smith.
                            As Favret notes, Romantic scholars like Pinch have thought about passion
                            for some time as “a feeling operating between and among individuals, not
                            emanating from some private interiorized zone but from forms of social
                            and textual circulation” (1162). For more on the contagious role of
                            emotion in the period, see Pinch.</note> Zaki and Williams emphasize
                        that interpersonal regulation “may be the rule, not the exception,”
                        suggesting that “individuals often attempt to regulate others’ emotions
                        through empathic, supportive, and prosocial behaviors” (803). Specifically,
                        intrinsic interpersonal regulation occurs when people try to regulate
                            <emph>themselves </emph>through social contact; extrinsic interpersonal
                        regulation occurs when people try to regulate the emotions of
                            <emph>others</emph>. A response-dependent process requires that another
                        person respond with supportive feedback; a response-independent process
                        regulates emotion regardless of the feedback received. These distinctions
                        highlight the influence others can have on one’s own regulation. While the
                        use of intrinsic interpersonal regulation and of response-dependent
                        processes makes people vulnerable (i.e., the results of their emotion
                        regulation efforts are “in the hands” of others), there are potentially
                        valuable rewards to their selection. </p>
                    <p>Given these insights, we could modify Bonnano and Burton’s regulatory
                        flexibility by incorporating social considerations, influenced by
                        long-standing discussions of the social nature of sympathy and feeling. In
                        fact, they anticipated the need for such modifications, arguing that social
                        feedback would reflect cultural values and result in social costs or
                        benefits (603). In thinking about responsiveness to feedback, the success of
                        a regulation strategy might be driven by how those one values or fears have
                        responded. Likewise, context sensitivity and repertoire could be increased
                        by recruiting the resources and aid of others. However, the enhancement of
                        regulatory flexibility through social interactions may also depend upon
                        individual or relational differences (i.e., the intensity and length of a
                            relationship).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, Flores and
                            Berenbaum have found that the social regulation of emotion is influenced
                            by the desire someone has for emotional closeness. The desire for
                            emotional closeness might correlate with our familiarity with others,
                            our perceived similarity with others, and the personal experiences we
                            have had reaching out to others.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In perhaps the strongest contemporary argument for the primacy of
                        interpersonal affect dynamics, Butler argues that interactions with others
                        invariably involve the modulation of emotions, utilizing the concept of
                        contagion and “coconstruction of emotional meaning” to highlight the
                        inextricable link between one’s emotional experiences and those of others
                            (337).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> For more on classic and
                            contemporary conversations about contagion, see Pinch or Massumi.</note>
                        The social baseline model takes this social regulation of emotion as the
                        default in humans and other animals (Coan 618). Coan argues that
                        self-regulating emotion creates significant cognitive load, inherently
                        limiting people’s ability to negotiate successfully their own emotions. In
                        effect, the social regulation of emotion is cognitively “easier,” which
                        suggests “why individuals tend to invest less effort in self-regulation in
                        the presence of relational partners” (619). This aligns with affect
                        theorists Seigworth and Gregg, who argue, “At once intimate and
                        interpersonal, affect <emph>accumulates</emph> across both relatedness and
                        interruptions in relatedness,” and that affect “travers[es] the ebb and flow
                        of intensities that pass between ‘bodies,’” noting that these bodies
                        “reciprocate or co-participate in the passages of affect” (2). Combining
                        historical conceptions of the social in the operation of sympathy, the
                        debates of affect theorists about force relations, and recent integration of
                        the social in psychological processes of emotion regulation, it seems safe
                        to assume the supremacy of the social when managing and performing
                        affect-emotion. </p>
                    <p>Finally, recent psychological research empirically echoes the moral
                        philosophical idea that not only may social regulation be the default in
                        managing emotion, but that people are aware of the importance of negotiating
                        these exchanges. Cheung, Gardner, and Anderson found that people
                        strategically consider which friends or partners would be most effective at
                        helping them regulate specific emotional experiences. Moreover, their
                        research shows that individuals who have more diversified emotional
                        relationships (i.e., having a friend you go to when you are sad, another for
                        when you are mad, etc.) are healthier. The number of different kinds of
                        “emotionships” is more important for effective SER than the sheer quantity
                        of emotionships. These findings extend the earlier work of Coan, who argued
                        that, “prior experience with a close relational partner may provide a form
                        of ‘regulatory capital’ in the face of emotional stressor[s]” (616). The
                        importance of diversification in emotionships echoes the concept of a
                        diverse repertoire in Bonnano and Burton’s model of regulatory flexibility
                        and suggests a place to synthesize models of emotion regulation focused on
                        individual cognitive processes with the role of interpersonal affect
                        dynamics.</p>
                    <p>Because the empirical work examining interpersonal affect dynamics is
                        constrained to artificial lab environments, and the application to a rich,
                        complex, real-world engagement of SER is limited, using an interdisciplinary
                        lens provides the ability to consider SER <foreign>in situ</foreign>. Zaki
                        and Williams agree, arguing that questions of emotion regulation “may
                        require drawing from domains far afield from typical experimental psychology
                        but will also undoubtedly enrich our understanding of interpersonal
                        regulation in unanticipated ways” (808). Enter a consideration of the
                        dynamics of SER in <title level="m">De Monfort</title>, grounded in
                        Baillie’s concept of sympathetic curiosity, which itself was influenced by
                        the socio-scientific conversations of her day. In the following, we use an
                        interdisciplinary lens for a literary analysis highlighting exchanges
                        between the siblings in <title level="m">De Monfort </title>to inform
                        notions of SER.</p>
                    <p>Baillie’s foundational concept of sympathetic curiosity functions entirely
                        within a social context. Though everyone is imparted with this primary
                        “propensity,” it is only when engaging with others that people see it at
                        work. This “best instructor” is exercised through people’s interactions with
                        those around them, because of the need to “read” what others are feeling,
                        consider how they feel about that, and imagine how they might feel
                        themselves in that situation. In the following section, we highlight aspects
                        of the relationship between De Monfort and Jane in <title level="m">De
                            Monfort</title> that speak to how we envision future investigations into
                        SER models. Specifically, we explore moments that highlight both the
                        functioning and dysfunctioning of SER with an eye towards identifying those
                        areas that are not currently modeled within constrained empirical
                        investigations. We see Baillie’s program of work as particularly well-suited
                        to highlight these areas of SER given the precise and systematic,
                        one-emotion-at-a-time approach she uses, which is in line with both the
                        method taken in eighteenth-century medical investigations and with
                        twenty-first-century methodologies for exploring the neurocircuitry of
                        emotion (LeDoux 376).</p>

                    <p>Inherent in sympathetic curiosity is an interaction among self and others to
                        assess what another person feels and then adjust one’s own reactions in
                        light of that assessment. Below, we have two goals: 1) to provide converging
                        evidence from a literary text to socio-cognitive models of emotion
                        regulation (a kind of interdisciplinary “replication”); and 2) to
                        demonstrate areas of SER not yet recognized in empirical studies. <title
                            level="m">De Monfort</title> is Baillie’s tragedy about the “passion” of
                        hatred and was the final play in her 1798 collection. <title level="m">De
                            Monfort </title>traces the protagonist’s attempts to escape his hatred
                        of his childhood nemesis Rezenvelt. As the tragedy progresses, others,
                        especially his sister, Jane, try to help him come to terms with his hatred
                        and redirect it, in the end to little avail. When De Monfort erroneously
                        hears that Jane and Rezenvelt are secretly lovers, he vows revenge by
                        following Rezenvelt on his ride through the forest, murdering him in a fit
                        of rage.</p>
                    <p>As we’ve noted, interpersonal regulation happens primarily through our
                        closest social ties; for De Monfort, this is with his sister Jane. From the
                        first scene, host Jerome and manservant Manuel reference the love Jane has
                        for her brother. Manuel notes that it is his loyalty to her that keeps him
                        by De Monfort’s side: “She would have griev’ed if I had left my Lord”
                        (1.1.59). The reader also learn that De Monfort left without telling Jane,
                        and that Manuel is concerned that “it would afflict her much” (1.1.63). Here
                        we have evidence that the siblings’ relationship is one of support and
                        regulation, the one benefiting from the other.<note place="foot"

                    </p>
                    <p>Jane and De Monfort’s interdependency is further highlighted when Jane
                        arrives in town in search of her brother. She visits the Frebergs first,
                        confirming that De Monfort is in town. After some pleasantries, Count
                        Freberg tells Jane he finds De Monfort “well, but joyless” (2.1.59). Jane
                        resists that characterization by suggesting that this is just her brother’s
                        temperament, noting that usually his mind “opens not, but with the thrilling
                        touch / Of some strong-string o’the sudden press’d” (2.1.60–62). Yet, she
                        acknowledges that he is “a man in grief,” though no one seems aware of the
                        cause (2.1.66). This exchange demonstrates that SER can be accomplished
                        outside of oneself, without one’s knowledge, as others close to us do the
                        work of presenting our affect in socially acceptable terms. In other words,
                        regulation occurs with little to no cognitive and emotional costs for the
                        person described. While current models of SER describe how a person pulls
                        the resources of another to engage in self-regulation, they are limited to
                        regulation occurring in the physical presence of others. In contrast, we
                        highlight what we see as a kind of de-facto social emotion regulation that
                        has not yet been considered. Attention to Baillie’s systematic engagement
                        with emotion over time (rather than constrained within a moment of the
                        emotion in empirical studies) suggests that emotion regulation is not as
                        encapsulated as current models have suggested.</p>
                    <p>Jane recognizes that De Monfort’s emotional state is dependent on what Zaki
                        and Williams have called intrinsic interpersonal regulation. So, even though
                        whatever De Monfort has done thus far to try and regulate himself has not
                        worked, Jane is concerned that her presence would make things even worse,
                        and thus she initially declines Count Freberg’s invitation to stay for the
                        ball: <quote><lg>
                                <l>JANE. Here he will find all that can woo the heart</l>
                                <l>To joy and sweet forgetfulness of pain;</l>
                                <l>The sight of me would wake his feeling mind . . . (2.1.84–86)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Jane signals two things about De Monfort’s emotional
                        prospects. First, she thinks he can find the necessary interpersonal
                        regulation to “woo his heart” from whatever “grief” he might have. Second,
                        she also indicates that her presence would “wake” him to things he might do
                        well to put aside. In both cases, Jane recognizes the intimate realities of
                        De Monfort’s “feeling mind,” addressing the fact that others are key to his
                        own regulation and noting she has particular effects on it. Here we see the
                        extent of Jane’s insight into De Monfort’s emotion regulation strategies and
                        her own role in them. In other words, she is a key emotionship for how her
                        brother engages with others in the world, and she knows it.</p>
                    <p>The most vivid example of the emotional impact both siblings have on each
                        other happens during the Frebergs’ masked ball, and the reader learns the
                        extent to which De Monfort values Jane above all people in his life.
                        Literary critics like Hoeveler and Kim have noted the powerful erotic and
                        mythic qualities of the siblings’ relationship.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors">While critics like Hoeveler and Kim highlight either the
                            incestuous erotics or the biblical echoes of De Monfort and Jane’s
                            relationship, we have used the dynamic they describe to emphasize the
                            intimate and highly influential nature of their relationship. </note>
                        For De Monfort, in fact, this is the only relationship that provides him
                        with any desire or willingness to reveal his feelings of hatred. Equally
                        significant, this appears to be the one relationship that inspires feelings
                        other than despair, anger, sullenness, or hatred. This highlights De
                        Monfort’s limited emotionships, a limitation that Cheung et al. associate
                        with lower well-being as illustrated by De Monfort’s growing anxiety and
                        depression.</p>
                    <p>When Jane first appears at the ball, she disguises herself, leaving De
                        Monfort unaware that he is speaking to his sister. They begin a conversation
                        about siblings and the fact that the person she seeks is “heedless of [her]
                        pain,” having “forsaken” her (2.1.210). As the conversation continues and De
                        Monfort talks about his sister to someone he thinks is a stranger, he
                        regulates himself <emph>out of </emph>hatred for Rezenvelt and
                            <emph>into</emph> his passionate feelings for Jane. Even the mere idea
                        of Jane pulls him out of his internal struggle. When the disguised Jane
                        notes that perhaps “All sisters are not to the soul entwin’d / With equal
                        band,” suggesting that his sister has not “Weep’d for thee, cheer’d thee,
                        shar’d thy weal and woe / As I have done for him” (2.1.222–23), De Monfort
                        immediately protests. Though gloomy up to this point, he becomes loquacious
                        when speaking about his sister: <quote><lg>

                                <l>Compar’d to that which I do owe her love (2.1.225–27)</l>
                            </lg></quote> He continues, exclaiming: <quote><lg>
                                <l>DE MON. —But she of whom I speak</l>
                                <l>Is the dear sister of my earliest love;</l>
                                <l>In noble virtuous worth to none a second (2.1.229–31)</l>
                            </lg></quote> We see for the first time in the play, the longest
                        exchange De Monfort has with anyone aside from his soliloquies about his
                        angst and rage, and it is about Jane.</p>
                    <p>For De Monfort, Jane functions as a central vehicle for self-regulation, and
                        though this exchange is structured around <emph>the idea of</emph> Jane
                        rather than an actual conversation with Jane, it pries open a different
                        possibility for De Monfort’s emotional terrain. Up to this point De Monfort
                        has either talked about his hatred for Rezenvelt or his feelings of anguish
                        at having to be around him, and for most of the rest of the play the stage
                        directions describing De Monfort’s physical actions echo words like
                        “agitation,” “angrily,” “impatiently” “distractedly,” “contemptuously,” and
                        “disordered” (313, 315, 317, 318, 326, 328). Yet, the idea of Jane coaxes
                        feelings like “eagerly” or “affectionately” out of De Monfort (327, 334).
                        The shift in De Monfort’s affect demonstrates that the memories of one’s
                        social emotion relationships may have the power to motivate our regulation
                        efforts when context requires what seems like intrapersonal regulation. In
                        other words, even when doing regulation work on their own, people may
                        actually be invoking the social relationships they have with others to
                        accomplish this work.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Remember our
                            previous discussion of Smith’s impartial spectator here as an earlier
                            consideration of the role others play in our modification of emotional
                            displays, even when we must invoke them in our imagination. </note>
                        Therefore, along with suggesting that SER models incorporate actions taken
                        on one’s behalf (de-facto social emotion regulation), we also argue that the
                        activation of memories of others may enhance one’s intrapersonal regulation
                        repertoire and motivations, what we consider an “imaginary social emotion
                            regulation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Fridlund and Russell argue
                            the same, noting, “we often imagine that others are present when they
                            are not” and that the imaginary audience can trigger facial expressions
                            of emotion (312).</note></p>
                    <p>Jane is confident that she can regulate her brother’s emotions regardless of
                        what they are. In pleading with De Monfort to share the source of his
                        distress, Jane assures him that she will help him successfully wrestle with
                        his feelings. When De Monfort exclaims that his hatred “will not pass away:
                        ‘twill haunt me still,” Jane states that she will “haunt thee too” and that
                        she will “wrestle darkling with the fiend” and “o’ercome it” (2.2.52–56).
                        Jane explicitly offers to take on the emotion regulation work for her
                        brother convinced of her ability to do so. De Monfort, fearful and ashamed
                        of disappointing his sister, is motivated to control his expression of
                            hatred.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Emotion regulation motivated by
                            shame and fear are described in both Tomkins and Crozier. </note> We
                        know that this is an established dynamic, as Jane acknowledges to Freburg
                        that she has been De Monfort’s constant companion since early childhood and
                        the death of their parents. After De Monfort reveals his hatred for
                        Rezenvelt, Jane bemoans the fact that she was not present earlier to help
                        him. She says she came to him immediately when she discovered his duress,
                        telling him, “I heard a secret whisper, and resolv’d / Upon the instant to
                        return to thee” (2.2.143–44). She also blames herself for not being able to
                        allay her brother’s feelings sooner, exclaiming, “These absent months, have
                        brought us all this woe. / Had I remained with thee it had not been”
                        (2.2.148–49). We see that Jane thinks that if she had not left him alone, De
                        Monfort would not have dueled with Rezenvelt nor have the kind of saturated
                        hatred that now seems permanent.</p>
                    <p>In these exchanges it is also important to note that De Monfort is aware of
                        the critical role Jane plays in his emotional interactions with the world.
                        He hesitates to admit the cause of the change in his affect because he is
                        aware of the danger of losing his sister’s admiration and guidance. De
                        Monfort fears Jane’s reaction to his confession and indicates that when he
                        reveals the truth, “thou wilt despise me” (2.2.78). In other words, De
                        Monfort understands better than Jane that he is not the person she is
                        convinced he is; in this case, De Monfort knows the limitations of his
                        emotionship with Jane and tries not to disillusion her. Though Jane has
                        promised to listen to and support him, when he reveals his hatred, the
                        reader finds that he was correct and that she is startled at the vehemence
                        of it. She cannot understand how her brother hates a man who mercifully did
                        not kill him when they dueled and: <quote><lg>
                                <l>JANE. . . . gave thee that life he might have ta’en?</l>
                                <l>That life which thou so rashly did expose</l>
                                <l>To aim at his! (2.2.137–39)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Although Jane understands her influence over her brother,
                        she is mistaken about her image of him and about her ability to shift his
                        feelings of hatred. More important, this moment illustrates that De Monfort
                        is more aware of the nature of their emotionship than is Jane. When he
                        finally expresses the depth of his hatred, she rejects his feelings and who
                        he is at that moment, “De Monfort, this is fiend-like, frightful, terrible!”
                        and wonders “could in thy breast such horrid tempest wake / Who are thyself
                        his fellow?” (2.2.94, 97–98).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In Jane’s
                            reaction to De Monfort’s revelation of hatred, we perhaps see an example
                            of Stauffer’s analysis of anger as unsympathetic and frightening.
                        </note></p>
                    <p>Baillie’s careful dissection of an intense sibling relationship allows us to
                        see the limitations and multi-dimensionality of SER at work. The insights we
                        derive from this analysis suggest that models of SER should take into
                        consideration the work people do to avoid disrupting the relationships they
                        depend upon. In other words, just as regulatory flexibility models of
                        emotion break intrapersonal regulation into context sensitivity, repertoire,
                        and feedback, SER models could also be broken down into these components. In
                        addition to examining how people engage in the act of regulation with
                        others, we should also consider the meta-knowledge they have about who is
                        most appropriate to help them regulate certain kinds of emotions and how to
                        read the feedback they are getting from others during this work. We might
                        also consider the type of relationships that are more or less effective to
                        incorporate into people’s regulation strategies.</p>
                    <p>Again, looking at the intensity of SER highlights these issues. When De
                        Monfort finally confesses his hatred to Jane, we see Jane’s direct attempts
                        to regulate his emotional state. He asks his sister, “What shall I do?”
                        (2.2.196). Importantly, Baillie provides the reader with the stage direction
                        that De Monfort asks this “affectionately,” suggesting that he will do his
                        best to listen to her and that she will offer him strategies he cannot think
                        of himself. Jane implores him to “Repel the hideous foe. / Be great; be
                        valiant” (2.2.200). The force of Jane’s command is highlighted as she
                        responds to his hesitation, exclaiming, “Thou cans’t, thou may’st, thou
                        wilt. / We shall not part till I have turn’d thy soul” (2.2.205–06). </p>
                    <p>At this moment, Jane has stepped in to deliberately control De Monfort’s
                        emotional regulation attempts, a strong vision of the possibilities of SER.
                        Here, then, we note that, at least initially, De Monfort is willing to be
                        guided by Jane. She is convinced about her ability to affect change in her
                        brother as she says: <quote><lg>
                                <l>JANE. Come to my closet; free from all intrusion,</l>
                                <l>I’ll school thee there; and thou again shalt be</l>
                                <l>My willing pupil, and my gen’rous friend; (2.2.210–13)</l>
                            </lg></quote> All agency for emotion regulation is now laid upon Jane’s
                        shoulders as De Monfort relents, saying “Do as thou wilt; / I will not
                        grieve thee more” (2.2.216).</p>
                    <p>Although De Monfort does not think himself capable of shifting his feelings,
                        at Jane’s convincing he does calm himself enough to try to engage the
                        strategies she provides. At the beginning of Act III, the reader sees De
                        Monfort reading books Jane provides for his education and distraction. She
                        at first seems pleased, stating that in reading the Bible, De Monfort’s
                        “willing mind has been right well employ’d” and hopes that in this
                        meditation, his “heart warm[s] at the fair display / Of peace and concord
                        and forgiving love” (3.1.2–3). However, while De Monfort’s anger has been
                        ameliorated, he explains to her that it is a hard struggle, grounded in
                        childhood, and that he still harbors hatred toward Rezenvelt. He notes that
                        “nature herself doth lift her voice aloud, / And cries, it is impossible!”
                        to really do what Jane asks and have him “love thine enemy” (3.1.26–27,
                            15).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The powerlessness De Monfort
                            expresses here aligns with Tomkins’ ideas about affective control. He
                            argues, “affective responses seem to the individual to be aroused easily
                            by factors over which he has little control, with difficulty by factors
                            which he <emph>can</emph> control and to endure for periods of time
                            which he controls only with great difficulty if at all” (62).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>That De Monfort is able to name and reflect upon the emotion with which he is
                        struggling is a small emotion regulation success (he is capable of assessing
                        feedback here). However, according to Baillie’s theory about the evolution
                        of hatred, it may be “too late” for Jane’s attempts at emotion regulation to
                        “cure” her brother.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Baillie’s sense that it
                            is “too late” in the development of hatred foreshadows the description
                            of “late-blooming” anger-come-hatred episodes, when the anger is at its
                            most intense in the second half of the arc (Heylen et al. 175).</note>
                        Indeed, Baillie notes that hatred “aided by circumstances of little
                        importance, grows at last into such antipathy and personal disgust as makes
                        him who entertains it, feel, in the presence of him who is the object of it,
                        a degree of torment and restlessness which is insufferable” (“Introductory
                        Discourse” 108). Jane encourages De Monfort to keep trying, asking, “And
                        canst thou do no more for love of heaven?” (3.1.30). Again, we see that De
                        Monfort’s attempts at emotion regulation are being guided almost solely
                        through his relationship with Jane as he responds that “But this, my Jane,
                        I’ll do for love of thee” (3.1.33). He offers to apologize to Rezenvelt but
                        anticipates that the event will cause him (De Monfort) great pain. He asks
                        Jane, “Will it suffice thee? More than this I cannot” (3.1.52). Jane accepts
                        this offer, perhaps seeing it as the beginning of more to come, saying, “I
                        hop’d a better change, and still will hope” (3.1.55). Jane’s attempts at
                        regulating De Monfort have gotten him to a point not reached earlier in the
                        play, but because this was not emotional work of his own, De Monfort seems
                        ill prepared to succeed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Heylen et al.
                            found that “late-blooming” anger activates emotion regulation strategies
                            such as catastrophizing and rumination, strategies not associated with
                            regulation success. This research suggests that De Monfort would be
                            “stuck” with these strategies if not for his sister’s
                        invention.</note></p>
                    <p>When De Monfort agrees to reconcile with Rezenvelt, the reader sees him
                        prepared to use the strategies Jane provides. However, because they are not
                        his own, he does not succeed. While awaiting Rezenvelt, De Monfort expresses
                        unease, perhaps sensing his future failure: “This morning is oppressive,
                        warm, and heavy: / There hangs a foggy closeness in the air;” (3.1.118–19).
                        Despite these misgivings, De Monfort and Rezenvelt’s exchange starts off
                        well enough. De Monfort tells Rezenvelt that in his “wayward moods” he has
                        “too oft forgot the due regard / Your rank and talents claim” (3.1.171–73).
                        De Monfort offers Rezenvelt his hand “with dignity” and says, “I will not
                        offer you an hand of concord,” but he will “declare” that his “spared life”
                        is owed to Rezenvelt’s “forbearance” (3.1.187, 190–92). This incomplete yet
                        honest and effortful apology seems to satisfy Jane, who we are told, “smiles
                        with great approbation” (345). But when Rezenvelt demands an embrace,
                        something more than Jane has schooled De Monfort to give, things take a turn
                        for the worst. A handshake was in the script practiced by the siblings; an
                        embrace would require greater emotion regulation progress than Jane has been
                        able to achieve. </p>
                    <p>Illustrated in these moments is the notion that although emotions can be
                        regulated by others, the regulated individual may not benefit beyond the
                        initial intervention.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> This inability to
                            benefit from others may be due to “a residual form of the affect which
                            is at once heightened, distorted, and chronic and which is severely
                            punitive” (Tomkins 69).</note> In other words, his or her own regulatory
                        flexibility has not been expanded but only temporarily supported. So
                        although the social baseline theory would argue that SER is the default
                        method for dealing with emotions, it is insufficient for developing
                        additional emotion regulation skills that could be called upon in future
                        exchanges. We noted that the thought of one’s social emotionships would
                        animate self-regulation, and that certainly rings true in this sibling
                        dynamic. But here we also see that Baillie identifies a clarification for
                        this model. Although SER motivates the use of strategies one is already able
                        to perform, it is insufficient to lead to the development of
                            <emph>new</emph> regulation strategies that would permanently expand
                        one’s own repertoire; at best, they are only temporarily borrowed. Our
                        analysis of Baillie’s play suggests this limitation could be especially
                        problematic with an intractable passion like hatred.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the failed apology, Baillie’s stage directions indicate that
                        Jane and De Monfort “look expressively to one another, without speaking”
                        (347). This silent look is the last time both siblings are in contact with
                        each other until after De Monfort has murdered Rezenvelt. When they are
                        reunited, De Monfort makes one last attempt to regulate on behalf of his
                        sister saying: <quote><lg>
                                <l>DE MON. I thought to sink in abject wretchedness:</l>
                                <l>But for thy sake I’ll rouse my manhood up,</l>
                                <l>And meet it bravely; no unseemly weakness, (5.2.76–78)</l>
                            </lg></quote> The last time Jane sees De Monfort alive he “endeavors to
                        suppress his feelings” (378). Ultimately, without his sister, De Monfort is
                        unable to face his end “proudly,” and he dies from madness. Rezenvelt’s
                        murder and De Monfort’s breakdown and death at the end of the play occur in
                        Jane’s absence, indicating that De Monfort has become chronically dependent
                        upon her for regulation, and that perhaps her constraining influence has
                        exacerbated his hatred.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Kim warns about
                            “the danger of being unveiled” (722). She notes that in De Monfort’s
                            case it was others’ “curiosity” and “reckless seizing and laying bare of
                            the passion [that] proves fatal” and that “the revelation divests De
                            Monfort of his ennobling shroud of mysterious suffering and forces him
                            to deal openly with a passion he cannot manage” (721). This identifies a
                            dangerous limitation, one not yet incorporated into SER
                        models.</note></p>

                    <p>Overall, while we see key aspects of current SER models in the sibling
                        exchanges highlighted in our analysis, we emphasize aspects of these
                        interactions that are not yet incorporated fully into those models. First,
                        we note that with intense relationships, SER work can be carried out through
                        de-facto social emotion regulation on the part of one person for another.
                        Similarly, imagining the relationships one has with others can motivate the
                        emotion regulation strategies one selects. However, we also suggest that
                        when SER work is conducted on behalf of another person, this limits the
                        opportunities for learning and development. As we see with De Monfort, by
                        relinquishing responsibility for his emotion regulation work to Jane, he is
                        unable to develop and expand his regulatory flexibility. His ability to
                        engage in context sensitivity has not grown, his repertoire of strategies
                        has not expanded, and he has not become more responsive to feedback from
                        those around him. Although Coan argues that SER is the default because it is
                        cognitively easier, there are costs to outsourcing emotion regulation work.
                        Current models of SER should consider these costs and explore the limiting
                        effect they may have on the development of regulatory flexibility.</p>
                    <p>We also propose these costs exist along a continuum depending upon the
                        intensity and nature of the emotionship. In other words, with the kind of
                        intense sibling relationship we see between De Monfort and Jane, the effort
                        of conducting SER is one-sided, with less concern about damaging or
                        weakening the relationship. In contrast, if a relationship is not as
                        established, SER work may require more cognitive control in both parties,
                        thus allowing some opportunities for the development of new emotion
                        regulation strategies and skills. For example, De Monfort is able to stop
                        reading the room because the duration, constancy, and strength of their
                        relationship allow Jane to do that work for him without endangering it.</p>
                    <p>More broadly, we offer this integrated analysis of Baillie’s play and the
                        interactions of contemporary socio-cognitive models as an example of how an
                        interdisciplinary approach to affect studies can develop productive
                        conversations across disciplines. We are compelled by the arguments that
                        conversations mired in a consideration of what affect is keep us from
                        advancing our understanding of how affect works.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> As Mesquita et al. argue, “By focusing on cultural
                            construction of emotion, we shift the focus toward how people from
                            different cultures ‘do’ emotions and away from which emotions they
                            ‘have’” (31).</note> Presenting the language and ideas of emotion
                        regulation as a way to think about the “yet-ness” of affect could open up
                        new areas of exploration in affect studies that move beyond either/or
                        conversations about cognition versus the body that have been the focus of
                        moral philosophers like Hume and Smith and contemporary scholars like
                        Nussbaum and Solomon (Seigworth and Gregg 3). In fact, interpreting the
                        early work of Tomkins alongside those of contemporary affect scientists such
                        as Fridland and Russell, Bonnano and Burton, and Zaki and Williams
                        emphasizes the problem with a potential “new-wave dualism” seen in the
                        framing of affect as “body” and cognition as “mind.” We see our
                        interdisciplinary exploration and integration as fitting with Leys’ call for
                        taking a more ethical and nuanced approach to the incorporation of
                        experimental findings in the building of affect theories.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors"> Favret and Zunshine emphasize the tension between
                            wanting to use scientific studies and also fearing this incursion in
                            literary studies.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe our approach, perhaps more demanding and painstakingly slower, is
                        one that invites and requires scholars not only to read the works published
                        in each of their fields, but also to talk to and learn from each other as
                        they try to understand and negotiate points of similarity and difference.
                        Our approach also avoids the danger of consciously or unconsciously creating
                        “paradoxes where there [are] none” (Leys 467). Thus, literary scholars and
                        cognitive psychologists (for example) can work together to create an
                        understanding of human cognition, affect, emotion, and literature that would
                        not be built in isolation. Invoking Zunshine’s metaphor of the <title
                            level="m">bricoleur</title>, we argue that this messy merging and
                        blurring will invite new “bloom-spaces” that encompass both established
                        disciplinary strongholds and yet to be imagined new ones (Seigworth and
                        Gregg 9). As Zunshine has called literary theorists into a conversation with
                        the cognitive scientists, we ask cognitive scientists to engage with fellow
                        humanists so that the exchange becomes bi- or multi- directional, generating
                        more enriching conversations about the nature of human behaviors and
                        cultures.</p>
