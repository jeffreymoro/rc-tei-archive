            <p class="noCount">This essay examines the cognitive underpinnings of affect circulation in the poetry
               of Coleridge and Keats, poets who sought to shape the reading experiences of their
               contemporary and future audiences. Both poets utilized the automaticity inherent in
               reading popular genres like the Gothic and Romance, as they immerse their readers
               in a flood of sensation. Yet, interruptions to the narrative flow complicate moments
               of composition and reading, ultimately highlighting a complex cognitive and affective
               work happening through passive reading. While such sensational forms of reading were
               often disparaged during the Romantic period, modern cognitive psychology shows these
               “passive” or “immersive” forms are actually complex in their affective work. By structurally
               regulating the sensory experience, controlling the affective overflow, and calling
               attention to the cognitive and cultural processes at work underneath the fiction,
               these authors ensure we will not be caught in a dream world for long without awaking
               more enlightened. </p>

               <p>Medical science and literature converged in eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century
                  debates over embodied reading experiences. For Romantic-era thinkers, reading was
                  not simply an intellectual pursuit but a bodily exercise, and this belief has conflicting
                  implications. The physiological element of reading facilitates an intimate connection
                  between the bodies involved in acts of reading—those of the author, reader, and text.
                  These newly understood levels of intimacy open possibilities for the transformative
                  work of literature; however, the danger of such physiological connection is the ease
                  with which a reader’s body and mind can be influenced. Immersive reading—getting lost
                  in the affective throes of narrative—seems to include a loss of the thinking, reasoning
                  self. Immersive reading perhaps even leaves the reader at the mercy of the text. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the Romantic era, the mind itself becomes increasingly embodied, located at the
                     site of the brain instead of existing as an immaterial entity.

                              soul. For instance, Thomas Branch’s Thoughts on Dreaming (1738) explores dreaming
                              as proof that the soul exists as a “separate state” from the body (2). Likewise, Walter
                              Charlton’s A Natural History of the Passions (1701) distinguishes between the Rational
                              and the Sensitive souls, both of which can influence the body, though “made of substance
                              purely spiritual” (8). However, Andrew Fyfe writes A System of Anatomy and Physiology
                              in 1795 in which he compiles medical research and claims that the soul must be in

                     </div> Alan Richardson traces this line of thinking through theorists and scientists like
                     Edmund Burke and Joseph Priestley to poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats,
                     demonstrating their belief that the mind is an organ subject to growth and expansion.
                     In the same way one would build up a muscle through strategic use, the brain can be
                     enlarged through a sort of “mental calisthenics” (Richardson 28). As Priestley explains
                     in his 1777 lecture on the sublime, the mental organ dilates to “conceive a great
                     object” (119). Romantic poets take up the responsibility for the growth of the reader’s
                     mind, debating upon and experimenting with ways to engage their audience in effective
                     mental exercises. Romantic-era poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor
                     Coleridge rated the novel as senseless entertainment meant for mindless consumption
                     by a public whose sensibilities were dull and unrefined. In Book II of <em>The Friend</em> (1809), Coleridge writes: “The habit of receiving pleasure without any exertion of
                     thought, by the mere excitement of curiosity and sensibility, may be justly ranked
                     among the worst effects of habitual novel reading” (2:151). Coleridge goes on to say
                     that absorption in the plot and sensory experience of the tale—taking pleasure from
                     “mere excitement of curiosity and sensibility”—“dwarf[s]” cognitive capacity (2:151).
                     According to Coleridge, passive reading (absorption without intellectual and imaginative
                     contribution) inhibits the development of a reader’s brain. Here we see that passive
                     or immersive reading fails to properly engage the brain in exercise. Instead of enlarging
                     the organ, improper reading practices lead to brain atrophy. Wordsworth and Coleridge
                     believed an epidemic of novel readers meant sensational stories sold best because
                     these tales are what can excite the dulled sensibilities of dwarfed brains. How could
                     literature perform transformative work on the psyche of a reader who was unable to
                     sense and feel, to engage the affect of a text?</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While such popular genres were often disparaged, recent cognitive psychology shows
                     these forms that encourage passive or immersive reading are actually complex in their
                     affective work. A cognitive mechanism for “reading” social situations enables the
                     passivity that Romantic writers feared. The immersed attitude of a passive reader
                     can be attributed to the cognitive architecture humans evolved to navigate social
                     environments. In Theory of Mind theory (ToM), cognitive psychologists point to ways
                     we read people through their actions and behaviors, attributing emotion, motivation,
                     and beliefs to them automatically. This seems obvious, but, in fact, connecting outward
                     signs to inward states is an evolved skill. In <em>Why We Read Fiction</em> (2006), Lisa Zunshine writes that when we engage fiction using ToM, we do so in the
                     same way we engage and contextualize social situations in the real world. As we read
                     the actions and the dialogue of fictional characters, we ascribe complicated internal
                     systems of memory, emotion, and motivation them. She explains: <span class="quote">‘[T]he cognitive mechanisms that evolved to process information about thoughts and
                        feelings of human beings are constantly on the alert, checking out their environment
                        for cues that fit their input conditions. On some level, then, works of fiction manage
                        to “cheat” these mechanisms into “believing” that they are in the presence of material
                        that they were “designed” to process, that is, that they are in the presence of agents
                        endowed with a potential for a rich array of intentional stances. (10)’</span> The ToM employed as we read a narrative works because our minds are cheated into the
                     same kind of cognitive processing of fiction as they perform of social reality, a
                     form of “neural recycling” explained by neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene (7).

                              but rather the human brain’s neural architecture recycles existing pathways in order
                              to create the meaning of words on the page (7).</span></div>

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>To expand our understanding of the cognitive architecture at work as a reader employs
                  ToM, let us consider recent revelations in cognitive linguistics. Key to the cognitive
                  process of reading is the recruitment of the motor and sensory regions of the brain
                  to make sense of and even replicate the affect in language. Noting recent experiments
                  by Pulvermuller and his colleagues, Dehaene explains: <span class="quote">‘Some verbs such as “bite” or “kiss” evoked mouth movements, others hand actions (“write,”
                     “throw”), and yet others actions performed by legs and feet (“kick,” “walk”). A remarkable
                     fragmentation of meaning was observed: each of the verb types activated a distinct
                     sector of the premotor cortex, at the location represented in the “motor homunculus,”
                     or map of our body. Thus word meaning seems to be literally embodied in our brain
                     networks. A string of letters only makes sense if it evokes, in a few hundred milliseconds,
                     myriad features dispersed in the sensory, motor, and abstract brain maps for location,
                     number, intention. (113)’</span> The ease with which humans comprehend the written word (comprehension takes only
                  a few hundred milliseconds) and how comprehension relies upon a translation through
                  the body is truly striking, and Dehaene uses the analogy of a tidal bore to describe
                  the rush of processing systems that engage in translating word on the pages into meaning
                  (114).</p>
               <p>These findings seem to offer an anatomical basis for the fears held by eighteenth-
                  and early nineteenth-century writers for the passive novel reader’s vulnerability
                  should he be caught up in a dream world. Feeling the text on his body, a passive reader
                  could easily forget the distinctions between fiction and reality. Given the effortlessness
                  in translation of the literary to nonliterary signification, we know the reverse is
                  equally probable: we mentally process actual events as if they were analogous to the
                  virtual comings and goings of imagined characters. Indeed, this possibility inspires
                  the anxiety surrounding literature’s influence on an unthinking readership. Zunshine
                  elaborates this point: <span class="quote">‘It seems to me that our unease on this occasion stems from our intuitive realization
                     that on some level our evolved cognitive architecture indeed does not fully distinguish
                     between real and fictional people. Faced with Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, our
                     Theory of Mind jumps at the opportunity (so to speak) to speculate about their past,
                     present, and future states of mind, even as we realize that these “airy forms [and]
                     phantoms of imagination” do not deserve such treatment. (18–19)’</span> If we are passive readers of fiction (especially irresponsibly written novels that
                  present overwrought sentiment or sensational events), we allow the phantoms of imagination
                  to infiltrate our everyday interactions. We see from Jane Austen’s <em>Northanger Abbey</em> (1817), as it parodies the genre and its readers, how this is the perceived danger
                  of reading too many Gothic novels.  </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Though historically we have ascribed a failure to distinguish between fiction and
                     reality to the lost control over one’s rational mind, the most recent findings of
                     cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology find that the mind has evolved in
                     ways that make the mental confluence of fiction and reality healthful. Zunshine examines
                     how readers become aware of their cognitive processing in the reading experience.
                     She concludes that the pleasure derived from reading fiction is satisfaction in recognizing
                     our cognitive mastery of the material, our ability to operate ToM. Fiction is a space
                     where we can experience an automatic (though advanced) activity of the mind, but the
                     pleasure derived is from seeing ourselves being immersed, being automatic.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Similarly, Richardson identifies a phenomenon in the Romantic era that he calls the
                              “neural sublime.” In moments of disruption, the subject is “not marveling at the power
                              of Reason [as with the Kantian sublime] but rather stunned by the capacity and complexity
                              of the human brain” (Richardson 29). </span></div>
                     </div> Through narrative, our minds are allowed to both work and see themselves work. In
                     this we are stunned and even made uncomfortable by how much of our cognition is inaccessible.
                     Perhaps the inaccessibility is due to the automaticity with which our brains process
                     information on the page or in our social worlds. As readers we hold two contrasting
                     states of mind: we are performing a cognitive task automatically, and we are aware
                     of that automaticity though we cannot fully untangle the neuronal pathways. We are
                     not, then, entirely passive readers: we are aware of our own “passivity” on some level.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In what follows, I will show how immersive, affective reading experiences of works
                  by Coleridge and Keats facilitate the movement between the imagined and the real.
                  Absorption in the text happens so readily that the cognitive work resembles the ease
                  of social cognition in ToM. Yet, these Romantic writers utilize structural abnormalities
                  to disrupt the immersion and call attention to the embodied cognitive process of immersive
                  reading, thus encouraging the growth of the reader’s mind. By placing themselves at
                  a site of cooperative reading with alongside their audience, Coleridge and Keats reaffirm
                  the intimate connection between the bodies involved in acts of reading. </p>

               <h2><span class="head">Immersive Reading and Material Sublimity</span></h2>
               <p>Eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century writers saw the slippage between fiction
                  and reality happening as reading habits changed with the proliferation of popular
                  fiction. In response, Wordsworth sought to teach his readers how to maintain distance
                  between the emotional and the rational. If Wordsworth’s mode is, as Keats said, the
                  “egotistical sublime,” a defensive position that distances a reader from immediate
                  sensation in order to maintain the integrity of the thinking self, Keats’s “material
                  sublime” offers a counter-model to the Wordsworthian poet: the material sublime embraces
                  the overflow of powerful emotion in the moments of aesthetic experience. The idea
                  of the material sublime emerges in a poem to John Hamilton Reynolds (“To J.H. Reynolds,
                  Esq.”), written on 25 March 1818 in the midst of <em>Isabella</em>’s composition: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,</div>
                     <div class="l">Would all their colours from the sunset take,</div>
                     <div class="l">From something of material sublime,</div>
                     <div class="l">Rather than shadow our own soul’s daytime</div>
                     <div class="l">In the dark void of night. (Keats l. 67–71)<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Notably, this exaltation longs to join a passive openness to sensory input with the
                  active play of the mind’s store. While the wish for a dreaming state may appear initially
                  passive, the forceful action “take” stressed at the end of line 68 contrasts with
                  the weaker feminine meter of the opposing verb “shadow.” Dreaming, whether in sleep
                  or in a waking dream, is a joint act of sensual imprint and imaginative projection,
                  while shadowing is a flat, colorless reiteration of the self, the shadow of “our own
                  soul’s daytime.” And while a familiar daytime shadow may provide comfort in “the dark
                  void of night,” Keats’s ideal poet relishes “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without
                  any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” (<em>Letters</em> II. 213). For Keats, a poet is capable of existing in negative space, the space of
                  immersion and passivity, and, for him, this space fosters growth.</p>
               <p>Coleridge also advocates for sensory immersion, a radical openness to material (and
                  textual) excess. For example, in “Kubla Khan,” (1816) the muse overtakes the poet
                  while in an unconscious dream state. Here, Coleridge imagines himself as the vehicle
                  for a larger message, a truth that differs in effect from Wordsworthian self-reflection
                  in the egotistical sublime. Where the egotistical sublime positions the poet prominently
                  as the interpreter and philosopher, always in control of the emotions and message
                  being transferred, the Coleridgean poet dissolves into an ether of affect and impressions.
                  The feelings and impressions cohere to form ideas. Rather than emerging from a disembodied
                  mind, the body of the poet cannot be disentangled from the mind as together they translate
                  meaning to the audience. </p>
               <p>This Coleridgean vision of the poet can be read as a model for Keats’s idea of the
                  material sublime, and I argue that Keats uses this Coleridgean poet in his own Gothic
                  Romance <em>Isabella; or the Pot of Basil</em> (1818). Coleridge establishes a poet figure both in the narrative itself and in the
                  bibliographic material that frames and contextualizes the narrative. The poet of the
                  narrative seems to have been overtaken by the material excess of sensation, but, importantly,
                  Coleridge’s sensual excess in “Kubla Khan” results from the act of reading “Purchas’s
                  Pilgrimage.” Like an immersed reader of narrative, the poet has invited the material
                  and textual into his body and has consequently abdicated control to the text. The
                  literary and the nonliterary become confused for the entranced poet/reader. Nevertheless,
                  a sensually immersive poetic state is fraught with difficulties. The poet is an imperfect
                  medium for the dream vision because of his existence in the modern world. At any moment,
                  he may be woken from his trance state into his conscious reality. With a knock at
                  the door, Coleridge is brought back to a self-consciousness where the <span class="foreign">cogito</span> resumes control over sensory experience and the boundaries between self and outside,
                  the literary and the nonliterary, are reasserted. Yet, Coleridge’s waking is a narrative
                  structure, designed to both allow and disallow the analogous slippage between fiction
                  and reality. Immersive reading engages the reader in the affective ecology of the
                  text: the reader feels as if she is participating in the narrative, experiencing the
                  movement and the emotion through ToM. By reasserting the authorial voice, in a seeming
                  Wordsworthian move, Coleridge calls attention to the cognitive processes and the narrative
                  devices that have allowed for the immersive experience in the first place.</p>
               <p>“Kubla Khan” immerses its reader in a sublimity of movement and sensation, until,
                  like the poet himself, she awakes to remember that this is a constructed experience.
                  “Kubla Khan” seeks a balance between sensation and sensibility by creating a safe
                  space for the free movement of affect within the poem or dream and then calling attention
                  to this designed space of immersive reading. The movement through Coleridge’s poem
                  takes the reader down the river Arve, deeper and deeper into the dream space until
                  we reach a vision of a poet at the center of a chasm—his “flashing eyes” and “floating
                  hair” suggest an otherworldly trance. He is caught up in the sublimity of ice caves,
                  geysers, incense, and ancient forests. The reader and dreamer alike are smothered
                  in sensual imagery, absorbed in the sexual arc of the narrative, until the poem reaches
                  a climactic threat of eruption. Here, the speaker halts the narrative action. Outside
                  of the narrative and its sensual excess, the speaker shifts his focus from the sublime
                  scene he was transcribing to a desire to build his own sunny domes in air. This is
                  canonically read as a desire to compose his own poetry. However, the speaker doesn’t
                  compose his own fantasy tale at this point, but rather speculates on the audience’s
                  reaction to his poetic process: “And all who heard should see them there, /And all
                  should cry, Beware! Beware!” (48–49). The repeated exclamation, “Beware! Beware!”
                  and the repetition of “And all” indicate the poet’s anxiety over how he will be received.
                  He will be misunderstood by all who encounter his poem. The audience will believe
                  he has lost control not only over his poem but also over himself. These repeated phrases,
                  just like the circles to be woven round him, contain the poet like a straight-jacket,
                  wrapping him up for the safety of himself and his readers. This is the danger inherent
                  in being immersed in aesthetic experience: losing control in an automaticity of emotions
                  (flashing eyes) and body (floating hair). </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As a way of containing the space for immersive reading, Coleridge imposes multiple
                     circles of context for the poem’s composition. These circles spread outward from the
                     visionary poet of the narrative to form multiple levels of authorship. Closest to
                     the vision, of course, is the speaker of the poem, presumably the sleeping Coleridge,
                     though his identity is only established in the prefatory note. In fact, the speaker
                     is only given a first-person pronoun at the end of the fragment when he steps outside
                     of the narrative motion and action to reflect: “A damsel with a dulcimer / In a vision
                     once I saw” (37–38). The sudden appearance of a first-person speaker calls attention
                     to the poem as a material object, constructed by an author, and the invisible cognitive
                     processes involved in this act of reading are brought to the surface of the text for
                     inspection. The reader is confronted with her own act of reading and the fact of her
                     subconscious immersion in the poem’s atmosphere up to this point. Absorbed in the
                     sensual immediacy and the movement of the poem, the reader does not realize the poem
                     is composed in tranquility, as a recollection. The poem seems to have been composed
                     organically, in real time, as the reader (and speaker of the poem) travels along the
                     Arve. However, outside of the text itself, we see that the woken poet Coleridge writes
                     from a future time of reflection upon his interrupted dream state. He attempts (but
                     fails) to recall the complete poem that was composed in full during his dream. The
                     poem is a constructed space, and its multiple layers of authorship further complicate
                     its history. In a prefatory note titled “Of the Fragment of Kubla Khan,” Coleridge
                     attributes his subject matter to falling asleep while reading about Kubla Khan’s palace
                     and gardens in “Purchas’s Pilgrimage,” thus adding another layer of authorship to
                     this synthetic dream production. Finally, outside of the author and his source tale,
                     we get a second poet called upon to validate the worth of this fragment. Lord Byron,
                     “a poet of great and deserved celebrity,” and his publisher John Murray are named
                     as patrons of “Kubla Khan.”

                              of Lord Byron. Coleridge had recited the poem one morning while visiting Byron in

               </div>
               <p>Coleridge’s imposition of these multiple layers of authorship attempts to control
                  the reception of his poem, to ensure the narrative gets understood in a particular
                  way that protects the poet and his unconventional model of composition from scrutiny.
                  He showcases a model that counters the imperatives to rationality and composure characteristic
                  of post-Enlightenment culture. The abandon modeled in Coleridge’s dream vision goes
                  against the reigning model of poetry, exemplified by Wordsworth. The levels of authority
                  that encircle the poet figure in “Kubla Khan” depict a poet actively engaging a literary
                  tradition through reading Purchas and associating with Byron. In this way, Coleridge
                  offloads responsibility for the poem to his environment and his friends. However,
                  these protective layers do more than preempt critique. The layers of context impose
                  boundaries for the reading experience: they establish a socially (and professionally)
                  acceptable environment where sensation can enjoy a free play of sorts. The poet is
                  entranced for the composition of the poem, and thus without the direction of his conscious
                  mind. He is a reader, engaging in the same sort of absorption in a text as his own
                  readers do. He, too, finds himself immersed in seductive tales that take him out of
                  reality. Though he criticizes passive reading in<em>The Friend</em> and elsewhere, here Coleridge embraces the affective and cognitive openness that
                  is characteristic of reading a sensual and sensational text. In Coleridge’s model,
                  the poet’s body takes precedence over the mind. However, Coleridge imposes a balance
                  between sensation and sensibility by creating a space for the free movement of affect
                  within the poem or dream and by calling attention to this constructed space of immersive
                  reading. By halting the forward movement of the poem and imposing structures to contextualize
                  the composition of “Kubla Khan” as a history of reading, Coleridge ensures that his
                  audience recognizes the cognitive mechanisms at work. By creating this revelatory
                  moment for his reader, Coleridge anticipates Zunshine’s take on ToM, as the pleasure
                  of mind-reading is being able to see yourself perform the task. Coleridge’s poem facilitates
                  sensual absorption for its readers, rather than disallowing a phenomenological experience
                  of the fiction as Wordsworth’s egotistical sublime does. In fact, the prefatory note
                  to “Kubla Khan” mourns the failure of the poet to transcribe the poem in full. He
                  regrets the interruption of his literary space by a nonliterary reality, but, in replicating
                  this interruption for his readers, Coleridge forces them to evaluate the way their
                  bodies and minds have been at work and learn from it, as he shows he has done himself.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In <em>Isabella; or the Pot of Basil</em>, Keats positions himself as a self-conscious translator of Boccaccio, becoming the
                     vehicle for another’s transformative aesthetic experience. Keats’s careful attention
                     to this task peeks through the text as he digresses from the narrative to offer apologies
                     for the liberties he takes with his source tale. Begging the forgiveness of Boccaccio
                     and lamenting the disappearance of the Old Romance tradition Boccaccio comes to represent,
                     these interruptions of the tale have often been described as evidence of his youth
                     and immaturity as a poet.

                              the poet deemed his attempt a failure, and how historically critics have agreed with
                              Keats’s own assessment. Along these lines, see also Ridley 56. Nigel Wood (reads Keats
                              as a “most self-conscious narrative poet;” however, he calls Isabella’s romance narrative
                              apparatus “unsavory by design,” ultimately defending the seeming immaturity as a “calculated
                              narrative tactic” (90). Susan Wolfson argues that scholars should consider digressions
                              more seriously, that “these suspensions of story-telling are not display…</span></div>
                     </div> Rather, these authorial interludes have a deliberate function, serving to position
                     Keats himself as a reader alongside the readers of genres like Romance and the Gothic, <span class="foreign">en masse</span>. Keats’s many interruptions call attention to genre conventions of the grotesque
                     and indecorous by stepping outside of the text at the moments where sensation verges
                     on the sensational. Keats transports the reader out of the text when the narrative
                     becomes most gripping and unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that allow for
                     absorption in the narrative. Ostensibly censoring the text, Keats adopts a seemingly
                     Wordsworthian mode with his interruptions. He stops the forward movement of the narrative
                     and extricates the reader from their absorption in the text, transporting him or her
                     back to the present moment and encouraging a more reflective reading experience. Arguably,
                     Keats regulates the circulation of affect by reasserting the boundary between the
                     literary and nonliterary. The interruptions ensure the reader acknowledges the text
                     is fictional and confined to the space of the page. Like the frames of “Kubla Khan,”
                     the structural abnormalities of this rendering of Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em> (c. 1353) show the poet as a reader himself and give the tale a specific history as
                     a reincarnation. They point to a larger literary tradition of Old Romance that precedes
                     and transcends the historical specificity of Boccaccio.

                              Jack Stillinger reads the digressions as Keats’s attempt to modernize the genre of
                              Old Romance with the addition of realism, noting the tension within the poem between
                              Keats’s translation and the original tale. Objecting to the way Stillinger reads the
                              text as “divided against itself,” Susan Wolfson proposes an interpretation that “sees
                              Keats taking advantage of his ambivalence [to the values of ‘old Romance’] to devise

               <p> Keats asks forgiveness of Boccaccio and mourns the passing away of Boccaccio’s Italy,
                  the edenic surroundings that first inspired and then listened dutifully to his song.
                  Flattering the author in a move that reads like the epic convention of invoking his
                  muse, Keats declares he is not making the original tale <em>“more sweet,”</em> but rather honoring and preserving the writer and his legacy. Indeed, he wishes to
                  “greet” the “gone spirit” through his own song, thus imagining a social introduction
                  to the author. Yet, he fears he has overstepped the social and literary decorum required
                  of his task. By setting up this pastoral context for the source tale, Keats implies
                  the unnaturalness of his sensational additions to the original. The Gothic “glooms”
                  portrayed in Keats’s version of the tale are far from “quiet,” and being so are seemingly
                  ill-suited for a representation of Boccaccio’s theme.</p>
               <p>Despite acknowledging his failed decorum, Keats makes significant changes to the source
                  tale in order to adapt it for his own context. These adaptations, in turn, call attention
                  to the social nature of cognition and the inherent co-creation of the narrative as
                  the reader’s own minds translates the text to create meaning. If we look back to the
                  main clause of the stanza, we see the poet uses the plural pronoun “we” instead of
                  taking sole responsibility for any wrongs committed. Like the first-person “I” used
                  by Coleridge to halt forward movement down the River Arve, Keats’s “we” presents an
                  immediacy that transports the reader outside of the narrative flow and into a reflective
                  position alongside the poet. No longer is the reader feeling the sensual excess of
                  former passages when the lovers pine over each other to the point of physical sickness
                  or when the lovers meet under the perfume and musk of the hyacinth bower. Together,
                  reader and poet are thinking about the poem as a written text with a history of composition.
                  “We” are aware of the sensual excesses already experienced (those for which the text
                  is currently apologizing), and we may even be prepared to spot further co-opting of
                  our senses and bodies in future passages. A sense of shared responsibility is important
                  as we come to understand the power of reading in shaping the intellectual and moral
                  life of a populace. Keats’s revisions introduce some of the most atrocious historical
                  misdeeds that have made Boccaccio’s song, and all it represents of the idyllic in
                  nature and culture, something long forgotten in nineteenth-century England. From the
                  “we,” the reader begins to see their own responsibility alongside that of the author.
                  Indeed, an author’s responsibility to his or her readership extends beyond the development
                  of an individual reader’s sensibilities as the individual reader can now recognize
                  the atrocities of their contemporary moment and act in response.</p>

                     figures synecdochically in the poem: the employees are represented as little more
                     than hands, ears, eyes, and loins. As their employers perceive them, the workers’
                     body parts make up the industrial machine. The famous “Why were they proud?” interjection
                     (Stanza XVI) follows this series of modern tortures and introduces a nineteenth-century
                     critique of the socio-economic system these brothers represent. Keats continues his
                     list of the brother’s wrongs, punctuating it with the repeated question, “Why were
                     they proud?” There is no answer from Boccaccio, nor is there any anticipated answer
                     from his modern reader. The atrocities multiply and the momentum builds, but Keats
                     breaks the stanza’s rhythm with another grasp at communal identity. He cries, “and
                     again <em>we</em> ask aloud, / Why in the name of Glory were they proud?” (128, my emphasis). This interjection
                     performs two critical tasks. Like the apologetic digression, this passage, and Keats’s
                     use of the plural pronoun in particular, suggests that the author and reader together
                     object to the liberties taken with the source tale. Traveling the narrative together
                     and then stepping outside of the fiction to examine it at work, the author and reader
                     critique the way emotion has gotten the better of them. Their decorum has devolved
                     into disgust and outrage. The second and more important task this interjection performs
                     is to show that the author and reader alike object to the abuse of a corrupt socio-economic
                     system. Though “we” are responsible for the loss of Boccaccio’s pastoral paradise,
                     “we” are equally able to recognize the horrors of our modern moment.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Keats has inserted a bold critique of the modern setting that informs his own tale,
                  and returning to the apologetic stanzas XIX and XX, we must note the self-consciousness
                  of “succeed the verse or fail,” in light of this audacious revision. Conspicuously
                  set off from the main clause with dashes and located in the middle of Stanza XX, this
                  aside is reminiscent of Coleridge’s self-conscious speaker, who anticipates his own
                  reception at the end of “Kubla Khan.” But Keats’s audience is as multi-faceted as
                  his layers of authorship. The address to Boccaccio contextualizes his anxiety as a
                  fear of failing the master or muse; however, “succeed . . . or fail” implies the pressure
                  of Keats’s contemporary literary market as well. This poem is widely held to be inspired
                  by Hazlitt’s lecture on 3 February 1818, in which he declared that a rewriting of
                  <em>The Decameron</em> “could not fail to succeed in the present day” (Hazlitt qtd. in Heinzelman 168).
                  Moreover, Keats hails this poem as his “new Romance,” following from <em>Endymion</em> 1818), which he hastily shrugs off as a “feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished.”
                  Penned the month before he began <em>Isabella</em>, the “Preface” to <em>Endymion</em>characterizes the epic as a “failure.” Thus, Keats’s digression here in <em>Isabella</em> registers fear that resurrecting the past for the present literary market will fail
                  as he believes his most recent publication to have done. He fears for its success
                  in the modern market because the grotesque and titillating are what sell. Popular
                  texts sell because of their ability to provide mindless entertainment. As noted above,
                  texts like gothic novels and sensational romances encourage a passive reading posture
                  without interrupting it to improve the condition of the modern mind or the modern
                  society more generally. In navigating the practical need for success in the modern
                  literary market, Keats plays at a balancing act where he must at once titillate and
                  educate. He must weigh the moments where the slippage between fiction and reality
                  is productive, as when it teaches us to recognize corruption and abuse of power, against
                  the moments when the slippage makes the passive reader vulnerable to that corruption
                  and abuse. This seems a crucial threshold to the reading (and writing) experience
                  being created in <em>Isabella</em>.</p>

                  <p>Lorenzo’s ghost serves as the most halting interruption of Keats’s poem. Like the
                     poetic digressions themselves, Lorenzo’s ghost disrupts and unweaves the fiction Isabella’s
                     brothers perpetuate, calling attention to the mechanisms underneath their lies. When
                     Lorenzo’s ghost visits Isabella, he is described in terms similar to Coleridge’s Mariner.
                     His bright eyes and strange voice captivate. Like the poet from “Kubla Khan,” Coleridge’s
                     Ancient Mariner is a vehicle for a prophetic message. Doomed to wander the margins
                     of society alone, he is distanced from humanity and forced to propagate his tale.
                     He is entranced and entrancing. The Mariner circulates his narrative by holding his
                     audience with a hypnotic eye, compelling the audience to listen until the tale is
                     complete.

                              is a wedding guest who is wrenched out of his own narrative trajectory, walking to
                              the chapel.</span></div>
                     </div> Lorenzo’s eyes, too, are “wild,” and he is “upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling”
                     (<em>Isabella</em> 289, 306). He “chant[s] alone the holy mass,” cut off from community but obeying a
                     higher power’s demands to pay heed to truth. And like the Ancient Mariner, Lorenzo’s
                     act of storytelling leaves his auditor “a sadder and a wiser” person for having heard
                     the tale (<em>Rime</em> 625). Describing the ghost’s strange voice, Keats writes it was like a “palsied Druid’s
                     harp unstrung,” and his tale “did unthread the horrid woof / Of the late darken’d
                     time” (<em>Isabella</em> 286, 292–93). The negating prefix in each of these lines suggests the work Lorenzo’s
                     tale performs: it repeals the magic of Old Romance and uncovers a disturbing reality.</p>
               </div>
               <p>As in Coleridge’s <em>Rime</em>, what is most compelling in the scene with Lorenzo’s ghost is not the message itself,
                  but rather the pattern of transference, how the tale moves between the bodies engaged
                  in its telling and its transformative effect after the moment of its telling. Most
                  interesting is the way both the Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost interrupt and disrupt.
                  In <em>Isabella</em> and <em>Rime</em>, the integrity of the tale itself doesn’t seem to be fragile; rather, the moment
                  of its transference is endangered. If we look again to Coleridge’s bibliographic layers,
                  he seems almost as anxious as Wordsworth, with his controlling authorial hand in the
                  egotistical sublime, to ensure the tale itself be received in a certain way. Coleridge’s
                  marginal glosses added to the poem in 1817 seek to direct the interpretation of his
                  poem and add a moral and philosophical explanation for the otherworldly, mythological
                  events of the Mariner’s tale. Yet, these marginal glosses occur outside of the act
                  of storytelling within the poem. These glosses are not aides for the wedding guest’s
                  lesson, but rather for a modern audience’s understanding of the tale itself (as it
                  has been translated by the speaker who witnesses its transmission in one particular
                  instance), the moral imperative to circulate the tale, and its circulation within
                  the text. The glosses and the reception anxiety they imply, then, suggest that the
                  tale’s meaning is very much constructed in the moment of transfer from writer to reader.
                  Success and failure are not determined by the soundness of the text itself or even
                  the poet’s maturity and talent. Rather, they are measurements of the co-creation that
                  happens in acts of reading, when the reader’s brain meets the words on the pages and
                  writer and reader work together in the space of the text (and even beyond) to create
                  meaning. Indeed, the anxiety represented in “Kubla Khan” and <em>Rime</em> studied together suggests that the very composition of the poem actually takes place
                  at its moment of translation from the written word through the reader’s neural processing
                  as a cerebral tidal bore (Dehaene 114). When the poet is distracted from the transcription
                  of his vision, the composition fails, and its communication will always be incomplete.
                  If we can say that composition fails here, then for <em>Rime</em>, a poem in which the anxiety is ostensibly located after the point of composition
                  in the moment of the tale’s circulation, we might conclude that the tale is complete
                  from the very beginning, that it comes to the poet and the reader and the text at
                  the same moment—that it pre-exists what would traditionally be called its composition,
                  the moment pen hits the page.</p>
               <p>Like the stories circulated by the Ancient Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost, the act of
                  reading, for Keats, stages an uncanny re-emergence of thoughts repressed, hidden,
                  and seemingly lost. Keats writes in an 1818 letter to his publisher John Taylor, “Poetry
                  should surprise by a fine excess and not by Singularity—it should strike the Reader
                  as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a Remembrance” (<em>Letters</em> I. 238). Poetry should seem an extension or an uncovering of the reader’s own thoughts.
                  This formula imagines poetry as a form of simulation rather than an actual transmission
                  of the author’s thoughts in the reader’s own mind. Reading, therefore, acts as an
                  elusive sleight of hand working in such a way that the text seems at once to convey
                  both the writer’s and reader’s thoughts. This letter also positions reading as an
                  experience of recovery of high thoughts forgotten. The thoughts are like the reader’s,
                  though they seem to have been lost in the cobwebbed corners of the mind. With this
                  brief formula in mind, reading for Keats seems necessarily a gothic experience, an
                  uncanny re-emergence of thoughts always already in existence. They are at once of
                  the reader and not of the reader, unfamiliar but coming upon Isabella and the wedding
                  guest in a surprising excess of strange familiarity. These thoughts disrupt both the
                  narrative and the everyday life of the characters. They prevent the wedding guest
                  from attending the ceremony. They teach their readers or listeners a nightmarish truth.
                  They call attention to the cognitive mechanisms under which the reader has been operating,
                  the state of sleepwalking in which the reader has existed and can no longer exist.
                  To see how this plays out in Keats’s Gothic Romance, let us turn to the most sensational
                  moment in the poem.</p>
               <p>Laboring for three hours with a nurse by her side, Isabella appears to be a woman
                  giving birth, a point that would not have been lost on Keats, the trained physician.
                  Moreover, Isabella carefully tends the basil plant as though it is her child. Having
                  exhumed his body, she decapitates Lorenzo. She carries his head home, combs its hair,
                  straightens its eyelashes, and wraps it in a perfumed silk scarf, all the while kissing
                  it and crying over it. Finally, Isabella entombs the head in a garden pot and plants
                  basil over top of it. All day and night, she tends the plant with a “continual shower”
                  of tears “from her dead eyes” (452-53). Isabella’s tears fertilize Lorenzo’s head,
                  and, from this, the two lovers (re)produce a lush plant. While understanding this
                  as a symbolic childbirth is compelling and valuable, Isabella’s exhumation of Lorenzo’s
                  body can also be understood as an act of reading and writing. Isabella fills the old
                  skull and dead bones with life to resurrect their old romance. Keats interrupts her
                  labor at the grave with a rhetorical question for all readers of Romance: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">

               </blockquote>
               <p> Reading Gothic Romance (or even reading tombstones in an actual churchyard) is here
                  figured as resurrection from the grave. A reader revitalizes the corpse with his imagination.
                  Sending forth his spirit to dig through clayey soil and gravel hard, the reader immerses
                  himself in the material sublime of the grave. He uncovers the emptied body of a text
                  to fill it again with imagined life. He joins the negative with capability, marries
                  sensation and memory.</p>
               <p>As she cries over the pot, the basil thrives. Her emotional response to Lorenzo’s
                  murder is all-consuming and self-destructive. Indeed, crying over the relic of her
                  dead lover is the most sentimental and overwrought image in the entire poem. She is
                  so overwhelmed with her sentiment that she becomes insensible to her surroundings.
                  Keats records how Isabella “forgot the stars, the moon, and sun, / And she forgot
                  the dells where waters run, / And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze” (417–19). She
                  has no awareness of life outside of her replacement romance. She is out of sync with
                  nature, having “no knowledge when the day was done,” and not knowing when the new
                  day began (421). Having lost herself in a flood of emotion, Isabella is vulnerable
                  to the outside disruption. But, why does the plant, which represents a co-creation
                  of meaning like poetry itself, flourish in the midst of her excess sentimentality?
                  Can we critique this scene’s mawkishness given that the plant thrives? Or to bring
                  this line of inquiry back to ToM and seeing our cognition laid bare, is absorption
                  in the affective excess actually dangerous if the immersive reading allows for growth?
                  </p>
               <p>Perhaps the most famous of Keats’s interjections occurs at Lorenzo’s graveside. Keats
                  halts the narrative during the disentombment to justify his obsessive attention to
                  the grotesque scene. He exclaims, “Ah! wherefore all this wormy circumstance? / Why
                  linger at the yawning tomb so long? / O for the gentleness of old Romance, / The simple
                  plaining of a minstrel’s song!” (385–88). Once again, this digression anticipates
                  his audience’s objection to overt sensationalism. Importantly, the audience he anticipates
                  here must be a literary one, for a reader of modern romance would not likely question
                  these common conventions of popular gothic narratives. Yet this digression serves
                  a dual purpose in calling attention to the sensationalism for the common reader’s
                  benefit and justifying his choices to a skeptical literary peer. With his predictable
                  nostalgia, Keats waxes upon the traditional form of Old Romance that modern society
                  has ravaged. But a closer examination shows that this passage goes beyond mere lament.
                  Old Romance is the simple plaining of a minstrel’s song. The word “simple” here echoes
                  the “simple misery” that was Isabella’s lovesickness before learning of Lorenzo’s
                  murder (<em>Isabella</em> 330). The pleasure of Old Romance is like a passive reading experience in which the
                  reader is absorbed, lost in the automaticity of the affect. Keats criticizes those
                  simple reading experiences that engage sensory immersion without the interruption,
                  without halting the forward movement of narrative to show the mechanisms at work underneath
                  the fiction. If then simple misery is all sensation and sentiment without sensibility,
                  Keats’s digressions offer the necessary space for sensibility to return.</p>
               <p>Awaking the morning after her vision, Isabella gives her only speech in the entire
                  poem:   </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">“Ha! ha!” said she, “I knew not this hard life,</div>
                     <div class="l">I thought the worst was simple misery;</div>
                     <div class="l">I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife</div>
                     <div class="l">Portioned us—happy days, or else to die;</div>
                     <div class="l">But there is crime—a brother’s bloody knife!<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                     <div class="l">Sweet Spirit, thou hast schooled my infancy.” (Keats 329–34)</div>
                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> Here, Lorenzo’s ghost has called Isabella out of her absorption in their romance
                  to educate her in the reality of the world’s corruption. Until now, she naively believed
                  “misery”—the term used for their lovesickness earlier in the poem—to be the worst
                  experience in life, but, learning of Lorenzo’s murder, she understands there is crime,
                  betrayal, and, worse yet, having to live on after waking to this knowledge. “New romance,”
                  then, takes on a particular meaning; more than just a fresh start for Keats after
                  <em>Endymion</em>, it is reinventing the way tales are told and read. The richness of new romance,
                  narrative synthesized with reality, engenders a reading experience that moves us beyond
                  the immaturity of Old Romance to arrive at a state of awareness that can inspire action
                  and change (Keats, <em>Isabella</em> 391).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
               <p>Despite their maligned reputation in the cultural debates of the Romantic era, passive
                  reading postures require complex cognitive and affective work. In a matter of a few
                  hundred milliseconds, the human brain translates the written word into bodily meaning,
                  producing a physiological intimacy between bodies involved in acts reading. Through
                  a material sublime of instantaneous cognitive translation, narrative is brought to
                  affective life and the text is co-created by poet and reader. Both Coleridge and Keats
                  utilized the automaticity inherent in reading popular genres like the Gothic and Romance,
                  as they immerse themselves and their readers in a flood of sensation. And yet, interruptions
                  to the narrative flow complicate moments of composition and reading, ultimately highlighting
                  the complex cognitive and affective work of passive reading. By structurally regulating
                  the sensory experience, controlling the affective overflow, and calling attention
                  to the cognitive and cultural processes at work underneath the fiction, these authors
                  ensure we will not be caught in a dream world for long without awaking more enlightened.

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">Many early eighteenth-century medical texts sought to prove the immateriality of the
               soul. For instance, Thomas Branch’s <em>Thoughts on Dreaming </em>(1738) explores dreaming as proof that the soul exists as a “separate state” from
               the body (2). Likewise, Walter Charlton’s <em>A Natural History of the Passions </em>(1701) distinguishes between the Rational and the Sensitive souls, both of which can
               influence the body, though “made of substance purely spiritual” (8). However, Andrew
               Fyfe writes <em>A System of Anatomy and Physiology</em> in 1795 in which he compiles medical research and claims that the soul must be in
               the head alone, not descending into the spinal marrow (67-68).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Dehaene explains that the brain has no specific hardware solely evolved to reading,
               but rather the human brain’s neural architecture recycles existing pathways in order
               to create the meaning of words on the page (7).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Similarly, Richardson identifies a phenomenon in the Romantic era that he calls the
               “neural sublime.” In moments of disruption, the subject is “not marveling at the power
               of Reason [as with the Kantian sublime] but rather stunned by the capacity and complexity
               of the human brain” (Richardson 29). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Richard Holmes explains that “Kubla Khan,” though written in 1797, was not published
               until 1816, when it appeared alongside <em>Christabel</em> and <em>The Pains of Sleep</em>, at the behest of Lord Byron. Coleridge had recited the poem one morning while visiting
               Byron in Piccadilly (426).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Kurt Heinzelman explains Keats’s sustained attempt at translation with Isabella, that
               the poet deemed his attempt a failure, and how historically critics have agreed with
               Keats’s own assessment. Along these lines, see also Ridley 56. Nigel Wood (reads Keats
               as a “most self-conscious narrative poet;” however, he calls Isabella’s romance narrative
               apparatus “unsavory by design,” ultimately defending the seeming immaturity as a “calculated
               narrative tactic” (90). Susan Wolfson argues that scholars should consider digressions
               more seriously, that “these suspensions of story-telling are not displays of humorous
               narrative incompetence” (249). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In his seminal study of the poem, “Keats and Romance: The ‘Reality’ of <em>Isabella</em>,” Jack Stillinger reads the digressions as Keats’s attempt to modernize the genre
               of Old Romance with the addition of realism, noting the tension within the poem between
               Keats’s translation and the original tale. Objecting to the way Stillinger reads the
               text as “divided against itself,” Susan Wolfson proposes an interpretation that “sees
               Keats taking advantage of his ambivalence [to the values of ‘old Romance’] to devise
               a genre of tale-telling whose designs are both narrative and deconstructive” (“Keats’s
               ‘Isabella’ and the 'Digressions' of 'Romance'"). For Wolfson, creating an immersive
               reading experience and interrogating the structure of that experience are not necessarily
               competing objectives within the poem. She writes, “Keats is concerned . . . to reform
               the way we read romance, even as he entertains us with a romance of sorts” (251).
               My own interpretation can reconcile Stillinger and Wolfson, as I see the realism in
               Keats’s revisions working to disrupt the reader’s experience of the sensational narrative.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
