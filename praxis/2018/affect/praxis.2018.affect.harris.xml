                <p rend="noCount"> This essay examines the cognitive underpinnings of affect
                    circulation in the poetry of Coleridge and Keats, poets who sought to shape the
                    reading experiences of their contemporary and future audiences. Both poets
                    utilized the automaticity inherent in reading popular genres like the Gothic and
                    Romance, as they immerse their readers in a flood of sensation. Yet,
                    interruptions to the narrative flow complicate moments of composition and
                    reading, ultimately highlighting a complex cognitive and affective work
                    happening through passive reading. While such sensational forms of reading were
                    often disparaged during the Romantic period, modern cognitive psychology shows
                    these “passive” or “immersive” forms are actually complex in their affective
                    work. By structurally regulating the sensory experience, controlling the
                    affective overflow, and calling attention to the cognitive and cultural
                    processes at work underneath the fiction, these authors ensure we will not be
                    caught in a dream world for long without awaking more enlightened. </p>

                    <p>Medical science and literature converged in eighteenth-century and early
                        nineteenth-century debates over embodied reading experiences. For
                        Romantic-era thinkers, reading was not simply an intellectual pursuit but a
                        bodily exercise, and this belief has conflicting implications. The
                        physiological element of reading facilitates an intimate connection between
                        the bodies involved in acts of reading—those of the author, reader, and
                        text. These newly understood levels of intimacy open possibilities for the
                        transformative work of literature; however, the danger of such physiological
                        connection is the ease with which a reader’s body and mind can be
                        influenced. Immersive reading—getting lost in the affective throes of
                        narrative—seems to include a loss of the thinking, reasoning self. Immersive
                        reading perhaps even leaves the reader at the mercy of the text. </p>
                    <p>In the Romantic era, the mind itself becomes increasingly embodied, located
                        at the site of the brain instead of existing as an immaterial entity.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Many early eighteenth-century medical texts sought to
                            prove the immateriality of the soul. For instance, Thomas Branch’s
                                <title level="m">Thoughts on Dreaming </title>(1738) explores
                            dreaming as proof that the soul exists as a “separate state” from the
                            body (2). Likewise, Walter Charlton’s <title level="m">A Natural History
                                of the Passions </title>(1701) distinguishes between the Rational
                            and the Sensitive souls, both of which can influence the body, though
                            “made of substance purely spiritual” (8). However, Andrew Fyfe writes
                                <title level="m">A System of Anatomy and Physiology</title> in 1795
                            in which he compiles medical research and claims that the soul must be
                            in the head alone, not descending into the spinal marrow (67-68).
                        </note> Alan Richardson traces this line of thinking through theorists and
                        scientists like Edmund Burke and Joseph Priestley to poets like Percy Bysshe
                        Shelley and John Keats, demonstrating their belief that the mind is an organ
                        subject to growth and expansion. In the same way one would build up a muscle
                        through strategic use, the brain can be enlarged through a sort of “mental
                        calisthenics” (Richardson 28). As Priestley explains in his 1777 lecture on
                        the sublime, the mental organ dilates to “conceive a great object” (119).
                        Romantic poets take up the responsibility for the growth of the reader’s
                        mind, debating upon and experimenting with ways to engage their audience in
                        effective mental exercises. Romantic-era poets such as William Wordsworth
                        and Samuel Taylor Coleridge rated the novel as senseless entertainment meant
                        for mindless consumption by a public whose sensibilities were dull and
                        unrefined. In Book II of <title level="m">The Friend</title> (1809),
                        Coleridge writes: “The habit of receiving pleasure without any exertion of
                        thought, by the mere excitement of curiosity and sensibility, may be justly
                        ranked among the worst effects of habitual novel reading” (2:151). Coleridge
                        goes on to say that absorption in the plot and sensory experience of the
                        tale—taking pleasure from “mere excitement of curiosity and
                        sensibility”—“dwarf[s]” cognitive capacity (2:151). According to Coleridge,
                        passive reading (absorption without intellectual and imaginative
                        contribution) inhibits the development of a reader’s brain. Here we see that
                        passive or immersive reading fails to properly engage the brain in exercise.
                        Instead of enlarging the organ, improper reading practices lead to brain
                        atrophy. Wordsworth and Coleridge believed an epidemic of novel readers
                        meant sensational stories sold best because these tales are what can excite
                        the dulled sensibilities of dwarfed brains. How could literature perform
                        transformative work on the psyche of a reader who was unable to sense and
                        feel, to engage the affect of a text? </p>
                    <p>While such popular genres were often disparaged, recent cognitive psychology
                        shows these forms that encourage passive or immersive reading are actually
                        complex in their affective work. A cognitive mechanism for “reading” social
                        situations enables the passivity that Romantic writers feared. The immersed
                        attitude of a passive reader can be attributed to the cognitive architecture
                        humans evolved to navigate social environments. In Theory of Mind theory
                        (ToM), cognitive psychologists point to ways we read people through their
                        actions and behaviors, attributing emotion, motivation, and beliefs to them
                        automatically. This seems obvious, but, in fact, connecting outward signs to
                        inward states is an evolved skill. In <title level="m">Why We Read
                            Fiction</title> (2006), Lisa Zunshine writes that when we engage fiction
                        using ToM, we do so in the same way we engage and contextualize social
                        situations in the real world. As we read the actions and the dialogue of
                        fictional characters, we ascribe complicated internal systems of memory,
                        emotion, and motivation them. She explains: <quote>[T]he cognitive
                            mechanisms that evolved to process information about thoughts and
                            feelings of human beings are constantly on the alert, checking out their
                            environment for cues that fit their input conditions. On some level,
                            then, works of fiction manage to “cheat” these mechanisms into
                            “believing” that they are in the presence of material that they were
                            “designed” to process, that is, that they are in the presence of agents
                            endowed with a potential for a rich array of intentional stances.
                            (10)</quote> The ToM employed as we read a narrative works because our
                        minds are cheated into the same kind of cognitive processing of fiction as
                        they perform of social reality, a form of “neural recycling” explained by
                        neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene (7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Dehaene explains
                            that the brain has no specific hardware solely evolved to reading, but
                            rather the human brain’s neural architecture recycles existing pathways
                            in order to create the meaning of words on the page (7).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>To expand our understanding of the cognitive architecture at work as a reader
                        employs ToM, let us consider recent revelations in cognitive linguistics.
                        Key to the cognitive process of reading is the recruitment of the motor and
                        sensory regions of the brain to make sense of and even replicate the affect
                        in language. Noting recent experiments by Pulvermuller and his colleagues,
                        Dehaene explains:
                    <quote>Some verbs such as “bite” or “kiss” evoked mouth movements, others hand
                        actions (“write,” “throw”), and yet others actions performed by legs and
                        feet (“kick,” “walk”). A remarkable fragmentation of meaning was observed:
                        each of the verb types activated a distinct sector of the premotor cortex,
                        at the location represented in the “motor homunculus,” or map of our body.
                        Thus word meaning seems to be literally embodied in our brain networks. A
                        string of letters only makes sense if it evokes, in a few hundred
                        milliseconds, myriad features dispersed in the sensory, motor, and abstract
                        brain maps for location, number, intention. (113)</quote>
                    The ease with which humans comprehend the written word (comprehension takes
                        only a few hundred milliseconds) and how comprehension relies upon a
                        translation through the body is truly striking, and Dehaene uses the analogy
                        of a tidal bore to describe the rush of processing systems that engage in
                        translating word on the pages into meaning (114). </p>
                    <p>These findings seem to offer an anatomical basis for the fears held by
                        eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century writers for the passive novel
                        reader’s vulnerability should he be caught up in a dream world. Feeling the
                        text on his body, a passive reader could easily forget the distinctions
                        between fiction and reality. Given the effortlessness in translation of the
                        literary to nonliterary signification, we know the reverse is equally
                        probable: we mentally process actual events as if they were analogous to the
                        virtual comings and goings of imagined characters. Indeed, this possibility
                        inspires the anxiety surrounding literature’s influence on an unthinking
                        readership. Zunshine elaborates this point: <quote>It seems to me that our
                            unease on this occasion stems from our intuitive realization that on
                            some level our evolved cognitive architecture indeed does not fully
                            distinguish between real and fictional people. Faced with Elizabeth
                            Bennet and Mr. Darcy, our Theory of Mind jumps at the opportunity (so to
                            speak) to speculate about their past, present, and future states of
                            mind, even as we realize that these “airy forms [and] phantoms of
                            imagination” do not deserve such treatment. (18–19)</quote> If we are
                        passive readers of fiction (especially irresponsibly written novels that
                        present overwrought sentiment or sensational events), we allow the phantoms
                        of imagination to infiltrate our everyday interactions. We see from Jane
                        Austen’s <title level="m">Northanger Abbey</title> (1817), as it parodies
                        the genre and its readers, how this is the perceived danger of reading too
                        many Gothic novels.  </p>
                    <p>Though historically we have ascribed a failure to distinguish between fiction
                        and reality to the lost control over one’s rational mind, the most recent
                        findings of cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology find that the
                        mind has evolved in ways that make the mental confluence of fiction and
                        reality healthful. Zunshine examines how readers become aware of their
                        cognitive processing in the reading experience. She concludes that the
                        pleasure derived from reading fiction is satisfaction in recognizing our
                        cognitive mastery of the material, our ability to operate ToM. Fiction is a
                        space where we can experience an automatic (though advanced) activity of the
                        mind, but the pleasure derived is from seeing ourselves being immersed,
                        being automatic.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Similarly, Richardson identifies a
                            phenomenon in the Romantic era that he calls the “neural sublime.” In
                            moments of disruption, the subject is “not marveling at the power of
                            Reason [as with the Kantian sublime] but rather stunned by the capacity
                            and complexity of the human brain” (Richardson 29). </note> Through
                        narrative, our minds are allowed to both work and see themselves work. In
                        this we are stunned and even made uncomfortable by how much of our cognition
                        is inaccessible. Perhaps the inaccessibility is due to the automaticity with
                        which our brains process information on the page or in our social worlds. As
                        readers we hold two contrasting states of mind: we are performing a
                        cognitive task automatically, and we are aware of that automaticity though
                        we cannot fully untangle the neuronal pathways. We are not, then, entirely
                        passive readers: we are aware of our own “passivity” on some level. </p>
                    <p>In what follows, I will show how immersive, affective reading experiences of
                        works by Coleridge and Keats facilitate the movement between the imagined
                        and the real. Absorption in the text happens so readily that the cognitive
                        work resembles the ease of social cognition in ToM. Yet, these Romantic
                        writers utilize structural abnormalities to disrupt the immersion and call
                        attention to the embodied cognitive process of immersive reading, thus
                        encouraging the growth of the reader’s mind. By placing themselves at a site
                        of cooperative reading with alongside their audience, Coleridge and Keats
                        reaffirm the intimate connection between the bodies involved in acts of
                        reading. </p>

                    <head>Immersive Reading and Material Sublimity</head>
                    <p>Eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century writers saw the slippage between
                        fiction and reality happening as reading habits changed with the
                        proliferation of popular fiction. In response, Wordsworth sought to teach
                        his readers how to maintain distance between the emotional and the rational.
                        If Wordsworth’s mode is, as Keats said, the “egotistical sublime,” a
                        defensive position that distances a reader from immediate sensation in order
                        to maintain the integrity of the thinking self, Keats’s “material sublime”
                        offers a counter-model to the Wordsworthian poet: the material sublime
                        embraces the overflow of powerful emotion in the moments of aesthetic
                        experience. The idea of the material sublime emerges in a poem to John
                        Hamilton Reynolds (“To J.H. Reynolds, Esq.”), written on 25 March 1818 in
                        the midst of <title level="m">Isabella</title>’s composition: <quote><lg>
                                <l>O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,</l>
                                <l>Would all their colours from the sunset take,</l>
                                <l>From something of material sublime,</l>
                                <l>Rather than shadow our own soul’s daytime</l>
                                <l>In the dark void of night. (Keats l. 67–71)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Notably, this exaltation longs to join a passive openness
                        to sensory input with the active play of the mind’s store. While the wish
                        for a dreaming state may appear initially passive, the forceful action
                        “take” stressed at the end of line 68 contrasts with the weaker feminine
                        meter of the opposing verb “shadow.” Dreaming, whether in sleep or in a
                        waking dream, is a joint act of sensual imprint and imaginative projection,
                        while shadowing is a flat, colorless reiteration of the self, the shadow of
                        “our own soul’s daytime.” And while a familiar daytime shadow may provide
                        comfort in “the dark void of night,” Keats’s ideal poet relishes
                        “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact
                        &amp; reason” (<title level="m">Letters</title> II. 213). For Keats, a poet
                        is capable of existing in negative space, the space of immersion and
                        passivity, and, for him, this space fosters growth. </p>
                    <p>Coleridge also advocates for sensory immersion, a radical openness to
                        material (and textual) excess. For example, in “Kubla Khan,” (1816) the muse
                        overtakes the poet while in an unconscious dream state. Here, Coleridge
                        imagines himself as the vehicle for a larger message, a truth that differs
                        in effect from Wordsworthian self-reflection in the egotistical sublime.
                        Where the egotistical sublime positions the poet prominently as the
                        interpreter and philosopher, always in control of the emotions and message
                        being transferred, the Coleridgean poet dissolves into an ether of affect
                        and impressions. The feelings and impressions cohere to form ideas. Rather
                        than emerging from a disembodied mind, the body of the poet cannot be
                        disentangled from the mind as together they translate meaning to the
                        audience. </p>
                    <p>This Coleridgean vision of the poet can be read as a model for Keats’s idea
                        of the material sublime, and I argue that Keats uses this Coleridgean poet
                        in his own Gothic Romance <title level="m">Isabella; or the Pot of
                            Basil</title> (1818). Coleridge establishes a poet figure both in the
                        narrative itself and in the bibliographic material that frames and
                        contextualizes the narrative. The poet of the narrative seems to have been
                        overtaken by the material excess of sensation, but, importantly, Coleridge’s
                        sensual excess in “Kubla Khan” results from the act of reading “Purchas’s
                        Pilgrimage.” Like an immersed reader of narrative, the poet has invited the
                        material and textual into his body and has consequently abdicated control to
                        the text. The literary and the nonliterary become confused for the entranced
                        poet/reader. Nevertheless, a sensually immersive poetic state is fraught
                        with difficulties. The poet is an imperfect medium for the dream vision
                        because of his existence in the modern world. At any moment, he may be woken
                        from his trance state into his conscious reality. With a knock at the door,
                        Coleridge is brought back to a self-consciousness where the
                            <foreign>cogito</foreign> resumes control over sensory experience and
                        the boundaries between self and outside, the literary and the nonliterary,
                        are reasserted. Yet, Coleridge’s waking is a narrative structure, designed
                        to both allow and disallow the analogous slippage between fiction and
                        reality. Immersive reading engages the reader in the affective ecology of
                        the text: the reader feels as if she is participating in the narrative,
                        experiencing the movement and the emotion through ToM. By reasserting the
                        authorial voice, in a seeming Wordsworthian move, Coleridge calls attention
                        to the cognitive processes and the narrative devices that have allowed for
                        the immersive experience in the first place. </p>
                    <p> “Kubla Khan” immerses its reader in a sublimity of movement and sensation,
                        until, like the poet himself, she awakes to remember that this is a
                        constructed experience. “Kubla Khan” seeks a balance between sensation and
                        sensibility by creating a safe space for the free movement of affect within
                        the poem or dream and then calling attention to this designed space of
                        immersive reading. The movement through Coleridge’s poem takes the reader
                        down the river Arve, deeper and deeper into the dream space until we reach a
                        vision of a poet at the center of a chasm—his “flashing eyes” and “floating
                        hair” suggest an otherworldly trance. He is caught up in the sublimity of
                        ice caves, geysers, incense, and ancient forests. The reader and dreamer
                        alike are smothered in sensual imagery, absorbed in the sexual arc of the
                        narrative, until the poem reaches a climactic threat of eruption. Here, the
                        speaker halts the narrative action. Outside of the narrative and its sensual
                        excess, the speaker shifts his focus from the sublime scene he was
                        transcribing to a desire to build his own sunny domes in air. This is
                        canonically read as a desire to compose his own poetry. However, the speaker
                        doesn’t compose his own fantasy tale at this point, but rather speculates on
                        the audience’s reaction to his poetic process: “And all who heard should see
                        them there, /And all should cry, Beware! Beware!” (48–49). The repeated
                        exclamation, “Beware! Beware!” and the repetition of “And all” indicate the
                        poet’s anxiety over how he will be received. He will be misunderstood by all
                        who encounter his poem. The audience will believe he has lost control not
                        only over his poem but also over himself. These repeated phrases, just like
                        the circles to be woven round him, contain the poet like a straight-jacket,
                        wrapping him up for the safety of himself and his readers. This is the
                        danger inherent in being immersed in aesthetic experience: losing control in
                        an automaticity of emotions (flashing eyes) and body (floating hair). </p>
                    <p>As a way of containing the space for immersive reading, Coleridge imposes
                        multiple circles of context for the poem’s composition. These circles spread
                        outward from the visionary poet of the narrative to form multiple levels of
                        authorship. Closest to the vision, of course, is the speaker of the poem,
                        presumably the sleeping Coleridge, though his identity is only established
                        in the prefatory note. In fact, the speaker is only given a first-person
                        pronoun at the end of the fragment when he steps outside of the narrative
                        motion and action to reflect: “A damsel with a dulcimer / In a vision once I
                        saw” (37–38). The sudden appearance of a first-person speaker calls
                        attention to the poem as a material object, constructed by an author, and
                        the invisible cognitive processes involved in this act of reading are
                        brought to the surface of the text for inspection. The reader is confronted
                        with her own act of reading and the fact of her subconscious immersion in
                        the poem’s atmosphere up to this point. Absorbed in the sensual immediacy
                        and the movement of the poem, the reader does not realize the poem is
                        composed in tranquility, as a recollection. The poem seems to have been
                        composed organically, in real time, as the reader (and speaker of the poem)
                        travels along the Arve. However, outside of the text itself, we see that the
                        woken poet Coleridge writes from a future time of reflection upon his
                        interrupted dream state. He attempts (but fails) to recall the complete poem
                        that was composed in full during his dream. The poem is a constructed space,
                        and its multiple layers of authorship further complicate its history. In a
                        prefatory note titled “Of the Fragment of Kubla Khan,” Coleridge attributes
                        his subject matter to falling asleep while reading about Kubla Khan’s palace
                        and gardens in “Purchas’s Pilgrimage,” thus adding another layer of
                        authorship to this synthetic dream production. Finally, outside of the
                        author and his source tale, we get a second poet called upon to validate the
                        worth of this fragment. Lord Byron, “a poet of great and deserved
                        celebrity,” and his publisher John Murray are named as patrons of “Kubla
                            Khan.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Holmes explains that “Kubla Khan,”
                            though written in 1797, was not published until 1816, when it appeared
                            alongside <title level="m">Christabel</title> and <title level="m">The
                                Pains of Sleep</title>, at the behest of Lord Byron. Coleridge had
                            recited the poem one morning while visiting Byron in Piccadilly
                            (426).</note></p>
                    <p>Coleridge’s imposition of these multiple layers of authorship attempts to
                        control the reception of his poem, to ensure the narrative gets understood
                        in a particular way that protects the poet and his unconventional model of
                        composition from scrutiny. He showcases a model that counters the
                        imperatives to rationality and composure characteristic of
                        post-Enlightenment culture. The abandon modeled in Coleridge’s dream vision
                        goes against the reigning model of poetry, exemplified by Wordsworth. The
                        levels of authority that encircle the poet figure in “Kubla Khan” depict a
                        poet actively engaging a literary tradition through reading Purchas and
                        associating with Byron. In this way, Coleridge offloads responsibility for
                        the poem to his environment and his friends. However, these protective
                        layers do more than preempt critique. The layers of context impose
                        boundaries for the reading experience: they establish a socially (and
                        professionally) acceptable environment where sensation can enjoy a free play
                        of sorts. The poet is entranced for the composition of the poem, and thus
                        without the direction of his conscious mind. He is a reader, engaging in the
                        same sort of absorption in a text as his own readers do. He, too, finds
                        himself immersed in seductive tales that take him out of reality. Though he
                        criticizes passive reading in<title level="m"> The Friend</title> and
                        elsewhere, here Coleridge embraces the affective and cognitive openness that
                        is characteristic of reading a sensual and sensational text. In Coleridge’s
                        model, the poet’s body takes precedence over the mind. However, Coleridge
                        imposes a balance between sensation and sensibility by creating a space for
                        the free movement of affect within the poem or dream and by calling
                        attention to this constructed space of immersive reading. By halting the
                        forward movement of the poem and imposing structures to contextualize the
                        composition of “Kubla Khan” as a history of reading, Coleridge ensures that
                        his audience recognizes the cognitive mechanisms at work. By creating this
                        revelatory moment for his reader, Coleridge anticipates Zunshine’s take on
                        ToM, as the pleasure of mind-reading is being able to see yourself perform
                        the task. Coleridge’s poem facilitates sensual absorption for its readers,
                        rather than disallowing a phenomenological experience of the fiction as
                        Wordsworth’s egotistical sublime does. In fact, the prefatory note to “Kubla
                        Khan” mourns the failure of the poet to transcribe the poem in full. He
                        regrets the interruption of his literary space by a nonliterary reality,
                        but, in replicating this interruption for his readers, Coleridge forces them
                        to evaluate the way their bodies and minds have been at work and learn from
                        it, as he shows he has done himself. </p>

                    <head>Digressing from Boccaccio</head>
                    <p>In <title level="m">Isabella; or the Pot of Basil</title>, Keats positions
                        himself as a self-conscious translator of Boccaccio, becoming the vehicle
                        for another’s transformative aesthetic experience. Keats’s careful attention
                        to this task peeks through the text as he digresses from the narrative to
                        offer apologies for the liberties he takes with his source tale. Begging the
                        forgiveness of Boccaccio and lamenting the disappearance of the Old Romance
                        tradition Boccaccio comes to represent, these interruptions of the tale have
                        often been described as evidence of his youth and immaturity as a poet.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Kurt Heinzelman explains Keats’s sustained attempt at
                            translation with Isabella, that the poet deemed his attempt a failure,
                            and how historically critics have agreed with Keats’s own assessment.
                            Along these lines, see also Ridley 56. Nigel Wood (reads Keats as a
                            “most self-conscious narrative poet;” however, he calls Isabella’s
                            romance narrative apparatus “unsavory by design,” ultimately defending
                            the seeming immaturity as a “calculated narrative tactic” (90). Susan
                            Wolfson argues that scholars should consider digressions more seriously,
                            that “these suspensions of story-telling are not displays of humorous
                            narrative incompetence” (249). </note> Rather, these authorial
                        interludes have a deliberate function, serving to position Keats himself as
                        a reader alongside the readers of genres like Romance and the Gothic,
                            <foreign>en masse</foreign>. Keats’s many interruptions call attention
                        to genre conventions of the grotesque and indecorous by stepping outside of
                        the text at the moments where sensation verges on the sensational. Keats
                        transports the reader out of the text when the narrative becomes most
                        gripping and unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that allow for
                        absorption in the narrative. Ostensibly censoring the text, Keats adopts a
                        seemingly Wordsworthian mode with his interruptions. He stops the forward
                        movement of the narrative and extricates the reader from their absorption in
                        the text, transporting him or her back to the present moment and encouraging
                        a more reflective reading experience. Arguably, Keats regulates the
                        circulation of affect by reasserting the boundary between the literary and
                        nonliterary. The interruptions ensure the reader acknowledges the text is
                        fictional and confined to the space of the page. Like the frames of “Kubla
                        Khan,” the structural abnormalities of this rendering of Boccaccio’s <title
                            level="m">Decameron</title> (c. 1353) show the poet as a reader himself
                        and give the tale a specific history as a reincarnation. They point to a
                        larger literary tradition of Old Romance that precedes and transcends the
                        historical specificity of Boccaccio.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> In his seminal study
                            of the poem, “Keats and Romance: The ‘Reality’ of <title level="m"
                                >Isabella</title>,” Jack Stillinger reads the digressions as Keats’s
                            attempt to modernize the genre of Old Romance with the addition of
                            realism, noting the tension within the poem between Keats’s translation
                            and the original tale. Objecting to the way Stillinger reads the text as
                            “divided against itself,” Susan Wolfson proposes an interpretation that
                            “sees Keats taking advantage of his ambivalence [to the values of ‘old
                            Romance’] to devise a genre of tale-telling whose designs are both
                            narrative and deconstructive” (“Keats’s ‘Isabella’ and the 'Digressions'
                            of 'Romance'"). For Wolfson, creating an immersive reading experience
                            and interrogating the structure of that experience are not necessarily
                            competing objectives within the poem. She writes, “Keats is concerned .
                            . . to reform the way we read romance, even as he entertains us with a
                            romance of sorts” (251). My own interpretation can reconcile Stillinger
                            and Wolfson, as I see the realism in Keats’s revisions working to
                            disrupt the reader’s experience of the sensational narrative.</note>
                        Moreover, the digressions implicate Keats in the very sentimentalism he
                        calls out in the genres of Romance and the Gothic. However, this
                        self-implication opens channels of sympathy between the author and reader,
                        and, through his digressions, Keats establishes <title level="m"
                            >Isabella</title> as a joint act of reading a popular form. </p>
                    <p> Among Keats’s first interjections is an apologetic interlude to Boccaccio in
                        which the poet reflects upon the contrast of his own Gothic framing of the
                        tale with the tradition of Old Romance. Here, he first calls the reader’s
                        attention to the text as a constructed space with a history preceding its
                        current iteration: <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> Keats asks forgiveness of Boccaccio and mourns the passing
                        away of Boccaccio’s Italy, the edenic surroundings that first inspired and
                        then listened dutifully to his song. Flattering the author in a move that
                        reads like the epic convention of invoking his muse, Keats declares he is
                        not making the original tale <emph>“more sweet,”</emph> but rather honoring
                        and preserving the writer and his legacy. Indeed, he wishes to “greet” the
                        “gone spirit” through his own song, thus imagining a social introduction to
                        the author. Yet, he fears he has overstepped the social and literary decorum
                        required of his task. By setting up this pastoral context for the source
                        tale, Keats implies the unnaturalness of his sensational additions to the
                        original. The Gothic “glooms” portrayed in Keats’s version of the tale are
                        far from “quiet,” and being so are seemingly ill-suited for a representation
                        of Boccaccio’s theme. </p>
                    <p>Despite acknowledging his failed decorum, Keats makes significant changes to
                        the source tale in order to adapt it for his own context. These adaptations,
                        in turn, call attention to the social nature of cognition and the inherent
                        co-creation of the narrative as the reader’s own minds translates the text
                        to create meaning. If we look back to the main clause of the stanza, we see
                        the poet uses the plural pronoun “we” instead of taking sole responsibility
                        for any wrongs committed. Like the first-person “I” used by Coleridge to
                        halt forward movement down the River Arve, Keats’s “we” presents an
                        immediacy that transports the reader outside of the narrative flow and into
                        a reflective position alongside the poet. No longer is the reader feeling
                        the sensual excess of former passages when the lovers pine over each other
                        to the point of physical sickness or when the lovers meet under the perfume
                        and musk of the hyacinth bower. Together, reader and poet are thinking about
                        the poem as a written text with a history of composition. “We” are aware of
                        the sensual excesses already experienced (those for which the text is
                        currently apologizing), and we may even be prepared to spot further
                        co-opting of our senses and bodies in future passages. A sense of shared
                        responsibility is important as we come to understand the power of reading in
                        shaping the intellectual and moral life of a populace. Keats’s revisions
                        introduce some of the most atrocious historical misdeeds that have made
                        Boccaccio’s song, and all it represents of the idyllic in nature and
                        culture, something long forgotten in nineteenth-century England. From the
                        “we,” the reader begins to see their own responsibility alongside that of
                        the author. Indeed, an author’s responsibility to his or her readership
                        extends beyond the development of an individual reader’s sensibilities as
                        the individual reader can now recognize the atrocities of their contemporary
                        moment and act in response.</p>
                    <p>Keats’s emphasis on institutionalized capitalism is a wholly new addition to
                        the original tale. The brothers’ exploits have long intrigued Romantic
                        scholars: their abrupt entrance into the poem and the consequent tonal shift
                        from sentimental romance to bitter critique draw much attention.<note

                        mysterious in nature, the brothers’ moneymaking schemes are violent and
                        dehumanizing: <quote><lg>

                            </lg></quote> Isabella’s brothers fragment their workers into functional
                        parts, and such objectification figures synecdochically in the poem: the
                        employees are represented as little more than hands, ears, eyes, and loins.
                        As their employers perceive them, the workers’ body parts make up the
                        industrial machine. The famous “Why were they proud?” interjection (Stanza
                        XVI) follows this series of modern tortures and introduces a
                        nineteenth-century critique of the socio-economic system these brothers
                        represent. Keats continues his list of the brother’s wrongs, punctuating it
                        with the repeated question, “Why were they proud?” There is no answer from
                        Boccaccio, nor is there any anticipated answer from his modern reader. The
                        atrocities multiply and the momentum builds, but Keats breaks the stanza’s
                        rhythm with another grasp at communal identity. He cries, “and again
                            <emph>we</emph> ask aloud, / Why in the name of Glory were they proud?”
                        (128, my emphasis). This interjection performs two critical tasks. Like the
                        apologetic digression, this passage, and Keats’s use of the plural pronoun
                        in particular, suggests that the author and reader together object to the
                        liberties taken with the source tale. Traveling the narrative together and
                        then stepping outside of the fiction to examine it at work, the author and
                        reader critique the way emotion has gotten the better of them. Their decorum
                        has devolved into disgust and outrage. The second and more important task
                        this interjection performs is to show that the author and reader alike
                        object to the abuse of a corrupt socio-economic system. Though “we” are
                        responsible for the loss of Boccaccio’s pastoral paradise, “we” are equally
                        able to recognize the horrors of our modern moment.</p>
                    <p>Keats has inserted a bold critique of the modern setting that informs his
                        own tale, and returning to the apologetic stanzas XIX and XX, we must note
                        the self-consciousness of “succeed the verse or fail,” in light of this
                        audacious revision. Conspicuously set off from the main clause with dashes
                        and located in the middle of Stanza XX, this aside is reminiscent of
                        Coleridge’s self-conscious speaker, who anticipates his own reception at the
                        end of “Kubla Khan.” But Keats’s audience is as multi-faceted as his layers
                        of authorship. The address to Boccaccio contextualizes his anxiety as a fear
                        of failing the master or muse; however, “succeed . . . or fail” implies the
                        pressure of Keats’s contemporary literary market as well. This poem is
                        widely held to be inspired by Hazlitt’s lecture on 3 February 1818, in which
                        he declared that a rewriting of <title level="m">The Decameron</title>
                        “could not fail to succeed in the present day” (Hazlitt qtd. in Heinzelman
                        168). Moreover, Keats hails this poem as his “new Romance,” following from
                            <title level="m">Endymion</title> 1818), which he hastily shrugs off as
                        a “feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished.” Penned the month
                        before he began <title level="m">Isabella</title>, the “Preface” to <title
                            level="m">Endymion</title>characterizes the epic as a “failure.” Thus,
                        Keats’s digression here in <title level="m">Isabella</title> registers fear
                        that resurrecting the past for the present literary market will fail as he
                        believes his most recent publication to have done. He fears for its success
                        in the modern market because the grotesque and titillating are what sell.
                        Popular texts sell because of their ability to provide mindless
                        entertainment. As noted above, texts like gothic novels and sensational
                        romances encourage a passive reading posture without interrupting it to
                        improve the condition of the modern mind or the modern society more
                        generally. In navigating the practical need for success in the modern
                        literary market, Keats plays at a balancing act where he must at once
                        titillate and educate. He must weigh the moments where the slippage between
                        fiction and reality is productive, as when it teaches us to recognize
                        corruption and abuse of power, against the moments when the slippage makes
                        the passive reader vulnerable to that corruption and abuse. This seems a
                        crucial threshold to the reading (and writing) experience being created in
                            <title level="m">Isabella</title>. </p>

                    <p>Lorenzo’s ghost serves as the most halting interruption of Keats’s poem. Like
                        the poetic digressions themselves, Lorenzo’s ghost disrupts and unweaves the
                        fiction Isabella’s brothers perpetuate, calling attention to the mechanisms
                        underneath their lies. When Lorenzo’s ghost visits Isabella, he is described
                        in terms similar to Coleridge’s Mariner. His bright eyes and strange voice
                        captivate. Like the poet from “Kubla Khan,” Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner is a
                        vehicle for a prophetic message. Doomed to wander the margins of society
                        alone, he is distanced from humanity and forced to propagate his tale. He is
                        entranced and entrancing. The Mariner circulates his narrative by holding
                        his audience with a hypnotic eye, compelling the audience to listen until
                        the tale is complete.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Importantly, the Mariner interrupts
                            a love story to convey his truth. His audience is a wedding guest who is
                            wrenched out of his own narrative trajectory, walking to the
                            chapel.</note> Lorenzo’s eyes, too, are “wild,” and he is “upon the
                        skirts of human-nature dwelling” (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 289,
                        306). He “chant[s] alone the holy mass,” cut off from community but obeying
                        a higher power’s demands to pay heed to truth. And like the Ancient Mariner,
                        Lorenzo’s act of storytelling leaves his auditor “a sadder and a wiser”
                        person for having heard the tale (<title level="m">Rime</title> 625).
                        Describing the ghost’s strange voice, Keats writes it was like a “palsied
                        Druid’s harp unstrung,” and his tale “did unthread the horrid woof / Of the
                        late darken’d time” (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 286, 292–93). The
                        negating prefix in each of these lines suggests the work Lorenzo’s tale
                        performs: it repeals the magic of Old Romance and uncovers a disturbing
                        reality. </p>
                    <p>As in Coleridge’s <title level="m">Rime</title>, what is most compelling in
                        the scene with Lorenzo’s ghost is not the message itself, but rather the
                        pattern of transference, how the tale moves between the bodies engaged in
                        its telling and its transformative effect after the moment of its telling.
                        Most interesting is the way both the Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost interrupt
                        and disrupt. In <title level="m">Isabella</title> and <title level="m"
                            >Rime</title>, the integrity of the tale itself doesn’t seem to be
                        fragile; rather, the moment of its transference is endangered. If we look
                        again to Coleridge’s bibliographic layers, he seems almost as anxious as
                        Wordsworth, with his controlling authorial hand in the egotistical sublime,
                        to ensure the tale itself be received in a certain way. Coleridge’s marginal
                        glosses added to the poem in 1817 seek to direct the interpretation of his
                        poem and add a moral and philosophical explanation for the otherworldly,
                        mythological events of the Mariner’s tale. Yet, these marginal glosses occur
                        outside of the act of storytelling within the poem. These glosses are not
                        aides for the wedding guest’s lesson, but rather for a modern audience’s
                        understanding of the tale itself (as it has been translated by the speaker
                        who witnesses its transmission in one particular instance), the moral
                        imperative to circulate the tale, and its circulation within the text. The
                        glosses and the reception anxiety they imply, then, suggest that the tale’s
                        meaning is very much constructed in the moment of transfer from writer to
                        reader. Success and failure are not determined by the soundness of the text
                        itself or even the poet’s maturity and talent. Rather, they are measurements
                        of the co-creation that happens in acts of reading, when the reader’s brain
                        meets the words on the pages and writer and reader work together in the
                        space of the text (and even beyond) to create meaning. Indeed, the anxiety
                        represented in “Kubla Khan” and <title level="m">Rime</title> studied
                        together suggests that the very composition of the poem actually takes place
                        at its moment of translation from the written word through the reader’s
                        neural processing as a cerebral tidal bore (Dehaene 114). When the poet is
                        distracted from the transcription of his vision, the composition fails, and
                        its communication will always be incomplete. If we can say that composition
                        fails here, then for <title level="m">Rime</title>, a poem in which the
                        anxiety is ostensibly located after the point of composition in the moment
                        of the tale’s circulation, we might conclude that the tale is complete from
                        the very beginning, that it comes to the poet and the reader and the text at
                        the same moment—that it pre-exists what would traditionally be called its
                        composition, the moment pen hits the page. </p>
                    <p>Like the stories circulated by the Ancient Mariner and Lorenzo’s ghost, the
                        act of reading, for Keats, stages an uncanny re-emergence of thoughts
                        repressed, hidden, and seemingly lost. Keats writes in an 1818 letter to his
                        publisher John Taylor, “Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by
                        Singularity—it should strike the Reader as a wording of his own highest
                        thoughts, and appear almost a Remembrance” (<title level="m">Letters</title>
                        I. 238). Poetry should seem an extension or an uncovering of the reader’s
                        own thoughts. This formula imagines poetry as a form of simulation rather
                        than an actual transmission of the author’s thoughts in the reader’s own
                        mind. Reading, therefore, acts as an elusive sleight of hand working in such
                        a way that the text seems at once to convey both the writer’s and reader’s
                        thoughts. This letter also positions reading as an experience of recovery of
                        high thoughts forgotten. The thoughts are like the reader’s, though they
                        seem to have been lost in the cobwebbed corners of the mind. With this brief
                        formula in mind, reading for Keats seems necessarily a gothic experience, an
                        uncanny re-emergence of thoughts always already in existence. They are at
                        once of the reader and not of the reader, unfamiliar but coming upon
                        Isabella and the wedding guest in a surprising excess of strange
                        familiarity. These thoughts disrupt both the narrative and the everyday life
                        of the characters. They prevent the wedding guest from attending the
                        ceremony. They teach their readers or listeners a nightmarish truth. They
                        call attention to the cognitive mechanisms under which the reader has been
                        operating, the state of sleepwalking in which the reader has existed and can
                        no longer exist. To see how this plays out in Keats’s Gothic Romance, let us
                        turn to the most sensational moment in the poem.</p>
                    <p>Laboring for three hours with a nurse by her side, Isabella appears to be a
                        woman giving birth, a point that would not have been lost on Keats, the
                        trained physician. Moreover, Isabella carefully tends the basil plant as
                        though it is her child. Having exhumed his body, she decapitates Lorenzo.
                        She carries his head home, combs its hair, straightens its eyelashes, and
                        wraps it in a perfumed silk scarf, all the while kissing it and crying over
                        it. Finally, Isabella entombs the head in a garden pot and plants basil over
                        top of it. All day and night, she tends the plant with a “continual shower”
                        of tears “from her dead eyes” (452-53). Isabella’s tears fertilize Lorenzo’s
                        head, and, from this, the two lovers (re)produce a lush plant. While
                        understanding this as a symbolic childbirth is compelling and valuable,
                        Isabella’s exhumation of Lorenzo’s body can also be understood as an act of
                        reading and writing. Isabella fills the old skull and dead bones with life
                        to resurrect their old romance. Keats interrupts her labor at the grave with
                        a rhetorical question for all readers of Romance: <quote><lg>
                                <l>Who hath not loiter’d in a green church-yard,</l>
                                <l>And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,</l>
                                <l>Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,</l>
                                <l>To see scull, coffin’d bones, and funeral stole;</l>
                                <l>Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr’d,</l>
                                <l>And filling it once more with human soul?</l>
                                <l>Ah! this is holiday to what was felt</l>
                                <l>When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt. (353–60)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Reading Gothic Romance (or even reading tombstones in an
                        actual churchyard) is here figured as resurrection from the grave. A reader
                        revitalizes the corpse with his imagination. Sending forth his spirit to dig
                        through clayey soil and gravel hard, the reader immerses himself in the
                        material sublime of the grave. He uncovers the emptied body of a text to
                        fill it again with imagined life. He joins the negative with capability,
                        marries sensation and memory. </p>
                    <p>As she cries over the pot, the basil thrives. Her emotional response to
                        Lorenzo’s murder is all-consuming and self-destructive. Indeed, crying over
                        the relic of her dead lover is the most sentimental and overwrought image in
                        the entire poem. She is so overwhelmed with her sentiment that she becomes
                        insensible to her surroundings. Keats records how Isabella “forgot the
                        stars, the moon, and sun, / And she forgot the dells where waters run, / And
                        she forgot the chilly autumn breeze” (417–19). She has no awareness of life
                        outside of her replacement romance. She is out of sync with nature, having
                        “no knowledge when the day was done,” and not knowing when the new day began
                        (421). Having lost herself in a flood of emotion, Isabella is vulnerable to
                        the outside disruption. But, why does the plant, which represents a
                        co-creation of meaning like poetry itself, flourish in the midst of her
                        excess sentimentality? Can we critique this scene’s mawkishness given that
                        the plant thrives? Or to bring this line of inquiry back to ToM and seeing
                        our cognition laid bare, is absorption in the affective excess actually
                        dangerous if the immersive reading allows for growth? </p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most famous of Keats’s interjections occurs at Lorenzo’s
                        graveside. Keats halts the narrative during the disentombment to justify his
                        obsessive attention to the grotesque scene. He exclaims, “Ah! wherefore all
                        this wormy circumstance? / Why linger at the yawning tomb so long? / O for
                        the gentleness of old Romance, / The simple plaining of a minstrel’s song!”
                        (385–88). Once again, this digression anticipates his audience’s objection
                        to overt sensationalism. Importantly, the audience he anticipates here must
                        be a literary one, for a reader of modern romance would not likely question
                        these common conventions of popular gothic narratives. Yet this digression
                        serves a dual purpose in calling attention to the sensationalism for the
                        common reader’s benefit and justifying his choices to a skeptical literary
                        peer. With his predictable nostalgia, Keats waxes upon the traditional form
                        of Old Romance that modern society has ravaged. But a closer examination
                        shows that this passage goes beyond mere lament. Old Romance is the simple
                        plaining of a minstrel’s song. The word “simple” here echoes the “simple
                        misery” that was Isabella’s lovesickness before learning of Lorenzo’s murder
                            (<title level="m">Isabella</title> 330). The pleasure of Old Romance is
                        like a passive reading experience in which the reader is absorbed, lost in
                        the automaticity of the affect. Keats criticizes those simple reading
                        experiences that engage sensory immersion without the interruption, without
                        halting the forward movement of narrative to show the mechanisms at work
                        underneath the fiction. If then simple misery is all sensation and sentiment
                        without sensibility, Keats’s digressions offer the necessary space for
                        sensibility to return. </p>
                    <p>Awaking the morning after her vision, Isabella gives her only speech in the
                        entire poem:   <quote><lg>
                                <l>“Ha! ha!” said she, “I knew not this hard life,</l>

                                <l>I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife</l>
                                <l>Portioned us—happy days, or else to die;</l>

                                <l>Sweet Spirit, thou hast schooled my infancy.” (Keats 329–34)</l>
                            </lg></quote> Here, Lorenzo’s ghost has called Isabella out of her
                        absorption in their romance to educate her in the reality of the world’s
                        corruption. Until now, she naively believed “misery”—the term used for their
                        lovesickness earlier in the poem—to be the worst experience in life, but,
                        learning of Lorenzo’s murder, she understands there is crime, betrayal, and,
                        worse yet, having to live on after waking to this knowledge. “New romance,”
                        then, takes on a particular meaning; more than just a fresh start for Keats
                        after <title level="m">Endymion</title>, it is reinventing the way tales are
                        told and read. The richness of new romance, narrative synthesized with
                        reality, engenders a reading experience that moves us beyond the immaturity
                        of Old Romance to arrive at a state of awareness that can inspire action and
                        change (Keats, <title level="m">Isabella</title> 391).</p>

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>Despite their maligned reputation in the cultural debates of the Romantic
                        era, passive reading postures require complex cognitive and affective work.
                        In a matter of a few hundred milliseconds, the human brain translates the
                        written word into bodily meaning, producing a physiological intimacy between
                        bodies involved in acts reading. Through a material sublime of instantaneous
                        cognitive translation, narrative is brought to affective life and the text
                        is co-created by poet and reader. Both Coleridge and Keats utilized the
                        automaticity inherent in reading popular genres like the Gothic and Romance,
                        as they immerse themselves and their readers in a flood of sensation. And
                        yet, interruptions to the narrative flow complicate moments of composition
                        and reading, ultimately highlighting the complex cognitive and affective
                        work of passive reading. By structurally regulating the sensory experience,
                        controlling the affective overflow, and calling attention to the cognitive
                        and cultural processes at work underneath the fiction, these authors ensure
                        we will not be caught in a dream world for long without awaking more
                        enlightened. </p>
