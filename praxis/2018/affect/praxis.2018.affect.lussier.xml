                <p rend="noCount"> William Blake’s perpetually protean <title level="m">Marriage of
                        Heaven and Hell</title> has proven somewhat elusive for those seeking to
                    articulate “what” the work means. Given its unusual form/s (organized along both
                    verbal and visual axes), its visionary commitments (evoked through its
                    apocalyptic imagery), and its intertextual engagements (from Aristotle and Jesus
                    through Milton to Swedenborg [Blake’s primary focus]), one cannot arrive at a
                    singular textual meaning. However, when one asks a different question—“How does
                    the text make its meaning?”—the dynamic aims of the work do emerge. The fusion
                    of these and other elements creates an art object with an overt gaze woven
                    through affective textualities, and this dynamic and interactive presence
                    strives to transform the very subjectivities of those readers who enter its
                    entangled zones of semiotic operations. Thus, affect forms the boundary
                    conception of such a textual condition, and its apprehension transforms them
                    into subjective effects. </p>

                        (1793) has long held a special place in Blake Studies, following from those
                        “under late Victorian sponsorship” who undertook the textual recovery and
                        secured, via critical extension, both Blake’s work and the place occupied by
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> (Eaves et al. 116).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> Citations will be to Erdman’s standard edition, <title

                            unless otherwise indicated. </note> Dante Gabriel and William Michael
                        Rossetti figure prominently in the recovery, and Algernon Charles Swinburne,
                        who published the first book-length interpretation of Blake’s prophetic
                        works, dedicated his critical essay to the latter. Swinburne, a friend of
                        the family, was intimately familiar with the first Blake biography by
                        Alexander Gilchrist and had direct access to the illuminated works.
                        Swinburne pronounced <title level="m">The Marriage</title> “the greatest of
                        all his books” and the work that best brought into view “the high water mark
                        of his intellect” (204). By the end of the century, Edwin Ellis and William
                        Butler Yeats published their famous “three-volume annotated edition, with
                        lithographic reproductions of a fair number of illustrations,” which, in
                        Edward Larrissy’s view, offered “The greatest tribute paid to Blake at the
                        end of the nineteenth century” (69). The volume provided <emph>the</emph>
                        Blake transmitted to modernity and taken up by some of its strongest
                        advocates and exemplars (e.g., Yeats, as well as James Joyce and André

                        arena of modernity and postmodernity alike.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Clark and

                            to have had essays included in both volumes.</note> Blake’s “brilliantly
                        experimental work” (Wittreich 198) was, from the beginning, perceived to
                        capture an unusually acute and intense convergence of aesthetical,
                        authorial, cultural, historical, material, philosophical, political,
                        psychological, and theological concerns and strategies.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                            Blake’s affective textual strategies align well with those proposed by
                            Knudson and Stage: “The <emph>inventive experiment</emph> creat[es]
                            either a) artificial environments (e.g., a laboratory) in which tests of
                            various sorts are conducted to develop, falsify/verify or discuss
                            hypotheses, or b) natural everyday environments (e.g., peoples’ homes,
                            classrooms or the street) that the researcher, designer, artist or
                            social activist influences or modifies in order to investigate
                            participants’ emotional and affective responses to a particular
                            stimulation [Marres, 2012]” (<title level="m">Affective
                                Materialities</title> 12). Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title>
                            falls in the latter group.</note>
                        <title level="m">The Marriage</title> powerfully delivers—through a fusion
                        of the verbal and visual fields (the illuminated book)—“a strange work, a
                        kind of philosophical manifesto” (Nurmi 59) that immediately became the
                        measure of Blake’s genius—and often even of genius itself—as it plunged
                        readers “into a vigorous Beethovenish coda [which was] big with portents of
                        the movement[s] to follow [in perpetuity]” (Frye, “Thief” 35). </p>
                    <p> The reception accorded the transmission, which periodically assumes material
                        bodies that are quantifiable, can be seen in recent research by Roger
                        Whitson and Jason Whittaker, who mapped the flow of Blake citations (versus
                        those of the other “big five” poets) in the narrowed discursive arena of
                        Twitter citations. Within this eddy of the digital environment, Blake
                        quotations far outstrip the other authors (17,970 quotations in a 27-week
                        span). Of these citations, <title level="m">The Marriage</title> provides
                        the majority, with the collision of the heavenly and hellish accounting for
                        almost 40% of those evocations (4,523 citations). Of course, given the
                        constant unfolding into potential fields of representational force, the
                        amount of “Blakespotting” one could now undertake is almost infinite, even
                        though it has only been less than a decade since the publication of Mike
                        Goode’s splendid and influential <title level="m">PMLA</title> essay. The
                        evidence seems to confirm that Blake, furthered when harnessed to those
                        mechanical horses of instruction—the computational engines of digital
                        knowledge and the machinic mills within the worldwide web—seemingly captures
                        the spirit of every age, but one measured by the rhythms of the body in
                        relation to the pulsation of social process, providing an individuated
                        experience of the event of being for eternity and cultivating via
                        transference an incident of incipient identity. Steven Goldsmith speaks best
                        in current criticism to this undercurrent, the strange pulse writhing
                        beneath the surface of the work in the depths of its textuality, a
                        substratum “mimicking in sound and meaning the cardiac rhythms that expands
                        and contracts an artery” and predicated on “activity and passivity [being] a
                        shared rhythm” (228, 245).</p>
                    <p>During this project, I have periodically returned to contemplate Frye’s
                        analogy to the animating energies of Beethoven, since the phrase provided
                        early recognition of the affective functions embedded in work and since the
                        material underlying the analogy—a revolutionary rhythmic presence that moves
                        successive generations—can be measured by new methods to assess how this
                        poetic presence was caught as “a condition of daily labor for Blake”
                        (Goldsmith 38). Consider, quickly, one level of textual operation analyzed
                        below at greater detail, the function of the I-persona and its reinforcement
                        in the entangled fields of the verbal and visual. The first-person persona
                        speaks only in memorable fancies, with the first leading into the proverbs
                        of hell. After the proverbs, on plate ten, the design decodes the narrative
                        process just conveyed to and negotiated by a reader: the devil dictates, the
                        I-persona captures those dictates, and a reader accesses the operation of
                        the work by passing through the devilish wings. In this way, one plane of
                        rhythmic manifestation must be the sequential assessment of what we do when
                        entering though this narrative function to participate in the work of the
                        text, which is a material operation of rhythm, since the “I” vacillates
                        between active and passive modes and reaches a peak on plate twenty-four
                        with the formation of prophetic character. The periodicity of this presence
                        is a material textuality function, providing only one way that Blake brings
                        this rhythmic presence into experience, since the verbal evocation of
                        recording that leads into the proverbs concludes with visual analysis of the
                        textual operation itself.</p>
                    <p>The techniques that embody this ethereal presence pulsate beneath the
                        composite text, like blood in arteries, and methodologies associated with
                        current affect theory and rhythmic studies provide strategies for recovering
                        this rhythmic aspect, which seemingly occurs on every plateau of possibility
                        within the work as the spirit beneath Blake’s embrace of the bounding line.
                        The evidence suggests that the perennial popularity of <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> is grounded in this elusive yet material presence,
                        since the work encodes a “certain rhythm or order” (Shelley 512) that
                        transfers its pulsations through an assemblage of affective devices (e.g.,
                        the narrative functions of the I), whose analytic plateaus provide vectors
                        (or in current parlance de/territorializing and re/territorializing lines of
                        flight) capable of moving the mind into motion (as Kant proposed in the
                        third critique). The text conveys the rhythm of Blake’s thought in a work
                        packed with projections from both the current time and the long traditions
                        that inform it. Literally, the rhythm of the work captures the spirit of its
                        own age (something only perceived across its literal and symbolic
                        reconstruction from obscurity), but, more importantly, <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> continues to catch like a corresponding breeze the
                        rhythms of almost every age, including our own (e.g., through Patti Smith).
                        The work evinces something perennial and important arising from the
                        harnessed energies undergirding the dialogic superstructure of the work,
                        which forms the “aspect of poetic form” (i.e., products of poetic genius in
                        poetry and prose) “that escape the conventions of meaning” (Aviram 83).
                        Rhythm defines the technique, provides the theme, and delineates its
                        textuality in ways with profound implications for those who read this
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps another specific example can help gesture at the play of pulsations,
                        providing a local example of rhythmic emergence in a more traditional place,
                        the shortest proverb which occupies the measured center of The Proverbs of
                        Hell: “One thought, fills immensity.” A dimension of rhythm resides in its
                        elusive metrics (made more complicated by the insertion of the comma), since
                        no matter where one places emphasis, the prior monosyllabic terms (either
                        dactyl or anapest) are swept away by the closing polysyllabic
                        double-accented solitary term. The metrics of the poetic line model the
                        sentiments expressed by the proverb, yet the second pulse of this rhythm
                        occurs with the passage of the eye from the term “immensity” to the
                        micro-visualization that follows to complete the line, where a ship, wind
                        filling its sails, sweeps towards the horizon at the edge of the page. Like
                        the metric of the poetic line, the visual tableau also enacts or embodies
                        what the proverb proposes through the image. </p>
                    <p><title level="m">The Marriage </title>propagates this rhythm within a work
                        seemingly packed with meaning and through analytic and visionary “utterance
                        designed in such a way as to draw attention simultaneously to its dimensions
                        of pure sound and to that of meaning, creating a sustained tension between
                        the two forces; and which achieves that effect of tension by means of
                        structuring its language according to rhythm” (Aviram 37). The scopic-driven
                        operations of the text create yet another layer of potential for affective
                        interactions, which proceeding along lines defined by textual tracks open to
                        participation, with the resulting spectrum of the self (an individual
                        pattern of interference and reception, a discrete perception of the work)
                        varying according to the hidden variables brought to bear by its readers and
                        spectators in these phenomenological acts of perception and reception. Thus,
                        the inscriptive process (image and word inscribed inversely on copper
                        plates) embodies this rhythm, the order (sequence of plates) and
                        organizational decisions (plate subsets) contain this rhythm, the pace of
                        narrative (vacillation across varied forms) enfolds this rhythm, and the
                        reader embodies, through suspension in narrative techniques, a transmission
                        of energies that moves from alterity to interiority.</p>

                        especially in light of its emanation from my cultural and social
                        environment, with first contact coming through snippets from other authors
                        and writers (e.g., Huxley or Ginsberg), musical devotees (e.g., The Doors or
                        Emerson, Lake, and Palmer), and even book covers for classes (e.g., <title

                            Prophecy in Israel</title>). <title level="m">The Marriage </title>also
                        arrived at a moment of personal crisis where the confluence of external and
                        internal forces necessitated radical changes in my life, and, following this
                        engagement, a quantum shift in my thinking took hold in relation to the
                        repetitive daily pursuits of studying the classically oriented curriculum at
                        the University of St. Thomas and performing the nightly work in the county
                        trauma center in Houston. Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title>
                        literally served “as equipment for living” (Burke 645) through the dark and
                        often tragic occurrences that arrived to the late-night emergency room
                        (between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM), which was cast into relief by juxtaposition
                        with the tranquil beauty of the campus and its deliberate pace through
                        knowledge—a passage often only separated by thirty minutes. Several years
                        later, when the time came to write my MA thesis, I predictably turned to
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> and its multi-dimensional analysis
                        and evocation of the prophetic tradition, which even in this relatively
                        early text (c. 1790–03) seemed to enfold fable, folklore, and myth (plate
                        11); the history of printing and its relationship to the transmission of
                        “knowledge” (plate 15); the con/fusion of the poetic and prophetic
                        (throughout but especially plates 12 and 13); and the re/cognition of the
                        triangulated interplay of desire projected onto “Vegetable Glass of Nature”
                        (E 555) and the ways drives and ideologies assume material bodies (plates
                        25-7).</p>
                    <p>Even after writing the thesis (“‘Rintrah Roars’: Anti-structural Prophetics
                        in <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>”), I felt my
                        assessment missed as much as it struck, but the impact of its textual gaze
                        during reception and interpretation stuck. The work continued to hail or
                        interpellate from the inside out, no surprise given that “such
                        interpellation [resides] in all acts of reading” (Bracher 177), and figured
                        prominently in my dissertation.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The work has continued to
                            exert a fascination on/to me, and if books were banned and burned, as in

                            the current political situation, I would select Blake’s <title level="m"
                                >Marriage</title> to memorize—both designs and words.</note> As Mark
                        Bracher has observed, the function of interpellation takes on added
                        intensity within the entangled fields of the work and its ability by
                        “textual codes” (170) to rouse the faculties of those who encounter it,
                        literally by the genesis of affect. Blake builds a work with textual
                        features that both recognizes the presence of appellation (and its
                        ideological functions) and re/cognizes its ability to achieve through the
                        marshalling of literary and textual techniques a transformation of readers
                        by its “gaze.”<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The gaze in its Lacanian and Blakean
                            permutations will accompany more detailed reading (below). Blake’s
                            experimental textual methods (its gaze and its elements) do reflect
                            current thinking on artistic intervention “in social life by [creating
                            and deploying] certain forms of controlled sensual stimulation” through
                            dramatizing “particular epistemic and aesthetic events in order” to
                            render visible “affective liveliness” capable of extending “current

                    <p>The impulse to use material operations and narrative techniques for
                        transformational ends finds the perfect textual platform within the rapidly

                        designed to engage readers and court the “capacity to produce significant
                        transformations in a reader’s psychic economy” (183).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The
                            term “appellation” is primarily borrowed from Louis Althusser: “all

                            subjects, by the functioning of the category of the subject” (173). My
                            dissertation confirms the continued call of <title level="m">The
                                Marriage</title>, since it dedicates a chapter to the Lacanian
                            echoes and essences embedded in the work and its deployment of “mirror
                            stage” apparatus like identification and projection, and the following
                            analysis owes much to Mark Bracher’s work (see below). </note> According
                        to most of my students (at all levels), the work continues to “hail” them
                        well after our studies concluded, whether they took delight, became enraged,
                        and/or felt provoked, but they all agreed that the work evinced the ability
                        to engage them where they live (the dynamic conditions of the real), while
                        manifesting a trans-temporal textual plasticity of great power that emanates
                        from complex and dynamic operations in the method best termed an “affective
                        mechanics” (“Mirrored Text” 16).</p>
                    <p>Having taught Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> at all levels of
                        instruction for about thirty-five years, I still marvel at the ability of
                        the work to stimulate receptive activities across a broad spectrum of
                        cultural/social belief and concerns through its activated semiotic textual
                        environment, and the analysis of this matter (the material base for the
                        textual generation of this stimulation) requires a shift from “what” the
                        work means to a question seemingly long resolved: “How does the text make
                        its meaning?’’ Such a question of <emph>praxis</emph> “turns on [Blake’s]
                        manifold involvement with the many modes of the sign’s operation, the ways
                        of setting alight a signifier . . . and the various ways readers have of
                        making sense of that involvement” (Hilton [2006] 86). Blake fuses from these
                        interactive sign systems “a new art form,” a dynamic textual object that
                        eliminates “the key division between conception and execution” (Jones 32),
                        and thereby offers the opportunity to traverse a plentitude of hermeneutic
                        plateaus in route to the closing “Song of Liberty.” Perhaps the most overt
                        line of flight, the “affective stylistics” built into the material of the
                        text, announces its operational function as “kinetic art [that] forces you
                        to be aware of ‘it’ as a changing object—and therefore no ‘object’ at
                        all—and also to be aware of yourself as correspondingly changing” (Fish
                        82-3). </p>
                    <p>My extended examination, then, takes up an inquiry into the affective
                        functionalities at work within <title level="m">The Marriage</title>,
                        beginning with those dialogic and dynamic exchanges (even the plateaus have
                        polarities implanted in content and form) for which the work is well-known
                        and through the energized interchanges between the “I” active within its
                        memorable fancies and the eye reading the “event” of the work. This direct
                        narrative node operates both linguistically and psychologically through
                        identification at the preliminary point of exchange and becomes the vehicle
                        for the emergence of a “larger I individual participate in a specific form
                        of subjectivity” posited by Michon in the epigraph to this essay. The
                        technique opens a receptive path for forms of transference and
                        counter-transference at the event-horizon of reception (an effect enhanced
                        through repeated reading). Through such methodic techniques, the gaze of the
                        work functions as generator of an affect (thus an affect machine), which
                        renders it an early experiment in and continuing exemplar of what is best
                        termed “affective textuality.”</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough, it has now been “thirty-three years since [the] advent” (E
                        34) of the thesis and its defense, and I feel methodologically better
                        informed to explore precisely how a physical textual object implants itself
                        in consciousness like a reoccurring infection that leaps out to inflect and
                        reflect across the spectrum of the real, symbolic, and imaginary registers
                        of the subject and its projections techniques onto the screen of alterity.
                        Although initially undertaken with typical critical instrumentation (in
                        succession, the rhetorical thrust of the prophetic [MA] and the
                        incorporation of post-structural psychoanalytic methodologies into textual
                        operations [PhD]), the excavation and exploration of such an intricate
                        object eventually extended to spatial/temporal planes of reception/response
                        (the space-time of critical analysis in which the affective aspects of the
                        work’s activated textuality operate), which extends the hermeneutic
                        possibilities to infinite planes and therein establishes what Alain Badiou
                        termed “a new idiom” by which the subject is newly positioned, speaking
                        existentially, as “being-for-the-infinite” (in contradistinction to “being
                        for death” [137]).</p>

                            Marriage</title>, the work synthesized those earlier efforts into a form
                        where intellectual and technological dimensions achieve a refined unity
                        reflected “in a Part as in the Whole” (E 269) transmitted to the Lambeth
                        (balanced between historical and psychological concerns) and Felpham periods
                        (the last effort to synthesize all concerns into illuminated prophetic
                        form). This essay, then, represents the third of four analyses designed to
                        bring into view the operational elements of what is best described as
                        Blake’s highly successful “experiment in affective textuality” (Knudson and
                        Stage 2–5).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> My interest extends backward to an early

                        creative and productive decade of Blake’s life and provides an assemblage of
                        forms, sources, and voices filtered through a scathing satiric imagination
                        guided by an impulse akin to Heideggerian <foreign>Destruktion</foreign>, a
                        “de-structuring of the history of ontology,” to gain purchase on the
                        “onto-theological” embedded in metaphysics as a necessary prelude for any
                        state of dwelling capable of abiding, aspiring, surviving, and thriving
                        (Heidegger 20; Economides 17). Blake the “bricoleur” (Mee 3) functions as
                        artist, engraver, painter, philosopher, poet, printer, and publisher—a
                        rather audacious stance relative to the sophisticated semiotic seas in which
                        he swam—and pursues an imaginary exploration of desires and drives,
                        constructs symbolic repetitions of these conflicts of varied layers of
                        representation and signification, deconstructs the foundational binaries
                        beneath them, renders the mythic and psychologic dynamic and interactive,
                        and traces them through history, myth, and other bearers of tradition into
                        the realm of the real. </p>
                    <p>Blake’s multi-formulaic approach is informed by a dizzying array of
                        intertextual references primarily focused on the Old and New Testaments and
                        its secondary “interpreters” John Milton and Emmanuel Swedenborg, with
                        everyone from Aristotle and Jesus through Ezekiel and Isaiah to Dante and
                        Shakespeare mentioned in its twenty-seven pages. However, this typical
                        referential apparatus is supplemented by an incipient intratextual dimension
                        established with the earlier tracts <title level="m">Songs of
                            Innocence</title> (1789) and the later <title level="m">Songs of
                            Experience</title> (1794) (i.e., their combination), as well as the
                        Lambeth prophecies (especially<title level="m"> America, A Prophecy</title>
                        [1793] and <title level="m">The Book of Urizen</title> [1794]), creating a
                        work of great plasticity capable of incorporating retrospectively an
                        evolving mythology placed within an entangled field of verbal and visual
                        representation, where even interlinear flourishes serve to support larger
                        hermeneutic and ideological interpellations within their micro-narratives
                        and where insistent apocalyptic and visionary language is capable of a
                        sustained frontal assault on all forms of what Lacan would term the symbolic
                            order.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lacan clearly establishes, given its function

                        legion, occur at many levels of the work, and are quite well known, given
                        its unusual textual features (organized along both verbal and visual axes,
                        each entangled with the other amidst supplemental interlinear flourishes)
                        and its transhistorical and prophetic commitments (evoked through its

                    <p>This assemblage of collective concerns confronted upon encountering the
                        creative aspects of characters and their contexts suspends readers in an
                        affective textuality and its operational modalities, which provide the
                        method of propagation to those “future generations” to which his “sublime
                        allegory” seems to be addressed (E 730). Each layer of intricacy has a
                        quasi-fractal nature of iteration and re/iteration, manipulating the reader
                        through discretely constructed sets: argument, demonstration, vocalization,
                        and visualization. Thus, rather than having little or no structure, the work
                        deploys a hyper-structuration designed “to restore difference in thought [in
                        order] to untie this first knot, which consists of representing difference
                        through the identity of the concept and the thinking subject,” a process
                        unfolding continually in <title level="m">The Marriage</title> and
                        reflecting its commitment to an “affirmation of differences,” which
                        throughout the work provides “a primary” impulse assuming “material and
                        bare” forms that are reflected in all encounters with “every . . . variant,
                        a difference, a disguise or a displacement” (Deleuze, <title level="m"

                    <p><title level="m">The Marriage</title> mostly seems to inspire, to ignite
                        aspirations, yet in almost any class at least one student experiences the
                        work as psychologically disturbing (and perhaps even dangerous), seemingly
                        offering substantiation to Bracher’s argument across that spectrum of
                        response that reception of this work often creates subjective alterations,
                        tends to unveil mental instabilities in the process, and often produces
                        existential/spiritual shifts as one alters one’s opinion in relation to the
                        textual gaze. The event of reading/reception unfolds relative to endless
                        variables woven into the cultural information comprising the content with
                        which the work and its spectator is concerned (within), and every reader
                        must engage textual conditions governed by principles of uncertainty
                        (without) that “activate[] the [spectators’] participation” (while
                        “destabilizing . . . singular identities”), thereby positioning its
                        consumers within a constantly shifting hyper-activated event horizon
                        (Badiou, <title level="m">Being</title> 304–05; Piccitto 80, 149). These
                        dynamic aspects of creation and reception “co-exist and co-function” (as
                        contraries) and depend on “discrete perceptions/cognitions” within this
                        event-horizon, which is shaped by the shared energies of author and reader
                        and provide a path through “productive interference” (mutual imposition) to
                        an infinity of “potential forms/configurations” (those “Unnam’d forms”
                        contained within the fifth chamber of the printing house of hell [E 40: 15])
                        response to “discrete perceptions/cognitions” (Massumi 197). </p>
                    <p>The lines of hermeneutic flight track something somewhat elusive (but
                        hopefully not illusive)—the ways Blake finds to capture and communicate the
                        rhythm of thought in the material operations of <title level="m">The
                            Marriage</title> (the first full-bore illuminated book of prophecy) and
                        to engineer paths of perpetuation within the work’s textual conditions—and
                        serve as routes to transferences and counter-transferences as the primary
                        sought outcome of its textuality. In this and other ways, Blake’s <title
                            level="m">Marriage</title> operates “as a machine conceived in order to
                        elicit interpretation” (Eco 85). This affect-generating machine encloses a
                        plenitude of dimensions, providing paths for intellectual interventions into
                        the cultural processes of subject formation and runs along governing
                        dynamics capable “of directly modifying the neurodynamics of the SELF” (see
                        second epigram) during acts of reading and reception. The textual condition
                        Blake establishes places semiotic complementarity at the foundation of
                        textual functions, with the verbal and visual languages positively writhing
                        within the framing engraved rectangle of representation whose energies
                        depend upon fields of semiotic force manifesting principles of
                        complementarity, which serves as the steady state of the illuminated books
                        generally. The textual field of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>
                        deploys what can only be described as a “gaze” in the full affect/effect
                        given that term in current critical discourse, although manifest at the
                        individual level of aesthetic object is significant for an affect-oriented
                        approach to Blakean textuality. Through at least two layers of its material
                        operations (one visual and one verbal), the work modulates its figural and
                        linguistic languages to effect a shift or transference of perception “from
                        the point of view of the object [to see] . . . from the subject’s point of
                        view” (Merleau-Ponty, <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> 226) and must
                        maneuver within the knowledge of what W. J. T. Mitchell termed the
                        “composite” dimension of the text (Otto 42–44). Blake’s textuality form
                        evinces an overt gaze woven through affective textualities, and this dynamic
                        and interactive presence strives to transform the very subjectivities of
                        those readers who enter its entangled zones of semiotic operations. Thus,
                        affect forms the boundary condition for this new textual state, and its
                        apprehension undertakes forms of transforms designed to create subjective
                        effects.</p>

                    <p>As Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker suggest, the verbal and visual images
                        enter the subject of contemplation like “viruses, worms and memes” that
                        infect the reader/viewer locally but that equally establish a wider host
                        when they “circulate through cyberspace” (Dent and Whittaker 174), where
                        textual virtuality provides the precise threads for the shaping of affective
                        outcomes through effective techniques continually communicated within and
                        without the work. Obviously, the hidden variables at play cannot be
                        definitively mapped; however, the textual operations can be observed.
                        Blake’s activated mode of mimetic representation produces significant local
                        (and often immediate) affects, not a surprising outcome in light of Anna
                        Gibb’s description of such textual operations quite relevant to the case of
                        the illuminated books (although in periodic manifestation and so with
                        unequal measure): <quote>At the heart of mimesis is affect contagion, the
                            bioneurological means by which particular affects are transmitted from

                            are powerful purveyors of affect contagion, since they are communicated
                            rapidly and automatically via the face, as well as the voice. (“After
                            Affect” 91)</quote> The face of <title level="m">The Marriage</title> is
                        clearly the title plate, and, as Leo Damrosch notes, the bounding lines of
                        the design yield “the shape of a human head” (102), which, in light of the
                        plateaus of experience reflective of polarities, offers (for the experienced
                        reader) a visual x-ray of the dynamic symmetries in existential play
                        erupting within all individuals. The design also assumes the function of a
                        mirror, providing a mimetic representation of a visionary head wherein all
                        textual dynamics operate to create a mirror-stage encounter, escalating
                        affective intensities with every encounter (one can only once be innocent in
                        the face of this gaze textual) through identification. The design provides a
                        view of interior process of a human head, and with this mirror in the text
                        (i.e., another form of the <title level="m">mise en abyme</title> trope)
                        proffered as aesthetic antidote to the maladies of selfhood (a concern taken
                        up in later works but here in incipient form). Since the “contraries battle”
                        in all (poet and audience alike), the title page presents an archetypal,
                        universal man (an <title level="m">ur</title>-form of Albion), and the
                        mirrored aspects of the construct operate in opposition to “the mundane
                        world, the world built by nature and memory, a crazy house of false mirrors”

                        symbolic and imaginary spaces), help structure the work and provide the

                        readers within varied spatiotemporal situations and, when transmitted,
                        across varied cultural processes of signification. In the first “Memorable

                        Devil” not only serves as a front to un/veil Blake’s corrosive inverse
                        printing method but also articulates the governing query by which to
                        contemplate improvement through multiversical forms of affective experience: <quote><lg>

                            >The Marriage</title>, and, as Nelson Hilton long ago perceived, it (and
                        other forms of enigmatic wisdom [i.e., parables, proverbs and prophecies])
                        functions in ways similar to Zen <foreign>koan</foreign> (197–200) by
                        “rouzing the faculties” (E 560) as a method for intellectual development in
                        the constant conversion of knowledge into wisdom. While the devil writes
                        corrosively to inscribe this couple, the I-persona records it, providing the
                        other voice while functioning as the vehicle for incorporation and,
                        thereafter, participation. Given my contention that the work functions as an
                        affect-generating machine by design, the relevance of this quote should be
                        obvious; Blake’s theory of the text uses material elements to unravel
                        ideological manacles and, in the process, rewrite the process of subject

                    <p><title level="m">The Marriage</title> takes up residence in the psyche as a
                        symptom of reception (probably at all three topological layers of Freudian
                        psychoanalytic experience); as in the literary, philosophical, and
                        theological layers of the book, the psychological layers also pursue the
                        unveiling cultural elements and operations (i.e., ideological production) in
                        order to redirect those energies as a vehicle to alter the
                        reader/spectator/subject through implication and participation. The work
                        crafts “an intraorganic mirror” (Lacan, <title level="m">Ecrits</title>
                        79)—to adopt the well-known operation at the foundation of Lacan’s mirror
                        stage—which generates through identification an <foreign>imago</foreign>
                        (Blake’s term is “spectre”), thus initially stabilizing subjectivity by an
                        imaginary sense of totality (i.e., constructed from the outside in).<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors">In essence, Blake’s textuality operates through similar
                            dynamics as Lacan’s famous mirror-stage, although the textual mirror
                            Blake presents is a screened window upon which both writer and reader
                            project from different spots in the spacetime continuum, while
                            transmitting the physical and psychological mechanics needed to
                            annihilate the <foreign>imago</foreign>, a process that reaches its best
                            expression in <title level="m">Milton</title>. Of course, in the mirror
                            stage described by Lacan, the subject assumes an illusory identity; in
                            the textual mirror of Blake, the <emph>specter </emph>is unveiled
                            through a process of mimetic representation, thereafter deconstructed,
                            and then restructured through techniques of transformation piloted in
                                <title level="m">The Marriage</title> (although precede by the
                            tractates). The mirror, for Blake, must shatter to reveal the work as a
                            window, since one should look through a text and not with it (like one
                            should look through the eye and not with it). </note> Blake directed the
                        mirrored textual dynamics towards dismantling the initial
                            <foreign>imago</foreign> (of ideology), allowing a new form of
                        subjectivity to assert itself by embracing the contrary aspects of “the body
                        and the soul” to achieve a visionary outlook more contestatory in
                        commitment. More specifically, Blake fashions his mirror through interactive
                        semiotic fields (i.e., the “head” of the title page and the “I” of the
                        narrative) dedicated to “the formation of [] prophetic character” (Wittreich
                        216) as the sought outcome for any passage through a dynamic process of
                        subject formation predicated on participation (a path of development related
                        to that mapped by Lacan’s Schema L).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lacan discusses this
                            map of “intersubjective dialectics [and dialogics]” in his seminar of
                            Poe’s “The Purloined Letter” (<title level="m">Écrits</title> 6–48) and
                            in a brief closing commentary to the compilation to establish why “the
                            quaternary [structure] is fundamental” to the functions “of the
                            unconscious” in order to map “a subjective ordering” (<title level="m"

                        side of the screen (i.e., locus of the author), ideally results in the
                        formation and emergence of an altered state of consciousness, the opening
                        place from which to begin the long struggle with the
                            <foreign>imago</foreign> embraced, in Lacan’s view, as early as eighteen
                        months. Yet, as André Green suggests, the process, once internalized, must
                        be recognized not as a singular “pinpoint chronologically as a stage than to
                        designate [it] as a structuring situation” (166), the point of entry for
                        affective textual techniques. </p>
                    <p> Generally, all illuminated books—when performing at the peak of their
                        potential—operate in similar ways, but the techniques deployed by <title
                            level="m">The Marriage</title> provide a baseline of affective
                        operations, beginning with mimetic representation predicated upon “the
                        presence of others.” Those “others” are interpellated in the process of
                        reception through Blake’s version of “the larger I” posited by Michon
                        (above), the I-persona, which supplements the imagistic mirror of the title
                        page with a linguistic mirror upon which the contraries of material reality
                        (within and without) are projected. This two-fold mode opens the possibility
                        of a counter-identification that would have some chance of neutralizing the
                        freeplay of the <foreign>imago</foreign> or Blake’s spectre, although that
                        task awaits Milton in <title level="m">Milton</title>, a work driven by
                        reception dynamics. Reception, then, <emph>always</emph> occurs within an
                        event-horizon involving the intersection of linguistic and scopic properties
                        that <emph>always</emph> alters neurological conditions, therein creating a
                        corresponding shift from object relations (author/work or reader/book) to a
                        “subject to subject” relationship that defines, in part, its “gaze” (Lacan,
                            <title level="m">Fundamentals</title> 84). These techniques work
                        somewhat covertly in <title level="m">The Marriage</title>; after all, only
                        educated or experienced readers would know that the “corrosive” process that
                        concludes the first “Memorable Fancy” or the “thirty-three years” (on plate
                        three) are both self-referential and hence meta-textual. However, the
                        affective textual functions become increasingly overt in the vibrant
                        semiotic fields of <title level="m">Milton</title> (1804) and <title
                            level="m">Jerusalem</title> (1820): both include direct addresses to
                        readers, and both periodically unveil the mirrored textual dynamics at the
                        foundation of the illuminated form itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Jane Bennett’s
                            description of “vibrant matter” works well with the dynamics built into
                            the illuminated books: “I am looking for a materialism in which matter
                            is figured as a vitality at work both inside and outside of selves, and
                            is a force to be reckoned with without being purposive in any strong

                        distributed across several layers of mimetic representation to assure the

                        beyond postmodernism and posthumanism alike. Through the transmission of
                        viral strains of verbal, visual, and interlinear forms of representation,
                        textual functionalities infect the reader during reception and therein
                        inflect the neurological conditions to create an intensified mental

                            >The Marriage</title> was often seen as “‘a scrapbook of Blake’s

                        that seemingly impeded, rather than facilitated, understanding for “readers
                        who want to know what they are reading” (Eaves et al. 117). However, in my
                        experience, Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> has perhaps the most
                        trackable structure in the canon, unfolding as a fourfold structure
                        constructed in relation to the affective dimension informing subject
                        formation earlier established: <list type="simple">

                            “<foreign>mise en abyme</foreign>,” which Lucien Dällenbach argues
                        represents “a structured reality, despite [its] apparent variety and
                        randomness,” yet in such a manifestation actually provides a way “to trace
                        its diachronic evolution” (165).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Lucien

                            dramatic, and narratological dimensions of this complicated trope, and
                            Blake’s enhanced semiotic field creates new possibilities for its
                            incorporation as a technique used at different plateaus within a single

                            observations for the potential for this trope (74-81). </note> The
                        section begins with a visual thesis that equally reflects the current state
                        of subjectivity (an energized eternal now of dynamic events occurring at
                        every topology of the psyche and every sense of the body), follows with a
                        poetic “Argument” (organized temporally from “Once” through “Then” and
                        “Till” to “Now”—the time of the prior title design), and proceeds into a
                        zone of negative dialectics (which strives to occupy an intellective
                        position “that is historical and critical but not dogmatic” [<title

                            its acquired system of connections” (29).</note> The last component of
                        this subset, already briefly discussed, is the inaugural “Memorable Fancy,”
                        which introduces the I-persona, unveils the printing method, and propels the
                        work into the unruly and wild “Proverbs of Hell.”</p>
                    <p> In the opening seven plates of the work, Blake stages energetic exchanges of
                        “contraries” (plate three) to test intellectual and spiritual systems,
                        seeking to unveil inconsistences and inconstancies while advancing
                        “unlearning” as the sought pedagogical outcome. These collisions (which
                        occur across numerous plateaus of activity) shape the epistemological
                        framework of <title level="m">The Marriage</title>, providing the
                        reiterative set of elements that reflects the use of <foreign>mise en
                            abyme</foreign> helping to create a force field woven, in part, from
                        dialogic imperatives.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> The form of dialogism pursued
                            through <title level="m">The Marriage</title> is not a tame

                            “unresolvable but is nonetheless reconciled” but rather the strident
                            “condition of fierce social struggle outlined by Bakhtin . . . in which
                            dialogical forces of language actively contest the social and political
                            centralization of their culture” (Hirschkop 74). My sole revision would
                            be to replace “language” with “semiotics” as the deeper and wider system
                            of signs open to Blake given the verbal and visual fields of the
                            illuminated books. </note> The work proceeds through the fourfold
                        structure by beginning in unlearning (plates 1–7), unleashing a burst of
                        unfettered creativity (plates 7–10) through which any reader must travel
                        (akin to Satan’s swimming across chaos in <title level="m">Paradise
                            Lost</title> [1667]), with Blake positioning immediately after the
                        “Proverbs of Hell” the key to decode the process that follows—the visual
                        design that mediates the passage from the tumultuous imaginary realm of
                        proverbial wisdom and his effort to restructure the way the subject is
                        shaped. </p>
                    <p> The third section, which begins a rather deliberative process to reconstruct
                        the subject (a realignment to effect a shift from passive to active reading
                        habits and then to extend this into the structure of everyday life), unfolds
                        in a fourfold movement established through the function of the I-persona and
                        predicated on the phenomenological encounter with the textual gaze which it
                        bears (plates 11–24). The manifestation of this new state of subjectivity is
                        found in the voice that sings “The Song of Liberty” concluding the work
                        (plates 25–27), and the numbered biblical verses (the culminating form of
                        utterance) perform visionary work conveying Blake’s reinterpretation of
                        prophetic discourse (a shift from the predictive to the psychoanalytic). The
                        “Song” sung presents the preliminary mytheme of Blake’s evolving mythopoetic
                        map of mental processes (the interactions of the nuclear family: “The
                        Eternal Female,” “The newborn terror,” and “the starry king” [E 44: 25–26])
                        and announces the vehicle (the illuminated book of prophecy) designed to
                        serve as method itself and to exploit lines of de- and re-territorializing
                        lines of flight forged in reception, leading directly to the assumption of a
                        deliberately crafted visionary perspective yet crafted through difference
                        and repetition rather than solidified mimetic representation and symbolic
                        similitude.</p>
                    <p> Blake reinforced these broad structural elements though an act of repetition
                        with a difference, since the third section of the work (plates 11–24)
                        manifests its own four-part organization (including the elements of the set
                        comprising the first section) and thereby transforms the deployment of an
                        occasional use of a <foreign>mise en abyme</foreign> structure within its
                        surface examination of tradition into a treatment in the form of an active
                        textuality, recommending treatment for the condition (within the narrative)
                        and narrative operation and textual techniques and technologies as the
                        prescription for the inherent divisions at play in all areas of the work
                        (Dällenbach 43–53) into both a narrative operation and a textual technique.
                            <title level="m">The Marriage</title> undertakes nothing less than
                        simultaneously diagnosing the maladies of subject formation (based upon
                        known means of reception) and articulating an antidote to the dis/ease
                        resident in the process of subject formation, embracing the semiotic as the
                        cure for the symbolic (in contemporary critical language). The modes of
                        correction assume a fractal-like façade founded in repetition and
                        reiteration that charts the trajectory of method, the evolutionary and
                        revolutionary aspects of the physical body through which Blake staged these
                        often <emph>carnivalesque</emph> exchanges (i.e., the memorable fancies),
                        where the illuminated book itself provides a dynamic textual environment
                        within which to transfix any reader’s attention and entangle affective
                        operations within these semiotic layers through the rhythmic elements
                        distributed throughout the plateaus of Blake’s formative multiverse.<note
                            place="foot" resp="editors"> “It is this rhythm that gives a temporary form to these
                            diverse elements, holds them together for so long as it lasts, . . .
                            creating a writing that resonates with it, simultaneously describing and
                            performing it. Rhythm, I think is a critical key to thinking writing as
                            an affective methodology” (Anna Gibbs 227).</note></p>
                    <p> Jerome McGann associated Blake’s illuminated books with the emergence of a
                        quantum textuality, since the work in hand really does open onto “infinity”
                        within and without: “Holding the book you hold ‘Infinity in the palm of your
                        hand,’ as Blake precisely remarked” (163). The interplay of these dialogic
                        and dynamic elements within any given illuminated book encodes forms of
                        uncertainty at several levels (including form itself) and operates through
                        principles of complementarity (throughout the enriched semiotic environment
                        shaped by the entangled energies of intersecting verbal and visual fields).
                        The affective textual forms and techniques analyzed here—which were uniquely
                        designed to shift “the scene of instruction” into any reader’s mind—does so
                        by discrete textual operations that take hold during acts of reception and
                        response and are shaped with sound psychoanalytic principles in mind (a
                        point already addressed elsewhere). The interplay of these textual forces
                        are supplemented by other aspects of the work, creating an assemblage of
                        interactive generic forms produced from interwoven poetic philosophical
                        argument, prosaic analysis, parodic yet pointed memorable fancy, proverbial
                        wisdom, and numbered biblical verse bound together to articulate patterns
                        that trace, but do not and cannot represent, affect: “The rhythm of poetry
                        [in all its permutations and vacillations] compels affect, which can then be
                        put into words; rhythm does not represent affect”: <quote>Physical rhythm
                            can be said to have meaning only in a very limited way, insofar as it
                            alludes to well-known rhythms that are in turn attached to certain
                            ideas, conventions, and moods, and therefore to words and images. . . .
                            Physical rhythm is quite different in kind from either words or images,
                            which are fundamental to the economy, codes, and values of ordinary
                            social life. The ideas and images of poetry are historical; they
                            construct the immediate physical reality of the rhythm that their words
                            simultaneously embody. (Aviram 226–28)</quote> Blake’s textual
                        strategies aspire to unveil this presence through an assemblage that places
                        affect at the foundation of textuality itself, since such a move “is that
                        the specific joys and pleasures of poetry are preserved” (Aviram 244) but
                        would also operate unveil “writing itself is an affect-laden process: driven
                        by interest and desire, subject to frustration and misery as well as
                        productive of joy and excitement” (Gibbs 223).</p>
                    <p> Blake’s <title level="m">Marriage</title> exploits “the stability of print
                        as a platform and the linearity of text in the codex form,” therein
                        extending “speech beyond the body of the writer [and] producing the effect
                        of an inner voice and with a psychodynamics of interiority” (Gibbs, <title
                            level="m">Affective Materialities</title> 228). Blake’s experimental
                        text and the textual theory behind its strategies operate relative to the
                        unseen while hailing those who come into its gaze, a peculiar tactic again
                        aligned with scopic drives and one that acknowledges the specular nature of
                        subjectivity itself: <quote>What we have to circumscribe, by means of the
                            path [Blake] indicates for us, is the pre-existence of the gaze—I see
                            only from one point, but in my existence I am looked at from all sides.
                            . . . The eye and the gaze—this is for us the split in which the drive
                            is manifested at the level of the scopic field (Lacan, <title level="m"
                                >Four </title>72–73)</quote> Within the accumulation of <title
                            level="m">The Marriage</title> as assemblage, from its opening titular
                        mirror and its dedicated exploitation of the “I” as our narrative guide
                        through both heaven and hell, readers both transfer (via internalization)
                        the subject-function and thereby continuously pronounce themselves the “I”
                        of the text, which operates through countertransference. Returning this
                        reflection into the textual field of Blake’s <title level="m"
                            >Marriage</title>, affective techniques provide a mechanism for a
                        transference of consciousness within the dynamics described by Georges
                        Poulet (I-persona as a vehicle of interiorization and subsequent
                        ex/pression) and evoked by Lacan in his discussion of the gap between the
                        “eye and the gaze.” For both Blake and Lacan, “this split constitutes the
                        characteristic dimension of analytic discovery and experience” (Lacan,
                            <title level="m">Four </title>69), and it clearly informs Blake’s
                        attempt to provide an experience and ex/pression of rhythm through effects
                        and techniques that deploy affect as the vehicle of subjective
                        transformation.</p>
