            <p class="noCount">Taking as its main focus Shelley’s lyrical drama <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, this essay examines the Romantic treatment of feeling as a kind of affective ecology
               sustained by love. The poem reconstitutes feeling, not as it indicates a subject formed
               by Enlightenment notions of words or looks, but as an unrestrained <span class="foreign">jouissance</span> that constitutes the event of feeling itself. This event shatters the subject so
               that, as if to tarry with a Jupiterian desire to conscript meaning, the subject can
               feel its truth.</p>

                  <p>Many of Romanticism’s ur-texts, from <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> (1774) to <em>The Prelude</em> (1850), apotheosize the eighteenth century’s increasing attention to feeling. Our
                     sensate response to the world—<span class="foreign">sentio ergo sum—</span>spurred Romanticism’s feeling enterprise as a part of its critical response <em>to </em>feeling. Put another way, Romanticism struggles to understand affect as expression,
                     cognition, and cogitation, as when Wordsworth tempers the spontaneous overflow of
                     powerful feeling through the tranquil recollection of emotion. This cognitive latency
                     (feel first; think later) demanded a measured response to feeling’s autonomous rhythms,
                     the symptom of any number of enthusiasms—religious, political, sexual, etc.—that excited
                     concern. Scholarship has long shared this (strangely passionate) distrust of feeling
                     (e.g., Wimsatt and Beardsley’s attack on affective criticism as Romantic subjectivism).

                     and the transformation of emotion into a scientific object, we are now rethinking
                     feeling in Romanticism as a complex matrix of representational and cognitive possibilities.
                     Feeling and thinking are far more interrelated than previously felt or thought, and
                     feeling itself is anything but ancillary to being.

                  <p>Part of this effort requires that we parse feeling’s difference from itself. Rei Terada
                     distinguishes emotion as “a psychologically, at least minimally interpretive experience
                     whose physiological aspect is affect” from feeling, “a capacious term that connotes
                     both physiological sensations (affects) and psychological states (emotions)” (14–15).
                     For Brian Massumi, feeling is affect materialized as virtual existence, a “zone of
                     indistinction” that he reads as a kind of political ecology (66). Affect is a “system”
                     of “autonomic responses” that the cognition of emotions “may seize upon . . . [in
                     order to] . . . ‘qualify’ or name them, but in doing so it ‘dampens’ their force or
                     ‘resonance.’” Emotion “is affect ‘owned and recognized’; it translates affect into
                     ‘conventional, consensual’ form, where it can be given ‘function and meaning’” (cited
                     in Favret 1159). Or as Michael Hardt argues, feeling transforms the “ontology of the
                     human” by “illuminat[ing] . . . both our power to affect the world around us and our
                     power to be affected by it, along with the relationship between these two powers”
                     (xi). Each of these cases speaks implicitly to a Romantic impulse at once to understand
                     and thus name feeling, and to give it free rein as a kind of psychochemical radical
                     transferring and transforming of relations between subjects and their world.

                     </div> What we feel along our pulses registers the natural and preternatural (uncanny) psychosomatics
                     of our sensorium as it touches and withdraws from the world. As Wordsworth says, “we
                     cannot chuse but feel / That [man’s works] must perish” (<em>The Prelude </em>[1805] 5.20), which rather ambivalently prefers feeling to rational determination <em>and </em>marks feeling as our unavoidable lot tied to a death that we unavoidably must feel.
                     Our “works” are rather beside the point, for feeling <em>is </em>our work, whether we like it or not.</p>
               </div>
               <p>This essay takes its cue from these authors as well as from accounts more specifically
                  targeting Romanticism. For Julie Carlson, Percy Shelley’s use of simile, as embodied
                  thought, unlike metaphor, which subordinates reality, registers language’s affective
                  pull as the feeling relationality among selves as others. By enacting their difference
                  from reality, similes offer a non-defensive, non-coercive relation to the very antagonism
                  they stage. Richard C. Sha reads this relation in terms of the motion or force of
                  emotion as a “metalepsis” of the human and nonhuman (both mechanical and divine),
                  an unstable but productive relational matrix that subjectivity materializes: “Emotions
                  . . . literally matter because of the force they contain,” Sha writes, “the mechanism
                  by which the mental becomes somatic and emotion is communicated” (23, 22). Emotions
                  lack agency, but not intentionality, and thus confuse the “border between matter and
                  sociality,” so that “affinities are necessarily multiple, and by implication, transient”
                  and “fungible” (31). This paradoxical transfer informs Terada’s sense of how passion
                  undoes “intentional subjectivity” to mark the “nonsubjectivity within the very concept
                  of the subject” (4–5), the non-human within the human. And for Jacques Khalip, the
                  above lines from Book Five of <em>The Prelude </em>suggest an inhuman automaticity that expresses an “extreme kind of purposiveness without
                  purpose—a zero-degree relation of carelessness, a relation without relation” (631).</p>
               <p>What does feeling “mean” as a form of inhuman cognition that at once locates us in
                  and beyond the world? I ask this question of Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), in which the global effects of feeling are writ large as cosmic phenomenon.
                  Feeling is the eruption and rupture of a material happening embodied through its subjects
                  as feeling’s virtual presences, feeling <em>as </em>virtual presence. Alain Badiou describes this rupture as “the event.” For Badiou,
                  within the givenness of any situation, delimited by the dominant ideology of its social
                  order, what that order excludes and thus renders invisible threatens to erupt. “The
                  structure of situations” does not itself “deliver any truths”; rather, the rupture
                  constitutes the truth of “rupturing with the order which supports it, never as an
                  effect of that order” (xii). The event is thus a random, local, subjective breach
                  that calls attention to whatever exclusions made and sustain the situation, a defamiliarizing
                  moment that calls it to its <em>situatedness</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>For my present purposes, I would argue that emotion carries the event’s rupturing
                     force, as in the spontaneity of Wordsworthian feeling. But to Badiou’s sense of the
                     event’s radical, incommensurate singularity, I would add that emotion’s sheer immanence
                     is at the same time tied to that which incites it or to the situation in which it
                     erupts—Wordsworth’s sense of emotion’s recollection. In the simplest terms, emotion
                     at once explodes and gauges the situation it explodes, is at once apart from and embedded
                     within, and thus responsive to and responsible for, the situation. Put another way,
                     by materializing subjects <em>as </em>subjects, emotion registers their embeddedness within any situation’s ideological
                     constraints, but also marks them as exceptions to its (and to the subject’s) rule.
                     In the “perpetual Orphic Song” (4.415) that is the fourth act of Shelley’s lyrical
                     drama, Panthea and Ione are awakened by the Voice of Unseen Spirits, who bring news
                     of Prometheus’ unbinding and subsequent union with Asia, a marriage and transformation
                     of unfathomable proportions.

                     happiness at once agitates and is agitated by “Storm” and “panic.” Contrary to the
                     poem’s otherwise idealist and idealistic slant, Shelley’s environment is both self-possessed
                     and possessed by the agents of its unfolding—who are, in turn, possessed by its autonomous
                     functioning and self-possessed enough at once to be shaped by and to endure its arbitrary
                     purposiveness.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The key word here is “shake,” which marks the power of emotional response in excess
                     of itself, something that exceeds cognitive recognition. It also marks the ambivalence
                     of one’s feeling response to the world as an agency without agents, a force materialized
                     through the expressions that it generates in turn. Coincidentally, the OED defines
                     “emotion” as “movement, disturbance, perturbation, or instance of this” by citing
                     Shelley’s “Love’s Philosophy,” first published in <em>Posthumous Poems </em>(1824): “The fountains mingle with the river, / And the rivers with the ocean, / The
                     winds of heaven mix forever / With a sweet emotion” (1–4). Emotion also means “an
                     agitation of mind; an excited mental state. Subsequently: any strong mental or instinctive
                     feeling, as pleasure, grief, hope, fear, etc., deriving esp. from one's circumstances,
                     mood, or relationship with others.”

                              me with the joy / Of elevated thoughts, a sense sublime / Of something far more deeply
                              interfused” (Poetical Works 94–97).</span></div>
                     </div> “Sweet emotion” and “shake with emotion” thus suggest both Heraclitean contingency
                     and pantheistic interconnection (in “Love’s Philosophy,” Shelley continues: “Nothing
                     in the world is single; / All things by a law divine / In one another’s being mingle”
                     [5–7]). Here an emotive nature is not the world humanized, as in a nature rendered
                     “instinct with feeling” by the poet, to borrow a common (by Shelley’s time even hackneyed)
                     phrase, but rather (to borrow another Shelleyan word) enkindled by and as its own
                     sensorium. “Instinct” signifies an autonomous, unwilled self-fashioning, a nature
                     imbued with or animated by feeling but also an innate, spontaneous impulse that disturbs
                     or resists rational cognition, as in Darwin’s account of species formation. Eventually
                     emotion becomes a transitive verb: “to cause to move; to make emotional” and “to affect
                     or imbue with emotion; to make emotional” (OED), which denotes our current understanding
                     of “emoting” as performance. Ironically, this aesthetics of feeling partly recalls
                     Aristotle’s purgation of emotion (<span class="foreign">katharsis ton pathematon</span>) and reminds us that feeling stages our subjectivities without our knowing: we only
                     come to know feeling once we feel or see it “staged” for us in turn.

                     of Shelley’s truncated final poem: “Then, what is Life?” To say that the cognition
                     of where we fit in the world is <em>more</em> than a feeling, to name this essay’s title, suggests a super-addition that makes feeling
                     relevant, understandable—an <span class="foreign">Aufhebung </span>in which affect and emotion meet to become cognizable, in which we become cognizant

                     feeling as an excess beyond itself. Feeling is thus both superfluity, something that
                     neither rationality, mental cognition, nor understanding can easily assimilate, and
                     a superabundance that imbricates us within the larger affective matrix that situates
                     us within the world. Binding the above etymologies is emotion as “political agitation,
                     civil unrest” (which again echoes Badiou’s sense of the event), but also of “a movement
                     from one place to another, a migration” (OED). Shelley’s poem senses a world moving
                     both within and beyond its own boundaries. Feeling registers this migratory impulse
                     as a threat that also leads humanity, and its detrimental effects, beyond itself to
                     a brighter but also radically unknown (and thus equally terrifying) future. <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, perhaps the most intensely idealistic of Shelley’s texts, expresses an “idealism
                     without absolutes.”

               <p>In his Preface to the poem, Shelley speaks of poets as “the combined product of such
                  internal powers as modify the nature of others.” They express the power of poetry
                  as a “mimetic art” that “creates by combination and representation,” to produce “some
                  intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought,” by
                  which he means “the mind of man” and “nature” (208). For Shelley this “analogy” takes
                  the form of “imagery . . . drawn from the operations of the human mind, or from those
                  external actions by which they are expressed” (207). This creative reciprocity between
                  mind and world immediately (dis)locates images of the brain, like those of a dream,
                  to a transitional space that is at once communal and nowhere, which is to prompt the
                  question of where such images reside and what effect they might have. Shelley locates
                  the poem’s impetus in an effort to “annihilate” the “moral interest of the fable which
                  is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of Prometheus,” by attempting
                  to “conceive of him as unsaying his high language” (206). This rethinking of language’s
                  power to convey, control, and coerce thought is an attempt to discover and explore
                  a radically different vocabulary that would express “some unimagined change in our
                  social condition or the opinions which cement it” (208). That the future remains “unimagined”
                  suggests Shelley’s “‘passion for reforming the world,’” yet without a plan to do so,
                  which invokes the customary disparagement of a Shelleyan politics out of touch with
                  reality. But to mark change as “unimagined” is to mark the negative potentiality of
                  three possibilities: a catastrophic outcome avoided, as in the recurrence of despotism
                  against all resistance to the contrary; a future that may or will never come, as in
                  the frustrated hope for political change; or, most radically in Shelley, an event
                  left unfulfilled so as precisely to make way for its possible occurrence. This unimagined
                  “something evermore about to be” evokes a sense of threat that haunts Act One as Prometheus
                  struggles to recall his curse against Jupiter. Yet as we shall see, it haunts the
                  poem’s movement toward its future—toward the future—as a progress without <span class="foreign">telos</span>, a trajectory that materializes as if from and within the motions of its own immanence,
                  which is to say the immanence of emotion itself.</p>

               <p>In his opening speech, Prometheus rails against Jupiter for the toxic emotions—“fear
                  and self-contempt and barren hope” (1.8); “mine own misery and thy vain revenge” (11)—over
                  which Prometheus “Hast [been] made [to] reign and triumph, to thy scorn” (10). For
                  Jupiter’s attempt to legislate another’s emotional life—for how Jupiter’s tyranny
                  tries to make Prometheus <em>feel—</em>Prometheus, who refuses to accept the emotions that result from the affect transmitted
                  by Jupiter’s reign, feels not “Disdain” but “pity” for Jupiter (53). Hence, in Act
                  One Prometheus is no longer made to endure but actively <em>asks </em>to endure, not <em>what </em>his curse said, but <em>how </em>it was said, how it might now be recalled in order to transform its effect. Which
                  is why the Phantasm of Jupiter, not of Prometheus, repeats the curse, to which Prometheus
                  replies, in one of the poem’s most moving statements of the ethics of affect, “It
                  doth repent me” (303). Having been “made” to rule an emotional “empire” not of his
                  making, and thus reluctantly estranged from an emotional life he longs to claim, Prometheus,
                  who nonetheless “endure[s],” turns outward to “Earth” and “Heaven” to ask if they
                  have “seen” or “heard [his] agony” (15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29). This gesture is less
                  to gain sympathetic witness to his eternal “pain” than to reclaim, not the words,
                  which “are quick and vain,” but the toxic affect that fueled and sustained the curse’s
                  utterance, the breath of which left Earth’s “wan breast . . . dry / With grief,” and
                  “the thin air . . . stained / With the contagion of a mother’s hate / Breathed on
                  her child’s destroyer” (30, 303, 176–79).</p>

                  <p>Earth and Heaven are thus impoverished by the <em>sound </em>of the curse, at first repeated in the four Voices of mountains, springs, air, and
                     whirlwinds. On one hand, Earth resounds with the “dying fall” that encrypts the curse’s
                     ruinous effect. On the other hand, Earth’s “Caverns” remain “tongueless,” except to
                     hear the “hollow Heaven” and “Ocean’s purple waves” cry “Misery!” to the “pale nations”
                     (107, 108, 109, 111). Between Philomel and Echo, that is to say, affect might be heard—sounded—in
                     either violent or transformational ways. More particularly, in the transmission of

                              which asks us to re-think, non-pathologically, how affect and its energy of feeling
                              is absorbed by and between subjects, and thus both permeates and blurs the boundary
                              between mind and body. </span></div>
                     </div> that eventually transforms the life of the poem’s emotional landscape, the text emphasizes
                     the sound of echoes, an odd displacement that paradoxically marks the very thing that
                     echoes are, the mode of their difference from themselves as difference itself, and
                     the echo as sound’s difference from itself. This is why Prometheus “hear[s] <em>a sound</em> of voices—not <em>the</em> voice / Which [he] gave forth” (112–13; my emphasis), as if to take ethical and moral
                     responsibility for the effect his emotions have, not just on others, but on the environment
                     that both marks him and upon which his existence inevitably leaves its mark. Prometheus
                     accuses the Earth of not knowing him, and implores her not to “deny” him his “dreadful
                     words” (185). But this is only to mark her “inorganic voice” (135). It is more critical
                     that he hears the “melancholy” (152) carried by that voice in order to mourn the mourning
                     of its past effects and affect. That is to say, Prometheus would move past the cycle
                     of mourning itself, emblazoned as what Panthea, having heard the Chorus of Furies
                     come to tempt Prometheus to despair, calls “A woeful sight—a youth / With patient
                     looks nailed to a crucifix” (584–85). Such is the logic of Jupiter’s emotional tyranny
                     that “In each human heart terror survives / The ravin it has gorged” (618–19) and
                     men “live among their suffering fellow men / As if none felt” (630–31). This is at
                     once to legislate the self-predatory nature of affect (not unlike Freud’s notion of
                     guilt internalized as the superego in the name of a self-lacerating and thus self-governing
                     conscience) and to atomize subjects so as to pre-empt any movement of feeling and
                     thus neutralize its potential resistance.</p>
               </div>
               <p>His immortality at first keeps Prometheus from hearing the sound of his own (past)
                  voice; as the Earth reminds him, “How canst thou hear / Who knowest not the language
                  of the dead?” (137–38). But his eternal nature reflects a broader emotional landscape,
                  less the timeless utopianism that uncannily depends upon an equally endless cycle
                  between hope and despair for its possible apocalypse (hence the Christian redemptive
                  eschatology that Prometheus eschews), than “merely” the harbinger of things to come,
                  in which the future remains radically unknown so as not to predetermine and thus constrain
                  its emotional life. This is, paradoxically, why dread and terror as much as love and
                  hope sustain this life as a “voice to be accomplished” (3.3.67). Earth, who “dare[s]
                  not speak” the words of the curse, instead has been “mediat[ing]” upon them “In secret
                  joy and hope” (184–86), “Preserve[d], a treasured spell,” among “the inarticulate
                  people of the dead” (183–84). Like the frozen affect of the melancholic, she encrypts
                  the source of her lament, the refuge, as Shelley writes in <em>Adonais</em>, of “what is still dear” as that which “Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither”
                  (473, 474). The curse is thus “dreadful” because it bears the hope of a secret that,
                  as Nietzsche suggests in “On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense,” becomes the empty
                  center around which a mobile army of metaphors and metonymies orchestrate themselves
                  in order to exert the force of truth. Arriving to “execute” a “doom of new revenge,”
                  Jupiter’s son Mercury compels Prometheus to “Clothe . . . in words” the “secret known”
                  to Prometheus of the term of Jupiter’s tyranny (355, 375, 371). Like the Foucauldian
                  psychiatrist who feeds the discursive regimes of power by coaxing the confessant’s
                  internal life into the open, Mercury’s promise of redemption and thus happiness, signified
                  by the remedial authority of his “serpent-cinctured wand” (324), feels to Prometheus
                  like the Sword of Damocles (396–405).</p>
               <p>Yet Prometheus tarries with the <span class="foreign">pharmakon</span> in other ways, for he risks re-agitating the same emotional pestilence he was unwillingly
                  made to incite, like a toxin injected into bodies—given bodily form—(hopefully) to
                  mobilize antibodies against the poison it cultivates. That is to say, he must claim
                  the curse’s affect <em>as his own</em> in order both to reject and to transform its affective coding. He calls up the archive
                  or Wayback Machine (as it were) of his emotional life in order, like Shelley’s notion
                  of poetry’s re-creative effects from existing causes, to envision this life’s hardwiring
                  otherwise. Very early in the poem Prometheus pities and thus disavows Jupiter’s tyranny.
                  But again, only once he “endures” the variously toxic causes and effects that lead
                  to pity do the various Furies, sent to torment his desire back into bodily (i.e.,
                  verbal) form, vanish (634). The text allegorizes this excoriating process when the
                  Earth says that the words of Prometheus’ curse “shall be told” (191), a powerfully
                  passive construction that immediately displaces the force and thus potential affect
                  of their saying: </p>

               <p> The passage reads as an uncanny template of Lacanian self-encounter. In cursing Jupiter,
                  Prometheus became what he beheld, as if to enter the mirror stage in which we witness
                  for the first time the symbolic contours of our selfhood <em>as </em>self, yet simultaneously recognize that our desire <em>for </em>this self is constituted precisely by the desire <em>of </em>self we witness in the other. Such an encounter turns both sides of the reflection
                  into a specular exchange or transference from which it seems impossible to escape.
                  We might say that the poem begins with Prometheus recognizing this trap. Put another
                  way, the passage invites the subject to witness his own (“sole”) death as the burial
                  of a potential (“unimagined”) life that is less the site of a possible repression
                  (for Shelley repression signals inevitable death) than the unconscious that psychoanalysis
                  can never presume to know. Or to paraphrase Prometheus answering Mercury asking about
                  the “period of Jove’s power,” “I know but this, that it must come” (412–13).</p>
               <p>The Earth invites passage through the mirror stage to a different constitution of
                  things that does not depend upon the tyrannical power of the gaze in which the other
                  and its Jupiterian authority hope to catch subjects. This “Infinity [that] shall be
                  / A robe of envenomed agony” (288–89) signifies the endless cycle of a possible redemption
                  calcified in the image of a crucified saviour. Gazing upon the Phantasm of Jupiter,
                  Prometheus “see[s] the curse on gestures proud and cold, / And looks of firm defiance,
                  and calm hate, / And such despair as mocks itself with smiles, / Written as on a scroll”
                  (258–61). Shelley’s hermeneutics of facial anatomy suggests Charles Bell’s <em>Essays on the Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression</em> (1824), which reads in the face’s visual topography a spiritual dimension. And Bell’s
                  text anticipates Charles Darwin’s <em>The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals</em> (1872), which re-thinks the relationship between mind and body in terms of a biology
                  of emotion that links mental states to the human and animal movement across and between
                  species through time and space. Like Bell, Darwin uses illustrations as well as photographs
                  to visualize and materialize emotion in process. Yet Shelley’s poem avoids this materialization
                  precisely for its desire (as Massumi notes) to “capture” affect as emotion. As Ione
                  notes after the appearance of Jupiter’s Phantasm, this image of emotion is “but some
                  passing spasm” that would have us, in the words of the First Fury, “die with our desire”
                  (314, 351).</p>
               <p>In this way, the melancholy of Earth’s voice, which is the echo of Prometheus’ own
                  desire, carries a transforming, semiotic energy. Julia Kristeva accounts for language’s
                  unsteadily disruptive but renewable force as the semiotic <span class="foreign">chora</span>, an “essentially mobile and extremely provisional articulation constituted by movements
                  and their ephemeral stases” (<em>Revolution </em>24). Similar to the primary processes in Freudian dreamwork, the <em>chora</em> is comprised of “‘energy’ charges as well as ‘psychical’ marks” (25), both the force
                  of the drives and the impressions they leave behind. Associated with the infant’s
                  biological attachment to mother, and thus constellating the matrix of all intersubjective
                  relationships, the semiotic denotes the psychic “binding” of our instinctual and libidinal
                  “motility.” It thus registers the inextricable link of the material and the psychic
                  as part of a “<span class="foreign">signifying process</span>” into which all subjects are born and out of which they emerge (25). The semiotic
                  marks the residual materiality of the mother’s body, which is also to say of any primordial
                  sustaining presence or force that registers the subject’s first bodily experience.
                  It thus also marks the matrix of our environmental disposition in the world, the transferential
                  space of our attachment to things, and the energy that at once sustains this relation
                  and perpetually disrupts and (re)generates its manifestation <span class="foreign">as </span>relation. The semiotic denotes the reciprocal movement of melancholy itself, of how
                  we are at once born from a past without origin and borne toward a future with trajectory
                  but without <span class="foreign">telos</span>. Or as Kristeva writes, without “a bent for melancholia there is no psyche,” for
                  “there is no imagination that is not, overtly or secretly, melancholy,” an “<em>impossible mourning</em>” for “an inaccessible—and inaccessibly lost—object” (<em>Black Sun </em>6, 9). Melancholic semiosis—the melancholy <em>of </em>semiosis—thus also sustains the affect of sound—the sound <em>of </em>affect—that carries the work of affect itself in the poem, the echoes of sound that

                  <p>At the end of Act One we anticipate the arrival in Act Two of Asia’s “transforming
                     presence—which would fade / If it were mingled not with [that of Prometheus]” (832–33),
                     which is to say the affective life Act One has worked hard to release—or rather, to
                     keep “unregarded” (3.4.179), to borrow a word from a different context in Act Three.
                     Once the last of the Furies vanishes, Prometheus invokes “two woes: / To speak and
                     to behold” (646–47). Earth having “spare[d]” (647) him one by re-calling the echoes
                     of his curse, the poem now tackles the second vehicle by which emotion has transferred
                     itself: the Enlightenment power of the gaze. Earth thus calls upon “those subtle and
                     fair spirits / Whose homes are the dim caves of human thought”; who “behold / Beyond
                     that twilight realm, as in a glass, / The future” (658–63); and who “breathe, and
                     sicken not, / The atmosphere of human thought” (675–76). This glimpse into, as opposed
                     to gaze upon, the future carries the affective force of “despair / Mingled with love,
                     and then dissolved in sound” (756–57) before it can calcify into image. The force
                     of affect in the poem will now be carried by the materiality of sound that contains
                     it, not as emotion, but as a feeling in which, as Panthea says struggling to speak,
                     “all . . . words are drowned” (758). This “form of Love” (763), like Shelley’s “shape
                     all light” in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, is constituted by the “sense” of sound that “Remains . . . like the Omnipotence
                     / Of music when the inspired voice and lute / Languish” but carries on “through the
                     deep and labyrinthine soul” (801–05).

                              by Chris Washington that reads the poem as what I would call the triumph of, to borrow
                              a word from Deleuze, an incompossible love: love as incompossible. Washington writes:

                              anarchy but rather a radical politics of love that creates worlds anew. Love is an

                     form <em>of</em> feeling—is Ione and Panthea’s reading of the turmoil in Prometheus’ soul while sitting
                     at his feet throughout Act One. Specifically, Panthea reads this affect as it is registered
                     by Ione, then carried by Panthea to Asia as the “wordless converse” (2.1.52) that
                     has all along been transpiring between Asia and Prometheus.

                              language, yet offers an exchange equally complex. In Rajan’s deconstructive reading,
                              affect, like language, functions (or threatens to function) logocentrically to close
                              of its own complexity, whereas I might argue for a more Kristevan reading in which
                              affect, like the semiotic, persistently disrupts any symbolic or representational
                              system. That is to say, affect at once perpetuates the ocular transference of affect…</span></div>
                     </div> Asia instructs Panthea to “Lift up thine eyes / And let me read thy dream” (55–56),
                     which is actually two dreams, one of which, tellingly, she “remember[s] not” (61).
                     In the other dream Panthea envisions the liberation of Prometheus’ body, coerced by
                     the feeling of Jupiter’s tyranny, to reveal “the glory of that form / Which lives
                     unchanged within,” through which “his voice fell / Like music which makes giddy the
                     dim brain / Faint with intoxication of keen joy” (64–67). Imploring Panthea to “lift
                     thine eyes on me,” she “[feels] / His presence flow and mingle through my blood /
                     Till it became his life and his grew mine / And I was thus absorbed” (70, 79–82).
                     To Asia, the transmission of these “words” are at first “as the air”: “I feel them
                     not . . . oh, lift / Thine eyes that I may read his written soul!” (108–10). This
                     exchange materializes feeling, not as emotion, but as the situation or event of its
                     own unfolding, the “written” quality of this experience as “soul” being the shape
                     it takes <em>as </em>it unfolds. The interchange between Panthea and Asia thus transpires as through a
                     glass darkly, a mirror without surface in which the transmission of affect is “dark,
                     far, measureless / Orb within orb, and line through line inwoven” (116–17).</p>
               </div>
               <p>This transmission having been enacted in the first scene, the sound of echoes is then
                  transported in the second scene through a Semichorus of Spirits, which revives the
                  melancholy voice of Earth as it fades, “Till some new strain of feeling bear / The
                  song” (2.2.34–35) into the third scene, where music materializes on Earth a sound
                  “Awful as silence” (2.3.36). Asia describes this event as the “sun-awakened avalanche”
                  that unleashes the “thought by thought . . . piled” by “Heaven-defying minds,” “till
                  some great truth / Is loosened, and the nations echo round / Shaken to their roots”
                  (37, 39–42). Asia and Panthea are carried as if to the previously “tongueless caverns”
                  of the Earth, specifically the cave of Demogorgon in which “A spell is treasured but
                  for thee alone” (88). Here they confront “a mighty Darkness / Filling the seat of
                  power,” “Ungazed upon and shapeless:—neither limb / Nor form nor outline” (2.4.2–6).
                  But, “[they] feel it is / A living Spirit” (6-7). In her confrontation with Demogorgon,
                  Asia is told that, ultimately, “the Abysm / [Cannot] vomit forth its secrets,” for
                  “a voice / Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless” (114–16). In one of the poem’s
                  key statements of the ineluctability of necessity, it would “avail [not] to bid thee
                  <em>gaze</em> / On the revolving world” or “to bid speak / Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change,”
                  for “To these / All things are subject but eternal Love” (117–20; my emphasis). In
                  this way, “eternal Love” comes to signify that moment in which feeling, as event,
                  ruptures things as they are to reveal, to return to Badiou, the truth of the subject’s
                  experience. Put another way, this truth <em>of </em>experience, at the moment of its happening, becomes radically incommensurate with
                  the situation from which it emerged, yet within which it remains ineluctably enmeshed
                  except as it (potentially) shifts this situation’s terms of reference.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The poem’s utopian thrust suggests that transformation attends this evolution. As
                     Asia ascends from her encounter, Panthea tells her she can feel “How thou art changed!”
                     but “dare not look on thee”: “I feel, but see thee not” (2.5.16–17). Emissary of the
                     atmosphere of love that is the Earth transformed by a kind of cosmic “sympathy” (34),
                     the voice of Spirits alone now governs the poem’s unfolding, in which the “breath”
                     of the “Life of life” is exchanged “between” the “lips” they “enkindle,” and are then
                     “screen[ed] . . . / In those looks where whoso gazes / Faints, entangled in their
                     mazes” (2.5.48–53). Shelley’s use of “screen” means at once, paradoxically, to obstruct,
                     to divide, to protect, and (to borrow Shelley’s own use in <em>Queen Mab</em> [1813]), to “conceal, obscure, or disguise” (OED). Taken together, the “screen” also
                     evokes for us as contemporary readers an instance of cinematic encounter in which
                     neither gaze holds the other captive but instead suggests a reciprocity, not between
                     bounded subjects, but of an agency without agents. In this moment of Heideggerian <span class="foreign">Schein</span>, existence simultaneously reveals itself to and hides itself from our grasp,

                     these matrices of feeling in which Asia experiences her “soul [as] an enchanted boat”:
                     “Till like one in slumber bound / Borne to the Ocean, I float down, around, / Into
                     a Sea profound, of ever-spreading sound” (82–84). Here the two-way circuit of desire
                     that keeps subjects in their place through a Jupiterian transmission of affect is
                     now “Without a course—without a star— / But by the instinct of sweet Music driven”
                     (89–90).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is in light of the disembodied materiality of sound accomplished in Act Two that
                     we then read the dramatic irony of Jupiter’s opening speech in Act Three. Here he
                     anticipates a spirit “which unbodied now / Between us, floats, felt although unbeheld,
                     / Waiting the incarnation” (3.1.44–46), shortly after which Demogorgon arrives to
                     take Jupiter to “dwell together / Henceforth in darkness” (55–56). Instead, Hercules
                     arrives to unbind Prometheus, enacted without fuss in a stage direction at the opening
                     of Scene Three. This apparently negligible event at same time signifies the quantum
                     and cosmic space and time of transformation itself between the at once adamantine
                     and utterly ephemeral nature of a Jupiterian emotional tyranny. In the cave to which
                     Prometheus and Asia will retire (which journey remains at the level of prophecy in
                     the poem), Prometheus enjoins Ione to “chant fragments of sea-music,” which shall
                     resonate with “echoes of the human world, which tell / Of the low voice of love, almost
                     unheard” (27, 44–45):

                     Of all that man becomes” (57–58), Prometheus then implores her to give to the Spirit
                     of the Hour the “curved shell that Proteus old / Made Asia’s nuptial boon,” which
                     contains a “voice to be accomplished” (3.3.65–67). Thus “Loosening its mighty music
                     . . . it shall be / As thunder mingled with clear echoes” (81–82), what Act Four calls
                     “an Ocean / Of clear emotion” (96–97). Echoes that are “clear” are at once pure, bright,
                     transparent, unclouded, capable of allowing sound to pass without obstruction—again,
                     screens both through and upon which sound might transfer. As Prometheus then bends
                     to kiss the ground, Earth responds, “I hear—I feel—” (84). Here the “sound” and “look”
                     of feeling mobilize its meta-global economy as Prometheus’s “touch runs down / Even
                     to the adamantine central gloom / Along these marble veins” (“stony veins” [1.153])
                     as “The Warmth of an immortal youth shoots down / Circling” (3.3.85–90). Like Panthea’s
                     absorption by and in Prometheus, or Prometheus by and in Asia, unbound Prometheus
                     becomes the avatar of an unrestrained feeling that is at once the blood and breath
                     of the earth’s affective ecology, the agency of its sound and sight. Or as Prometheus
                     says to the Spirit of the Hour, “We feel what thou hast heard and seen” (97). As if
                     further to mark this final transformation of feeling, the Spirit, prophesying the
                     “mighty change as I had felt within / Expressed in outward things” (129–30), acknowledges
                     how humans will be “Speaking the wisdom once they could not think, / Looking the emotions
                     once they feared to feel” (157–58). This last phrasing visualizes emotion, as in Bell
                     or Darwin, as if to mark the image’s capacity to register and thus fix feeling, yet
                     also as if to fulfill the poem’s promise of an unrestrained emotional life, the migration
                     of feeling across subjective borders, unchecked throughout the world and beyond.

               <p>Yet in a final, remarkable turn, Act Three “[tears] aside” the “painted veil . . .
                  called life” that “mimicked, as with colours idly spread, / All men believed and hoped”
                  to reveal man “Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed—but man” (190–92, 194–95). To leave
                  man “but man” is to reclaim a feeling humanity lost through Jupiter’s tyranny but
                  regained through the possibility of love. Yet man also remains “Nor yet exempt, though
                  ruling them like slaves, / From chance and death and mutability,” the “clogs of that
                  which else might oversoar / The loftiest star of unascended Heaven / Pinnacled dim
                  in the intense inane” (200–01, 202–04). In Act Two, as we have seen, Demogorgon tells
                  Asia that “All things are subject to [Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change] but
                  eternal Love.” Within this penultimate context, feeling materializes, not the utopianism
                  of love, which would be once again to trap “All men” in what they “believed and hoped,”
                  but a future to come in (as Reiman and Fraistat annotate “intense inane”) a “formless
                  void of infinite space” (269n). Here what remains incommensurate nonetheless registers
                  with “intense” force, the indistinguishable locus of feeling itself as the air we
                  breathe. In this sense, although Shelley calls it love, which is to invoke the political
                  idealism of a society renovated by sympathetic encounters without violence, terror,
                  or tyranny, it is also love as the inevitability and unavoidability <em>of</em> encounter that <em>is</em> our feeling life. Like drive as the difference between desire in Freud’s psychic
                  economy, feeling moves always with an unanticipated trajectory. Or as Shelley writes
                  in “On Love,” “It is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive or fear
                  or hope beyond ourselves when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient
                  void and seek to awaken in all things that are a community with what we experience
                  within ourselves” (503). Love materializes this desire to have “another’s nerves .
                  . . vibrate to our own, . . . the beams of their eyes . . . kindle at once and melt
                  into our own” (503).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Here, however, the feeling mode that would transform the world is a “perpetual Orphic
                     song, / Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng / Of thoughts and forms, which else
                     senseless and shapes were” (415–17). In this “work [that] shall be called the Promethean”
                     (158), feeling is (necessarily) in constant flux, what Sha calls the “motion of emotion”:
                     “Break the dance, and scatter the song; / Let some depart and some remain” (159–60);
                     or, “Even whilst we speak / New notes arise . . . What is that awful sound?” (184–85).
                     In such gaps Ione hears “under-notes, / Clear, silver, icy, keen, awakening tones
                     / Which pierce the sense and live within the soul” (189–91), a labyrinthine reality—Earth’s
                     “multitudinous Orb” (253)—described at length (194–318). Yet we can recall that Daedalus,
                     who built the ground upon which Ariadne danced or the labyrinth into which Theseus
                     carried Ariadne’s golden thread so that he could slay the Minotaur and get back out,
                     also created wings for Icarus to fly to the sun, a story without a happy ending. Shelley’s
                     conceptualization of feeling as a labyrinthine matrix from which it is impossible
                     to extract ourselves because there is no “beyond” to this world, one in which feeling
                     traces Deleuzian lines of flight between things that are themselves in flight, is
                     haunted by the specter of fallen gods.

                              (13)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In his reading of The Triumph of Life, Washington, playing on Blanchot’s etymology
                              of disaster, meaning “fallen star,” very movingly expresses this notion in terms of
                              us, like Shelley, inhabiting the time of falling and fallen stars in which the only
                              possibility left is love.</span></div>
                     </div> The transfer of emotion that transpires within and sustains the poem’s environment
                     by Act Four, like that between Asia, Ione, and Panthea, materializes a circuitry in
                     which no one knows whose desire is whose.</p>
               </div>
               <p>That is as feeling should be, which carried even to its cosmic dimension produces
                  an endlessly generative movement between beings and things—or rather things <em>as </em>beings; or as the Moon says, illuminated by the light of an earth renovated by the
                  love between Prometheus and Asia, “Gazing on thee I feel, I know” (4.363). This loss
                  of identity is not a problem insofar as it signifies a kind of unrestrained communication
                  between people and things that is Shelley’s ideal of a world liberated from the Jupiterian
                  tyranny of words and looks, the uninhibited flow of a “wordless converse” that finds
                  Shelley inspired by the spirit of Godwin’s ideal of unrestrained conversation. Yet
                  Shelley’s description in “On Love,” and the Moon’s subsequent statement that “a lover
                  or chameleon / Grows like what it looks upon” (4.483–84), encrypts the possibility
                  of subjects at once formed and trapped in the mirror stage of their own constitution.
                  In this world of “A universal sound like words” (518), Demogorgon’s final speech rings
                  rather ominously. It speaks of “Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom and Endurance” as “spells
                  by which to reassume / An empire o’er the disentangled Doom” (562, 568–69). This is
                  to register the <em>entangled </em>labyrinth of feeling as the <em>only </em>spell we have, the drive of affect reflecting a mindless force that is our being without
                  Being. Here I am reminded of Khalip’s notion of the inhuman automaticity or relationality
                  between things. In this way the poem re-invokes the complex Lacanian circuit of desire
                  in which we only know our desire as that of the other, through which neither sides
                  owns desire but rather circulates in the non-space of transference between their subjectivities.
                  Put another way, in the “wordless converse” that is the exchange of feeling, we are
                  eternally left to find our own way. This is neither tragedy, nor comedy, nor farce,
                  but it does locate feeling itself as incompossible with any experience that is the
                  very situation it materializes and by which it is materialized.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this is where Shelley means to leave us. In Act One the Chorus of Spirits
                  sing, “Though Ruin now Love’s shadow be” (780), as if, like Benjamin’s Angel of History,
                  we proceed into the future, like Orpheus walking away from Eurydice, always by virtue
                  of the past disaster of a feeling incommensurate with itself. In <em>Queen Mab</em>, Shelley’s vision, torn between idealism and skepticism, is over-ambitiously cosmic,
                  as if (unintentionally, but inevitably) out of touch with the world it seeks to express
                  and thus reform. The empiricism of the poem’s labyrinthine footnotes threaten to deflate
                  the poem’s otherwise lofty visionary spirit, like Shelley’s warning in <em>A Defence of Poetry </em>(1821) that the world threatens to bury us with our knowledge. Certainly the political
                  dimension of Shelley’s verse, especially as he envisions its devastating progress
                  in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (1824), imagines an idealism without absolutes. In this sense, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is resolutely earthbound, though anything but terrestrial, for here Shelley envisions
                  nothing less than an ecology sustained by its own emotional life, a vitality of cosmic
                  expansiveness that marks the inextricable link between human and nonhuman sensoria.
                  We remain unable to grasp this broader feeling network because we exist in its midst
                  as both its products and generators. Feeling sustains the poem’s atmosphere as part
                  of a global emotional ecology. This ecology indicates not just the transfer between
                  subjects and the world, but the movement of affective transference that is literally
                  the air we breathe, the very mode and matrix of our existence. Subjects call the world
                  into emotional existence and this existence materializes their emotional lives—the
                  life <em>of </em>emotion—in turn. Joy, hope, happiness constitute the possible fulfillment of the poem’s
                  emotional life as something devoutly to be wished for but ruinously possible, an existence
                  in which, as Shelley concludes the poem, we must “love” and “bear” and “hope, till
                  Hope creates / From its own wreck the thing it contemplates” (573–74). Which is to
                  say that Shelley also seems aware that affect shatters the subject. Leo Bersani argues
                  that “Freud’s most profound originality . . . is to propose . . . that the sexualizing
                  of the ego is identical to the shattering of the ego” (66). In this catastrophe “affect
                  [is set] free from psychic organization; unbound affect produces the excitement of
                  <span class="foreign">jouissance</span>,” which at its most extreme is that of a “satisfied aggression [that] at once hyperbolizes
                  the ego and risks shattering its boundaries” (67). Put another way, only this catastrophe
                  of feeling—this feeling <em>of </em>catastrophe--reminds us we are alive. Shelley’s lyrical drama labours resolutely against
                  aggression. And yet, the poem’s <span class="foreign">jouissance </span>of unrestrained feeling works by a shattering or “scattering” that refuses to let
                  subjects settle—refuses subjects altogether except as they are conscripted into being
                  by the event of feeling itself. The truth of this event disrupts things as they are,
                  but means always tarrying with Jupiterian desire to know this meaning’s—this feeling’s—truth.</p>

               an “idealism without absolutes, rather than any kind of absolute materialism or idealism,”
               which is also to read the influence of German Idealism as “not only configured by
               materiality but also” as something that “itself reconstitutes the material: both ‘materiality’

               as invoking the “feel” of love, and to an unpublished essay on <em>The Triumph of Life </em>by Chris Washington that reads the poem as what I would call the triumph of, to borrow
               a word from Deleuze, an incompossible love: love <em>as </em>incompossible. Washington writes: “Shelley’s theory of love suggests not the egoistic
               chaos of a world lost to political anarchy but rather a radical politics of love that
               creates worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests new types of life, of
               living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world without us we could
               never have possibly anticipated because those worlds do not yet exist” (courtesy of

For Rajan, communication through the eyes bypasses language, yet offers an exchange
               equally complex. In Rajan’s deconstructive reading, affect, like language, functions
               (or threatens to function) logocentrically to close of its own complexity, whereas
               I might argue for a more Kristevan reading in which affect, like the semiotic, persistently
               disrupts any symbolic or representational system. That is to say, affect at once perpetuates
               the ocular transference of affect, but circumvents the coercive power of the gaze.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
