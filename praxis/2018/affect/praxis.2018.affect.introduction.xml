                <head>Introduction: Romanticism and Affect Studies</head>
                <p>This volume presents new work by scholars working at the intersection of British
                    Romanticism and affect studies. The past two decades have seen a growing
                    interest in the use of affect theory, cognitive science, phenomenology, and
                    neuroscience to reconceptualize theories of feeling and emotion in British
                    Romantic writing. This “affective turn” has renewed emphasis on emotion, which
                    experienced relative marginalization in new historicist scholarship throughout
                    the 1980s and 90s. Once dismissed as ideologically suspect, emotion has been put
                    to increasingly sophisticated use by literary critics, often in relation to
                    affect’s effects on the body and its relationship to emotion, cognition, and
                    action. Much more than a passing trend, affect studies has transformed the study
                    of emotion for a generation of scholars.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> One recent example
                        of affect studies’ far-reaching influence on a wide range of disciplines is
                        Palgrave’s massive <title level="m">Handbook on Affect Studies and Textual
                            Criticism</title>. See Wehrs and Blake, eds.</note></p>
                <p>While much of the foundational work in affect studies tends toward the
                    theoretical and scientific, an influential group of Romanticists has shaped the
                    field in relation to literature, culture, and history. In particular, scholars
                    such as Joel Faflak, Mary Favret, Steven Goldsmith, Thomas Pfau, Adela Pinch,
                    Alan Richardson, and Richard Sha have applied affect theory and cognitive
                    science to the study of Romantic texts, revising our understanding of the
                    emotions in relation to thought and action.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Favret;
                        Goldsmith; Pfau; Pinch; Richardson; and Sha and Faflak, eds.</note> This
                    unique exchange between Romanticism and affect studies has produced a body of
                    important scholarship that fruitfully crosses disciplinary boundaries. The
                    essays in this volume both capitalize on and extend this scholarship in new and
                    exciting ways, demonstrating the broad application and theorization of “affect”
                    in Romantic-era studies. Each essay takes a different approach to affect and
                    emotion, from a piece on Joanna Baillie’s passion plays, co-written by a
                    literary scholar and a cognitive psychologist, to a piece by Mark Lussier that
                    utilizes affect theory and rhythmic studies in a reading of William Blake’s
                        <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title> (1793). This volume
                    does not propose a single definition of “affect” or “emotion,” but all of the
                    essays share the conviction that the kind of interdisciplinary work demanded by
                    affect studies is beneficial to both Romantic studies <emph>and </emph>affect
                    studies.</p>
                <p>While “affect studies” refers to a broad range of scholarship rather than a
                    unified movement with a shared theoretical or methodological perspective, affect
                    theory has taken two general trajectories relevant to British Romanticism. The
                    first reflects interest in the writings of American psychologist Silvan Tomkins,
                    who argued for nine “primary affects” rooted in biology.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                        Tomkins.</note> Tomkins’s writings on emotion and affect from the 1960s have
                    inspired a range of studies on the physiological basis of affect, including work
                    by Eve Sedgwick and Patricia Clough, as well as research in affective
                        neuroscience.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Sedgwick; and Clough.</note> Scholars
                    in this group propound the Basic Emotions paradigm, which asserts that primary
                    affects operate on a different system than cognition. Primary
                        <emph>affects</emph> such as fear and joy are automatic responses to
                    external triggers, as opposed to <emph>emotions</emph> like love or hate, which
                    require memory, reflection, and awareness. </p>
                <p>This Basic Emotions paradigm presents perhaps the most contentious debate within
                    affect studies: cognitivist vs. anti-intentionalist arguments. Are we really in
                    control of our thoughts, actions, and responses to external stimuli? Or are we
                    pre-programmed, in a sense, feeling and responding <emph>before</emph> cognition
                    and volition? The Basic Emotions paradigm suggests the latter, and, in doing so,
                    brings up pressing questions about agency, ethics, and action. Theorists and
                    scientists continue research in these areas without consensus.<note place="foot" resp="editors"
                        > In general, there are four major theories of emotion in the cognitive
                        sciences that bear on affect theory in literary and cultural studies: (1)
                        James-Lang theory understands emotion as an interpretive result of autonomic
                        physiological response; (2) Cannon-Bard theory understands autonomic
                        response and emotion as occurring simultaneously; (3) Schachter and Singer’s
                        cognitive-arousal theory understands emotion as the result of both autonomic
                        response and cognitive attributions; and (4) Lazarus’ theory argues that
                        thought precedes emotion and physiological arousal. For a useful essay on
                        debates and findings within cognitive studies and neuroscience related to
                        affect and theories of emotion, see Hamann. For a recent neuroscientific
                        study that challenges the Basic Emotions paradigm, see Barrett.</note>
                    Meanwhile, scholars such as Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ruth Leys, and Richard Sha see
                    too much agreement among affect theorists. Why is it, Leys asks, that so many
                    affect theorists champion anti-intentionalism, while philosophers,
                    psychologists, and literary scholars gravitate toward a neglected cognitivism?
                    Barrett and Sha also worry about this anti-intentionalist strand, which
                    essentially argues for emotion and cognition as separate systems wherein
                    “concepts like the human, the subject, and agency” are left behind (Sha, “The
                    Turn to Affect” 260). Leys suggests that we need more social and cognitive
                    psychological research, and, significantly, that we also need to embrace
                    literary approaches to affect: one hesitation among affect theorists to abandon
                    the Basic Emotions paradigm is that “intentionalist interpretations of the
                    affects” require “thick descriptions of life experiences of the kind that are
                    familiar to anthropologists and novelists but are widely held to be inimical to
                    science” (Leys 471). This is the kind of affective-literary project taken up in
                    studies such as Joel Faflak and Richard Sha’s <title level="m">Romanticism and
                        the Emotions</title> (2014) and Lisa Ottum and Seth T. Reno’s <title
                        level="m">Wordsworth and the Green Romantics: Affect and Ecology in the
                        Nineteenth Century</title> (2016). It is also the approach modeled by the
                    essays in this volume.</p>
                <p>A literary approach to the affects, then, is much needed, and it reflects a
                    second trajectory in affect theory: renewed interest in philosopher Baruch
                    Spinoza, a figure familiar to Romanticists. Spinoza’s influential <title
                        level="m">Ethics</title> (1677) presented the affects as “confused ideas”
                    rooted in both mind and body, a concept that thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze,
                    Felix Guattari, and Brian Massumi have revisited and revised.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        See Deleuze and Guattari; and Massumi, <title level="m">Parables for the
                            Virtual</title>.</note> These “new affect theorists” tend toward the
                    philosophical and theoretical, though neuroscience also plays an important role
                    in their work. For example, in his seminal study <title level="m">Parables for
                        the Virtual</title> (2002), Massumi draws from both Spinoza and neuroscience
                    in his argument for the autonomy of affect. Several of the authors in this
                    volume take up Massumi’s ideas in diverse ways. </p>
                <p>Given Spinoza’s influence on Romantic-era writers and scientists, Massumi and the
                    new affect theorists have much to offer Romanticists. While scholars have long
                    studied Spinoza’s influence on the Romantics’ conceptions of nature, we have
                    only recently begun to examine his theories of affect and emotion. In <title
                        level="m">Ethics</title>, Spinoza defines the affects as “affections of the
                    Body by which the Body’s power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or
                    restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections. . . . affects
                    are confused ideas of <title level="m">the Mind and Body at once</title>” (493,
                    501; italics original). This dual process of corporeal and cognitive response
                    inspired the work of the new affect theorists. Much of the <title level="m"
                        >Ethics</title> involves outlining and explaining the various kinds of
                    affects and their effects on us, and many contemporary scholars locate the basis
                    of contemporary affect theory in Spinoza’s ideas. Through readings of Spinoza,
                    these scholars have opened up new possibilities for understanding Romantic
                    figurations of affect and emotion. For example, echoing Spinoza, Eric Shouse
                    describes affect as “a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from
                    one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or
                    diminution in that body’s capacity to act.” Massumi similarly defines affect as
                    a non-conscious “intensity” that the mind later “qualifies” as emotion (<title
                        level="m">Parables </title>28). An emotion is only “a very partial
                    expression of affect” that cannot “encompass all the depth and breadth” of our
                    experiences (Massumi, <title level="m">Politics</title> 5). For both scholars,
                    Spinoza’s theory of the affects is key, as it incorporates both cognition and
                    sensory stimulation. Many scholars thus distinguish affect from emotion:
                        <emph>affect</emph> is an innate biological response, or physiological
                    intensity, while <title level="m">emotion</title> involves awareness of affect
                    through memories, or narratives of accumulative experiences.</p>
                <p>For Shouse, Massumi, and others, Spinoza’s insights have great significance for
                    politics, especially when coupled with neuroscientific research. For instance,
                    Massumi argues that most political influence occurs at the level of
                    pre-linguistic and sub-personal affect, and not “ideology” as is commonly
                    assumed. Affect generates thoughts, feelings, and modes of knowing prior to
                    conscious awareness; we feel affect before we know it. According to Leys,
                    theorists in the Massumi camp believe that “political campaigns, advertising,
                    literature, visual images, and the mass media are all mechanisms for producing
                    such effects below the threshold of meaning and ideology” (451).<note
                        place="foot" resp="editors"> As Leys suggests, such a view extends to aesthetics as well:
                        if experience trumps content, the structures and intentional meanings of
                        artworks are of no consequence.</note> Affective intensities exceed
                    language, and thus transcend ideology. This kind of reading pushes Romantic
                    studies beyond the modes of ideology critique and hermeneutics of suspicion that
                    have dominated scholarship since the 1980s. However, other theorists have taken
                    a different approach to Spinoza and affect, treating “affect” as “neither a
                    solely biological phenomenon nor a solely ideological one” (Ottum and Reno 6).
                    Elsewhere, I have shown how affective neuroscience helps us to rethink
                    Wordsworth’s poetry, which is more scientific and ecological than many readers
                        acknowledge.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Reno.</note> Such an understanding of
                    affect helps to reconceptualize concepts such as nature and imagination. But of
                    course, affect is also political. Philosopher and affect theorist Martha
                    Nussbaum argues that we need to revive an emphasis on affect and emotion into
                    politics: justice, she argues, necessitates the cultivation of love and
                        compassion.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Nussbaum.</note> In many ways, this is a
                    return to Romantic-era poetry and politics, but the ground in shifting: rather
                    than ideology critique as the dominant methodology, affect studies offers a more
                    complex picture of the interacting forces of bodies, feelings, emotions,
                    language, and ideas that constitute cognition and subjectivity.</p>
                <p>The amorphous nature of affect, as well as affect studies’ still-evolving
                    trajectory, is precisely what makes it so ripe for exploration by scholars of
                    British Romanticism. Indeed, as the essays in this volume show, the study of
                    affect was incipient in the nineteenth century: following their
                    eighteenth-century forbearers, the Romantics were deeply interested in matters
                    such as the transmission and mediation of “sympathy.” In the first essay,
                    Soledad Caballero and Aimee Knupsky highlight connections between Joanna
                    Baillie’s “sympathetic curiosity” and recent work in cognitive psychology on
                    “emotion regulation.” These connections open up new readings of Baillie’s theory
                    of drama, as well as the particular work of <title level="m">De Monfort</title>
                    (1798), and they also inspire more scientific-affective research. This is the
                    kind of interdisciplinary work called for by affect studies: Caballero and
                    Knupsky use scientific research to study a literary text <emph>and</emph> use a
                    literary text to direct new scientific research. As they point out, Baillie’s
                    “Introductory Discourse” was influential and groundbreaking not only for its
                    contributions to dramatic theory but also for her use of Romantic-era science,
                    and so a cognitive approach to her work makes perfect sense. By highlighting the
                    relationship between De Monfort and Jane in the play, Caballero and Knupsky
                    re-envision investigations into social emotion regulation (SER) models.
                    Specifically, they explore moments in the play “that highlight both the
                    functioning and dysfunctioning of SER with an eye towards identifying those
                    areas that are not currently modeled within constrained empirical
                    investigations.” In their application and analysis of SER to <title level="m">De
                        Monfort</title>, with a particular emphasis on hatred, they show how affect
                    is both biological and cultural, a process that operates within, as well as
                    among, individual feeling subjects. Cognitive psychology suggests that affective
                    and cognitive processes occur simultaneously in an intricate and sophisticated
                    manner, which both challenges the conclusions of Massumi and pushes beyond the
                    Basic Emotions paradigm.</p>
                <p>In the second essay, Renee Harris also draws from the cognitive humanities in a
                    rereading of John Keats’s <title level="m">Isabella</title> (1818). While
                    scholars have traditionally read the poem’s digressions as evidence of Keats’s
                    youthful and immature poetic style, Harris argues that this critique doesn’t
                    hold up when we consider the digressions in light of nineteenth-century reading
                    practices: though the kinds of “passive” or “immersive” reading that Keats
                    practices were disparaged by Wordsworth and other high arbiters of literary
                    taste, a counter-tradition reveals the cultural work of such reading, which
                    modern cognitive psychology helps to illuminate. Keats breaks down the
                    structural norms of the text and calls attention to the reading experience
                    itself. In doing so, he “unveils the invisible cognitive mechanisms that allow
                    for absorption in the narrative,” fostering psychic development and intellectual
                    growth in the reader. Harris links this practice to Keats’s concept of the
                    “material sublime,” which he adopts and adapts from Coleridge. In poems like
                    “Kubla Khan” (1797) and “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” (1798), Coleridge
                    models an immersive, affective reading that moves between fiction and reality in
                    ways analogous to what cognitive scientists call Theory of Mind. Both poets,
                    then, reveal an interest in the regulation and circulation of affect within the
                    literary text, and they do so in an eerie manner, through narratives of ghosts,
                    nightmares, deaths, dreams, and sleepwalking, all Gothic elements that figure
                    the immersive reading experience “in which the reader is absorbed, lost in the
                    automaticity of the affect”—not absorbed forever, but rather awakening to a more
                    enlightened state.</p>
                <p>Moving from canonical figures to a lesser-known author, Jonas Cope’s essay
                    focuses on Eliza Fenwick, whose understudied gothic novel <title level="m"
                        >Secresy</title> (1795) shows unparalleled dramatization of the
                    impersonality of emotion as compared to other novels of the same period. What’s
                    more, the novel illustrates several core tenets of contemporary affect theory in
                    surprising ways—surprising, I say, given its relative obscurity amongst most
                    readers and scholars. In contrast to existing scholarship that situates
                    characters in the novel as specific “types” isolated from one another, Cope’s
                    affective approach shows how their bodies interact in intimate, non-cognitive
                    ways, in the shared space of affect. Cope also intervenes in affect studies by
                    arguing that <title level="m">Secresy</title> “illuminates the more recent,
                    physiological-theoretical work in affect theory” espoused by Massumi “as much as
                    that work illuminates” the benefits of the literary-historical strand of affect
                    studies—that is, how characters interact in the novel. Cope thus advances
                    existing scholarship on the novel to show how affect theory can contribute to
                    the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers.</p>
                <p>In the fourth essay, Mark Lussier draws from both affect theory and rhythmic
                    studies to shed new light on what is arguably William Blake’s greatest and most
                    complex work: <title level="m">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</title>. In an
                    essay dazzling in its theoretical breadth and critical understanding of Blake,
                    Lussier uses his unique critical lens to make sense of Blake’s continuing
                    influence on and engagement with each new age (Blake, as Lussier points out, is
                    cited more than any other Romantic poet in popular culture), weaving together
                    the poem’s reception history, scholarly history, and his own personal
                    relationship with the poem, from his Master’s thesis to the present project.
                    This is perhaps what is most novel about the essay: while affect studies tends
                    to take an almost detached approach to the emotions—treating them historically,
                    theoretically, or scientifically—Lussier takes a personal approach, for what is
                    more personal than our emotions and our bodies? Indeed, Lussier reads <title
                        level="m">Marriage </title>as a textual body itself, one that transmits
                    affects to its reader through its structure and rhythm, a process of “affect
                    contagion.” Blake’s material text embodies affective intensities that work on
                    the reader prior to cognition. The text is an “affect-generating machine” that
                    continues indefinitely as it is a body that cannot die. Yet, as Lussier makes
                    clear, <title level="m">Marriage</title> cannot represent affect but only trace
                    affect through poetic form: affect remains outside of conscious thought. But the
                    movement and rhythm of the work unveils the presence of affect at work.</p>
                <p>In the final essay, Joel Faflak rereads Shelley’s <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> (1820) as the poet’s ultimate statement on the global and
                    cosmic intersections of affect, emotion, and feeling. By drawing from a range of
                    recent work in affect theory, Faflak presents a masterful close reading of
                    Shelley’s lyrical drama wherein emotion is “the event” (via Badiou) that
                    “materializ[es] subjects <emph>as</emph> subjects.” The movement of the drama is
                    the movement of emotion itself, the transmission of affect that constitutes “a
                    world moving both within and beyond its own boundaries.” In a kind of affective
                    feedback loop, subjects “call the world into emotional existence,” and that
                    existence in turn materializes the emotional lives of the subjects. In <title
                        level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title>, Shelley images this complex matrix,
                    this “broader feeling network” that we are unable to grasp fully because we
                    exist in its midst. By reading affect theory through Shelley and Shelley through
                    affect theory, Faflak offers a new understanding of <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> as more material and much less idealized. Importantly, the
                    essay helps to illuminate key concepts and arguments in affect studies as much
                    as it illuminates Shelley’s poem.</p>
                <p>We still have much to learn about affect and emotion, and, as the essays in this
                    volume make clear, Romantic literature continues to offer significant sites for
                    such critical inquiry. In sum, these essays offer a representative example of
                    how affect studies has transformed the study of Romanticism, and how
                    Romanticists continue to shape the trajectory of affect studies. They also
                    represent the future of Romantic scholarship: Caballero and Knupsky’s essay on
                    Baillie is part their ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration and publication
                    program on the intersections of Romantic literature and cognitive psychology;
                    Harris’s essay on Keats stems from her award-winning dissertation, which will
                    likely appear as a monograph in the near future; Cope’s piece on Fenwick speaks
                    to the ongoing recovery of neglected women writers of the Romantic period;
                    Lussier’s essay on Blake is one in a cluster of essays just published or
                    forthcoming on Blake, affect, and rhythmic studies; and Faflak’s piece on
                    Shelley is one of two forthcoming essays on <title level="m">Prometheus
                        Unbound</title> emerging from his influential work in affect studies. This
                    kind of work will prove increasingly important in a world where emotion is
                    growing in critical and popular appeal. As we continue to reimagine Romanticism
                    during this renaissance of emotion facilitated by the affective turn, the
                    Romantics will continue to teach us how to feel, and we can teach others how to
                    love and make sense of that feeling.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Portions of this essay
