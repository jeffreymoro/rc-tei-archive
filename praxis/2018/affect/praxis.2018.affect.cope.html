            <p class="noCount">This essay argues that recent criticism in affect theory emphasizing the “strictly
               biological portion of emotion” offers a new interpretive window into a much-neglected
               Gothic novel by an important though still relatively unknown writer. Its major claim
               is that <em>Secresy</em>’s emphasis on bodiliness, the extent to which characters share and absorb the same
               affective environment, undercuts important critical accounts of the novel—by Terry
               Castle, Patricia Cove, Julia Wright, and others—which claim that each of its characters
               occupies his or her own inalienable rhetorical or “generic” world to which the other
               characters have little or no access.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">“<em>[H]is mind was … my disease</em>”: Viral Affect in Eliza Fenwick’s <em>Secresy; or, The Ruin on the Rock</em></span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In the final volume of Eliza Fenwick’s 1795 novel <em>Secresy; or, The Ruin on the Rock</em>, Clement Montgomery, a ne’er-do-well dandy who has left his lover Sibella Valmont
               in the lurch, offers one morning to sell a miniature portrait of her (whose original
               he painted) to one of her richer, more genteel suitors, the Lord Filmar. Filmar “positively
               refuse[s] to accept” the gift, thanks to a “double dose of prudence” on his part.
               (At this point in the novel, Filmar has recently broken into Valmont Castle in a botched
               attempt to kidnap Sibella, an heiress expecting £6,000 a year. To keep the miniature
               on his person would therefore be to possess incriminating evidence.) Yet the lord
               recounts that, even as he “positively refuse[s]” it, his “fingers had a kind of tremulous
               impulse towards the picture” (Fenwick 299). By <em>impulse </em>Filmar means a “[s]udden or involuntary inclination or tendency to act, without premeditation
               or reflection” (“impulse”). In itself his comment is probably unremarkable: Filmar
               simply notices his lordly fingers trembling toward the portrait of a woman he knows
               little about save that she has a fortune and he wants it. But considered in the context
               of the entire novel, this tiny incident gains special significance.</p>
            <p>Characters in <em>Secresy </em>tend to be affected non-cognitively by intensities emanating from nearby objects and
               bodies. Caroline Ashburn, for instance, denied entrance to Valmont Castle, secures
               the permission of its proprietor, the honorable George Valmont, to correspond with
               his niece Sibella whom Valmont keeps secluded within his estate. Caroline rightly
               predicts, albeit ironically, that “the spirit of . . . affection breathed” into her
               letters will ultimately “waft down” the “drawbridges” of the castle and “disenchant
               . . . [Sibella] from the all-powerful spell” of her uncle’s “authority” (Fenwick 39).
               Lord Filmar declares that a “square piece of paper” on which he has written, “in large
               characters £6000 <span class="foreign">per annum</span>, placed . . . exactly opposite” him, will act as “a charm of infinite value” to goad
               him into his kidnapping scheme (216). In one of her letters to Caroline, Sibella insists
               that if the truant Clement would write her a note with “only three words, ‘<em>Bless my Sibella</em>;’ . . . [she] will wear it next . . . [to her] heart—a charm to hold disease and
               foreboding at defiance” (256–57). These apparently trivial statements about “charming”
               letters, notes, and pictures form part of a larger pattern in the novel whereby the
               sensibilities of characters are directed (or described as if they are directed) by
               the intensities enfolded in and emanating from material bodies and objects. The physical
               signs of feeling—tears, sighs, faintness—and hence the psychological states they presumably
               indicate are effectively “caught” from physical phenomena in shared spaces. The men
               and women in <em>Secresy</em> are thus little more than bodies adrift in an atmosphere full of viral affect. It
               is, of course, nothing new to say that a novel published in the 1790s denies its characters
               the full privileges of the autonomous Enlightenment subject. But <em>Secresy </em>dramatizes the impersonality of emotion in ways and to extents arguably unparalleled
               among novels of its time. One could say that it is a text tailor-made for the application
               of affect theory.</p>
            <p><em>Secresy </em>is a relatively slim, three-volume epistolary novel with a somewhat convoluted plot.
               The tyrannical gentleman George Valmont is scorned by a lady at an early age and grows
               to resent the prerogatives of high society. He raises his niece Sibella as his daughter
               and his illegitimate son Clement as the adopted son of poor laborers. Valmont secludes
               the two on his estate for nearly all their lives, insists that they think of one another
               as brother and sister, sees to their education, and exacts unflinching obedience from
               both. All the while, his real intention is to unite them in marriage. Sibella possesses
               an independent fortune and is the rightful heir to Valmont estate (though her uncle
               leads her to believe she is penniless). Valmont keeps her docile and tractable so
               that she will stay at home and fall in love with Clement, his natural son, thus securing
               for Clement both the estate and the independent fortune of its heiress—a veritable
               “economic powerhouse” (Cannon 543). Unfortunately for Valmont, all goes awry. Sibella
               and Clement fall in love prematurely and consummate their relationship in secret,
               out of wedlock (after which point Sibella fondly considers Clement her “husband”).
               Valmont, ignorant of the consummation, sends his nineteen-year-old son Clement out
               into the world as a kind of test to ensure that he is sufficiently misanthropic. But
               Clement becomes a dissipated rake, enamored with the very high society that Valmont
               intended he should hold in contempt. Angered, Valmont gives Clement £500 and tells
               him to earn his living in London. Since Clement has developed an aversion to work
               and a love of gambling, he squanders the money and ends up marrying Caroline Ashburn’s
               wealthy, materialistic, and pretentious mother (disregarding his unofficial “marriage”
               to Sibella). Meanwhile, after Valmont rejects the proposed aristocratic marriage of
               his niece to Lord Filmar, the latter decides to kidnap Sibella “whether her uncle
               pleases or not” (Fenwick 183). His first kidnapping attempt is thwarted by the presence
               of Arthur Murden, a gentleman sneaking about the castle disguised as a hermit. Murden,
               professedly in love with Sibella for reasons other than her money, manages to rescue
               her from Valmont castle only to lose her to Filmar at a nearby inn. Having absconded
               with the rescued heiress, Filmar soon realizes that she is pregnant with Clement’s
               child and therefore wants nothing to do with her. He returns her to her friend Caroline.
               Murden eventually dies in Sibella’s arms. Sibella gives birth to a stillborn child
               and dies herself shortly thereafter.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Though having gone through four editions and received generally favorable reviews
                  in its time, the novel was more or less relegated to the shadows of literary history
                  until it became a Broadview Press book in 1994 edited by Isobel Grundy. Since then
                  a wide range of articles and book chapters have been devoted to it, though the novel
                  remains understudied and relatively unknown. Critics have studied <em>Secresy </em>as a gothic, Jacobin, and/or radically feminist novel concerned variously with female
                  education, motherhood and childbirth, marriage laws, British India, female desire
                  and sexuality, madness, and contemporary medicine.

                  </div> I am primarily interested in a strain of criticism that views its characters as rhetorically
                  or psychologically hyper-compartmentalized. Julia Wright has claimed that each major
                  character in the novel is locked in her own fictional genre and given an inflexible
                  “perspective . . . coded as literary” (Wright 154). Caroline Ashburn, for instance,
                  speaks in the general rhetorical mode of didactic fiction. She “cannot understand”
                  the intense passions of someone like Arthur Murden (who is the quintessential man
                  of feeling), and so she claims that he is excessively “romantic” in the Johnsonian
                  senses of “wild,” “false,” “fanciful” (Wright 153; Johnson 440). According to Wright,
                  “no one voice” in the text “stands above the rest, secure from critique, contradiction,
                  or generic classification” (154). The “various genres” in <em>Secresy</em> “do not mingle, but collide to mark separations in cultural perspectives” (153). Patricia
                  Cove likewise claims that the sensibilities of main characters are discrete and incapable
                  of inter-assimilation. Murden is “Fenwick’s victim of excessive sensibility” and the
                  “object of Caroline’s rational critique of sensibility” (Cove 667). Each character
                  “adhere[s] to opposite value systems” that cannot interpenetrate (678). For Terry
                  Castle, none of this should surprise us: early female fiction was full of examples
                  of “psychic compartmentalization,” the “splitting up of emotional possibilities into
                  different characters,” a sort of “schizoid reductionism” (Castle 140). Thus Wright,
                  Cove, and Castle all agree that characters in <em>Secresy</em> are more or less hermetically sealed Theophrastan types who live in isolated emotional
                  and rhetorical worlds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I want to suggest that this line of thinking, though reasonable, ignores the novel’s
                  emphasis on bodiliness and how its characters share and absorb the same affective
                  environment—despite what some critics have called the characters’ impermeable “generic”
                  differences. The men and women represented in <em>Secrecy</em> are bodies that share spaces with other bodies and act as if according to the causal
                  properties circulating in those spaces. These causal properties move in and out of
                  mental and physical domains. Jonathan Kramnick has observed that eighteenth-century
                  philosophers and literary writers were preoccupied with the possibility that material
                  objects could cause human actions just as much as mental phenomena (like intentions)
                  could. Perhaps “mental states . . . ultimately make their way to the social and physical
                  environment” (6) until that environment absorbs the causal properties of the mental
                  states—until, in other words, “material entities” acquire “some sort of consciousness,”
                  enabling them to have an equal role in determining human behavior (10). Not that the
                  causal properties of objects need to come strictly or directly from human minds and
                  vice versa. Both objects and minds are subject to a shared environment. As Kevis Goodman
                  has more recently argued, late eighteenth-century Scottish medical writing suggested
                  that the “custom, memory, imagination, and discourse” of a given culture clung to
                  bodies within that culture—became “archived” in them (352)—so that bodies “became
                  . . . historical event[s],” “malleable site[s] structured by past and present history”
                  (353). To read <em>Secresy</em> in light of these ideas is to emphasize the extent to which the centered subject was
                  presumed dead long before poststructuralist theory insisted that it was dead.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> It is to see how the novel inherited and inflected certain ideologies operative in
                  the eighteenth century that ran against that century’s more familiar emphasis on “inwardness
                  or subjectivity” (Kramnick 2).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Most of us are familiar with what is now called the “affective turn” in literary studies.
               In their 2014 collection of essays, <em>Romanticism and the Emotions</em>, Joel Faflak and Richard C. Sha observe that “a renewed interest in the emotions
               is transforming how we view history, culture, and science” (1). Though affect is closely
               related to emotion, the two are not one and the same. Affect refers to the “vital”
               or “visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally <em>other than </em>conscious knowing” that “drive us toward movement . . . thought and extension.” These
               forces operate at the level of “miniscule or molecular events,” traveling “into and
               out of the inorganic and non-living, the intracellular divulgences of sinew, tissue,
               and gut economies, and the vaporous evanescences of the incorporeal (events, atmospheres,
               feeling-tones)” (Gregg and Seigworth 1–2). Brian Massumi has popularized the term
               “intensities” within affect studies to refer to forces that are “irreducibly bodily
               and autonomic,” “asocial,” the stuff of “incipient action and expression” existing
               in the “superlinear, super-abstract realm of potential” (28, 20, 31). That is, affect
               is altogether beyond “linear” accounts of mental processes—accounts resembling narratives
               and relying on notions of cause and effect—as well as beyond the “abstract” emotional
               states we claim to experience as a result of what is consciously happening around
               us: for Massumi, when we “register” an emotional “state” we are really “re-register[ing]
               an already felt state” that is purely bodily and non-conscious (25). Emotions are
               second-order affect.</p>
            <p>A general consensus among scholars of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature
               and culture is that although “[t]he romantic period and the era that precedes it often
               appear to us as eras in which people increasingly learned to claim their emotions
               as the guarantors of their individuality,” these periods simultaneously “characterize[d]
               feelings as transpersonal,” as “wander[ing] extravagantly from one person to another”
               like “viruses” (Pinch 3, 1). All supposedly private, indwelling emotions were often
               thought to originate, even at the turn of the nineteenth century, in shared affective
               atmospheres, “unformed and unstructured” “resonances independent of content or meaning”
               (Shouse par. 5, par. 14). And it is precisely because these “resonances” have neither
               form nor content that they can be transmitted between bodies and subsequently interpreted
               as the meaningful psychological states we recognize as personal feelings. Hence, I
               cannot feel precisely what it is you feel—the mental content of your feeling. But
               both my body and yours interact dynamically within the same affective field, within
               what Thomas Pfau has called “mood,” which he defines as the “horizon wherein all conscious
               practice . . . is being transacted, a horizon that therefore can never come into view
               as such.” This horizon or mood “operate[s] at a level logically anterior to the business
               of discrete reference, object-representation, and analytic, discrete knowledge” (Pfau
               10, 12). In a word, affect comprises the infinitesimal and infinite points of contact
               between organic and inorganic entities within a shared environment. The work of Pinch
               and Pfau tends more toward the literary and the historical, whereas critics of the
               Massumi and Tomkins schools have emphasized the scientific and the theoretical sides
               of affect—what Donald L. Nathanson has called “the strictly biological portion of
               emotion”—in such a way as to develop the older, more literary-historical scholarship.
               One of the main contentions of this essay is that <em>Secresy </em>illuminates the more recent, physiological-theoretical work in affect theory as much
               as that work illuminates how characters interact in the novel.</p>
            <p><em>Secresy </em>positions its characters as semi-autonomous bodies that catch, enfold, and circulate
               affective intensities in shared social spaces. This process is repeatedly described
               in terms of contagion. Clement, for instance, is mortified when Sibella learns—without
               his actually having told her—that he must earn his bread in London: “she sees misery
               in my looks. She hears it in my sighs, and the contagion has reached her” (Fenwick
               126). Caroline suspects, as it happens, that Sibella should worry less about Clement’s
               miseries than about the temptations he will face in London, “amidst allurements such
               as virtue had seldom rejected, had seldom turned from without contamination” (60).
               Usually viewing all other characters from a conspicuous moral high ground, Caroline
               also fears that young English girls like the Davenport sisters are too easily “infected”
               with patriarchal “maxim[s],” such as that female “weakness and defect” are primarily
               responsible for sexual incontinence (165). The ever class-conscious George Valmont
               is afraid to leave his estate lest he expose his “high-born” body to the “contaminating
               mixture” of the middle classes (62). News, vice, maxims, class: all such abstractions
               in <em>Secresy</em> are described in terms of communicable diseases.</p>
            <p>The presence of affect in <em>Secresy</em> becomes clearer as it continues to dramatize “the way the sensual world greets the
               sensate body,” the “affective forces … generated in such meetings” (Highmore 121).
               At one point in the novel, Caroline, Murden, and a company of aristocrats decide to
               take a “<em>rural </em>expedition” to a spot where they can fish, eat ices, and listen to costly music (Fenwick
               82). Caroline and Murden are riding along a rural road when <span class="quote">‘a pretty country girl on a horse loaded with paniers drew up to the hedge-side, while
                  the cavalcade passed her. I was in Mr. Murden’s phaeton; and we were the last carriage
                  but one. The girl, in making her awkward obeisance to the company, no sooner lifted
                  her eyes to Mr. Murden, than she blushed deeper than scarlet. It was a blush of such
                  deep shame, of such anguish, that I felt a sudden pain like a shock of electricity.
                  (83–84)’</span> Murden is shocked too, although he has more reason to be than Caroline, since he
               actually knows the girl and turns out, as we discover later in the novel, to be her
               protector. Caroline, for her part, is simply struck with a “sudden pain like a shock
               of electricity” for no demonstrable reason. On another occasion the young Henry Davenport,
               penniless but “related to several noble families,” pledges to marry Caroline’s mother,
               Mrs. Ashburn, in a misguided effort to provide for his impoverished, ostracized, consumptive
               childhood sweetheart Arabella and their illegitimate infant (143). Caroline requests
               one hour of conversation with Henry in order to talk him out of his foolish decision.
               She eventually settles the business by providing Davenport with a yearly income (until
               he can earn enough on his own) and an opportunity to study medicine, thanks to the
               kindness and connections of the well-to-do Murden. But at their first meeting, an
               “unusual softness” in Davenport’s voice, the “hectic colour” of his cheek and his
               melodramatic bodily attitude insinuate their way into Caroline’s otherwise unforgiving
               view of maudlin behavior: <span class="quote">‘He rose; and walked towards the widow. “Love is a romance; a cant; a whine; a delirium;
                  a poison; a rankling wound that festers here, here!” he layed [sic] his hand on his
                  heart, and leaned against the wainscot. . . . I sighed too: for the under tone of
                  voice in which he pronounced the last few words was in[de]scribably affecting. (143–45)’</span> Not his embittered sentiments about love, but the “under tone of voice in which he
               pronounce[s]” them is “in[de]scribably affecting” to Caroline, so that she has no
               choice but to “sig[h] too.” Thus even a woman who spends most of the novel morally
               critiquing the passions of others can be electrocuted by a blush, or induced to mirror
               one sigh with another. Caroline seems more affected in this case by the soft voice,
               flushed cheek, and leaning, melancholy body of Davenport than by the actual story
               of his misfortune that he subsequently relates. Her body enfolds affective intensities
               into itself in and through an environment shared with Clement. Something similar,
               though perhaps a bit stranger, happens between Sibella and her uncle Valmont. On one
               cold, windy day Sibella is alone in the woods near Valmont Castle, when a <span class="quote">‘chill, oppressive gripe seemed to fasten on my heart.—My uncle happened to pass in
                  from the park.—He spoke, but I could not reply. I waved my hand, which he took in
                  his; but, while he pressed it, he reproved me in an ungentle manner, for sitting on
                  the damp stone, and exposed to the raw air.—Tears <em>unbidden and almost unexcited</em>, roll down my cheeks. He called Andrew; and I was borne in, and laid on a sopha in
                  the breakfast parlour. (250–51, emphasis mine)’</span> I find it interesting that Sibella’s description of the “chill, oppressive gripe”
               upon her “heart” precedes her description of Valmont’s entrance: effect precedes cause.
               Were the sentences reversed, or were the dash replaced with a colon, the statements
               might make more logical sense. But the body here seems to have anticipated or “intuited”
               the object of fear before the mind knew what was happening. I suppose one could argue
               that Sibella’s letter is just creating suspense: i.e., “Fear no sooner gripped my
               heart than—behold!—my uncle entered the scene.” But the dash between the sentences
               enables us to read the physiological response to Valmont’s presence as instantaneous,
               instinctual, irrelevant to whether or not Sibella actually sees or hears her uncle
               approaching. More striking, however, is the fact that as Sibella writes the above
               passage in a letter to Caroline, her tears begin to flow “unbidden and almost unexcited.”
               Grundy interprets the word “unexcited” to mean “[u]nprovoked” (250). The <em>OED </em>defines “unexcited” similarly as “[n]ot mentally stirred or moved” (“unexcited”).
               In this case, one could say that Sibella is calmly writing in her room and cries when
               she remembers the touch of her uncle’s hand, his “ungentle” reproof, his removal of
               her from her beloved wood into the gloomy breakfast parlor. And yet she describes
               her tears as “unbidden and almost unexcited.” They surface in the present moment,
               as she is writing her letter, but seem alienated from the memory presumed to evoke
               them. Their origin is strangely displaced or obscured. This is not to say that there
               are no alternative, sensible explanations for her reported weeping: Clement is gone
               at this point and Sibella is pregnant and forced to keep the secret from her tyrannical
               uncle. But she describes her tears less as the signifiers of an internal signified
               (a definable feeling with a clear “origin” or stimulus) and more as the product of
               unknown, mysterious forces.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the presence and operation of affect in <em>Secresy</em> is most pronounced, palpable, and manifest in spaces shared by three members of a
               central love-triangle: Caroline, Sibella, and Murden. Early in volume one, a frantic
               Bengali mother sells everything she owns and travels to London to be reunited with
               her son, who used to work for the nabob Sir Thomas Marlowe (a friend of Mrs. Ashburn
               and, it follows, her daughter Caroline). Unfortunately, the mother arrives in London
               only to learn that her son is absent. Upon hearing the news, she “falls ill of an
               ague and fever,” “languish[ing] in the extreme of misery and disease” for eight weeks.
               She then visits the country seat of Sir Thomas at Barlowe Hall, where he, Caroline,
               and all their mutual friends are present. Her emotions are so “wild and extravagant”
               when she arrives that Caroline “wonder[s] that her intellects survived.” The other
               guests at Barlowe Hall “expres[s] their disgust at so miserable an object” (Fenwick
               85). The Indian woman “wrought a passionate flood of tears,” “wrung her hands, gnashed
               her teeth,” and “tore her hair” (86). Caroline compares her both to a corpse and an
               infant. Sir Thomas “saw himself in the utmost danger, and half his family dead or
               dying of the mortal disease” (which he seems to suspect is malaria) (87). Arthur Murden,
               who is Sir Thomas’s nephew, is the only gentleman willing to offer the woman any assistance.
               He accompanies her chaise in the rain to the next village and sees her to bed. Murden
               returns to Barlowe Hall “pale with fatigue, and want of food; his linen soiled; and
               his hair disordered” (88). Sir Thomas suspects that the Indian woman has infected
               him with something. Caroline notes that “[a]s Murden shut one door”—retiring from
               the drawing room—“a servant opened another,” bearing a letter to her from Sibella
               (89). The letter, as it turns out, places Murden in another infectious position. It
               excites such a “pleasurable glow of feeling,” such “visible pleasure” in Caroline
               that she is obliged to read it aloud that evening to her audience—which once again
               includes Murden—and to describe the person of Sibella in anatomical detail (90, 91).
               Murden freezes as she reads. He refuses to eat, which makes Sir Thomas suspect that
               “nothing but <em>the fever</em>” has seized him (96). That evening Murden whispers to Caroline: “My mind is my disease.”
               Caroline, in turn, observes that “<em>his mind was </em>also <em>my disease</em>” (96).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What I find interesting is that by this point the novel has effectively blurred the
                  distinction between physical and mental infection. The Bengali woman is thought to
                  have infected Murden with malaria or hysteria or both. This happens just as Murden
                  is introduced to the character of Sibella, whose letter to Caroline “disease[s]” his
                  “mind.” And no sooner is <em>he </em>diseased than he passes his disorder on to Caroline. What does she mean when she claims
                  that “<em>his mind was </em>also <em>my disease</em>?” Is she is struck with some fatal curiosity about Murden thanks to his charming,
                  good-natured madness? Is it a case of love at first sight? It does turn out—much,
                  I would say, to the surprise of most readers of this novel—that Caroline develops
                  strong feelings for him. One is tempted to conclude, the more one learns about the
                  universe of <em>Secresy</em>, that she “catches” the stuff of these feelings at this precise point; that her desire
                  for Murden is no more than a form or reflex of his own desire for Sibella: the affective
                  intensities having been encountered, enfolded, and subsequently privatized.

                  </div> Grundy observes that Fenwick uses “three different lengths of dash: short, to replace
                  or reinforce a period . . . medium, to indicate material absent from the text . .
                  . and very long for the inarticulacy of intense emotion” (Grundy 36). Sibella, who
                  at various points in the novel is called “unformed,” “half insane,” “queer,” “deranged”
                  and a “lovely lunatic,” admits that she is subject to “emotions . . . which [she]
                  cannot describe or explain” (Fenwick 55, 92, 207, 229, 175). Her first letter to Caroline—the
                  one that enthralled Murden—is filled with Grundy’s “very long” dashes, signifying
                  a “heart expand[ing] with swelling emotion” (41). It is telling that the recorded
                  speech of Murden never includes a long dash until he encounters Sibella for the first
                  time in the wood near Valmont Castle. After that his prose is full of them. Sibella
                  writes to Caroline of the encounter that 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                  enigmatic. Both the letters that he himself writes and the letters that others write
                  about him punctuate his speech with long dashes. In one of his subsequent letters
                  to Caroline, for instance, he replaces the unutterable name of Sibella with a long
                  dash: “neither prudence, honour, friendship, nor aught else could stay me in my course—not
                  even the heavenly ——.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Murden does not run into Sibella accidentally on her uncle’s property. He had already
               formed and executed a plan to cloister himself within the ruins of an old monastery
               near Valmont Castle so as to be close to Sibella during her nocturnal walks. He surprises
               her twice in the guise of a hermit and then communicates with her as a celestial spirit,
               all the while exacerbating his “disease.” It reaches its height at the end of volume
               one, when Murden discovers that Sibella has consummated her relationship with Clement.
               When Sir Thomas arranges a “numerous and brilliant party” in the Assembly Rooms at
               Bath, all the alarmed guests witness Murden “rush[ing]” into the ballroom “distorted
               with some species of passion, his hair deranged, and the powder showered on his dress
               as if he had been dashing his head against some hard substance in a paroxysm of rage.”
               He groans, curses, flushes, and pales by turns, “gnash[es] his teeth,” “snatch[es]
               a crumpled letter from his pocket” only to “tea[r] it into a thousand pieces” and
               “das[h] the fragments on the floor,” stares at everyone “malignant[ly], “carefully
               gather[s] up every fragment” of paper and then “dart[s] out of the room.” Sir Thomas
               presumes he is “mad” and “infect[ed]” (151–52). The symptoms of his emotional breakdown—down
               to the very gnashing of teeth—mirror those of the Bengali woman who fell into extravagant
               fits upon her arrival in London. Caroline is the person who reports this wild incident
               in the second letter of the second volume of the novel. It turns out that the “crumpled
               letter” that Murden dramatically tears to pieces is a “billet” written by Sibella
               to Clement, which Clement enclosed in his own letter to Murden at the end of volume
               one. In that “billet” Sibella invites Clement to her apartment, where with “pure hearts
               and hands, we will plight our fervent unspotted faith. Say I am your’s [sic], and
               you are mine, and sorrow and jealousy will vanish as a mist. You shall go the transported
               confiding husband” (131). Murden seems to realize in the ballroom at Bath that he
               has spent more time “stalk[ing],” “prying,” and “watching” Sibella than actually courting
               her in any remotely appropriate fashion. He has spent his time prowling about the
               ruins in Valmont estate and accosting Sibella in outlandish disguises. Perhaps he
               was foolishly convinced, as he writes in one of his now dash-heavy letters to Caroline,
               that Sibella was preserving herself as the “reward of a deserving ventrous [sic] hero
               like myself——Oh! I have embraced a cloud, and the tormenting wheel rolls round with
               a rapid motion!” (133).</p>
            <p>Both Murden and Sibella are gradually destroyed by a toxic interexchange of affect.
               From the point of his first meeting with the “lunatic” Sibella, Murden himself becomes
               “lunatic-like” (229, 160). He calls himself Sibella’s “shadow,” who “sigh[s] to her
               sigh” (269). Eventually her body wastes away as she broods on the unfaithfulness of
               her ex-lover Clement, and the body of Murden follows suit. In fact, the more physical
               contact the two have, the more they seem to become somatic equals. When Murden and
               his friend Richardson steal into Sibella’s private chamber in Valmont Castle in order
               to rescue her, Murden can barely stand: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <p class="noCount">She opened the door. She came out to us. – “Ah! what, what is the matter?” cried she,
                  extending her arms as if to save me from falling. . . . I recoiled <em>from her</em> . . . and, as I leaned on Richardson’s shoulder, I closed my dim eyes, and wished
                  they might never more open upon recollection.</p> 
               <p class="noCount">“Shame!” whispered Richardson, “you are unmanned!”</p> 
               <p class="noCount">And so I am, Miss Ashburn. . . . I feel a rankling glow of satisfaction, as she walks
                  past my chair, that I have so placed it [that] I cannot look up and behold her. (322)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> After her rescuers arrive, Sibella expresses her gratitude and her continued unrequited
               affection for Clement. At this point, the merger of her own body with Murden’s seems
               to crystalize: “[a]s she spoke,” Murden writes, “I turned my eyes from her now haggard
               and jaundiced face to my own, reflected in the mirror by which I was standing. ‘Moving
               corpses!’ said I to myself—‘Why encumber ye the fair earth?’” (322). In the next few
               paragraphs, Murden scores his own and Sibella’s speech with long dashes.</p>
            <p>The act of sympathetic exchange in <em>Secresy </em>is indeed more of a death sentence than an opportunity for benevolent action, than—according
               to an eighteenth-century ideal—a means to “transform social distance into union, social
               difference into identity” (McGowen 314). As the novel winds to a close, Murden and
               Sibella find themselves on the verge of madness and death in a small country inn.
               Each is lodged in separate quarters for reasons of safety. The landlord—reluctant
               though desperate—suggests that Sibella finally be allowed to see Murden in the hopes
               that his “pity-moving countenance” may possibly “affect her” and “call forth a sympathy
               which must produce tears” (Fenwick 353). (Sibella has not cried for a long time; Grundy
               notes that “<em>[n]ot </em>to weep in intense sorrow was held to have damaging physical effects” [Grundy 353]).
               Slowly, cautiously, Murden is ushered into her room. As he “gaze[s] intently on Sibella,
               his countenance under[goes] a striking alteration.” He either faints or falls asleep
               at her knees, and his hand falls upon the bed. Sibella places his hand in hers and
               finds that “[s]he could not . . . separate his sufferings from her own.” She “continued
               to hold his hand” until “her emotions were kindling into agony.” After two “loud and
               dreadful groan[s]” she exclaims: “‘Give me not a name . . . . I own none! What am
               I? a shadow! A dream! . . . Oh! Your touch is ice!’ . . . you have chilled my blood!’”
               Murden explains to Sibella that his body is cold because “[he] too [is] but a shadow.”
               He sinks in her arms and “never . . . rise[s] again.” Sibella dies shortly afterward
               and both are entombed together (355–56). There is indeed something wildly odd and
               arresting about the role that the <em>hand-holding</em> plays in Sibella’s Murden-killing paroxysm of existential despair. The harder and
               longer she grips his soon-to-be-lifeless hand, the more her feelings seem to accumulate
               inside of her—until she cries aloud in what becomes both her own and Murden’s swan
               song.</p>
            <p>As far back as 1978, René Girard observed that “the dearest of all our illusions”
               is the “intimate conviction that our desires are really our own, that they are truly
               original and spontaneous.” For Girard, desire is not original but imitative—not to
               mention “eminently contagious.” One “‘catches’ a nearby desire just as one would catch
               the plague or cholera, simply by contact with the infected person” (Girard ix, 96,
               99). One of the strangest plot twists in <em>Secresy </em>is that the hyper-sensible Caroline falls in love with the absurdly sentimental Murden.
               This is a man who Caroline claims has “refined upon romance; who can give . . . as
               much enthusiasm to the affections, and carve misery for himself as ingeniously, as
               though he had passed his days under the safeguard of Mr. Valmont’s walls and drawbridges”
               (Fenwick 188). The irony here is that Murden <em>has</em>, in fact, passed his days hiding on the Valmont estate: dressing up in various costumes
               to woo Sibella through enigmatic hints and notes. He first appears in the wood as
               an old hermit, the “tall figure of a venerable man, with a white and flowing beard,”
               “wrapped in a sort of loose gown” and wearing a “broad hat” (101). He identifies himself
               as the ghost of an old inhabitant of the ruined monastery who can “‘renovate old age’”
               (a power he demonstrates by removing his beard, hat and mantle to reveal “a young
               man of graceful form”) (102). Sibella stumbles upon Murden a second time loitering
               in the armory of Valmont Castle, to which he has gained access via an underground
               passage that connects the monastery outside to the armory within the castle. This
               time (still disguised as a hermit) he appears “disfigured by dust and cobwebs,” carrying
               a sword and speaking in “disjointed” words “with a rapidity which made him almost
               unintelligible” (119). Eventually Murden seems to realize that speaking to Sibella
               in the guise of a hermit will get him nowhere. Some time after these false starts
               he folds several pieces of paper into a ball, weighted with a pebble, and rolls it
               toward Sibella while she is walking about in the wood. In one of the enfolded notes
               he identifies himself as an angel or celestial spirit inhabiting a lower planetary
               sphere, charging Sibella to “set [her] desires” on one of the papers he has provided
               (i.e., to tell him if she is free to love him or if she loves someone else) and to
               leave it on a nearby tomb (179).</p>
            <p>The fact that Caroline falls in love with someone like Murden is completely at odds
               with her self-presentation throughout <em>Secresy</em>. She has professed to disdain all self-indulgent, blatantly irrational sentiment
               as any good Wollstonecraftian would. Others have called her “pedantic, inflexible,
               opinionated . . . severe, misjudging” (284). She accordingly refers to Murden as “a
               being more variable, more inexplicable, than any being within [her] knowledge,” a
               “baby” of “false delicacy,” “false refinement,” “ferment[ed] . . . senses,” “fevered
               fancy,” “burning brain,” “artificial refinements,” and so on: in short, he and Sibella,
               according to Caroline, are enthusiasts, romantic “victims of erroneous educations”
               (143, 285–86). How then could she possibly fall in love with him? One satisfying explanation
               is that her desires were never really her own, but <em>his</em> (both, at any rate, the product of the same affective “mood”). What Caroline claims
               to feel for Murden is a version of what <em>he</em> claims to feel for Sibella. At one point she even adopts Murden’s emotionalized language
               and extreme sensuality. In one of her letters to Sibella, Caroline reveals that she
               knows who the mysterious “wood-wanderer” is. She presents herself in the letter as
               a kind of hovering spectator in Valmont wood, spying on the disguised Murden as he,
               in turn, has been spying on Sibella: <span class="quote">‘I see him gliding through the paths you had trodden. The tree which screened him
                  from your view cannot conceal him from mine. I see him listen almost breathless to
                  your prayer. The new-born colour on his cheek hangs trembling . . . the throbbings
                  of his agonized bosom collect themselves while restrained . . .. I see him dart the
                  ball forward to meet your feet; and then he rushes into the thickest gloom to hide
                  himself. . . . did symmetry ever mould a statue in finer proportions than his form
                  can boast? His eye in its passive state is a clear grey, its shape long; and the finest
                  eye-brow and eye lash that ever adorned mortal face . . . Hold him in conversation
                  and you will see that eye almost emits fire. . . . Observe how his hair, bursting
                  from confinement into natural ringlets around his temples, contrasts itself with the
                  fairness of his complexion. . . . His colour . . . retires as you perceive it, or
                  suffuses the whole of his fine countenance. (187–88)’</span> And so on. As Murden was once entranced by what Caroline had spoken of the physical
               features of Sibella—her “face,” “form,” “attitude,” “eyes,” “forehead,” “mouth,” unset
               and unpowered hair “parted from the top of the head and always uncovered,” neck “one
               of the finest . . . that ever belonged to a human figure”—now Caroline indulges in
               her own blazon of Murden (92–93). The above passage may be somewhat ironically delivered,
               but it may also be evidence of how material bodies in shared spaces circulate the
               raw material of “private” feeling. Nor is this phenomenon exclusive to Caroline. One
               critic notes that “[a]lthough Clement accuses Murden of having “absurd dreams of romantic
               useless perfections” which hinder his appreciation of women, he himself is guilty
               of idealizing Sibella’s “lovely face” and “enchanting unresisting form” (Emsley 492).
               Sensual desire spreads everywhere in <em>Secresy</em>, in spite of what characters say or think about it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The characters in Fenwick’s novel may therefore <em>appear</em> to live in “polarized” emotional environments, as others have argued (Castle 140):
                  the sentimental-Burkean-chivalric Murden meets the cool Wollstonecraftian Caroline
                  and neither seems able to navigate outside of a generic emotional script. But to me
                  it is seems equally evident that these mental or rhetorical “types” have a strongly
                  corporeal presence in the novel, that the bodies to which they belong interact dynamically
                  in a physicalized space described repeatedly in metaphors of contagion. Every character
                  in <em>Secresy </em>is entitled, of course, to articulate her emotional state as she pleases. And every
                  character may presume, according to the Enlightenment view of sympathy advanced variously
                  by Locke, Hume, and Smith, that she can sympathize with other characters by imaginatively
                  participating in and possessing their feelings in a personal and private capacity.
                  But the novel makes it relatively clear that individual feelings are more like what
                  William Reddy calls <em>emotives</em>—culturally codified descriptions rather than private, indwelling energies.

               but that disease is “contained in the end” when “Sibella and her infant are sacrificed
