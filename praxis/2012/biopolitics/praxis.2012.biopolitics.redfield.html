               <p>Of the narratives currently in circulation about the origin, tendencies, and discontents
                  of modernity, Michel Foucault’s account of the emergence of biopolitics out of an
                  older political model grounded in sovereignty has proved particularly influential
                  among cultural theorists and has gained further traction in the wake of Giorgio Agamben’s
                  imaginative complication of the distinction between sovereign and biopolitical acts
                  of power. Foucault, as is well known, usually represents the relationship between
                  sovereignty and biopolitics as sharply contrastive and sequential. Sovereign power,
                  which radiates from a center, is “essentially a right of seizure: of things, time,
                  bodies, and ultimately life itself”; biopower, which radiates from multiple, dispersed
                  sites, works to “incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces
                  under it” (<em>History</em> 136). If sovereignty reduces to “the right to take life or let live,” biopolitics
                  unfolds as “the power to ‘make’ live and ‘let’ die” (<em>“Society”</em> 241). Both are forms of organized violence; and indeed, the biopolitical regimen
                  of “making live and letting die” has greater lethal force than its precursor: “wars
                  were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things
                  being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations”
                  (<em>History</em> 136-37). This destructive potential is the dark side of biopolitics as the regulation
                  of life: “Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended;
                  they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire populations are mobilized
                  for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity; massacres have
                  become vital. . . . the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside
                  of the power to guarantee an individual’s continued existence.” Throughout this broad-brush
                  historical account, Foucault emphasizes the break distinguishing modernity from earlier
                  eras. “If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a
                  recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised
                  at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population”
                  (137).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Agamben’s by now well-known speculations on the origin of Western theories and practices
                     of sovereignty interlace the master tropes of sovereignty and biopolitics to produce
                     a narrative grounded more in figures of acceleration and transformation than in those
                     of rupture and contrast. According to this account, which Agamben elaborates via the
                     lurid fable of the ancient Roman figure of “homo sacer”—the criminal who can be killed
                     with impunity—sovereignty has always been an archaic biopolitics. “[T]he inclusion
                     of bare life in the political realm constitutes the original—if concealed—nucleus
                     of sovereign power. It can even be said that the production of a biopolitical body
                     is the original activity of sovereign power” (6). This claim generates a perspective
                     from which the complicity between democratic and totalitarian forms of the modern
                     state can be established and renders visible shards of sovereign violence throughout
                     the modern biopolitical order; Agamben goes so far as to discover in the camp “the <span class="foreign">nomos</span> of modernity,” the “hidden matrix of the politics in which we are still living” (75). <em>Camp</em> names any space in which policing agents “temporarily act as sovereign,” from holding
                     zones in airports, to refugee camps, to sites of genocidal violence—any space, that
                     is, that in some way brings to manifestation an “absolute impossibility of deciding
                     between fact and law, rule and application, exception and rule” (173). Although the
                     “sovereign,” properly speaking, may have long since disappeared into the dispersed
                     conglomerate of biopolitical controls that Foucault calls “governmentality,” the biopolitical
                     order nonetheless, as Judith Butler puts it, “reanimates a spectral sovereignty within
                     the field of governmentality” (62).

                              with the maintenance and control of bodies and persons. . . . Marked by a diffuse
                              set of strategies and tactics, governmentality gains its meaning and purpose from
                              no single source, no unified sovereign subject” (52). For Foucault’s own definitions,

               <p>As my thumbnail summary also hopes to suggest, however, Agamben’s speculations do
                  not simply oppose head-on Foucault’s narrative of broad historical change. Agamben
                  accepts and builds on the Foucaultian thesis that modernity consists in the management
                  of life; and indeed, his analysis supplies at least one intriguing addendum to Foucault’s
                  account of the transformation of nineteenth-century Western society. The thesis that
                  sovereignty and biopolitics meet in the production of “bare life”—the body politicized
                  in and as quasi-biological existence: the body that is born; the body that can be
                  quite simply killed—allows Agamben to add to the familiar Foucaultian list of nineteenth-century
                  biopolitical developments (sanitation reforms, population control, surveillance, sexuality,
                  etc.) a surprising supplement: the advent of human rights. Rights extended at birth
                  are rights inscribed, as it were, on the body: “Declarations of rights represent the
                  originary figure of the inscription of natural life in the juridico-political order
                  of the nation-state” (Agamben 127). Like Hannah Arendt before him, Agamben notes that,
                  since rights have historically depended for their enforcement on the nation-state,
                  the universality of human rights contracts rapidly to the emptiness of “bare life”
                  (“the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human,” as Arendt puts it [300]) in
                  the case of the stateless person. Nationalism, human rights, and the refugee emerge
                  together during the era that literary scholars call romanticism; thus Agamben’s work
                  opens for scholars of romanticism a fresh and interesting line of questioning. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>From this perspective the history of modern aesthetics asks to be rewritten in relation
                     both to the Foucaultian concept of biopolitics and to Agamben’s modification of it.
                     The link between aesthetics and biopolitics is easily established. If we understand
                     by modern aesthetics not a minor field of specialization within philosophy but a broad
                     discourse of acculturation and of self-fashioning or <span class="foreign">Bildung</span>, aesthetics visibly becomes what its great modern theorists have always said it was:
                     the name for a seemingly non-coercive form of social control. This theme dominates
                     to the point of defining modern aesthetic discourse from Friedrich Schiller through
                     Matthew Arnold, T.S. Eliot, Norbert Elias, and the various tributaries of twentieth-century
                     literary and cultural criticism, including most formalisms (which rarely cut their
                     ties to the aesthetic-pedagogical dream of reshaping subjects) and the cultural criticism
                     of the present day (which, paradoxically and erroneously, often imagines itself to
                     be achieving critical distance on this tradition by calling it an “ideology”).

                     </div> Terry Eagleton helpfully updates this Schillerian theme by transposing it into an
                     idiom closer to that of Foucault: <span class="quote">‘The ultimate binding force of the bourgeois social order, in contrast to the coercive
                        apparatus of absolutism, will be habits, pieties, sentiments and affections. And this
                        is equivalent to saying that power in such an order has been <em>aestheticized</em>. It is at one with the body’s spontaneous impulses, entwined with sensibility and
                        the affections, lived out in unreflective custom. (20)’</span> Eagleton’s concept of “the body,” as I have commented elsewhere, may be a little simplistic,
                     and his representation of the causal efficacy of aesthetic discourse may be somewhat
                     idealized (at times in his survey he runs the risk of seeming to suggest that treatises
                     on the beautiful are magically capable, more or less on their own, of “refashioning
                     the human subject from the inside, informing its subtlest affections and bodily responses
                     with this law which is not a law” [42-43]).

                     but seem inherently plausible, for biopolitics is precisely what the aesthetic, particularly
                     in its modern form, has always claimed to be.

                     lists normativizing practices of socialization that shape subjects over time and in

                     Schiller’s and Goethe’s texts represent the inscription of life into law as a process
                     dependent on a movement of iterability, a figural and figuring violence, that composes

                     as humanity passes from a natural to a moral state (3.4). Aesthetic form mediates
                     the moral law’s impact upon the social body, thereby cushions the fragmenting force
                     of revolutionary change. The artwork (<span class="foreign">die schöne Kunst</span>) is the instrument (<span class="foreign">Werkzeug</span>) of humanity’s historical transformation (9.2). “In vain will you assail their precepts,
                     in vain condemn their practice; but on their leisure hours you can try your shaping
                     hand” (“<span class="foreign">Ihre Maximen wirst du umsonst bestürmen, ihre Taten umsonst verdammen, aber an ihrem
                        Müssiggang kannst du deine bildende Hand versuchen</span>”; 9.7). It is not a developed theme; but in embryo here (to pursue the organic metaphor)
                     we have the biopolitical strategy: immerse subjects in a sea of minute disciplinary
                     practices, shape them quietly, invisibly, when they are at work but above all when
                     they are consuming “leisure” (“<span class="foreign">Müssiggang</span>”: idleness, <span class="foreign">otium</span>), without argument, or sovereign decree, or spectacular acts of violence. Meanwhile—though
                     here, to be sure, it is only the barest hint—the figure of a “shaping hand” suggests
                     an aftershadow of sovereign force within this biopolitical process.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of course the production of docile bodies is not the announced intent of aesthetic
                  culture—quite the opposite: Schiller, though anxious about the French Revolution,
                  writes as a champion of Kantian Enlightenment. But a reading of the <em>Aesthetic Education</em> along the lines sketched above is a fair one if our guiding context is Foucault’s
                  narrative of a transition from early modern forms of sovereignty to late modern instantiations
                  of biopower. It would be wrong, however, to claim that Schiller is oblivious to the
                  potential for violence concealed within the aesthetic image of a non-violent synthesis
                  between bodies and the law. Though the artwork seemingly exemplifies this synthesis,
                  and is the instrument both of historical continuity and historical transformation,
                  Schiller draws attention to the difference between material and political artworks
                  in a famous passage: <span class="quote">‘When the artisan lays hands upon the formless mass in order to shape it to his own
                     ends, he has no scruple in doing it violence; for the natural material he is working
                     merits no respect in itself, and his concern is not with the whole for the sake of
                     its parts, but with the parts for the sake of the whole. When the artist lays hands
                     upon the same mass, he has just as little scruple in doing it violence; but he avoids
                     showing it. For the material he is handling he has not a whit more respect than has
                     the artisan; but the eye which would seek to protect the freedom of the material he
                     will endeavor to deceive by a show of yielding to this latter. With the pedagogic
                     and the political artist, for whom humanity is at once his material and his task,
                     things are very different. Here the end turns back into the material, and it is only
                     because the whole serves the parts that the parts should submit to the whole. The
                     statesman-artist must approach his material with a quite different kind of respect
                     from that which the artist feigns toward his, and must accord consideration to its
                     uniqueness and individuality not merely subjectively, so as to create an illusory
                     effect for the senses, but objectively, for the sake of its inner being. ’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">Wenn der mechanische Künstler seine Hand an die gestaltlose Masse legt, um ihr die
                        Form seiner Zwecke zu geben, so trägt er kein Bedenken, ihr Gewalt anzutun; denn die
                        Natur, die er bearbeitet, verdient für sich selbst keine Achtung, und es liegt ihm
                        nicht an dem Ganzen um der Teile willen, sondern an den Teilen um des Ganzen willen.
                        Wenn der schöne Kunstler seine Hand an die nämliche Masse legt, so trägt er ebenso
                        wenig Bedenken, ihr Gewalt anzutun, nur vermeidet er, sie zu weigen. Den Stoff, den
                        er bearbeitet, respektiert er nicht im geringsten mehr als der mechanische Künstler;
                        aber das Auge, welches die Freiheit dieses Stoffes in Schutz nimmt, wird er durch
                        eine scheinbare Nachgiebigkeit gegen denselben zu täuschen suchen. Ganz anders verhält
                        es sich mit dem pädagogischen und politischen Künstler, der den Menschen zugleich
                        zu seinem Material und zu seiner Aufgabe macht. Hier kehrt der Zweck in den Stoff
                        zurück, und nur weil das Ganze den Teilen dient, dürfen sich die Teile dem Ganzen

                        gegen seine Materie vorgibt, muss der Staatskünstler sich der seinigen nahen, und
                        nicht bloss subjektiv und für einen täuschenden Effekt in den Sinnen, sondern objektiv
                        und für das innere Wesen muss er ihrer Eigentümlichkeit und Persönlichkeit schonen.</span>]’</span> <span class="quote">‘(4.4, translation slightly modified)’</span> The paradox flickering into view here is that Schiller’s analogy between the politician
                  and the artist itself repeats the duplicity ascribed here to the latter. The artisan
                  (<span class="foreign">der mechanische Künstler</span>) does violence to his materials and does not care; the artist (<span class="foreign">der schöne Künstler</span>) does violence to his materials but conceals this violence; the politico-pedagogical
                  artist or statesman-artist (<span class="foreign">der pädagogische und politische Künstler</span> or <span class="foreign">Staatskünstler</span>), however, should <em>not</em> do violence to his materials—but precisely to the extent that the politician has
                  become a politico-pedagogical <em>artist</em>, the distinction between the politician’s respect and the artist’s concealment of
                  violence threatens to devolve into another way of concealing violence. Thus a violence
                  that ought to belong strictly to art, not aesthetic politics, begins to spread throughout
                  the <em>Aesthetic Education</em>. To the extent that the artwork forms the matrix of this descriptive and prescriptive
                  system, the politico-pedagogical artist risks deforming his artwork in the very act
                  of forming it—and, worse, disguising this deformation as freedom, human dignity, and
                  all the other master-tropes of aesthetic pedagogy. Thus aesthetics itself becomes
                  the site of a certain autoimmune disorder within the body of aesthetic education:
                  a place from which violence and deceit (the deceit of violence as non-violence) promises
                  to spread through the text.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>That is not Schiller’s official theme, of course; but a careful reading would uncover
                     various traces of the instability haunting the figure of art-as-life and life-as-art
                     in the <em>Aesthetic Education</em>. Hints of this instability can even be detected in the framing contexts of the text.
                     Consider Schiller’s advertisement, published on 10 December 1794, for <em>Die Horen</em>, the ambitious cultural journal in which the <em>Letters on Aesthetic Education</em> were first published. Schiller had contracted with the Tübingen publisher J. F. Cotta
                     to edit this new journal, which had as its ambition nothing less than the creation—the
                     aesthetic shaping—of a national literary public. The journal was to unite Germany’s
                     intellectual talent and publish philosophical, historical, and literary texts aimed
                     at the general cultivated reader. The diversity of its genres and topics was to submit
                     to one overall restriction: discussions of anything related to established religion
                     and the political constitution was forbidden, as was discussion of “the favorite topic
                     of the day” (“Lieblingsthema des Tages”), that is, the French Revolution (“Ankündigung”
                     870).

                              are mine.</span></div>
                     </div> In his advertisement, Schiller explains that the new journal takes its name from the
                     three Horae, Eunomia (“good legislation”), Dike (“justice”), and Irene (“peace”),
                     who personify agrarian temporal order (the times, the seasons, “the rhythm of the
                     sun”). “Legend makes them the daughters of Themis and Zeus, of Law and Power; of the
                     very law that rules over the change of seasons in the corporeal world, and preserves
                     harmony in the world of the spirit” (5: 871). Furthermore, in the variant of the myth
                     that Schiller expounds (his source is one of the Homeric Hymns to Aphrodite), <span class="quote">‘It was the Horae who received the newborn Venus at her first appearance in Cyprus,
                        clad her in divine garments, and thus brought her, adorned by their hands, into the
                        circle of the immortals: a charming story, through which it is signified that already
                        at its birth Beauty must submit to rules, and only through lawfulness can become worthy
                        of maintaining a place in Olympus, immortality, and a moral value. ’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">Die Horen war es, welche die neugeborene Venus bei ihrer ersten Erscheinung in Cypern

                     Venus veiled—hints at a certain violence marking the intersection of body and law.

                              Schiller’s various appeals to the “feminine” as the privileged figure of aesthetic
                              figuration; let Hegel’s comment in his Aesthetics suffice: “he makes the praise of
                              women his particular subject matter, since in their character he recognized and emphasized
                              just that present-in-itself unification of the spiritual and the natural [that constitutes
                              the beautiful]” (Hegel, 91). My most sustained attempt to write on the vast topic
                              of aesthetics, gender, and the figure of Venus is to be found in the fourth chapter
                              of …</span></div>
                     </div> This feminized body never quite unites with the law that clothes it (it <em>submits</em> to rules—and <em>must</em> submit to them: “<span class="foreign">sich fügen muß</span>”), even though we are being teased by the possibility that this aesthetic body does
                     not exist <em>as</em> body prior to its inscription by law (“already at its birth Beauty must submit to
                     rules”: according to that logic, Venus, even newborn, is never quite unclothed). The
                     aesthetic both veils and uncovers a body-making violence at the origin of biopolitics.</p>
               </div>
               <p>If then, taking our cue from Agamben, we speak of a certain “sovereign” violence being
                  allegorized here, we uncover a tricky overlap between the states of exception and
                  of harmonious free play in which sovereignty and post-Kantian aesthetics, respectively,
                  manifest themselves. The sovereign decision, at once “outside and inside the juridical
                  order” (<em>Homo Sacer</em> 15), exceeds yet sustains law, much as Zeus exceeds and sustains Themis in Schiller’s
                  allegory. Aesthetic judgment, a seemingly much gentler personification—sovereignty’s
                  dutiful daughter—claims to act freely yet lawfully. Aesthetic judgment would thus
                  be a harmonious state of exception, a sovereign decision taken without violence—yet
                  just as the trickery of the artist is exposed in the text that theorizes his exemplarity,
                  so reflective judgment, reflecting on itself, tells the story of a certain law-like
                  force at work in the coming-to-figuration of aesthetics. This force, furthermore,
                  turns out to be hard to locate in the topography of these scenes: on the one hand
                  it seems to come from “outside” the aesthetic phenomenon per se (coming from the artist,
                  shaping his art; from the Horae, clothing Beauty in the garments of the law); on the
                  other hand it seems to emerge “inside” aesthetic theory, as a force that aesthetics
                  seems obliged to represent as part of its narrative of its own origins. Aesthetic
                  theory thus tells the story of an insight that coexists with blindness, and of a power—the
                  artist’s power to conceal—that comes into existence thanks to a double movement of
                  revelation and concealment that the artist as sovereign demiurge cannot master. For
                  because the artist cannot control the repetition and potential exposure (in, say,
                  a treatise on aesthetic education) of a violence he imagines himself (as shaping,
                  violence-concealing artist) to be controlling, the sovereignty of the artist becomes,
                  within the terms of the text, a legible delusion. All the more illusory, therefore,
                  the sovereign willfulness of the <span class="foreign">pädagogische und politische Künstler</span>, who, modeling himself on the artist, needs all the more desperately to conceal (or
                  justify or mythologize) the violence he does to his fellow human beings. These compulsively
                  reiterated acts of sovereignty, in other words, never know quite what they do nor
                  why.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Of course such political allegories, which inevitably appear when aesthetic discourse
                     reflects on its own origins and its own purchase on the world, should not be taken
                     at face value. We are, after all, dealing here with personifications, not persons;
                     with figures, not bodies; and why should we believe what aesthetic discourse says
                     about itself, anyway? Who would want to trust a trickster, particularly when he (or
                     she) claims to be exposing the sleight-of-hand for which, as lovers of beauty, we
                     are also supposed to fall every time? Yet precisely because it reflects on figuration
                     and iterability in reflecting on itself, a text like the <em>Aesthetic Education</em> exposes sovereign biopolitical body-making violence to the possibility of an irreducibly
                     erratic, non-end-directed movement of figure-making. The echo is faint; but if we
                     strain our ears we hear murmuring within the story of Beauty submitting to law the
                     counterplot of a law producing and gripping a body without quite knowing what it is
                     doing. Writing and erasing its story of the harmony of law and freedom, aesthetics
                     endlessly invokes and exorcises and reinvokes the specter of a freedom or force—the
                     “or” here marking an essential undecidability—that might <em>not</em> reduce to law and to the sovereign decision that refers exception back to law. This
                     spectral freedom or force can be represented in various ways: as blindness; as iterability;
                     as singularity in excess of rule; as desire or death-drive; as the absolute yet absolutely
                     uninsurable right to something more than “rights”; as an openness to the impact of
                     revolution, revelation, origin, death, event, miracle, catastrophe, history—the many
                     names of a potentiality in excess of positive existence, irreducible to a will to
                     power.

                     In form Goethe’s text pays homage, at least to some extent, to Bocaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>. The frame-narrative, set in 1792-93, and particularly in the spring of 1793 during
                     the siege of Mainz (which Goethe had witnessed, as I shall review in a moment), tells
                     the story of a noble German family headed by a gentle matriarch, the Baroness, displaced
                     by the war with France and then partly restored to its Rhine holdings by the Prussian
                     advance. By the time the story has really begun, these “refugees” are in fact not
                     really refugees at all, since they have reoccupied their property on the east side
                     of the Rhine, and can expect to recover possessions on the other side when Mainz capitulates.
                     They are at home yet not quite at home; borders are shifting, the times are changing.
                     As I hope to be able to indicate even within the limits of a brief study, <em>Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten</em> (hereinafter short-titled as <em>Conversations</em>) is fundamentally—that is, not just in its range of topical reference, but in its
                     dominant figurative patterns—a text preoccupied by war, revolution, and modernity.
                     Until Goethe wrote and published his memoirs <em>Campagne in Frankreich 1792</em> and <em>Belagerung von Mainz</em> (<em>Siege of Mainz</em>) some thirty years after the fact (they were written in 1820-22 and published in
                     1822), the <em>Conversations</em> may be said to be the text in his oeuvre most obviously inspired by his grueling experiences
                     at the beginning of the revolutionary wars. Before continuing my summary of the plot
                     of the <em>Conversations</em>, therefore, let me offer a summary of the campaigns of 1792-93, up through the siege
                     that forms the backdrop for Goethe’s narrative.</p>
               </div>
               <p>With the announced intention of restoring Louis XVI even at the cost of razing Paris
                  to the ground, an Austro-Prussian army commanded by the Duke of Brunswick and King
                  Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia crossed into France on August 19, 1792. Duke Carl August,
                  who was an officer in the Prussian army, contributed troops from Weimar, and Goethe,
                  at the duke’s request, accompanied his patron. Longwy and Verdun were captured easily;
                  but the French general Dumouriez maneuvered to confine the invaders to the inhospitable
                  terrain of the Argonne, through which the allied army advanced slowly, hampered by
                  unrelenting rain and insufficient supplies. At Valmy, Brunswick found himself boxed
                  in by a numerically inferior but tactically well-positioned enemy possessed of an
                  outstanding gunnery corps. After an inconclusive artillery exchange on September 20,
                  the “cannonade of Valmy” ended in an Austro-Prussian retreat. Fewer than two hundred
                  allied soldiers were killed in the bombardment itself, but during the retreat the
                  army endured losses in the tens of thousands. The weather continued terrible, to the
                  point that soldiers sank in mud to their waists; dysentery was pandemic; the supply
                  train broke down, and men and horses starved. A minor battle in itself, Valmy was
                  later recognized as a turning point in the revolutionary wars: a moment when the French
                  Revolution was saved. In his memoir of the campaign, Goethe famously (and somewhat
                  improbably) claimed to have achieved and expressed this insight on the night following
                  the cannonade: “‘From this time and this place a new epoch is beginning, and you will
                  be able to say that you were there’” (10: 235/5:652).</p>
               <p>The French then counterattacked, occupying Mainz and Frankfurt—Goethe’s natal city—in
                  late October. Prussia retook Frankfurt in December. On March 18, Mainz, in the control
                  of a local Jacobin club, proclaimed itself a republic; and at the end of March an
                  ascendant Prussian army surrounded Mainz. The blockade became a siege, and bombardment
                  began on the night of June 17, 1793. Goethe, having spent a few months back home in
                  Weimar, rejoined Carl August and witnessed the city’s destruction. Mainz burned for
                  five weeks, and capitulated on July 23. Over the course of the siege, the city’s cathedral,
                  library, churches, palaces, theater, and custom-house were reduced to rubble. Tourists
                  came from Frankfurt to watch the fireworks. Thirty years later Goethe wrote of the
                  “terrible spectacle” of Mainz, a city he had visited and admired before the war, burning
                  at night under shellfire: “the bombs seemed to vie with the heavenly lights, and there
                  were moments when it was really impossible to distinguish between the two. The ascending
                  and descending of the incendiary bombs was something new to us....” (10:375/5:757).
                  He went on to recall that two of his talented companions, the English painter Charles
                  Gore, and the director of the drawing academy at Weimar, Georg Kraus, “treated this
                  event artistically and made so many sketches of fires that they were later able to
                  produce a translucent model of the night scene; the model still exists, and when well
                  illuminated it is capable of conveying, better than any number of words, the representation
                  of an unfortunate, burning major city of the fatherland” (10:375/5:757-58). </p>

                  <p>I cite these remarks because they relay a blend of voyeuristic aestheticism and unease
                     that has certain equivalents in the text we shall be considering. Fascinated though
                     he is by the satanic glitter of bombs vying with stars, Goethe’s persona remains touched
                     by—overvulnerable to—the sublime vista, and never quite settles comfortably into the
                     slot of spectator <span class="foreign">ab extra</span> before it. Instead, proxies are generated who produce a “model” of this “unfortunate,
                     burning major city of the fatherland”: a gesture that doubtless serves as an avatar
                     of a coming spectatorial media culture, yet also hints at a compulsive, Shandean reenactment
                     of an experience that relays the shock of an event that is <em>historical</em> insofar as it outstrips sensory and cognitive processing.

                     </div> Goethe’s story of his <span class="foreign">mot</span> at Valmy (“From this time and this place a new epoch is beginning, and you will be
                     able to say that you were there”) is precisely a claim to have been able to experience—to
                     perceive, process, and recognize—the historical event as such. His story about watching
                     Mainz burn is less brash, and the story he wrote some thirty years previously—twenty-odd
                     months after Valmy, about twelve months after Mainz—is cagier still. A sense of everything
                     solid melting into air characterizes the opening lines of the <em>Conversations</em>, spoken by a narrator agitated enough to hint at anal rape as he describes the French
                     army violating both the body of the fatherland and the piety due to fathers: <span class="quote">‘In those unhappy days that brought such sad consequences to Germany, to Europe, indeed
                        to the rest of the world, when the French army burst into our fatherland through an
                        ill-kept gap, a noble family abandoned its properties in that region and fled over
                        the Rhine, in order to escape the afflictions threatening all distinguished persons,
                        who were treated as criminals because they remembered their fathers with joy and respect,
                        and who enjoyed many advantages that any right-thinking father would want to provide
                        for his children and descendants. (10:15)’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">In jenem unglücklichen Tagen, welche für Deutschland, für Europa, ja für die übrige

                           Lücke in unser Vaterland einbrach, verließ eine edle Familie ihre Besitzungen in jenen
                           Gegenden und entfloh über den Rhein, um den Bedrängnissen zu entgehen, womit alle
                           ausgezeichneten Personen bedroht waren, denen man zum Verbrechen machte, daß sie sich
                           ihrer Väter mit Freuden und Ehren erinnerten und mancher Vorteile genossen, die ein
                           wohldenkender Vater seinen Kinder und Nachkommen so gern zu verschaffen wünschte</span>.] (6:125)’</span> The frame-narrative of the <em>Conversations</em> begins in the wake of the disastrous retreat from Valmy, when Custine’s army poured
                     through Landau (the “ill-kept gap”) to capture Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and Frankfurt.
                     The world has been turned so upside-down that, when first absorbing the trauma that
                     makes her a refugee, the Baroness’s eldest daughter loses self-control to the point
                     of entering “a sort of complete absent-mindedness [<span class="foreign">Abwesenheit</span>]”, in which state she mistakes “an old servant for her fiancé” (126/16). The Baroness
                     and her entourage are thus grappling not just with the age-old horrors of war, but
                     with the fragmenting force of a political struggle that affects both <span class="foreign">polis</span> and <span class="foreign">oikos</span>, endangering relationships between master and servant, parent and child. For within
                     the family, as within Mainz (and, for that matter, within “Germany, Europe, and the
                     rest of the world”), internal differences are generating conflict. Cousin Karl has
                     allowed himself to be “seduced by that blinding beauty [<span class="foreign">blendenden Schönheit</span>] who under the name of Freedom had known how to acquire so many admirers, first secretly
                     and then openly” (127/16). A fervent supporter of the French Revolution, he gets into
                     such violent arguments with the <span class="foreign">Geheimrat</span> (“Privy Councillor”), a conservative friend of the family, that the latter leaves
                     in anger (“exiled a second time, and this time through a countryman” [134/21]), taking
                     with him his wife, who is the childhood friend of the Baroness. Karl repents of having
                     caused his aunt pain; and the Baroness, after excoriating the damage done by the male
                     desire for sovereignty (<span class="foreign">Herrschaft</span>), prohibits all conversation having to do with the “interest of the day” (“<span class="foreign">Interesse des Tages</span>”; 139/24)—a version of the prohibition we saw Schiller propounding in the prospectus
                     for <em>Die Horen</em> against the “favorite topic of the day” (“<span class="foreign">Lieblingsthema des Tages</span>”). Her command has no more performative felicity than Schiller’s (when she goes to
                     bed, the group—like the <em>Conversations</em> itself and, for that matter, the <em>Aesthetic Education</em> itself—continues to discuss the news and rumors of the day). But the family members
                     agree to tell and listen to stories that, nominally, will have no connection to current
                     events.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The seven stories told make up a curious bouquet. Only the final two are, strictly
                  speaking, original to Goethe: the first is a supernatural story from an eighteenth-century
                  French source; the second is a ghost story that was circulating orally in Weimar in
                  Goethe’s day; the third and fourth are translations of tales by the seventeenth-century
                  French writer François de Bassompierre; the fifth is a story from a popular, much-republished
                  Renaissance collection, <em>Cent Nouvelles nouvelles</em>; the sixth, 
                  “The Story of Ferdinand’s Guilt and Reformation,”
                  is original to Goethe; and the seventh, which breaks the frame of the frame-narrative
                  and ends the text, is Goethe’s famous 
                  “Fairy Tale,”
                  a richly enigmatic text that has often been studied in isolation from the <em>Conversations</em>. It is little wonder that Schiller and the journal’s first readers felt some disappointment,
                  even frustration, when they read Goethe’s contribution. The <em>Conversations</em> exemplify one of the many ways in which Goethe is a far more interesting writer than
                  the marmoreal image of him as the mainstay of the classical German literary canon
                  would suggest. No less than such famously difficult works as <em>Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</em>, <em>Faust II</em>, and the late poetry, the <em>Conversations</em> is an experimental text, and a shrewd and disturbing one. It is not just <em>about</em> liminal conditions, border crossings, and ambiguous states of warfare, homelessness
                  and exception; it welcomes foreign bodies into itself. It reveals that conversation
                  (<span class="foreign">Unterhaltung</span>) destroys itself in becoming a form of socio-aesthetic support (<span class="foreign">Unterhalt</span>). And in doing so, the text stages and deconstructs the sovereign violence entwined
                  with the biopolitics of an aesthetic education. Often dismissed as a <span class="foreign">Nebenwerk</span> to Goethe’s more serious work, <em>Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten</em> is a highly ambiguous instance of light literature (<span class="foreign">Unterhaltungsliteratur</span>), to say the least.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Let us look again, and this time a little more closely at the Baroness’s command that
                     the community renounce political conversation—which is to say, political strife, for
                     when Karl and the <span class="foreign">Geheimrat</span> reach the climax of their argument, they are exchanging death threats (the <span class="foreign">Geheimrat</span> hopes to see the collaborationists in Mainz hanged; Karl, losing all control, desires
                     that “the guillotine would reap a rich harvest in Germany too” [133/20]). Newly politicized
                     and imbued with revolutionary and counterrevolutionary violence, conversation must
                     now undergo a new process of de-politicization. The Baroness proposes that under her
                     gentle, matriarchal leadership, both the phallic brutality of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> and the anarchy of revolution will be overcome. “‘Come here, children!’ called the
                     Baroness. ‘We have had a serious discussion, one that, I hope, will restore to us
                     peace and unity, and once more bring us the manners [<span class="foreign">den guten Ton</span>] that we have lacked for awhile’” (139/24). <span class="foreign">Der gute Ton</span>: the Baroness proposes this old-regime Franco-Germanic expression, a literal translation
                     of <span class="foreign">bon ton</span>, as the figure for an aesthetic culture that will trump the French Revolution and
                     restore old-world manners, yet without violence, without manifestations of male <span class="foreign">Herrschaft</span>. Though she imagines herself to be proposing a return to the old ways (138/23), the
                     Baroness is offering something closer to Schiller than to Castiglione. Her new maternal,
                     aesthetic state will unite law and freedom. “I do not like to give orders,” the Baroness
                     states; rather, she will provide a piece of advice (<span class="foreign">einen Rat</span>) and a request (<span class="foreign">eine Bitte</span>). “And,” replies one of her auditors, “both shall be an unbreakable law [<span class="foreign">ein unverbrüchliches Gesetz</span>] for us” (137/23). The law is that of conversation as good tone: the company is to
                     converse pleasantly, <span class="foreign">sich angenehm unterhalten</span>, and to tell stories that engage the imagination in harmony with reason and understanding.
                     In and through this aesthetico-politico-linguistic law, a newly aesthetic community
                     is to emerge: a storytelling community that begins by hearing ghost stories (while
                     the Baroness is in bed, since they are beneath her dignity) and progresses toward
                     the heights of the 
                     “Fairy Tale.”
                      Many critical analyses of the <em>Conversations</em> have interpreted the text as narrating the arc of such a communal aesthetic <span class="foreign">Bildung</span>, though more common in recent years has been a skeptical approach, in which the <em>Conversations</em> is read as an ironization of Schiller’s program of aesthetic education.

                              in a disinterested, Kantian fashion to the tales they hear. See also Ulrich Gaier,

                     haunted by half-acknowledged instabilities. Goethe exacerbates those instabilities
                     in the <em>Conversations</em> in several ways, and perhaps above all by extending, elaborating, and exploding the
                     figure of the law of aesthetic conversation and community, <span class="foreign">guter Ton</span>. In passing from custom to law-without-law—in passing, that is, from being the tacit

                     aesthetic acculturation—<span class="foreign">guter Ton</span> figures the arrival of a biopolitical era of discipline and rights. This new community
                     of refugees—refugees restored to their property, but forever exposed to future deracinations
                     and displacements—is built on aesthetic citizenship as the right to speak and to be
                     listened to without fundamental political consequence (a right that unfolds in and
                     as the dialectical tension between, on the one hand, high aesthetic disinterestedness—the
                     right of literature or art to say <em>anything</em>—and on the other hand, that great modern aggressively passive middle-class prerogative:

                     </div> In her scrupulous reading of eighteenth-century British georgic poetry, Kevis Goodman
                     disinters a symptom akin to the one we encounter here: “the figure of ‘noise,’ non-ideational
                     sound experienced as sensuous unpleasure” functioning as “the noise of history, or,
                     more accurately, the presentness of ongoing history beyond lived experience or phenomenological
                     verification” (63, 64). One of the contextual frames for Goodman’s study is the newspaper
                     as a figurative “limit of conversability” (87); consistent with this pattern, Goethe’s
                     text encourages associations between the sound of cannon-fire destroying Mainz and
                     the invasion of news items, <em>Neuigkeiten</em>, about Mainz (and more broadly about the “topic of the day. At one point the old
                     family priest (<span class="foreign">der Geistliche</span>, <span class="foreign">der Alte</span>: an authority figure who will tell the most important of the text’s stories) comments
                     that a drive for novelty (<span class="foreign">etwas Neues</span>) is more exciting than serious subjects; novelty (<span class="foreign">die Neuheit</span>) gives incidents a dangerous charm that depends neither on internal coherence (<span class="foreign">Zusammenhang</span>) or on self-sufficiency (141/25). As Andreas Gailus has pointed out, the text thus
                     encourages an opposition between “sociable speech” and “the plague of revolutionary
                     news” (453). Yet the Baroness’s attempt to revive the former by banning the latter
                     is undermined by spectral disturbances afflicting the figure of sociable speech, <span class="foreign">guter Ton</span>, itself. In the first story told, the 
                     “Story of the Singer Antonelli,”
                      the singer’s jilted lover returns from the dead to haunt her in the form of a “violent,
                     fearful sound” (“<span class="foreign">gewaltsame, fürchterliche Ton</span>”; 152/33). This sound appears variously as a voice (<span class="foreign">Stimme</span>) or cry (<span class="foreign">Schrei</span>), but also as a shot (<span class="foreign">Schuß</span>). Lingering in ears and limbs, it threatens to disarticulate the body. It is “penetrating”
                     (“<span class="foreign">durchdringend</span>”; 152/33), appearing between walls, between lovers, crossing borders between insides
                     and outsides, and bringing with it a little death: in one instance, when “the shot
                     penetrated through the carriage,” the women inside are lifted out, taken for dead
                     (155/35). Finally the mysterious noise is successfully aestheticized; it changes into
                     “more pleasant sounds [<span class="foreign">angenehmer Töne</span>] . . . not actually melodious, but unbelievably pleasant and delightful. . . . It
                     was as if a heavenly spirit wanted to draw attention by a beautiful prelude to a melody

                     between meaningful speech and sheer noise. It is a little like cannon-thunder and
                     a little like news (news so new or so uncannily mediated that it cannot be assimilated
                     without stress); and this “likeness” has to do not, finally, with any phenomenal characteristic
                     that can be perceived as such, but with the threat of difference and dislocation that
                     all these phenomena convey. If the strange sounds in the Antonelli story sometimes
                     resemble the sounds of the cannonballs that nearly killed Goethe at Verdun and Valmy,
                     as he was to describe them three decades later (“suddenly there was a fierce, whistling-crashing
                     sound [<span class="foreign">grimmige, pfeifend-schmetternde Ton</span>] behind me”), what this means is not that a fictional image has been traced back
                     to a real-life experience, but rather that haunting, like cannon-fever, is being represented
                     as a form of shock.

                     and above all with the dislocating force of technical reproducibility. Benjamin offers
                     various examples of the shock experience: the reading of newspapers; the sterile repetitiveness
                     of unskilled factory work; contact with the urban crowd; gambling and amusement park
                     “fun”; photography; cinema; the ticking of quantifiable, capitalizable clock-time.
                     Shock is an effect of mediation rather than simply of physical violence, though physical
                     or literal battering is usually a possibility—sometimes overwhelmingly so, as in the
                     middle of a battle or (to return to our text) as in the second story told in the <em>Conversations</em>, 
                     “The Story of the Mysterious Knocking,”
                      in which a fourteen-year-old servant girl suddenly begins to be accompanied around
                     a nobleman’s house by knocking sounds (which are also described as irregular blows, <span class="foreign">Schläge</span>). The nobleman conquers this figurative irruption of female sexuality and revolutionary
                     violence by threatening a simpler and more terrible violence: “He took his largest
                     hunting whip down from the wall and swore to beat the life out of the girl if the
                     knocking were ever heard again. From that time on she went all over the house without
                     a tap, and no further knocking was heard” (158/36).

               <p>Splitting and redoubling the writing desk, Goethe allegorizes his own text’s role
                  in the dissemination of shock in and as the aesthetic of <span class="foreign">gutem Ton</span>, which is to say the aesthetico-pedagogical project of <em>Die Horen</em>. He has also, of course, written into the frame narrative a surrogate for the siege
                  of Mainz. The aunt’s ravaged estate, the burning desk and its cracking twin form a
                  figurative complex that, gathered around the figure of <span class="foreign">Ton</span>, relay a violence that is <em>historical</em> both in its excess over sensory apprehension or cognitive comprehension, and in the
                  claim it makes on spectators who cannot properly measure their distance. A full reading
                  of the <em>Conversations</em> would need to trace the aftershocks of the aesthetic through all of this text’s embedded
                  tales; here, I can only consider briefly the story in which the political stakes of
                  aesthetic education receive their fullest elaboration, the “story of Ferdinand’s guilt
                  and reformation.” As it happens, the damaged writing-desk returns in this narrative.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Ferdinand, the son of a well-off but careless businessman, discovers, through a strange
                     accident (<span class="foreign">sonderbarer Zufall</span>), that the lock of his father’s desk is defective, and the top will fly up if the
                     desk is given a side-blow (<span class="foreign">Seitenstoß</span>). The desk contains money that the father is in the habit of grabbing without counting
                     to satisfy his pleasures; Ferdinand, in a domestic parody of revolution, steals from
                     his father to support his own impulsive passions. (The parody is sharply drawn: Ferdinand
                     chafes against parental restrictions in the idiom of <span class="foreign">les droits de l’homme</span>: “And with what right [<span class="foreign">mit welchem Rechte</span>] do they have to do it? And how did they get this right [<span class="foreign">Und wie sind sie zu diesem Rechte gelangt</span>]? Should it depend on chance alone, and can there be a right [<span class="foreign">Recht</span>] where chance is at work?” [192/58].) After stealing for awhile, Ferdinand repents
                     and secretly pays back the money (unlike his father, who never notices the thefts,
                     Ferdinand knows how to count and has kept track of what he owes); alas, his mother,
                     stepping in to supplement the paternal role, has found out his crime, and suspects
                     him of taking gold ducats that in fact he did not take. Threatened by his furious
                     mother with legal persecution and public exposure, Ferdinand despairs; he prays to
                     his <span class="foreign">Vater im Himmel</span> (203/66), and is rewarded with an immediate act of providence: his mother, now cheerful,
                     enters the room to tell him that, miraculously, the missing ducats have just then
                     been found (the father had forgotten he had given them to his cashier for safekeeping).
                     Ferdinand, having thoroughly submitted to paternal law by acceding to a guilt that
                     outstrips his literal transgression, goes on to found a business and a family of his
                     own in a different part of Germany (most of the characters in the <em>Conversations</em>, unsurprisingly, are exiles or emigrant of some sort). For our purposes the most
                     interesting part of the story comes when the Abbé (who is telling the story and who
                     claims to have known Ferdinand in later life) describes what sort of <span class="foreign">pater familias</span> Ferdinand becomes. Anyone who imagines that Goethe is incapable of subjecting his
                     great theme of renunciation (<span class="foreign">Entsagung</span>) to astringent parody has not read this story to the end: <span class="quote">‘He told me his story himself, and as it happens with people to whom something significant
                        has happened in early years, this story had impressed itself so deeply on him that
                        it had a deep influence on his life. Even as a husband and a father he often took
                        it upon himself to deny himself something that would have given him pleasure, simply
                        in order not to get out of practice of such an admirable virtue, and his entire principle
                        of education was, so to speak, that his children must, off the cuff as it were, be
                        able to deny themselves something.’</span> <span class="quote">‘In a way that I at first could not approve, he would, for instance, at dinner forbid
                        one of the boys to eat a favorite food. To my surprise the boy remained cheerful,
                        and it was as if nothing special had happened.’</span> <span class="quote">‘And so the eldest children, on their own initiative, often used to allow a special

                        indifferent to everything and allowed them almost unbridled freedom, except that once
                        a week he would get the notion that everything had to happen to the minute. Then first
                        thing in the mornings the clocks would be synchronized, everyone got his orders for

                     from the opening sentence of the <em>Conversations</em>, constitutes the essence of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span>, has been impressed on him (<span class="foreign">eingedrückt</span>) with a force that recalls all the verbs of breaking in, bursting into, splitting
                     through, and so on that have proliferated throughout the text, from the fateful moment

                     notice they are being damaged—for his household is a parody of an aesthetic state
                     (the first of what were to be several such parodies in Goethe’s work), and as we know,
                     the violence with which the political and pedagogical artist treats his materials
                     sometimes manages to go unperceived.

                     to capriciousness—to a sheer act of will. The children are being taught to renounce
                     for the sake of renunciation, and to do so without forethought or calculation—“off
                     the cuff” is the English idiom to which I had recourse in the translation above, but
                     it misses something: the German idiom <span class="foreign">aus dem Stegreife</span> connotes improvisation and hints at the bravado of a highly skilled, impromptu aesthetic
                     performance.

                     </div> Ferdinand’s household, Goethe suggests, is one version of what an aesthetico-bio-political
                     state in which law and freedom coincide would look like—an obsessive-compulsive nightmare.
                     The Baroness, who immediately draws the larger political parallel, is mad enough (or
                     desperate enough) to approve of this crazed aesthetic polis: “The Baroness made a
                     few comments, and confessed that this friend [Ferdinand] on the whole was probably
                     right, for in a kingdom, too, everything depended on the executive power [<span class="foreign">exekutive Gewalt</span>]; the legislative power could be as rational as it liked, it would avail the state
                     nothing if the executive [<span class="foreign">ausführende</span>] power were not strong” (208/69). But sovereignty reduced to sheer will-power becomes
                     nothing more than a spasmodic effort to convince itself of its own existence. Ferdinand’s
                     impulsive negations and compulsive bouts of temporal ordering relay and refigure the
                     shock of a body- and subject-making power that cannot underwrite or understand itself.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We may take this story as a little allegory about the degradation and dispersal of
                  sovereign power within a biopolitical regime, or (which is perhaps not so very different)
                  as a little allegory about the violence of aesthetic politics. Either way, it is also
                  a story about the unruly critical force of aesthetic discourse, which exposes the
                  violence and incoherence it is supposed at all costs to conceal. Let me close with
                  a small clutch of images drawn from near the end of the 
                  “Fairy Tale”
                  the appendix-text that ruptures the body of the <em>Conversations</em>. The Abbé offers the <em>Fairy Tale</em> as a story of pure imagination: “imagination itself cannot demand, it must await
                  what is given it. It makes no plans, chooses no path, but instead it is borne and
                  led by its own wings; and as it swings back and forth it traces the strangest courses,
                  which constantly shift and change direction” (209/70). This strange, intriguing text
                  does indeed often give one the sense of a world controlled by slightly mad laws that
                  proliferate unpredictably and dizzyingly: in the opening paragraphs alone we encounter
                  will-o’-the-wisps who feed on gold; a snake that feeds on gold; a river that will
                  rise up to swallow anyone who tosses gold into it; a lamp that turns rock to gold
                  (but timber to silver and dead animals to gems)—and on and on. The tale has a redemptive
                  arc (at the end “all debts are paid”) and closes with a king restored to his throne;
                  yet it also closes with a weird regicidal image. Over the course of the story we meet
                  four living statues of kings (as distinct from the human king): one of gold, one of
                  silver, one of bronze, and one of a mixture of metals; and this last statue, the mongrel
                  “fourth king,” suffers a fate worse than the guillotine when, near the end of the
                  <em>Fairy Tale,</em> his veins of gold are licked out of him by the will-o-the-wisps, causing him to collapse
                  into himself formlessly (<span class="foreign">unförmlich zusammengesunken</span>): <span class="quote">‘But when at last even the most delicate veins were consumed, the statue suddenly
                     collapsed, unfortunately at just those places that hold their shape when one sits
                     down; whereas the joints, which ought to have bent, remained stiff. There was no choice
                     but to laugh or to look away; this middle-thing between form and lump was a hideous
                     sight. (89)’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">Als aber auch zuletzt die zartesten Äderchen aufgezehrt waren, brach auf einmal das
                        Bild zusammen und leider gerade an den Stellen, die ganz bleiben, wenn der Mensch
                        sich setzt; dagegen blieben die Gelenke, die sich hätten biegen sollen, steif. Wer
                        nicht lachen konnte, mußte seine Augen weg wenden; das Mittelding zwischen Form und
                        Klumpen war widerwärtig anzusehen</span>.] (237)’</span> This comic, slightly obscene figure of a king disfigured, collapsing as he attempts
                  the royal act of sitting down, is then concealed under “a magnificent covering that
                  no eye could penetrate and no hand dared remove” (241/91). As a “middle-thing between
                  form and lump” (237/89), his deformed body offers a visual equivalent of the uncanny
                  <span class="foreign">Ton</span> (a middle-thing between speech and noise) in the Antonelli story. Both of these tropes
                  figuratively register an uncertainty afflicting the secure establishment of figure,
                  body, or meaning. The image (or, better, anti-image) of the disfigured king hints
                  at a fundamental powerlessness underlying the violent operations of body-making. We
                  may hypothesize that this deformed, material lump of sovereignty constitutes, for
                  aesthetics, the repressed truth of sovereign and biopolitical violence. Alternatively,
                  we could think of it as, aesthetically speaking, a metamorphic lump of history.</p>
               <p>What remains of the sovereign? A certain residue, to be sure. Ghostly to begin with,
                  sovereignty disperses, degrades, and returns as its own attenuated figure. I mentioned
                  earlier that at the end of the 
                  “Fairy Tale”
                  a king has been restored; at the very end of the tale we are told that he leaves the
                  temple (where the obscene remains of the “fourth king” lie covered) to go off to his
                  palace by “hidden passageways” while “the people dispersed through the temple to satisfy
                  their curiosity” (241/91). In a quasi-fairy-tale spirit, let us conclude with the
                  observation that this king has no clothes. At best he is a chastened, post-revolutionary
                  king, scurrying to his secure location; but we might just as well think of him simply
                  as a minor celebrity, pursued by paparazzi and running for cover—a sliver of pseudo-sovereignty
                  within a biopolitical order or, indeed, within a debased aesthetic state turned entertainment
                  center. The temple-exploring <span class="foreign">Volk</span> resembles a fan base or a tour group here far more than it does a people subject
                  to a monarch. And indeed, in the final sentences of the text, government becomes sheer
                  population control, and the fairy kingdom a theme park, the cynosure of a world-wide
                  tourist industry: </p>

                  power to deliver death and life from the sky—by excreting gold sucked from royal veins.
                  Their manna carries the faint whiff of the blood of a beheaded monarch, even as it
                  testifies to the survival of a certain mobile form of sovereignty in an era of population
                  control and mass entertainment. The residue of sovereignty in the biopolitical order
                  is reducible neither to sovereign-state intentionalism nor economic rationalism. If
                  the <em>Irrlichter</em> parody God and king, they also parody any <span class="foreign">Aufklärung</span> that would enthrone reason in the place of the divine. They are only half-present
                  anyway, in the concluding paragraph of this strange and prescient fairy tale: they
                  enter and leave it not as entities directly described, but as a narrator’s directive
                  (“<span class="foreign">Man begreift wohl...</span>”), and as the putative causal adjunct of the disappearing gold (“<span class="foreign">da keine Goldstücke mehr herabfielen</span>”). The gold, vaporizing into sheer motion, may be said to be turning into capital,
                  while the <span class="foreign">Irrlichter</span>, the will-o’-the-wisps, at this point may be taken as parodies of “power” in Foucault’s
                  sense. They disappear into a mass-in-movement—a multitude rather than a chosen people,
                  caught up not in a divinely directed exodus, but rather in an <span class="foreign">Auswanderung</span> as a dispersal or getting-lost (“<span class="foreign">verlief...sich</span>”) that vacillates between intentional movement (“<span class="foreign">zog seine Straße</span>”: the <span class="foreign">Volk</span> takes its path, sets out on its journey) and swarming excess (“<span class="foreign">wimmelt die Brücke von Wanderen</span>”: the bridge teems with travellers). Power, if we extrapolate from these images,
                  has no center; we are dealing rather with multiple and mobile centering-effects: markets
                  and profit mechanisms; localities with pseudo-religious (if never quite simply “secular”)
                  auratic privilege (“<span class="foreign">der Tempel ist der besuchteste auf der ganzen Erde</span>”). If one personifies power, one comes up with nothing more than <span class="foreign">Irrlichter</span>: the lightning-flashes of sovereign violence within the biopolitical order. And in
                  performing this personification, Goethe’s text performs yet another dislocation of
                  sovereignty as a coherent and self-sufficient instance. The twin <span class="foreign">Irrlichter</span> figure an errant, doubled and redoubled power of figuration that <span class="foreign">n’en est pas un</span>: a power that cannot measure, represent, coincide with, or otherwise account for
                  “its” own shaping, embodying, illuminating force.</p>
               <p>In its final sentence Goethe’s text registers this force in another way, as a disconcerting
                  acceleration into the present tense (“<span class="foreign">Endlich verlief es sich allmählig, zog seine Straße, und bis auf den heutigen Tag
                     wimmelt die Brücke von Wanderen, und der Tempel ist der besuchteste auf der ganzen
                     Erde</span>”). The eerily calm speed with which Goethe often tells stories has been a defining
                  characteristic of the <span class="foreign">Unterhaltungen</span> throughout this text’s many voices and genres; this final, uncanny acceleration,
                  which breaks the frame of the frame-narrative, reads as a last affirmation of an imaginative
                  power that exceeds sovereign control. Imagination, “<span class="foreign">von ihren eigenen Flügeln getragen und geführt</span>,” would then no longer be the expression of an author-father’s will and identity,
                  but rather a name for literature’s ability to open onto something else. That disruptive
                  aesthetic movement underwrites yet also exceeds the discourse of aesthetic education
                  as biopower.</p>

               with the maintenance and control of bodies and persons. . . . Marked by a diffuse
               set of strategies and tactics, governmentality gains its meaning and purpose from
               no single source, no unified sovereign subject” (52). For Foucault’s own definitions,

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">The limitations of Agamben’s study become particularly visible in its reiterated affirmation
               of the equation between “language” and “sovereignty”: e.g.: “Language is the sovereign
               who, in a permanent state of exception, declares that there is nothing outside language
               and that language is always beyond itself” (20; cf. 25, 50). Thanks to Matthias Rudolf
               and Alastair Hunt for drawing my attention to these moments in Agamben’s monograph.

         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">As I shall be detailing in a moment, Schiller’s treatise was first published in installments
               in his new journal <em>Die Horen</em>; the first nine letters appeared in January, 1795; letters 10-16 followed in February,
               and the final eleven letters were published in June. Schiller made modest revisions
               to the text when he republished it in his <em>Kleinere prosaische Schriften</em> in 1801. In what follows my citations of Wilkinson and Willoughby’s translation of
               Schiller’s <em>Aesthetic Education</em> (1967) are referenced by letter and paragraph number.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">This is not the place to embark on an enumeration—let alone a sustained reading—of
               Schiller’s various appeals to the “feminine” as the privileged figure of aesthetic
               figuration; let Hegel’s comment in his <em>Aesthetics</em> suffice: “he makes the praise of women his particular subject matter, since in their
               character he recognized and emphasized just that present-in-itself unification of
               the spiritual and the natural [that constitutes the beautiful]” (Hegel, 91). My most
               sustained attempt to write on the vast topic of aesthetics, gender, and the figure
               of Venus is to be found in the fourth chapter of my <em>Politics of Aesthetics</em>, which reads Friedrich Schlegel’s novel <em>Lucinde</em> in concert with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe’s ambitious essay 
               “The Unpresentable.”
               Lacoue-Labarthe, analyzing some passages in Hegel, argues that “between woman and
               art, the ‘symbolic’ equivalence, or the analogy, is rigorous and strong,” and that
               the figure of Venus figures “the ‘truth’ of figure and the fictional” in Hegel and
               in Western aesthetics (136, 155). I offer a critique of Lacoue-Labarthe’s brilliant
               but, it seems to me, overhastily essentializing argument in <em>Politics of Aesthetics</em>, 128-33.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Critique of Violence”
               ; Jean-Luc Nancy’s meditations in <em>The Experience of Freedom</em>; and Jacques Derrida’s reflections on force in

               worth noting in passing that, in Sterne’s <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim, having built their model fortifications on Uncle Toby’s
               bowling-green, reenact battles from the wars of the Spanish Succession as they are
               reported in the newspaper: “regulating their approaches and attacks, by the accounts
               my uncle Toby received from the daily papers—they went on, during the whole siege,
               step by step with the allies” (Sterne, 313 [vol. VI, ch. 22]). Readers of the novel
               will recall that Toby’s model-building responds to his inability to tell the story
               of the wound to his groin that he received at the siege of Namur (see vol. II, ch.
               1, and passim).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Die Ästhetische Erziehung der deutschen Ausgewanderten”
               ; his main argument is that Goethe represents the emigrants as failing to respond
               in a disinterested, Kantian fashion to the tales they hear. See also Ulrich Gaier,

The English word <em>din</em> comes from the same source (as does the English word <em>tone</em>, of course). (German has another meaning for <span class="foreign">Ton</span>, “clay,” but that is by way of a different etymology.) My authority here is the <em>Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen, Q-Z</em> (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1989). <span class="foreign">Ton</span> as sound or tone has as much claim as any other Latino-German word to be deeply and
               traditionally “German.” Yet it shades into the other languages being spoken by the
               major European powers in the 1790s. In the context we are examining, its tone is being
               disturbed by the French word from the same etymological background, <span class="foreign">ton</span>, as activated by the French aristocratic marker <span class="foreign">bon ton</span>, stamping the German <span class="foreign">calque guter Ton</span>. <span class="foreign">Ton</span> and <span class="foreign">ton</span> are (almost) cross-linguistic honomyms (the capitalization of nouns in German marks
               a tiny difference); they are pronounced a little differently in German and French,
               but they have an audible kinship. All of this makes this word a rich resource for
               a text interested in representing war and revolution by way of representations of
               familial violence. The authoritative study of the figure of <span class="foreign">Ton</span> and <span class="foreign">Töne</span> in Romantic and post-Romantic German literature is Menke, <em>Prosopopoiia</em>. Although Menke discussses Goethe only in passing, her powerful readings of texts
               by Brentano, Hoffmann, Kleist, Kafka, and many other writers underscore both the importance
               and the rhetorical instability of the figure of <span class="foreign">Ton</span> within this tradition.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               to their communicative character….The sounds are not simply physical phenomena but
               communications—that is, messages addressed to Antonelli and calling for a reply—and
               they terrify her not because they are untraceable in origin but because they are unfathomable
               in meaning” (467). Gailus’s essay contributes richly to the long tradition of understanding
               the <em>Conversations</em> as a crucial text in the development of the modern German <span class="foreign">Novelle</span>. He argues persuasively that all the tales told in the <em>Conversations</em> (except for the 
               “Fairy Tale,”
               which falls outside the purview of his study) “are built around an incomprehensible
               kernel” (466), and that this circling around a trauma or secret characterizes the
               modern novella.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">Goethe’s memoir is in any case no unmediated act of memory. It was written so long
               after the fact that he had to rely heavily on maps, documents, and other people’s
               journals: see Trunz, 
               “Nachwort,”
               10:661ff. <em>Campagne in Frankreich 1792</em> dwells repeatedly on the fascinations and horrors of modern artillery bombardment.
               Goethe had his first real taste of war at Verdun, where he nearly lost his life to
               a cannonball (this is the passage to which I alluded above): “suddenly there was a
               fierce, whistling, crashing sound [<span class="foreign">grimmige, pfeifend-schmetternde Ton</span>] behind me so that I turned around immediately, without being able to say whether
               this about-face had been caused by the sound [<span class="foreign">Ton</span>], the rushing air, or an inner, psychic, moral stimulus” (10: 209/5:633). In his
               account of the battle of Valmy, the scene in which Goethe stages his famous line about
               the “new epoch” is preceded by an almost equally famous scene in which he tempts the
               gods of war. “I had heard a lot about cannon fever and wanted to find out exactly
               what it was like. . . . I had now reached the area where the cannon balls were landing;
               the sound [<span class="foreign">Ton</span>] is strange enough, as though composed of the hum of a top, the bubbling of water,
               and the whistling of a bird. . . . I could soon tell that something unusual was happening
               inside me” (233-34/651-52).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">19. </span><span class="noteBody">All the stories in the <em>Conversations</em> dramatize in some way or other the threat of ungovernable female sexuality. Luise’s
               mistaking a servant for her fiancé hints at an association between political and sexual
               trouble. The “mysterious knockings” begin when the servant girl reaches puberty and
               begins to attract admirers. Other stories feature sexually active women who cause
               trouble and endure various sorts of punishment: the singer Antonelli, who casts off
               her lover and refuses to see him on his deathbed (which is why, presumably, his ghost
               returns as the uncanny <span class="foreign">Ton</span>); and three central female characters in three stories that I do not discuss in this
               essay: the beautiful grocer and the penitent adulteress in the two (very short) Bassompierre
               stories; the would-be adulteress in the “story of the Procurator” from <span class="foreign">Cent nouvelles nouvelles</span>. Among these figures of threatening women there are a few dark doubles of the Baroness
               as gentle matriarch: the singer Antonelli; Ferdinand’s castrating mother in 
               “The Story of Ferdinand’s Guilt and Reformation”
               (to be discussed below); even the Beautiful Lily in 
               “The Fairy Tale,”
               whose glance and touch are deadly prior to the fairy-tale world’s redemption. Given
               the thematic and figurative link in the <em>Conversations</em> between fatherhood and social order, these figures of unruly women form a visible
               part of the threat of revolution.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note19_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               <p class="noCount">The phrase comes from Thomas Carlyle’s famous description of the death of Robespierre,
                  in <em>The French Revolution</em>: <span class="quote">‘At the foot of the scaffold, they stretched him on the ground till his turn came.
                     Lifted aloft, his eyes again opened; caught the bloody axe. Samson wrenched the coat
                     off him; wrenched the dirty linen from his jaw: the jaw fell powerless, there burst
                     from him a cry;—hideous to hear and see. Samson, thou canst not be too quick!’</span> <span class="quote">‘Samson's work done, there bursts forth shout on shout of applause. Shout, which prolongs
                     itself not only over Paris, but over France, but over Europe, and down to this generation.
                     (744)’</span> The motif of the globally communicated shout recurs frequently in writing about the
                  Revolution, particularly in the Anglo-American tradition, indebted as it is to Carlyle.
                  Here is an early twentieth-century example: “‘The Bastille has fallen!’ was the glorious
                  news that greeted the ear of humanity the world over….There is force, tremendous force,
                  in the shout of an incensed and infuriated mob…. Who would have thought that this
                  mighty fortress, bristling with cannon, rock-ribbed from turret to foundation stone,
                  fortified, garrisoned, supplied with stores and ammunition sufficient to have withstood
                  the siege and assault of an army, would have fallen so quickly before the shout of
                  the multitude. It was not besieged by an army of disciplined soldiers, but by a mob
                  without order, organization or leadership. ‘And it shall come to pass . . . that the
                  people shall shout with a great shout and the walls of the city shall fall down flat.’
                  As before the walls of Jericho, so it was before the walls of the Bastile” (Warwick
                  272-73).</p> 
               <p class="noCount">The allusion to Joshua 6:5 reminds us of the ancient roots of the figure of the destructive
                  shout, found in the Hellenic tradition as, e.g., the shout of Pan that saves Olympus
                  from the Titans; the war-cry of Akhilleus; etc. Alala, the personification of the
                  war cry in Greek mythology, is daughter of Polemos and attendant to Ares (god of the
                  war cry: <span class="foreign">alalaxios</span>). Her name can also mean a loud cry or noise, and overlaps with <span class="foreign">alalos</span>, “speechless, dumb,” <span class="foreign">alalaô</span>, “make dumb,” etc.; ancient etymologies have her name deriving from the terrifying
                  cry of the owl.</p></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
