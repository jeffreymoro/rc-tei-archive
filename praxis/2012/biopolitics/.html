                     “Introduction: The Romantic Rhetoric of Life”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay introduces a collection of articles intended to initiate a conversation
                  about and between biopolitics and romanticism. Its broad contention is that the study
                  of biopolitics reanimates the question of romanticism in two senses. First, the set
                  of conceptual resources provided in recent work on biopolitics opens up inventive
                  lines of inquiry that enable scholars to re-think the already established awareness
                  that the literature, philosophy, and culture of romanticism displays an obsession
                  with life. In another sense biopolitics reanimates romanticism insofar as the current
                  scholarly concern with life as an object of power marks the radical survival of romanticism.
                  If romanticism responds well when examined in the light of contemporary biopolitical
                  theory, then a constitutive part of this response is a certain resistance to biopolitical
                  theory. As the contributors to this volume demonstrate, the biopolitical intervention
                  on life engages paradoxes, predicaments, and aporias that have been widely or fully
                  appreciated neither by theorists of biopolitics nor by critics who take up their work.
                  Romanticism, we suggest, is a privileged locus for the awareness that even the most
                  assured representation of life turns upon an irreducible “literariness.”</p>

               <h2><span class="head"><span style="font-weight:bold"><a id="RedfieldAbstract"><!--anchor--></a>Marc Redfield</span>, 
                     “Aesthetics, Sovereignty, Biopower: From Schiller’s <em>Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen</em> to Goethe’s <em>Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten</em>”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Redfield argues that the very density of aesthetics means that biopolitics may not
                  be exactly what contemporary theorists claim it to be. As much as aesthetics can be
                  read as an extension of biopolitics, biopolitical sovereignty finds itself subject
                  to the technicity of aesthetics. Explicitly a political response to and solution for
                  the violence of the French Revolution, Friedrich Schiller’s <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em> outlines an aesthetic program that aims for nothing less than a body at one with
                  the law. What Redfield focuses on, however, is not just the violence that sovereignty
                  performs and disavows, but also the force that it exploits yet cannot control. To
                  elaborate this claim, he turns to a text published in the same year (1795) as Schiller’s
                  treatise, Goethe’s <em>Conversations of German Refugees</em>, seven stories that are intended by their refugee tellers to embody the promises
                  of aesthetic culture to restore the moral and political order of the <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> after the violence of the French Revolution. The controlling figure for this order
                  is, in the words of the leader of the refugees, the Baroness, <span class="foreign">der gute Ton</span>, a literal translation of the French <span class="foreign">bon ton</span>. Yet <span class="foreign">Ton</span> in German also means “noise.” Exploiting this double meaning, Redfield traces a remarkably
                  consistent pattern by which sovereign responses to shocking noises in the text reproduce
                  rather than put an end to the revolutionary shock such noises are associated with.
                  Insofar as Goethe’s text is itself an aesthetico-pedagogical effort to disseminate
                  <span class="foreign">den guten Ton</span>, it allegorizes its own inability to rigorously distinguish between the shock to
                  which it responds and the shock upon which it turns.</p>

                     “What is Poetry in the Theater of Biopolitics?”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Sun examines how J. S. Mill develops in his aesthetic writings a theatrical rhetoric
                  of poetic citizenship that challenges the bio-political theatricality of Benthamite
                  panopticism. Mill derives his definition of poetry, which involves at its core a dissociation
                  between the visible and the audible, from the Wordsworthian figuration of nature as
                  the site of a disjunction between sense and sense-perception. Poetry, for Mill, serves
                  as the medium of a voice that circulates beyond the regulatory gaze of panopticism
                  to address the political subject as helpless, inactive overhearer rather than as bio-political
                  actor-spectator.</p>

                     “Biopoetics, or Romanticism”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Guyer’s essay "Biopoetics" opens by elegantly noting that it was not just natural
                  and social scientists who became interested in life around 1800, but also poets. What,
                  Guyer asks, would be a poetic understanding of the relationship between literature,
                  power, and life? To answer this question, she turns to Barbara Johnson’s account of
                  the relation of poetic apostrophe, a rhetorical figure of animation, and the politics
                  of abortion, as well as to John Clare’s romantic-period poem, 
                  “To Mary.”
                  The conjugation of Clare and Johnson suggests that what is at stake in the relationship
                  between romanticism, biopolitics, and literature is not a shared thematic representation
                  of life but, rather, a shared predicament concerning the representation of life. Guyer
                  reveals the nature of this predicament in an economic reading of the poem’s apostrophic
                  complex.</p>

                     “Response and Commentary (Sara Guyer, Marc Redfield and Emily Sun)”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">Eva Geulen’s response to the essays included in this volume contends that all three
                  essays more or less explicitly defend romanticism “from any biopolitical charges and
                  suspicions” by calling on the literary aesthetic, a move she takes as an indication
                  that what is at stake is not so much biopolitics as it is “aesthetics by way of biopolitics.”
                  Rather than opening up new lines of inquiry, the appearance of theoretical accounts
                  of biopolitics provides the occasion to redraw, however contingently, the lines defending
                  the literary aesthetic. Geulen’s discussion turns to and remains focused on Agamben’s
                  account of sovereignty and bare life. In her reading, the concept of sovereignty provides
                  an opening onto the relation of biopolitics and literature. Yet contrary to the readings
                  offered by Guyer, Redfield, and Sun, Geulen suggests that aesthetics does not as much
                  mark an aesthetic resistance to biopolitics as it paradoxically participates in and
                  furthers biopolitical violence. Geulen argues that merely identifying and recognizing
                  moments of textual ambivalence and rhetorical undecidability does little to resist,
                  let alone change, the effectivity of the biopolitical structure.</p>
