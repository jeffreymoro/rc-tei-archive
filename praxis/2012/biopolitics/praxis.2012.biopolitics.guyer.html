               <h1><span class="head">Biopoetics, or Romanticism</span></h1>
            </header><br/><p>In his last lecture of 1975-76, Michel Foucault focused on “power’s hold over life”
               (239), and in particular the emergence in the nineteenth century of sovereignty as
               a power over life, rather than death, sovereignty as “the right to make live and let
               die” (241). As Foucault explains in the <em>History of Sexuality</em>, “The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power was now carefully supplanted
               by the administration of bodies and the calculated management of life” (262), two
               “techniques” that Foucault identifies not in philosophy but “in the form of concrete
               arrangements” (262). Foucault’s insight has opened up the epoch of biopower, providing
               the terms and frames though which everything from sexuality to human rights can be
               understood as occurring in the aftermath of this shift in the very significance of
               life itself.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>British (and French) poets writing at more or less the same time as the planners and
                  statisticians who Foucault considers, that is, from the late-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth
                  centuries, might also be understood to register a new significance of life itself.
                  As Denise Gigante most recently has argued in <em>Life: Organic Form and Romanticism</em>, a preoccupation with life—in her case, understood as organicism, vitality, or nature—binds
                  the poets we typically call romantic. For Gigante, the romantics were writers (like
                  the scientists who are their contemporaries) “committed to defining and representing
                  the incalculable, uncontrollable—often capricious, always ebullient—power of vitality”
                  (3). This is a power that the poets also sought to categorize, calculate, and manage,
                  if not through new forms of record keeping and sanitation, then through new uses of
                  older tropes and figures. In this sense, poetry can be understood as another of the
                  “concrete arrangements” or “techniques” of power for the management of life, another
                  site of the power over life, like vaccination or the variety of emergent forms of
                  public health to which he alludes. This is true both in a thematic and a strategic
                  sense: literature of the period takes the power over life as a theme, but it also
                  takes life as its object. We would have to look no further than a novel like Mary
                  Shelley’s 1818 <em>Frankenstein</em> to find a clear example in which all of these senses of life and power emerge. There
                  we find that race, the question of the human species, education, the threat to populations,
                  and the emergence of new projects in biomedical engineering are construed as analogous
                  to literature itself; and literature (formed as a novel, but figured as poetry) emerges
                  as a kind of life. Indeed, Shelley famously refers to her literary fiction as a newly
                  formed life, more or less substitutable with and even allegorized by the life-form
                  whose existence the novel traces. Thus <em>Frankenstein</em> could be read as a vivid example of the analogy between what Foucault calls <em>biopower</em> and literary power—or literature as a form of biopower. Yet, that what is at stake
                  in this convergence is a monstrous formation whose full frontal force never can be
                  grasped suggests, at least allegorically speaking, the sublime impact—on poetry and
                  politics both—of this new power over life.

                           and Trope in Frankenstein” in my Romanticism After Auschwitz. While most examples
                           of lyric life are not concerned with the species, Frankenstein is a notable exception,
                           as it is precisely man as species and its future that is at issue throughout the novel.
                           Furthermore, other iterations of biopolitics, notably that of Giorgio Agamben, are
                           not focused on the question of species (or human as species), but rather of the human
                           and its political possibility and impossibility. For a discussion of the difference

               <p>One way of understanding this convergence—the more or less simultaneous emergence
                  of life as the medium of political <em>and</em> poetic power, the emergence of biopower <em>and</em> romantic poetry—is as an historical or terminological <em>accident</em>, rather than a series of effects with a shared cause. Indeed, the romantic preoccupation
                  with sovereignty (as lyric subjectivity) and poetic power as a vital force sits uneasily
                  with Foucault’s account of biopower, even as it shares its constitutive terms. The
                  lyric subject, at least as it is conventionally characterized, is a resoundingly individual
                  formation, whereas biopower, in Foucault’s account, is administrative and neither
                  oriented towards nor executed by the individual. Moreover, recent critics of biopower,
                  including Lauren Berlant and Eric Santner, also have noted the flawed tendency to
                  correlate the variety of conceptions of sovereignty (personal, political, and theological),
                  a tendency that the correlation between romanticism and biopolitics could even be
                  said to repeat.

                  life at this moment to emerge as an object (both aim and concern) of poetry and politics,
                  of lyric subjectivity and political sovereignty? Put another way, we might ask whether
                  this is strictly a nineteenth-century formation or rather, a late-twentieth-century
                  one articulated in and through a return to the nineteenth century texts and contexts

                  a past that it recasts even as it is conditioned by it? Is this the modernity of the

               <p>It is the very shape of this temporal knot that has led me, elsewhere, to conceive
                  of romanticism as a <em>poetics of survival</em>, that is, as preoccupied with and producing a condition of living on, while at the
                  same time figuring and instantiating life as beyond or in excess of the opposition
                  between life and death. In this essay, I wish to develop my earlier account in a somewhat
                  different direction by focusing on the concurrent socio-political and rhetorico-lyrical
                  preoccupations with making live. Taking seriously the shifting conception of life
                  as the object of politics and poetics in the nineteenth century—and the initial articulation
                  of this shift in the 1970s, the years of Foucault’s “Society must be defended” lectures,
                  the publication of the first volume of his <em>The History of Sexuality</em> [1976], and of Paul de Man’s essays “Autobiography as De-Facement” and “Shelley Disfigured”
                  [1979]—I will argue that there is a correspondence between biopolitics and romanticism
                  that is captured in this shared preoccupation with life, and that it is a conception
                  of poetry and politics that is uncontained by the nineteenth century.

                           can be read to resonate with one of Agamben’s criticisms of Foucault, that what he
                           identifies as a modern emergence, in fact has an ancient origin.</span></div>
                  </div> I will also suggest that this conjunction becomes an occasion to recognize life as
                  survival, and thus to consider something about life that the various demographers
                  and managers who appear in Foucault’s texts (and in his only cursorily formulated
                  and digressive account of biopower) may not be in a position to perceive or comprehend,
                  but nevertheless continue to expose.

                  </div> In other words, far from exhausted by Foucault’s account of biopower and the theoretical
                  accounts to which it has given rise, a lyric consideration of life, one formulated
                  in and through romanticism trains us to see beyond the management of species and populations
                  and to recognize the excesses that biopower and its institutions inherently fail to
                  contain. In other words, while it might appear from my opening observation that modern
                  poets are managers, belonging to the same category as statisticians and public health
                  officials, and that lyric sovereignty, insofar as it is focused upon making live,
                  is a mode of administration, several examples suggest instead the undoing of individual
                  formations by the very gesture that appears to contain it. These lyric examples show
                  that life is always on the side of nonpower, and that its containment fails to sustain
                  the newly formulated opposition between life and death that is at the heart of the
                  shift that Foucault so compellingly describes.

            <p>In what follows, I will turn from Paul de Man’s formative rhetorical account of the
               lyric to Barbara Johnson’s feminist revision of de Man in order to develop my own
               analysis of <em>biopoetics</em>. Johnson’s consideration of a subgenre of abortion lyric fosters a rethinking of
               the modern lyric and its rhetorical effects, identifying a shift in its organization
               from aiming to overcome the opposition between the living and the nonliving (in other
               words, “making live”) to imagining a relation between mother and child, whether dead
               or alive, as two potentialities. This example is a clear instance of the intersection
               of poetics and politics around the question of life, and one that, like <em>Frankenstein</em>, dramatizes the encounter between biopolitics and romanticism. Moreover, Johnson
               explicitly shows how lyric apostrophe can be understood not only as the trope of politics,
               but a trope that turns politics into biopolitics. From Johnson’s discussion of lyric
               animation and its political—or as I suggest—biopolitical—implications, I turn to a
               poem by John Clare that offers another way of imagining the lyric and its relation
               to biopolitics. Clare, a poet known as much for his lurid biography, his use of local
               idiom and eccentric grammar, and his opposition to the Enclosure Acts that divided
               his parish, spent a third of his life in a mental asylum. By focusing on questions
               of animation in the context of a lived fiction experienced as a pathology, a debilitating
               delusion that kept Clare from living among others, I propose to develop Johnson’s
               reading of lyric apostrophe into a theory that further emphasizes the lyric rhetoric
               at work in the politics of life and making live.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">I. A Fetal Address</span></h2>
               <p>Despite having written extensively on romantic lifewriting and on Percy Shelley’s
                  <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, Paul de Man seemed to have very little interest in the question of life itself.
                  Indeed, life, like death, for de Man is a linguistic predicament, and those texts
                  that seem most preoccupied with life (I am thinking here of “Autobiography as De-facement”
                  and “Shelley Disfigured”), are not simply “about” death or even the undecidability
                  between life and death (recall: “one moves, without compromise, from death <em>or</em> life to life <em>and</em> death [<em>Rhetoric of Romanticism,</em> 74]), but about figures and figural language. When in his essays of the late-1970s,
                  later collected in <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, de Man apparently turns away from organicist accounts of language (that is, language
                  as a vehicle of life), he does so in order to turn our attention to the ideology of
                  rhetoric (or literature) as a restorative, indeed indissociably restorative and privative,
                  operation. Autobiography (or lifewriting) operates through a figurative movement that
                  “deprives and disfigures to the precise extent that it restores.” (And returning to
                  the example I introduced above, Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> recognizes this in all of the scenes where the encounter between Victor Frankenstein
                  and his creature, involves a series of faintings and restorations.) Although de Man
                  focuses on Wordsworth’s <em>Essays upon Epitaphs</em> and Percy Shelley’s “Triumph of Life,” privation, disfiguration, and restoration
                  in his account are not matters of life and death, an assumption that would remain
                  within an organicist paradigm, albeit a negative one, but rather matters of cognition,
                  apparition, and image. It is sensation, and the relation between the visible and the
                  knowable worlds, rather than life and death, that are at the core of de Man’s observations.</p>
               <p>For all of these reasons, it might seem antithetical to turn to de Man in an effort
                  to track the relation of literature to life and develop a theory of <em>biopoetics</em>, unless <em>biopoetics</em> is only another name for figure, just as it might be another name for romanticism
                  itself. However, despite his own apparent allergy to questions of life and his indifference
                  to biological processes or political analysis on a grand scale, de Man’s understanding
                  of figuration has laid the groundwork for other accounts of lyric figures (apostrophe,
                  prosopopoeia) that take place in a more explicit relation to the politics of life,
                  namely those of Barbara Johnson.</p>
               <p>In her 1986 essay “Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion,” Johnson draws upon de Man’s
                  account of figure to ask whether “the very essence of a political issue—an issue like,
                  say, abortion—hinges on the structure of figure,” and she goes on to wonder if there
                  is “any <em>inherent</em> connection between figurative language and questions of life and death, of who will
                  wield and who will receive violence in a given human society?” (<em>World of Difference </em>184). The key word here is “inherent.” For figurative language, insofar as it relies
                  upon a seemingly infinite capacity for substitution, is driven by the establishment
                  of connections where there are none. Figuration is in this sense a matter of the non-inherent,
                  or the inherent as mere substitutability. So, to ask about ‘inherence,’ to consider
                  the possibility of an essential and permanent relation between “figurative language”
                  and “questions of life and death,” or to ask whether figure is the “hinge” that bears
                  the essence of politics, including the politics of life and death, as Johnson does,
                  is to suggest that there can be no politics of life without this poetics. Johnson’s
                  task is to understand and track the meaning and shape of this poetics. Turning to
                  abortion, Johnson conjoins questions of figure or poetic address with what Penelope
                  Deutscher has called “one of the major nodes of biopolitics” (55): abortion. Johnson
                  seems to ask, although not in quite so many words, whether biopolitics is essentially
                  <em>biopoetics</em>. And while she will go on to develop her initial consideration of the inherent relation
                  of lyric figures and politics into a speculative consideration of motherhood (“there
                  may be a deeper link between motherhood and apostrophe” [198]), the theoretical landscape
                  is such that she is not yet in a position to reflect directly upon the relation of
                  biopolitics and biopoetics. In the mid-80s, when Johnson’s essay is published, Foucault’s
                  various discussions of “making live” in the nineteenth century remained overshadowed
                  by his much more substantial considerations of governmentality, the body, and its
                  discipline. Thus, while Johnson presciently evokes the question of the relation between
                  biopolitics and poetics in her discussion of abortion and lyric, it remains a question
                  that still bears asking directly—one insinuated but not exhausted by the example of
                  abortion and poetry addressed to unborn fetuses. It is also the question, I want to
                  suggest, of the lyric itself. In other words, the question for us, as it is to a certain
                  extent for Johnson, is how important—how essential or <em>inherent</em>—is life for the discussion of literary rhetoric (or poetry), and is this matter of
                  life, rather than a programmatic attachment, not only a matter of politics, but in
                  fact the political nexus of literature itself? Put another way, the question for us
                  is whether life is the poetic nexus of the political? For Johnson, insofar as politics
                  is a matter of power and power a matter of violence, the essence of any political
                  issue is the question of life and death, of <em>the power over life and death</em>. And to suggest that politics “hinges on the structure of figure,” as she does here,
                  is also to suggest that it hangs on a rhetorical device that <em>makes</em> “present, animate, and anthropomorphic,” a device that, recalling Foucault’s account
                  of political power, makes live. This figure, apostrophe, has a particularly compelling
                  presence in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries and an afterlife in
                  some unlikely places. For example, as Johnson shows, it is at work in the case of
                  abortion, where the question of viability may not be altogether new, but it does become
                  newly visible and, thanks to new technologies for managing the ends of life—from pills
                  to respirators—newly ubiquitous. Now, as anyone even minimally familiar with the rhetoric
                  around abortion in the US knows, a central claim on one side of the debate is the
                  assumption of fetal life as having an unproblematic relation to human, speaking life,
                  indeed of fetal life as rights-bearing life or as personhood. Hence, as Catherine
                  Mills recently has shown, the use of 4D sonograms in antiabortion materials has as
                  its aim the production of the fetus as a face-bearing entity—and person or personage.
                  Here, political and poetic rhetoric, the rhetoric of persuasion and the rhetoric of
                  tropes and figures, enter in to a heightened relationship.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Johnson begins by showing how lyric apostrophes, as acts of animation that assume
                     the difference between the living and the dead, turn out to undo the very distinctions
                     upon which they seem to rely. Her initial examples, drawn from Baudelaire and Percy
                     Bysshe Shelley, relay scenes in which a lyric subject addresses an inanimate object
                     in order to endow it with the power that will retroactively animate the very subject
                     responsible for the address in the first place. Johnson reads these poems in the romantic
                     (and post-romantic) lyric tradition in which a (male) poet undertakes to obtain a
                     voice from the outside together with poems (by women) in which “the question of animation
                     and anthropomorphism is…given a new and disturbing twist,” poems that “textually place
                     aborted children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead, inanimate, or absent
                     entities previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Like Foucault, Johnson seems to
                     register a shift in modernity’s relation to sovereignty, showing that an emergent
                     structure of animation in the nineteenth century remains at the core of political
                     thinking in the late-twentieth-century; and, like Foucault, again, she is interested
                     in re-reading and re-casting an earlier emergence (which we could in both cases call <em>biopower</em>) from the perspective of its violent future.

                              persuasively considers the reasons why Agamben never takes up the matter of abortion—in
                              part the complexity of analogizing abortion and the Holocaust, an analogy which is
                              the bread-and-butter of the anti-abortion movement and something one would not want
                              to touch. </span></div>
                     </div> It is in these poems that a new, specifically biomedical uncertainty about the nature
                     and meaning of the living and the dead emerges. It is also here that Johnson explicitly
                     registers a continuity—or analogy—between poetry (the rhetoric of animation) and biopolitics
                     (abortion).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Johnson begins her exploration of another lyric scene with Gwendolyn Brooks’ “The
                  Mother,” a poem that, in her account, traces the disappearance and appearance of the
                  first person subject, rendering the lyric subject an object of the abortion itself
                  (“Abortions never let <em>you</em> forget”); the addressee of aborted fetuses (“I have heard in the voices of the wind
                  the voices of my dim killed children”); and finally the subject addressing them, albeit
                  through a citation (“I have said, Sweets, if I sinned….”). Even as a subject, she
                  remains uncertain about their status (“oh what should I say, how is the truth to be
                  said?”) and thus her own. Indeed, Brooks’ poem reflects a particularly complex case
                  where in actuality she did not want to bring the objects of her address to life even
                  as this animation is what occurs when she continues to hear the voices that sound
                  only through her. Thus, as Johnson notes, “the poem can no more distinguish between
                  ‘I’ and ‘you’ than it can come up with a proper definition of life” (190). This ambivalence
                  about life and death is fundamental to the structure of apostrophe, and in this sense
                  it also reveals what is at stake in abortion itself. Whatever our politics or rhetoric,
                  from the perspective of politics or rhetoric, it is not clear whether a life that
                  is not viable (an embryonic life) can be considered a life at all, just as it is not
                  always clear whether a life, even if not viable, is anything other than a life. From
                  a biopolitical perspective, like the one that Agamben offers at the end of <em>Homo Sacer</em>, the fetus also would emerge as one of those lives in which the political and the
                  biological have entered into a domain of indistinction. For Agamben, this would be
                  only a particularly vivid example of a quotidian situation. The same could be said
                  for Johnson, insofar as this is the structure of lyric, a structure upon which “the
                  essence of politics hinges.” Yet, for Johnson, who approaches the political scene
                  through poetry and rhetoric, what is at stake is not only the indistinction between
                  political life and biological life, but political life and poetic (or rhetorical)
                  life. Poetry and rhetoric supplement the place of biology so that the question of
                  species, populations, and measure, that is, the objects of social science become a
                  question for literary theory and history.</p>
               <p>My point here is not to suggest that Johnson <em>only</em> registers life or death as a fundamentally linguistic (and hence nonhuman) predicament,
                  as de Man does, but to show that her essay raises some highly specific questions about
                  the relation of poetry <em>to</em> life and death, indeed the power of poetry (or language) <em>over</em> life and death, when it registers the poetic and biological questions of life as
                  thoroughly indissociable. It is in this sense that what Agamben refers to as a “zone
                  of indistinction” comes to involve poetry and lyric subjectivity; for lyric (or poetic
                  or rhetorical), biological, and political notions of life emerge as indistinguishable.
                  While Johnson considers the ways that the lyric, as an exemplary form of language,
                  can repeat and re-enact the violence it aims to overcome, she also challenges conventional
                  accounts of lyric subjectivity as they relate to life itself. Johnson not only argues
                  that debates about abortion can be seen as debates about apostrophe and the rhetoric
                  of animation and address, but equally that lyric poetry can be seen as part of the
                  abortion debates—or construed more generally—debates within the politics of life.
                  She goes so far as to suggest (while attributing this suggestion to Brooks’ poem)
                  that “arguments for and against abortion are structured through and through by the
                  rhetorical limits and possibilities of something akin to apostrophe.” And further
                  that: “The fact that apostrophe allows one to animate the inanimate, the dead, or
                  the absent, implies that whenever a being is apostrophized, it is thereby automatically
                  animated, anthropomorphized, ‘person-ified’. (By the same token, the rhetoric of calling
                  makes it difficult to tell the difference between the animate and the inanimate, as
                  anyone with a telephone answering machine can attest)” (191).</p>
               <p>For Johnson, this “automatic animation” that occurs within a rhetoric of address raises
                  questions about the relation between what Agamben has called life and form-of-life.
                  Agamben describes his task as completing and correcting Foucault’s work on biopolitics.
                  He insists upon the ancient origins and specifically modern tendencies of biopolitics
                  by reminding us that initially two words, <span class="foreign">bios</span> and <span class="foreign">zoe</span>, were used to designate life, and focuses on what he calls “form-of-life,” a life
                  in which it is never possible to isolate something such as naked life, by which he
                  means “a life for which what is at stake is living itself, in which the single ways,
                  acts, and processes of living are never simply <em>facts</em> but always and above all <em>possibilities</em> of life, always and above all power” (<em>Means</em> 4). Here, Agamben understands a form of life as separate from automation, repetition,
                  habit, or prescription, seeing it rather as possibility or potential, a relation to
                  the indeterminate and unprogrammed. Agamben distinguishes between this “form-of-life,”
                  a life of reflection, and what is translated alternatively as bare or naked life,
                  although even bare or naked life is not simply a given, but an assumed category. Yet,
                  when Johnson suggests that arguments about abortion (about biological or sacred life)
                  are structured “through and through by something akin to apostrophe,” and when she
                  suggests that apostrophe <em>automatically</em> animates, which is to say that it is a power over life without intentionality, deliberation,
                  or control, she seems to recognize the separability or division within life not as
                  something that could be gotten beyond or resolved, but as the very structure of life,
                  just as it is so central to language fraught between performative and constative powers.
                  The distinction essential to Agamben’s insight is not at all essential here. This
                  is the parallel of de Man’s understanding of death as a linguistic predicament, for
                  now <em>life</em> emerges as a linguistic predicament; and Johnson suggests that “it becomes impossible
                  to tell whether language is what gives life or what kills” (192). Johnson accounts
                  for language or the lyric subject as displacing sovereignty, operating as a power
                  to give or take life itself, rather than a power to kill, as under the older, premodern
                  model. Yet, it is not because of this impossibility of determining the nature of linguistic
                  power that there is a debate about abortion. Rather, what occurs in the sphere of
                  politics shares a structure with—indeed is—a linguistic predicament. Johnson reveals
                  that biopolitics, understood as this power over life, is indissociable from lyrical
                  language as a power over life. Thus, returning to my initial questions concerning
                  the concurrent emergence of biopower and romanticism as two nineteenth-century scenes
                  of power as making live, Johnson’s simultaneous reading of the romantic lyric and
                  <em>its</em> legacies with biopower and <em>its</em> legacies offers a clear response. Johnson’s reading of lyric apostrophe suggests
                  that the poetic and political preoccupation with life is not merely an historical
                  accident nor an occasion where poetry reflects the politics or culture of the age,
                  but rather that this convergence, through Johnson’s reading, reveals the lyrical structure
                  of biopolitics: biopolitics as a politics of apostrophe. In this sense, the politics
                  that Johnson identifies throughout her essay is an unmarked biopolitics, which is
                  structured like the lyric.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But Johnson’s essay does not stop here, for it challenges us to consider what happens
                     when this is the case, that is, when politics and poetry hinge upon apostrophe and
                     when making live becomes the operative mode of poetry and politics both. Johnson not
                     only perceives the conjunction of poetics and politics, but also exposes the implications
                     of this conjunction on conventional accounts of subjectivity. It is not just that
                     abortion poetry offers a particular case, and not only that debates about abortion
                     “hinge on a structure akin to apostrophe,” but she goes further to show that lyric
                     subjectivity as a variety of subjectivity more generally has hinged upon the assumption
                     or production of a life akin to the one ended in an abortion <em>or</em> survived in birth. It is this survival that Johnson reminds us Baudelaire flaunts
                     when he opens <em>Les Fleurs du Mal</em> by representing himself as a failed abortion, as an originary survivor. Johnson’s
                     insight, drawn from her reading of Baudelaire, is that something like fetal or embryonic
                     life remains the life of the lyric subject—even in its most quintessentially sovereign
                     form.

                              two figures of exception: the sovereign and so-called bare life. See Homo Sacer. Also,
                              it is worth noting that Johnson does not distinguish between embryo and fetus, a distinction
                              that is typically linked to gestational age. In this analysis the distinction is not
                              especially meaningful as what remains at stake is viability or the indistinction between
                              living and nonliving which is at issue whether the being is more or less than eight

                     </div> Lyric apostrophe assumes and produces the subject as fetal life. This is true not
                     only in poetry like Brooks’ that takes abortion as its theme, but as the reference
                     to Baudelaire and more generally to romantic and postromantic lyric poets reveals,
                     “fetality,” rather than sovereignty, is the position of the romantic lyric subject.

                     a paradox of lyric sovereignty (which is also political sovereignty) as positioning
                     the fetus and the (male) subject in the same position of fetality <span class="foreign">vis-à-vis</span> apostrophe.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Penelope Deutscher distinguishes this fetal life from the so-called bare life that
                  Agamben associates with biopolitics. For Deutscher, the distinction is a temporal
                  and categorical one: the fetus is a scene of contested life prior to loss or privation.
                  As she writes: “A consideration of fetal life does not fit the series [Muselmanner,
                  overcoma, etc.], as it usually is not situated at the threshold of depoliticization
                  or dehumanization of previously politicized or humanized life. The fetus represents
                  the zone of contested and intensified political stakes around the threshold between
                  what some would consider ‘prelife’ and what is to be identified as nascent human life,
                  meaningful human life, and/or rights-bearing life” (58). When Johnson reads Baudelaire
                  and Brooks, she identifies poetic life as a zone of fundamentally contested viability.
                  Yet the difference between Baudelaire and Brooks, on Johnson’s reading, is that whereas
                  lyric life and subjectivity in Baudelaire are issued from the position of a failed
                  abortion or fetal life, that of the child, for Brooks and Clifton and others it is
                  the position of a mother, albeit one who is not a mother, a mother of aborted or miscarried
                  children live only within the space of literature, and a mother whose position within
                  that space is at once always assumed and almost always denied. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In concluding the essay, Johnson builds upon this understanding to conceive of lyric
                     expression beyond that of the fetus/subject. Spawned by Brooks’ poem as well as other
                     poems of the same subgenre by Rich, Anne Sexton, and Lucille Clifton, poems in which
                     the subject is figured as a mother who is both addressed by and addresses herself
                     to her dead offspring, Johnson suggests that the entire history of the lyric—of poetry
                     or politics, insofar as it is bound up with calling, is the repetition of a primal
                     apostrophe, the entrance into language and subjection through a demand placed upon
                     the mother who is called upon to make the child live. These poems that remember the
                     stakes of apostrophe—poems issued in the voices of mothers addressed by children who
                     may never have lived—also reveal the structure of apostrophic animation. They suggest
                     that the hidden structure of the lyric and its mode of animation resembles and depends
                     upon a mother who is almost always unremarked. Johnson seems to suggest that were
                     we to recast our prevailing accounts of subjectivity, were we to recognize the place
                     of the lyric subject as one not of infinite substitution (“men have in a sense always
                     had no choice but to substitute something for the literal process of birth” [198]),
                     but rather of unsubstitutability, we might find a path outside that of childhood (or
                     masculine subjectivity). This suggests that we might come to recognize that the relation
                     of apostrophe to animation is a relation to motherhood itself.

                     indissociable from a maternal subject. It is also one that opens up a space for another
                     subject position: that of the mother who does not “make live” or who makes live that
                     which she also has let die, even if she may nor have killed.

                  <p>On Johnson’s reading apostrophe emerges as a maternal structure: if the lyric subject
                     is conventionally figured as a sovereign, and if rhetorical reading exposes instead
                     that it is variously a fetus, embryo, infant, or child, Johnson aims to break the
                     fetus-sovereign dyad by recognizing that what has not or cannot be said is that lyric
                     animation is akin to motherhood, that we ought to begin to see the lyric subject not
                     as a man or a child (which is to say a fetus), but as (or wanting to be) a mother.

                     </div> It is as if our failure to recognize the lyric subject as mother has left us with
                     a structure of animation that cannot but leave the subject a child whose viability
                     and power is in question.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Johnson exposes fetal life as the life of lyric subjectivity as we know it. Put otherwise,
                  it is this life that she reminds us Baudelaire already recognizes as the life of lyric
                  subjectivity when he refers to himself as an abortion manqué. Yet, the lyric subject
                  is a fetus only because we do not see it (or him) as a mother. Rather than an originary
                  split in life, we have an originary question of viability itself (and with it the
                  particularly complex question of rights) at the heart of the subject. Rather than
                  operating like other techniques of power over life, and rather than a symptom of romantic
                  ideology, for Johnson the lyric is the structure of this scene of indissociable power
                  and contestation. While Johnson sets out to revise this scene by focusing on the relation
                  of apostrophe to motherhood, in what follows, I wish to expand our thinking of apostrophe
                  and viability by considering a poem that couples the poetics of life with the history
                  of madness, a poem written by a subject who, like Baudelaire, often was figured as
                  a child, and yet whose own lyric productions recover not a mother, but an asylum.</p>

               <p>I opened with the observation that the romantic lyric emerges alongside biopower as
                  two forms of a power over life. Reading Johnson, I also considered how politics might
                  be seen to “hinge” on the structure of a poetic figure, and further that to recognize
                  this structure is to see poetry as assuming a life at the threshold of viability,
                  a situation that further conjoins poetry with biopolitics, at least in the version
                  articulated by Giorgio Agamben. In this last section I want to consider how this conjunction
                  of poetry and biopolitics also leads to a further development in our conception of
                  poetry, and how the lyric has a particularly direct relation to the shift from sovereignty
                  to biopower. For Johnson the presence of the lyric subject indicates the absence of
                  the mother, an absence that Johnson’s account of the lyric undertakes to remedy. This
                  recovery of the (theoretical) mother—the establishment a position where she can speak
                  and be addressed and the “achieve[ment] of a full elaboration of any discursive position
                  other than that of a child”—might go far in alleviating certain forms of personal
                  and cultural pathology. But if we were to accomplish this would it be the end of the
                  story? While, abortion—its poetry and politics - opens up one especially crucial case
                  for thinking about the poetics of animation and politics of life, the various forms
                  of social abandonment and questionable viability fostered by animating acts, whether
                  in politics or poetry, reveal another.</p>

                     </div> Clare wrote extensively while in the asylum, where he went largely unmonitored. While

                     preserved, an undated apostrophic lyric addressed “To Mary” is one of the hundreds
                     of poems that survive. “To Mary” conjoins apostrophe and “lunacy,” exposing an inherent
                     failure to arbitrate between the living and the dead or the self and another, as both
                     rhetorical effect and medical symptom. It is this disorder that the asylum is called
                     upon to manage, but like the lyric, instead sustains.

                     that leads to haunting, confusion, and enduring symptoms of madness.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Clare, famous first for being a <em>poor</em> poet and later, a <em>mad</em> one, archives this radical privation in a poem that strangely, even perversely, registers
                  the effects of making live. Like the abortion poems that Johnson reads, what we have
                  here is not simply an example of a personal intervention or an encounter with the
                  personal as political, but rather a poem that bears witness to the lyric and the asylum
                  as two scenes of managing life that both house and sustain a form a madness or haunting.
                  In fact, the relation in this case is even closer than first meets the eye, for this
                  poem, like all of those that survive Clare’s twenty-three year internment, comes to
                  us thanks to its transcription and preservation by the asylum’s steward, William Knight.
                  There is no remaining manuscript, only a transcript composed in Knight’s hand. “To
                  Mary” is therefore a poem whose survival is the effect of the very institution called
                  upon to keep Clare alive <em>and</em> separate him from the living; it is a poem that registers not the work of “madness
                  and civilization,” but of “madness and biopower,” and the apostrophic or biopoetic
                  structure of both.</p>

                     an inmate. “To Mary” is addressed to a girl that Clare loved in childhood, but whose
                     father prevented their marriage because of Clare’s low social standing and fate for
                     poverty.

               <p>As an apparently conventional love poem, one that assumes and reflects upon the communion

                  loss, presence and absence. As a stubborn account of survival—of life beyond life
                  and death—it also indicates the poetry and the politics that produces and sustains
                  a life perceived to be unfit for society. What we have here is neither a scene of
                  the mourning—fulfilled or not—of a maternal poetics (in which we would have to include
                  Victor Frankenstein), nor a strictly political exclusion that reveals the new politics
                  of public health. Rather, we encounter an apostrophic poetics in which making live
                  coincides with a denial of loss, but in which this denial, this insistent animation,
                  becomes unmanageable and emerges as a form of lunacy. Here poetry and mental illness
                  converge not only through the instruments of lyric, but also the instruments of biopower
                  that resemble them. In other words, the symptom and the remedy (if not the cure) are

                  <p>The poem opens with the chilling announcement—directed at its addressee—that while
                     the subject sleeps and wakes with Mary, she is not there. The poem candidly acknowledges
                     the failure of poetic address to solve the problem of absence or death (“and yet thou
                     art not there”), and likewise, the failure of absence or death to exhaust direct address
                     and the presence that it remarks and effects (“I sleep with thee and wake with thee”).
                     Thus, Mary is at once too resilient and utterly absent. We could say that Mary’s presence
                     is the effect of psychosis or delusion, <em>this</em> is why Clare is in the asylum, and not just the outcome of lyric surmise; and yet
                     we would be hard pressed to rigorously distinguish on the basis of this poem, between
                     madness and poetry. In fact this confusion comports with Roy Porter’s hesitations
                     about diagnostic readings of Clare, and Porter’s suggestion that what we call madness
                     in Clare might not be madness at all, just as it might suggest that there is a deeper
                     link between madness and apostrophe than we have hitherto suspected.

                     because of indicators outside of the poem rather than internal to it. Or, put another
                     way, it is a poem that reveals the conventions of the lyric to be indistinguishable
                     from those markers of mental disorder that are meaningful only outside of poetry,
                     rather than within it. However, in a case like Clare’s when the lyric becomes a vehicle
                     for autobiography, and indeed in any autobiographical or testimonial text that relies
                     upon lyric figures for its narration, what is at stake is not only the non-opposition

                  he fills his arms not with a body, but with “common air,” suggesting that it is both
                  quotidian and shared, the stuff of life that signals in this case the absence of the
                  living. And in a line that resonates with Wordsworth’s “A Slumber did my spirit seal,”
                  admits: “I think and speak of other things/To keep my mind at rest,” suggesting that
                  Mary, like Wordsworth’s Lucy, is “a thing,” that is, that she is not animate, even
                  as the entire poem is organized around managing the opposite statement. Thus, in a
                  third episode Clare is the object of Mary’s gaze, but a gaze that, far from direct
                  or reciprocal, occurs only when she is out of sight, which is to say, <em>always</em>. The first stanza also concludes with an infinite kiss, a gesture whose possibility
                  relies upon its impossibility and the absence of its recipient (or otherwise a death
                  that it would deliver). As an exercise in the temporal logic of presence and absence,
                  the infinite relation here is presented as an impossible one, one that we might also
                  call literary or poetic. In other words, the power over life described here occurs
                  only in and through poetry (or delusion): this is a life indifferent to certificates
                  of birth and death, statistics, or populations. And yet, it is the very condition
                  archived here, the very condition of a virulent apostrophe, that leads to the convergence
                  of poetry and politics as two scenes of animation, for it is this condition that shapes
                  Clare’s supposed inability to live among others and his removal in the name not only
                  of his own survival but theirs as well. He is unable or refuses to distinguish between
                  the living and the dead or, put another way, he is unable to choose to reside among
                  the living, and by failing to choose life, by staying with Mary (or by attaching himself
                  to the dead poets, like Shakespeare or Byron, whose poems he will “continue”), Clare
                  registers a poetry in which the lyric subject is absorbed by a loss in the dramas
                  of animation. And yet, this is precisely what all lyric poems do when they marshal
                  the powers of apostrophe. What Clare’s poem then reveals is another scene in the emergence
                  of the poetics of animation and the politics of life: a conjunction not only between
                  romanticism and madness, but romanticism and the asylum.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Returning to Clare’s poem, we can further specify its experience of apostrophe. If
                     this poem assumes the presence of its addressee, it also breaks the analogy between
                     life and presence, absence and death. Moreover, unlike Shelley or Brooks, Clare asks
                     nothing of his addressee, he merely describes his relation to her. (The nature of
                     this description nevertheless makes it seem a creepy demand.) In a move that seems
                     almost to concede, finally, the absence that the act of address rejects, a move that
                     also evokes some of the moments of strange concession that occur in Clare’s journals,
                     the poem leaves its addressee in a position of utter non-responsiveness, or to recall
                     the line I noted above, she becomes a <em>thing</em>, the matter of this address, rather than its addressee.

                              He decides she’s drunk or mad, and writes: “But when I was told it was my second wife

                  <p>In the poem, the solution is not to turn <em>to</em> the addressee. Recalling that other sense of apostrophe or trope as turning away,
                     Clare turns <em>away</em> from her (“I think and speak of other things/To keep my mind at rest”), whether for
                     his own sanity or out of fear of humiliation.

                     </div> Still, the permanent presence of the absent lover archived in the first stanza is
                     repeated in the second stanza where it is the poet’s memory that remains fixated,
                     even despite the effort to turn away. Here, the <em>subject</em> becomes the <em>object</em> of address, but it is not Mary who speaks or whose voice he hears. Rather he hears <em>of</em> her through the whispering wind. This is the convention of Clare’s contemporaries,
                     Wordsworth and Shelley, but also a convention that, as Johnson shows, Brooks reworks
                     by “textually placing aborted children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead,
                     inanimate, or absent entities previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Still, what
                     occurs here also differs from the address in the other poems, for it is not the addressee
                     who speaks—directly or indirectly—through or to the wind; it is not Mary’s voice that
                     Clare hears. Rather, the wind speaks to him in its “own” voice <em>of</em> Mary (“The night wind whispers in my ear…”). This apostrophe does <em>not</em> raise significant questions about the power to marshal life or death (Shelley) or
                     about the sovereignty of the lyric subject as poet or as mother (Brooks), but exposes
                     the subject’s impotence and haunting, rather than its ultimate power. It may be that
                     a weak or triangulated apostrophe, like this one, an apostrophe that breaks the dyadic
                     subjectivism of the conventional lyric reveals another poetics of life.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Clare reports to Mary that he hears tales told of her. She at once inhabits the position
                     of the second and third person, just as he inhabits the first and second persons (“All
                     sighing on, and will not hush, / Some pleasant tales of thee”). The tales are also
                     the return of what the subject attempts to repress or conceal, figuring yet another
                     scene of ineffectivity. Much as he tries to say something else, the tale of Mary can
                     be displaced, but not extinguished; he can voice it or hear it, but cannot abandon—or
                     be abandoned by—it. Put another way, the third stanza seems to describe a scene that
                     might be one of revelation—that might expose the ghostliness and disturbance of this
                     relation, as if he finally were to learn the truth of her absence and the mistake
                     of his assumption of her presence. However, what is revealed here is instead another
                     form of haunting. Still related to Mary, it is not she, only stories of her; her life
                     and voice are now displaced onto the nightscape. In a turn that already begins at
                     the end of the second stanza (“But soft, the wind comes from the sky,/And whispers
                     tales of Mary”), by the third stanza, the world has become animated once more in a
                     speaking scene that occludes the beloved. Mary’s absence is replaced by the “whispering”
                     and “sighing” of tales, what Sigi Jöttkandt calls Clare’s “mary-ing” of the world.

                     </div> While the poem initiates with a lyric address, by the end, the subject becomes the
                     addressee, and the addressee, far from disappearing, has become an object. While this
                     is the case in “Ode to the West Wind” and “The Mother,” here we are left to ask who
                     is addressing the subject? In this case we have not a mirroring, a reciprocal animation,
                     or even a crossing of lyric and maternal animation. Rather, when Clare thinks and
                     speaks “of other things,” when he turns from his beloved to the landscape, he finds
                     not that he has turned away, but the very resilience of this passionate attachment.
                     Yet who is attached to whom and how do we decipher a scene in which hyperanimation
                     has riven subject and object, person and place both?</p>
               </div>
               <p>It is this excessive animation that leaves Clare writing from the asylum, and it is
                  this mode of apostrophe that, like Johnson’s account of apostrophe in abortion poetry,
                  and for that matter, de Man’s account of death (and life) as a linguistic predicament
                  leads us to rethink the relation of lyric to life, apostrophe to sovereignty, for
                  it is anything but sovereignty that apostrophe in this instance seems to wield. Yet,
                  the risk of this non-sovereignty is that it remains tied to new institutions in which
                  the nourishment of life and violence against the living are conjoined. The lunatic
                  asylum is just one of these examples. It is the asylum that protects Clare from society,
                  preserves his poetry, transcribes and archives it, and yet that also keeps him from
                  seeing his family for over twenty years (from his commitment until his death). If
                  this poem bears witness to a poetics of life that breaks with the dyadic model, it
                  also can be seen to proliferate it, for when Clare describes the lyric subject as
                  the object of address he may already, proleptically be describing a structure of reception
                  in which his own voice becomes a “whisper” and in which is own poem comes to us in
                  a double form, borne by a writer who is ultimately not the poet, and another listener
                  who may or may not be its addressee: William Knight.</p>
               <p>Johnson’s reading of Brooks after Shelley and Baudelaire allows us to witness anew
                  the lyric structure of sovereignty—and to see in the place of the lyric subject, perceived
                  as sovereign (Mill) or as mute (de Man) before her, a subject whose very viability
                  is in question. My reading of Clare proposes another iteration of lyric subjectivity
                  as it relates to life. The poem seems to rely upon another dyad; no longer mother
                  (living)/child (dead) nor poet (living)/breeze (nonliving); but rather a more familiar
                  encounter between the lover and beloved. Yet here, the dyad, while utterly intense
                  dissipates into a scene in which <em>nothing</em> and no one can be fully recovered. Here, uncertain viability is shared between the
                  poet and addressee; just as the power of over life is shared between the poet, his
                  steward, and the whispering breeze. This whispering also returns us to the question
                  of life. It leads not only to poetic fame or posthumous life (as in the case of Shelley
                  or Wordsworth), but also to what Joao Biehl has called “social abandonment” or actual
                  incarceration, to a life lived in the asylum. Indeed, behind the relation of lover
                  and beloved, here, there is the relation of inmate and asylum. The inmate who suffers
                  from a confusion of voices, a loss of his actual loved ones, not only his fictional
                  lover, and the disappearance of his manuscript. Yet, a typescript and a place in the
                  archive replace the absent manuscript, a freedom of mobility and protection from worry
                  and poverty substitute for the loss of family and obligation. If these substitutions
                  are forms of “making live” they also bear the structure of an apostrophe, like the
                  one in “To Mary,” that sustains, rather than remedies a malady.</p>
               <p>What kind of power of or over life is the lyric? Thanks to de Man and Johnson, we
                  have seen how this power can be alternatively, even simultaneously restorative and
                  privative, how it can refigure or transfigure the subject exposing the question of
                  her very viability. Yet with Clare we see how lyric sovereignty dissipates into voices
                  everywhere, and how the question of poetic power intersects with that of biopower,
                  with the rise of the Victorian asylum that became this poet’s place. In other words,
                  developing Agamben’s account of the structure of <span class="foreign">homo sacer</span> into a poetic claim, we also see how sovereignty and abandonment share a rhetoric;
                  how the lyric is one manifestation of this rhetoric; and how, at least in this case,
                  independent of an originary fissure in the meaning of life we have instead the birth
                  of biopoetics, not a literary biopolitics or a biopolitics of literature, but a lyric
                  thinking life itself.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Coda</span></h2>
               <p>In 1999, Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner published a collection of essays entitled
                  <em>Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts</em>. In an introductory essay, “Biopoetics: The New Synthesis,” Cooke outlines the theory
                  of sociobiology (or evolutionary psychology) upon which the essays collected in the
                  volume rely, and suggests that the aim of biopoetics is to “seek artistic universals
                  and features that reflect our common humanity” (5). In establishing the term <em>biopoetics</em>, he explains: “I propose that we add the prefix ‘bio’ to the Aristotelian root ‘poetics,’
                  a word which describes the science of at least one art—there is no English term for
                  the study of <em>all</em> the arts. Derived from the Greek word for making, ‘poetic’ also refers to our impulse
                  to create beauty. We then nominate the term ‘biopoetics’” (6). Here, biopoetics is
                  a name for the evolutionary account of aesthetics. This <em>biopoetics</em>, while in no way evoking <em>biopolitics</em>, as elaborated by Foucault, Agamben, and others, nevertheless shares with these approaches
                  a focus on new scenes of scientific method. For <em>biopoetics</em>, in this sense, it is a matter of using scientific method to understand the emergence
                  of art as a living thing; for <em>biopolitics</em>, in the sense offered by Foucault, it is matter of recognizing how the sciences of
                  demography and public health, among others, obtain a new power over life and the living.
                  Yet, the example of another, critical biopoetics, which this essay has sought to isolate,
                  begins to tell another story, one attuned to a rhetoric of figure and to the question
                  of literature’s power over life. By taking seriously the relation of lyric animation
                  to the politics of life, we discover the example, not only of a haunting that poetry
                  fails to manage (Johnson, Brooks), but also a mode of subjectivity at the threshold
                  of viability and survival. For Clare, this is manifest as delusion and madness, as
                  the failure to distinguish between what is living and dead and the emergence of the
                  poetic subject not merely as madman, but as psychiatric object. If biopoetics in this
                  sense returns us to Foucault’s biopolitics, then, it does so by exposing a new humanistic
                  method. This is the inverse of the biopoetics formulated by Turner and Cooke. For
                  rather than dismissing literary criticism and theory—whether in the name of natural
                  or social scientific method—it reaffirms literary criticism’s uncanny ability to say
                  something about life.</p>
               <p>When E.O. Wilson, on the jacket of Cooke and Turner’s <em>Biopoetics</em>, writes that he can see the methods proposed there “taking over from deconstruction
                  by 2010, and permanently,” he advocates a methodological turn away from the linguistic
                  and other turns that have marked humanistic method since the 1970s. As 2010 draws
                  toward a close, the prediction seems not to have borne out. It is time therefore that
                  we begin to recognize another biopoetics. Not the biopoetics of evolutionary arts,
                  but of the conjunction of rhetorical and biopolitical reading. This biopoetics sets
                  out, as this essay set out, by admitting two scenes of making live, and it concludes
                  by exposing the impossibility of a politics of life or a science of literature that
                  would be free from poetics.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For further discussion of <em>Frankenstein </em>and biopolitics, see the chapter “Testimony and Trope in <em>Frankenstein</em>” in my <em>Romanticism After Auschwitz</em>. While most examples of lyric life are not concerned with the species, <em>Frankenstein</em> is a notable exception, as it is precisely man as species and its future that is
               at issue throughout the novel. Furthermore, other iterations of biopolitics, notably
               that of Giorgio Agamben, are not focused on the question of species (or human as species),
               but rather of the human and its political possibility and impossibility. For a discussion
               of the difference between a power <em>of</em> life and a power <em>over</em> life, see Roberto Esposito.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">See Berlant, “Slow Death” and Santner, <em>The People’s Two Bodies</em>. For an account of romanticism attuned to the rhetoric of species and at odds with
               conventional characterizations, see Alastair Hunt, <em>The Rhetoric of Romantic Species</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">See Cynthia Chase, Marc Redfield. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">“Uncontained” is Carol Jacobs’ term, see her <em>Uncontainable Romanticism</em>. This point can be read to resonate with one of Agamben’s criticisms of Foucault,
               that what he identifies as a modern emergence, in fact has an ancient origin.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">See the lecture of 17 March 1976, where Foucault apologizes for “this long digression
               on biopower” (254). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Foucault is of course aware of this uncontainment, and his example of Franco’s death
               “and the symbolic values it brings into play” in the lectures on 1975-76 offers one
               example. <em>Society Must be Defended</em>, 248.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Agamben suggests that Foucault doesn’t do this sufficiently. Also, Penelope Deutscher
               persuasively considers the reasons why Agamben never takes up the matter of abortion—in
               part the complexity of analogizing abortion and the Holocaust, an analogy which is
               the bread-and-butter of the anti-abortion movement and something one would not want
               to touch. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">This is a prescient precursor to Agamben’s account of the indistinction between the
               two figures of exception: the sovereign and so-called bare life. See <em>Homo Sacer</em>. Also, it is worth noting that Johnson does not distinguish between embryo and fetus,
               a distinction that is typically linked to gestational age. In this analysis the distinction
               is not especially meaningful as what remains at stake is viability or the indistinction
               between living and nonliving which is at issue whether the being is more or less than
               eight weeks in utero.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">For another account of the centrality of the mother to romantic subjectivity, see
               Cathy Caruth, “Past Recognition: Narrative Origins in Wordsworth and Freud.” </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">These formulations evoke Agamben’s account of homo sacer as a life that can be killed
               but not sacrificed. See Deutscher for a speculative discussion of Agamben’s avoidance
               of abortion in the <span class="foreign">Homo Sacer</span> volumes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Of course, Wordsworth had a strong sense of the lyric subject as child. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">See Joanna Ball’s discussion of the asylum and its commitment to a “gentle” system
               of care and Jonathan Bate’s description of the asylum’s “liberal regime” (469). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">On the intake form at the lunatic asylum, Clare’s condition is understood as associated
               with and preceded by “years addicted to poetical prosing” (qtd in Bate, 466). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Sigi Jöttkandt, <em>First Love: A Phenomenology of the One</em>. Melbourne: Re-Press, 2010. Jöttkandt recalls that Clare believed he was confined
               in the asylum because of his polygamy.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               he writes describes his entry into his village and a woman jumps out to great him.
               He decides she’s drunk or mad, and writes: “But when I was told it was my <span style="text-decoration:underline">second</span> wife Patty I got in and was soon at Northborough, but Mary was not there, neither
               could I get any information about her further other than the old story of her being
               dead six years ago, which might be taken from a bran new old newspaper printed a dozen
               years ago, but I took no notice of the blarney having seen her myself about a twelvemonth
