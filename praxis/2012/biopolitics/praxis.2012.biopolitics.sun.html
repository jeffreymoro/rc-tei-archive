               <p>The famous distinction John Stuart Mill makes in his 1833 essay, 
                  “What is Poetry?”
                  —between eloquence as "heard" and poetry as "<em>over</em>heard"—is subtended by a theatrical metaphor whereby the young political philosopher
                  attempts to reimagine, in aesthetic terms, the organization of the nation. In making
                  the distinction, Mill contrasts two ways of speaking correlative to two interlinked
                  models of theatricality: in "nations" that excel at eloquence, the citizen as actor-spectator
                  addresses himself to the "feelings of others" on whom he depends for "applause," "sympathy,"
                  and "concurrence"; in "nations" that excel at poetry, the citizen turns away from
                  directly addressing the audience of his fellows to cultivate in solitude the expression
                  of private feelings the utterance of which constitutes its own end (110). Mill compares
                  the latter to “soliloquy,” with poetry in print being “a soliloquy in full dress,
                  and upon the stage” (109). Poetry, in this formulation, does not simply consist of
                  an anti-theatrical turn away from the public realm of eloquent discourse but, paradoxically,
                  inhabits and participates obliquely in this realm.</p>
               <p>
                  “What is Poetry?”
                  may be said to adumbrate a theater of poetic citizenship. Mill imagines citizens as
                  actors and spectators who perceive and become perceptible to one another as participants
                  in public, communal life, but he qualifies his conception of the citizen as an actor-spectator
                  with a conception of this citizen as an invisible speaker and eavesdropper. The present
                  essay aims to reconsider Mill’s political theatrical imagination in the context of
                  the genealogy of modern biopolitics and in relation to its two main influences–the
                  panopticist theater of Benthamite utilitarianism that Mill inherits and attempts to
                  revise, and the Wordsworthian strategy he adapts to formulate this revision.</p>
               <p>In a series of letters written in 1787, Bentham presented his design of the <em>Panopticon, or The Inspection-House</em>. An architectural proposal aimed at the construction of penitentiaries, this design
                  applied also to workhouses, madhouses, hospitals, factories, and schools. The paradigmatic
                  building would be circular, with an inspector’s lodge at the center. Between the center
                  and the circumference would be vacant space. Around the circumference would be distributed
                  the solitary cells of prisoners, workers, or inmates, each divided from the other
                  “by <em>partitions</em> in the form of <em>radii</em> issuing from the circumference towards the centre” (40). The principal advantage
                  of this plan, according to Bentham, is the “<em>apparent omnipresence</em> of the inspector…combined with the extreme facility of his <em>real presence</em>”; and a collateral advantage is “on the score of frugality,” for the schema would
                  require a minimum number of inspectors and administrators to function (45). Bentham
                  praises the elegance and efficiency of his own design in the Preface: “<em>Morals reformed–health preserved–industry invigorated–instruction diffused–public
                     burthens lightened–Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock</em>” (30). The panopticon, for Bentham, promotes the betterment of the community insofar
                  as it offers a greater number of members of the community the power to augment their
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>As Foucault argues in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, the panopticon is exemplary among the instruments and techniques invented in the
                  eighteenth century that accompanied the formation of a new disciplinary society that
                  wields power over subjects through relations of discipline rather than, as in the
                  previous era, relations of sovereignty. This new society organized, categorized, and
                  systematically produced subjects through such disciplinary institutions as factories,
                  schools, clinics, barracks, and prisons. Subsequently, in his 1977-8 lectures, <em>Security, Territory, Population</em>, Foucault would turn his attention from the emergence and operations of disciplinary
                  institutions per se to the concept of “population” that in the late eighteenth century
                  made possible what he calls a new “governmentality.” Linked with the spread of disciplinary
                  institutions, the concept of “population” subjected human beings to mathematization
                  and made them the objects of statistical calculability. “Population” functions as
                  the basis for the development of techniques, e.g., the Census in Britain, first taken
                  in 1801, whereby government undertakes to administer and regulate the very biological
                  existence of its citizens. The new governmentality, according to Foucault, is a bio-governmentality.</p>
               <p>In his 1978-9 lectures, <em>The Birth of Biopolitics</em>, Foucault advances the further claim that liberalism serves as the very framework
                  of this new bio-governmentality. Treating liberalism, construed as essentially capitalist,
                  as a development continuous with utilitarianism, Foucault discerns as the “fundamental
                  question of liberalism” the following: “What is the utility value of government and
                  all actions of government in a society where exchange determines the true value of
                  things?” (46). The new governmentality is oriented by the privileging of the market
                  as site of “veridiction,” or the determination of value, and hence source of criteria
                  for judgment. This new governmentality is “frugal”: government is to be limited and
                  evaluated according to the utility and efficiency with which it administers to the
                  needs of a population. According to this model, the task of government is to take
                  care of the necessities of life as if they belonged to a sphere separate and distinct
                  from the realm of freedom, which would be located beyond governmental jurisdiction
                  in the private sector. Where government ends, freedom begins. In accordance with the
                  logic of the market cycle, this liberalist freedom is, for Foucault, a freedom to
                  consume. “The new governmental reason needs freedom, therefore, the new art of government
                  consumes freedom,” writes Foucault, “It consumes freedom, which means that it must
                  produce it…The formula of liberalism is not ‘be free.’ Liberalism formulates simply
                  the following: I am going to produce what you need to be free. I am going to see to
                  it that you are free to be free” (63). Liberalism concerns itself, then, with the
                  delimitation of government according to the usefulness and efficiency of the latter’s
                  institutions and practices in securing freedom as promise and end of government.</p>
               <p>This liberalist delimitation presents a reconfiguration of what Arendt describes in
                  <em>The Human Condition</em> as the classical relationship between the <span class="foreign">polis</span> and the <span class="foreign">oikos</span> or household in ancient Greece. “The realm of the <span class="foreign">polis</span>,” she writes, “was the sphere of freedom,” while the household was the site where
                  the necessities of life were taken care of as the “condition for freedom of the <span class="foreign">polis</span>…What all Greek philosophers…took for granted is that freedom is exclusively located
                  in the political realm, that necessity is primarily a prepolitical phenomenon, characteristic
                  of the private household organization” (30-1). In modern liberalism, government assumes
                  the tasks of the <span class="foreign">oikos</span>, extending its activity or power into areas of life previously deemed pre- or non-political.
                  No longer the sphere of freedom, the <span class="foreign">polis</span> loses its hierarchical privilege and becomes conflated with the household to serve
                  the function of making its subjects, in Foucault’s formulation, “free to be free”–to
                  exercise such freedoms as “freedom of the market, freedom to buy and sell, the free
                  exercise of property rights, freedom of discussion, possible freedom of expression,
                  and so on” (63).</p>
               <p>The market, in Foucault’s analysis, emerged as the privileged site that governs and
                  gives value to public, communal life. The conflation of the <span class="foreign">polis</span> and the <span class="foreign">oikos</span> subordinates both to the market insofar as it serves to produce and uphold the conditions
                  for freedom as, specifically, the freedom to participate in activities related to
                  exchange and consumption. Liberalism, as the framework of bio-governmentality, enables
                  the citizen to be free to act and to appear in the market as paradigmatic public space
                  that has displaced the position of the <span class="foreign">polis</span> in ancient Greece. This public space is not political in the classical sense but
                  rather apolitical or even anti-political. In Arendtian terms, it corresponds rather
                  to the category of the social, insofar as “[s]ociety is the form in which the fact
                  of mutual dependence for the sake of life and nothing else assumes public significance
                  and where the activities connected with sheer survival are permitted to appear in
                  public” (46).</p>
               <p>Benthamite panopticism serves as an instrument of the liberalist utilitarian framework
                  of bio-governmentality by operating at the nexus of the governmental and the social.
                  It functions as an instrument of government and caters to the needs of a population
                  by organizing, regulating, and maximizing the efficiency of such disciplinary institutions.
                  And it performs the function of producing and regulating the conditions for subjects
                  to appear to each other in public, managing the terms of perceptibility whereby subjects
                  may exercise their freedom to participate in the activities of exchange and consumption
                  and derive value from such activity. Benthamite panopticism is the principle in the
                  eighteenth century behind a bio-political dramaturgy of public, communal life. </p>
               <p>In her invigorating reconsideration of utilitarianism and pornography as parallel
                  eighteenth-century developments, Frances Ferguson argues that the achievement of Benthamite
                  utilitarianism was to move politics away from the traditional emphasis on individual
                  beliefs, identities, and essences to the discussion of the social value of actions
                  that acquire significance and exert effects within a relativizing system. In contrast
                  to Rousseau’s notion of the social contract, which “could not be connected with a
                  sensible meaning,” Bentham’s experiments with social structures, Ferguson argues,
                  were “an effort to replace a metaphysical account of the general will with a physical
                  account of how the preferences of a group might visit themselves on individuals” (15).
                  Benthamite social structures–the classroom, the workhouse, and the prison–correlate
                  individuals with the groups in which they temporarily participate. The actions of
                  individuals are evaluated in relation to the group, and the possibility of new actions
                  likewise arises in relation to the actions of one’s group or another contiguous to
                  it. What makes the system work is the high degree of perceptibility it relies on.
                  Benthamite panopticism serves to engineer “an array of systematic social practices
                  that have made it possible for us to evaluate individuals by making their actions
                  look as though they could plausibly be described in terms of their perceptibility
                  and value in public” (xv). It serves to “<em>give social groups the means to make themselves felt by individuals.</em> Such representations…must present the artificial reason that they embody in strongly
                  perceptible terms. They must promulgate order–but, more, visible order. They must
                  create perceptibility for purely social productions–hierarchy, rank order, and social
                  evaluation” (15).</p>
               <p>For Ferguson, Benthamite utilitarianism reconstituted public, communal life by organizing
                  individuals into highly perceptible social groups within which they may move vertically
                  and between which they may move laterally, e.g., from school to hospital, in accordance
                  with procedures of evaluation. This reconstitution of public, communal life is egalitarian
                  insofar as it gives a greater number of individuals social mobility and the freedom
                  to act and appear to others in ways that are no longer determined by birth or rank.
                  If the <span class="foreign">polis</span> was in ancient Greece the sphere of freedom, it functioned as such for the few, whose
                  freedom was supported by the labor and work of women and slaves, who administered
                  to the necessities of life in the private realm of the household. The conflation of
                  the <span class="foreign">polis</span> and the <span class="foreign">oikos</span> in liberal utilitarianism achieves the result of allowing the entry of the many into
                  public, communal life. This articulation of public, communal life is constrained,
                  however, by the fluctuating criteria of the market as site of a bio-politically promised
                  and produced freedom. Ferguson’s interpretation of Benthamite utilitarianism underlines
                  how much we remain shaped by and inscribed within its legacy, and how the critical
                  effort to go beyond the version of freedom it promises and produces must reckon with
                  and acknowledge its structuring efficacy.</p>
               <p>The scaffolding of panopticism is evident throughout texts by John Stuart Mill, who
                  bears the distinction of having been pre-eminent proponent, symptomatic subject, and
                  revisionist critic of liberal utilitarianism. Trained by his father from early childhood
                  to become a “Benthamite reasoning machine,” Mill was caught and inscribed like none
                  other within the framework of utilitarian social engineering (111). He gives an account
                  of this formation in his <em>Autobiography</em>, published posthumously in 1873, as well as of his effort to exceed its limitations
                  via an emphasis on poetry as “not only on a par with, but the necessary condition
                  of, any true and comprehensive Philosophy” (131). I would like to revisit this account
                  before turning to passages from 
                  “What is Poetry?”
                  and the 1859 essay <em>On Liberty</em> to examine more closely Mill’s interrogation of the limits of bio-political subject
                  formation.</p>
               <p>Mill’s <em>Autobiography</em>, as many readers have noted, is a strangely reserved and impersonal text. In a tone
                  at odds with expectations concerning the genre, Mill writes in the prologue: “I do
                  not for a moment imagine that any part of what I have to relate, can be interesting
                  to the public as a narrative, or as being connected with myself” (6). He announces,
                  rather, that he has written the text as the story of an education. His insistent aim
                  is to portray himself as a lifelong student, his mind “equally ready to learn and
                  to unlearn either from its own thoughts or from those of others” (25). Mill addresses
                  his readers insofar as they may be interested in the topic of education in an age
                  in which “education, and its improvement, are the subject of more, if not of profounder
                  study than at any former period of English history” (25). He alludes here to mid-century
                  debates about national education in England, which led up to the 1870 Education Act,
                  presenting his story in the context of these debates to justify its usefulness and
                  interest to the reading public.</p>
               <p>In its narrative structure, the <em>Autobiography</em> follows in the tradition of spiritual autobiography to take the shape of a conversion
                  narrative. The first four chapters tell of Mill’s childhood and early education, and
                  his self-education as a youth; they are dominated by the figure of his father, James
                  Mill, as his formative, initiatory teacher. Chapter V, 
                  “A Crisis in my Mental History,”
                  occupies a pivotal position in the text and relates “the important transformation
                  in [his] opinions and character” that took place when Mill was in his early 20s. Mill
                  recounts falling into a serious depression, and being aided in his recovery by Wordsworth’s
                  poems, which offered “a medicine for my state of mind” and would form “the occasion
                  of my first public declaration of my new way of thinking” (121-2). In the last two
                  chapters, Mill introduces Harriet Taylor Mill, his wife, as the second of his two
                  most important teachers. From her he would learn, through the mode of conversation,
                  in a substantially different style than from his father. In between , Wordsworth’s
                  poetry appears to have effected a break and transition: the reading of Wordsworth
                  made possible for Mill a displacement of his father’s model of education and authority.</p>
               <p>Bentham’s oldest collaborator, James Mill was also a close associate of Ricardo and
                  Malthus in the circles of philosophical radicalism. His reformist agenda manifested
                  itself in his own household as an experiment to educate his eldest son in accordance
                  with his idea of a reformer–to the effect that John Stuart Mill recalls having in
                  his youth the reputation of being a “‘made’ or manufactured man” (126). Mill was immersed
                  in an intense curriculum that involved beginning Greek at age three, reading the whole
                  of Herodotus, the first six dialogues of Plato, among numerous other texts, before
                  age eight, when he began studying Latin and advancing, in another area, from arithmetic
                  to Euclid and algebra. In his account of his childhood, Mill notably does not mention
                  his mother and refers to his younger siblings only insofar as he was delegated the
                  responsibility, at age eight, to begin tutoring them in their studies. He was isolated
                  from other boys because his father, as he recollects, was “earnestly bent upon my
                  escaping not only the ordinary corrupting influence which boys exercise over boys,
                  but the contagion of vulgar modes of thought and feeling” (47). The education was
                  unusual and remarkable on several counts: the early age of Mill’s initiation into
                  various courses of study, the sheer voluminousness of what was prescribed for him,
                  his isolation from others, and the totalizing rigor of his analytical training. </p>
               <p>The Mill household resembles in Mill’s description a micro-panopticist institution,
                  with his father occupying the central position of the inspector. Mill recalls the
                  ubiquitous presence of his father, noting how he himself “went through the whole process
                  of preparing my Greek lessons in the same room and at the same table at which he was
                  writing” (28). Even on morning walks with his father, Mill would have no break from
                  his schedule of study but give reports of what he had read the day before. Besides
                  being constantly monitored, he was called upon to oversee his siblings by teaching
                  them when he reached the age of eight; and his siblings were asked subsequently to
                  repeat the lessons to their father as part of a two-tier evaluation process. “It was
                  a part which I greatly disliked,” he admits, “the more so, as I was held responsible
                  for the lessons of my pupils, in almost as full a sense as my own” (30-1). In relation
                  to his father as chief inspector, Mill was assigned the part of a subordinate. The
                  household functioned as a site contiguous with and structurally similar to social
                  institutions and served as a preparatory space that mediated Mill’s entry into public,
                  communal life. </p>
               <p>This strenuous pedagogical program launched Mill on a precocious career as a public
                  advocate of utilitarianism. Writing for newspapers and organizing the Utilitarian
                  Society before age twenty, Mill thought he had before him “an object in life”–“to
                  be a reformer of the world. My conception of my own happiness was entirely identified
                  with this object” (111). He recollects, however, finding one day in the autumn of
                  1826 the insubstantiality of this conception of happiness: “the whole foundation on
                  which my life was constructed fell down…I seemed to have nothing left to live for”
                  (112). </p>
               <p>In the wake of this crisis, he found relief in reading Marmontel and Byron but singles
                  out, above all, Wordsworth’s poetry–especially <em>Poems 1815</em>–as essential to his recovery. In describing his reading of Wordsworth, Mill uses
                  the language of didacticism, remarking that “Wordsworth taught me this” (121) and
                  writing about “the way in which he was now teaching me to find it” (121). He accounts
                  for the therapeutic efficacy of Wordsworth’s poetry by pointing to the poet’s description
                  of rural objects and natural scenery, in which he himself was also wont to take pleasure.
                  But, more importantly, Wordsworth’s poems do not just express “mere outward beauty”
                  but “states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of
                  beauty” (121). Expressivism is not, however, the final criterion for Mill’s judgment
                  of the poetry’s therapeutic power, for “poetry of deeper and loftier feeling could
                  not have done for me at that time what his did” (121). What Mill claims he learns
                  from none other than Wordsworth is that “there was real, permanent happiness in tranquil
                  contemplation. Wordsworth taught me this, not only without turning away from, but
                  with a greatly increased interest in, the common feelings and common destiny of human
                  beings” (121).</p>
               <p>The summation of Wordsworth’s lesson Mill finds in the 
                  “Immortality Ode,”
                  in which “I found that he too had had similar experience to mine; that he also had
                  felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that
                  he had sought for compensation, and found it, in the way in which he was now teaching
                  me to find it” (122). Mill accentuates here the parallelism of experience between
                  himself and Wordsworth, who in a similar mood had asked, “whither is fled the visionary
                  gleam?,” and who Mill sees as “teaching” the reader “now” a means of restoration.
                  In Wordsworth he claims to have found a fellow and a teacher whose poetic lesson relieves
                  him from the effects of his utilitarian formation. His narrative dates back to this
                  period a turn in which the “cultivation of the feelings became one of the cardinal
                  points in my ethical and philosophical creed,” and from which he would re-enter and
                  seek to re-articulate the terms and conditions governing public, communal life (147).</p>
               <p>Mill writes of his fellowship with Wordsworth in an autobiographical text that shows
                  obvious structural affinity with the latter’s poems of crisis and restoration, including
                  the 
                  “Immortality Ode”
                  and, in book length, the 1850 <em>Prelude</em>. Significantly, Wordsworth’s narratives of crisis and restoration do not simply parallel
                  Mill’s story but, indeed, <em>inhabit</em> it as that which mediates Mill’s restoration. Mill’s account of reading Wordsworth
                  reverberates <span class="foreign">passim</span> with Wordsworthian formulations. His description of Wordsworth’s poems as expressions
                  of “states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of
                  beauty,” echoes Wordsworth’s definition of poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of
                  powerful feelings,” and he repeats Wordsworth in his insistence on the importance
                  of “tranquil contemplation.” His claim that Wordsworth’s poems were “a source of inward
                  joy, of sympathetic and imaginative pleasure,” attest to his assimilation of the language
                  of such poems as “Tintern Abbey” and “I wandered lonely as a cloud.” His very language
                  of restoration–“Wordsworth’s poems [were] a medicine for my state of mind”–and his
                  figuration of Wordsworth as teacher redouble Wordsworth’s own tropes.</p>
               <p>The <span class="foreign">locus classicus</span> of Wordsworth’s language of restoration is, of course, the passage on “spots of time”
                  in Book XII of the 1850 <em>Prelude</em>, in which the poet-narrator attributes to them “a renovating virtue” and the capacity
                  for “our minds” to be thence “nourished and invisibly repaired” (XII.210, 215). These
                  “spots of time” the poet-narrator would “enshrine” as “the spirit of the Past/ For
                  future restoration” (XII.285-6). On one level, the term designates memories from the
                  poet’s past, on another, the very lyrical passages that render these memories as “spectacles
                  and sounds” strewn episodically throughout the poem. The passage provides meta-poetic
                  commentary on the formal structure of <em>The Prelude</em> itself, articulating the new poetics the very discovery of which the poem seeks to
                  narrate.</p>
               <p>This discovery coincides with the poet-narrator’s resolution to write a “poetry of
                  Nature” founded on the premise that “love of Nature” leads necessarily to “love of
                  Man.” The poet aims to show how “Nature” may serve as the basis for a new claim to
                  community. The most important and, at the same time, most unstable of terms in Wordsworth,
                  “Nature” designates in the exegeses of Abrams and Hartman, the uncertain relationship
                  between sense perception and sense. It is precisely in cases of the disjunction between
                  sense perception and sense, between the apprehension through the senses of the external
                  world and the capacity of the mind to make sense of the data, that “Nature” “teaches”
                  most powerfully; and it is often such disjunctions that are registered as “spots of
                  time.” To such “spots” the poet returns for future restoration as to inexhaustible
                  because essentially enigmatic sources. When he writes, “There are in <em>our</em> existence spots of time,” Wordsworth not only implies, on an individual psychological
                  level, that everyone, like him, has spots of time in his or her own life but that
                  his poems may serve as such for the reader.</p>
               <p>Mill assimilates to his own prose Wordsworth’s language of restoration. Where Wordsworth
                  makes “Nature” guide and source of renovation, Mill substitutes “poetry.” “Poetry”
                  as “instrument of human culture” plays in Mill’s new “ethical and philosophical creed”
                  a function analogous to “Nature” in Wordsworth’s poetry (147). In making this substitution,
                  Mill appropriates and displaces Wordsworth’s reflections on his own poetry for an
                  attempt to modify utilitarian thought by aesthetic means.</p>
               <p>
                  “What is Poetry?,”
                  published in 1833 in conjunction with the essay, 
                  “The Two Kinds of Poetry,”
                  marked Mill’s earliest engagement with questions of aesthetics. While the definition
                  of poetry Mill proposes there is most often linked with Wordsworth’s lyric practice,
                  it is important to note that Mill not only does not mention Wordsworth but does not
                  even define poetry in formal or generic terms. Rather, he defines poetry as a specific
                  mode of expression or utterance that may occur outside lyric poetry proper in other
                  genres such as drama, the novel, and narrative poetry; and in other arts such as music
                  and opera, as well as painting, sculpture, and architecture. In distinction to poetry,
                  Mill contrasts narrative, simple imitation or description, and, finally, eloquence
                  or oratory, elements of which, he claims, can be found in varying combination in different
                  works of art across the multiple arts. The last of these modes of speech, eloquence,
                  Mill finds closest to poetry insofar as eloquence and poetry both consist of “the
                  expression or uttering forth of feeling” (109). In contrast, narrative, for instance,
                  is directed towards “action and events,” not feeling (107).</p>
               <p>At the climactic point of the essay, Mill writes, “eloquence is <em>heard</em>, poetry is <em>over</em>heard” (107). In elaborating on this distinction, he uses a theatrical metaphor, invoking
                  in relation to these modes of speech “audience” and “listener.” “Eloquence,” Mill
                  distinguishes, <span class="quote">‘supposes an audience; the peculiarity of poetry appears to us to lie in the poet’s
                     utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling confessing itself to itself,
                     in moments of solitude, and bodying itself forth in symbols which are the nearest
                     possible representations of the feeling in the exact shape in which it exists in the
                     poet’s mind. Eloquence is feeling pouring itself forth to other minds, courting their
                     sympathy, or endeavoring to influence their belief, or move them to passion or to
                     action. (109)’</span> The figure of theater comes to the fore when he claims, “All poetry is of the nature
                  of soliloquy. It may be said that poetry, which is printed on hot-pressed paper, and
                  sold at a bookseller’s shop, is a soliloquy in full dress, and upon the stage” (109).</p>
               <p>The distinction between poetry and eloquence serves in turn as the basis for a theatrical
                  articulation of the “nation” itself: <span class="quote">‘The persons, and the nations, who commonly excel in poetry, are those whose character
                     and tastes render them least dependent for their happiness upon the applause, or sympathy,
                     or concurrence of the world in general. Those to whom that applause, that sympathy,
                     that concurrence are most necessary, generally excel most in eloquence. (110)’</span> Mill juxtaposes here two theatrically conceived versions of communal life that bespeak
                  two articulations of happiness: one in which happiness consists of the opening up,
                  through poetry, of the possibility for new and unprecedented feelings, and one in
                  which happiness consists of the circulation and endorsement of feelings that have
                  already been in circulation.</p>
               <p>This contrast anticipates to some degree Mill’s critique of a society regulated by
                  “custom” versus a society of individualist self-expression in the essay <em>On Liberty</em>. In a famous passage, Mill imagines the members of a society regulated by “custom”
                  as inhabitants of a panopticist structure. In this space, <span class="quote">‘from the highest class…down to the lowest, everyone lives as under the eye of a hostile
                     and dreaded censorship. Not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only
                     themselves, the individual or the family do not ask themselves, what do I prefer?
                     Or, what would suit my character and disposition? Or, what would allow the best and
                     highest in me to have fair play and enable it to grow and thrive? They ask themselves,
                     what is suitable to my position? What is usually done by persons of my station and
                     pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station
                     and circumstance superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is customary
                     in preference to what suits their own inclination. It does not occur to them to have
                     any inclination except for what is customary. (88)’</span> Public, communal life is here articulated in terms of a circular, tower-like construction
                  ruled by a central and elevated gaze that defines hierarchy and order. The inhabitants
                  of this vertically arranged society are all alike preoccupied with rank; whatever
                  class they come from, they are concerned alike with the actions and behavior appropriate
                  to their socio-economic circumstances and to those in the tier above them. All alike
                  are governed by what is expected of their group by “custom,” or received opinions
                  that have become unexamined criteria and grounds for action.</p>
               <p>For its operation, “custom” depends on the central and elevated gaze, the internalization
                  of which is manifest in the questions Mill ventriloquistically has the individual
                  or the family asking themselves. These questions constitute the verbal and audible
                  complement (though the speech may take the form of inner monologue) to the visibility
                  of the individual or the family to the “eye of censorship.” The individual or the
                  family are visible not only to that central gaze but to other individuals and families,
                  of whatever rank, that are likewise oriented by that gaze. It is this visibility that
                  determines the kind of questions that get asked, and it is this visibility that denies
                  the posing of the questions concerning individual preference and disposition. By implication,
                  it might seem that a certain invisibility is necessary to break the congruence between
                  exteriority and interiority–or to open up a space of interiority to begin with–and
                  to disrupt the relationship of adequation between seeing, being seen, and speaking
                  according to the dictates of “custom.” The break this invisibility would facilitate
                  involves at the same time a re-ordering of the relationship between the visible and
                  the audible corollary to a new determination of the terms of perceptibility governing
                  the relationships of subjects to one another in public, communal life.</p>
               <p>In 
                  “What is Poetry?,”
                  Mill already places emphasis on the dimension of the audible over the visible in his
                  imagination of a theatrical community oriented by poetry. Both eloquence and poetry
                  are forms of utterance, but eloquence involves a continuity between the visible and
                  the audible, while poetry involves a necessary suspension of visibility: “What we
                  have said to ourselves, we may tell to others afterwards; what we have said or done
                  in solitude, we may voluntarily reproduce when we know that other eyes are upon us.
                  But no trace of consciousness that any eyes are upon us must be visible in the work
                  itself” (109). Poetry originates in invisibility, though it may be rehearsed and reproduced
                  before the eyes of others after this originating moment. Likened to soliloquy, poetry
                  is the medium of a voice that circulates beyond the regulatory gaze of panopticism
                  and has the potential to disrupt its effective operation.</p>
               <p>As evident in the passage from <em>On Liberty</em>, panopticism implies a central and elevated observer around which are arrayed concentric
                  tiers of adjacent cells. The central observer is positioned so that he may see everyone,
                  but in principle anyone may occupy this interchangeable position. As Foucault writes
                  in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, “He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility
                  for the constraints of power…he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he
                  simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection” (202-3).
                  The subject, then, subjects himself by internalizing the capacity to regulate himself
                  and others. The field of visibility constructed by panopticism is circumscribed, at
                  the same time, by inherent blind spots. While the occupants of the cells are positioned
                  to perceive the inspector with whom they may in principle exchange roles, and while
                  they may see others at a distance, they remain necessarily blind and invisible to
                  those in their proximity who occupy adjacent and neighboring cells.</p>
               <p>As the medium of a voice that circulates beyond the central regulatory gaze, poetry
                  has the potential to open up alternative modes of communication within the theater
                  of panopticism and to introduce an alternative logic of subject-formation. To exemplify
                  his definition, Mill quotes from Burns’s 
                  “My Heart’s in the Highlands”
                  and comments, “That song has always seemed to us like the lament of a prisoner in
                  a solitary cell, ourselves listening, unseen, in the next” (111). Such eavesdropping
                  has the effect of de-centering and disorienting the listener away from the regulatory
                  gaze and toward, instead, the song of the neighbor, in relation to whom he is neither
                  superior nor subordinate but peer and fellow subject. The subjection that thus takes
                  place is at odds with the logic of Benthamite panopticist subjection since, in the
                  latter case, what subjects the prisoners and makes them equals of one another is the
                  unitary and elevated gaze, while, in the former, it is a proximate yet enigmatic utterance
                  that is neither addressed to one nor to anyone in particular, and that one can do
                  nothing about, but in relation to which one is nevertheless implicated and interpellated
                  as helpless overhearer.</p>
               <p>In Mill’s theater of poetic citizenship, citizens are imagined as actors and spectators
                  who perceive and become perceptible to one another in public, communal life, but their
                  capacity as participants in communal life is qualified by supplemental roles as invisible
                  speaker and eavesdropper. In these latter roles, they are temporarily <em>in</em>capacitated as actors–whether the actor be defined within the logic of utilitarian
                  subject-formation as a rational, intentional agent capable of undertaking actions
                  with statistically calculable consequences, or as an agent whose array of possible
                  actions is immanently delimited by the field of already available actions perceptible
                  to them. In this <em>in</em>capacity, they are “unworked” or <span class="foreign">désoeuvrés</span>, to use Nancy’s term from <em>The Inoperative Community</em>, as members of a maximally frugal and efficient, market-oriented community that promises
                  to produce freedom as, specifically, the freedom to participate in the activities
                  of exchange and consumption–to produce free subjects as, specifically, subjects that
                  perform the roles of seller and consumer. In relation to poetry as the song of the
                  unseen neighbor (or the song that one sings, unseen), the subject is re-oriented and
                  potentially re-constituted in excess of the logic of panopticist subject-formation.</p>
               <p>This re-orientation and reconstitution of the subject provides the potential means
                  of a liberation from the theater of bio-politics. The means it provides is, however,
                  precarious. The liberation in question may take place as a mere liberation <em>from</em> the constraints of bio-political subject formation, a quietist exercise of “negative
                  liberty” that ends up re-affirming, again and again, the framework of bio-governmentality.
                  In this case, the freedom the subject enjoys may take the form of a retreat or refuge
                  from public, communal life that leaves the basic structure of the latter intact and
                  to which the subject returns, renovated but substantially unaltered. Another scenario
                  involves a re-orientation and reconstitution of the subject that produces or generates
                  a new role, a new form-of-life, as it were, to be added to the, in principle, infinitely
                  proliferating repertoire of roles and forms-of-life in public, communal life. The
                  precariousness of this latter scenario hinges on the question of whether the emergence
                  of a new role would adhere once again to a liberalist-capitalist logic of subject-formation,
                  wherein the new role is molded into that of a seller-consumer, or whether this emergence
                  may manifest the enactment of a genuinely alternative logic of freedom and reconfiguration
                  of political space.</p>
