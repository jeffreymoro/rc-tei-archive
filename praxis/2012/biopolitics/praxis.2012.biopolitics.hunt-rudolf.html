               <h2><span class="head"> </span></h2>
               <p>Sometime during 1819, Percy Shelley interrupted the process of drafting his longest
                  prose text, <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em>, and began working on an essay equally fated to remain a fragment—
                  “On Life,”
                  which Shelley wrote into the back of the same notebook he was drafting the <em>Philosophical View of Reform</em> in. Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, the editors of the Norton Critical Edition
                  of <em>Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</em>, write that the fragment “grew directly from an early passage” in the former text
                  (505, n. 1). Their choice of metaphor characterizes an essay “on life” as an organic,
                  living outgrowth of a treatise on politics—as if life were continuous with and already
                  contained by politics. At the same time, the animation bestowed by the metaphor renders
                  the relationship of the two texts decidedly apolitical—not so much an action or even
                  a response to a historical or writerly exigency, but rather the manifestation of a
                  natural process, perhaps one as inevitable as Shelley’s individual disposition towards
                  abstract and ineffectual musings. Yet, and notwithstanding the suicidal irony of an
                  enlivened politics that, following this metaphor, does not so much politicize life
                  as depoliticize politics, the significance of the inscription of 
                  “On Life”
                  in the pages of the draft of <em>A Philosophical View of Reform</em> might have less to do with <em>what</em> compelled Shelley to turn from a treatise on politics—a survey of the historical
                  and contemporary workings of political power that was to demonstrate a “necessary”
                  because “inevitable” political change and to culminate in a practical proposal to
                  enact a more egalitarian political model—to a metaphysically tinged reflection on
                  life, than in the fact that he did so. From this perspective, the sheer material coincidence
                  of these two fragments indicates an historical and theoretical exigency in which politics—the
                  possibility of political change and more just government—comes to be staked on life
                  and life predicated on politics. In this light, the conjunction of the two texts allegorizes
                  a biopolitical relation between power and life, and so furnishes an occasion to read
                  romanticism’s engagement with “life” as a formative moment in the modern genealogy
                  of biopolitics. How, then, to read this turn to life?</p>
               <p>At first sight, 
                  “On Life”
                  would seem to suggest that life offers an escape from politics. In the opening paragraph
                  Shelley asks: “What are the changes of empires, the wreck of dynasties with the opinions
                  which supported them; what is the birth and the extinction of religions and of political
                  systems to life?” (505). The question is the first of three, and, insofar as it is
                  merely rhetorical, is a more effective way of asserting that power is trivial next
                  to the magnificence of life. However, this reading is immediately complicated by the
                  fact that, of the three questions, this is the only one lacking the phrase “compared
                  with” that unequivocally tells us that life is being measured or weighed up against
                  something else. While the question can still be rhetorical, without the comparative
                  prepositional phrase it also becomes increasingly legible as a sincere question: what
                  <em>is</em> the relation of power to life? This is not only a question of what power makes of
                  life, where life is rendered as the object of power, for insofar as the speaker asks
                  what the cycles of power are “to” life, it is almost as if life itself, indirectly
                  apostrophized, were called upon to give an account of its relation with power.</p>
               <p>This question is further sounded in the figuration of power’s historical forms as
                  themselves alive: beginning in “birth” and ending in “extinction,” political power
                  takes on the properties of a living being—a figuration that calls to mind Foucault’s
                  quip about biopower as a “magnificent beast” (“<span class="foreign">bête magnifique</span>,” qtd. in Chebili 142). Life, then, is not merely being compared to, or even being
                  valued over, power when the very act of that assertion renders the relation of life
                  and power indistinct. Shelley’s question instead suggests that power is staked on
                  the separability and difference of “life” from itself, and that to intervene in politics
                  always <em>also</em> entails coming to grips with the uncertain legibility of the relation between power
                  and life.</p>
               <p>We would like to take Shelley’s meditation on the relation between power and life
                  as the occasion to introduce a collection of scholarship intended to initiate a conversation
                  about and between what is called “biopolitics” and what is called “romanticism.” The
                  broad contention of this volume is that the study of biopolitics reanimates the question
                  of romanticism. We mean this in two senses. First, the set of conceptual resources
                  provided in recent work on biopolitics opens up inventive lines of inquiry that enable
                  scholars to re-think the already established awareness that the literature, philosophy,
                  and culture of romanticism displays an obsession with life. Biopolitics reanimates
                  romanticism in the additional sense that the current scholarly concern with life as
                  an object of power marks the radical survival of romanticism. If romanticism responds
                  well when examined in the light of contemporary biopolitical theory, then a constitutive
                  part of this response is a certain resistance to biopolitical theory. As the contributors
                  to this volume demonstrate, the biopolitical intervention on life—the political project
                  of targeting, capturing, making, and taking life—engages paradoxes, predicaments,
                  and aporias that have been widely or fully appreciated neither by theorists of biopolitics
                  nor by critics who take up their work. Romanticism, we suggest, is a privileged locus
                  for the awareness that even the most assured representation of life turns upon an
                  irreducible “literariness.”</p>

                  <p>Before we go any further, let us offer an overview of the current understanding of
                     biopolitics. The term “biopolitics” has a prehistory stretching back to the early
                     1900s, but in the last quarter of the twentieth century it emerged in the context
                     of heterogeneous attempts to account for the novel intersections between power, the
                     law, technology, culture, economics and the social sciences that over the last few
                     centuries have increasingly come to shape and dominate social and political life—disputes
                     over human rights and citizenship, the medical and demographic monitoring of population,
                     the management of relations between a population and the environment, the legal regulation
                     of abortion, the normative control of sexuality, the shifting strategies and objectives
                     of war, the conflict over the status and rights of so-called enemy combatants, the
                     emergence of biotechnologies, and the harnessing of life processes for economic purposes.

                     </div> Behind the diverse surfaces of appearance of biopolitics, what theories of biopolitics
                     have in common is a radical overturning of traditional models of politics as a specific
                     sphere of human practice. Whereas, politics, following Arendt’s canonical elaboration
                     of Aristotle’s account of political action in <em>The Human Condition</em>, names the activity of collective, non-coercive deliberation on the most just ways
                     to organize community, biopolitics refers to political practices in which the capacity
                     of collective deliberation is at best of secondary importance, since what is at issue
                     is the biological life of the community. From this perspective, the emergence of biopolitics
                     marks a fundamental transformation of the political order: from an order based on
                     and involving individual “subjects” as active participants to one in which the biological
                     life of “living beings” becomes the center and object of political intervention and
                     practice. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In Michel Foucault’s seminal theory, biopolitics takes the form of concrete techniques
                              of power that target individuals not as “legal subjects” but as “living beings” (Sexuality
                              142-43), while for Giorgio Agamben the nation-state is biopolitical to the degree
                              that it engages “not man as a free and conscious political subject but, above all,
                              man’s bare life” (Homo 128).</span></div>
                     </div> If, as both Foucault and Agamben argue, human beings were for two thousand years understood
                     to be animals whose capacity for politics was an extra-added feature that raised it
                     above the life of animals, the modern human being is “an animal whose politics places
                     his existence as a living being in question” (Foucault, <em>History</em>, 143). We would add that the modern placing-into-question of human life by politics
                     is all the more powerful and effective because, as Arendt’s critique of human rights
                     in <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em> suggests, the possibility of separating the juridico-political “subject” from the
                     “living being” that was its ostensible bearer was the enabling premise of the French
                     Revolution’s extension of the political capacity for collective deliberation and self-determination—which
                     since its inception in the Greek <span class="foreign">polis</span> had been confined to particular classes (social, economic, gendered) of human beings—to <em>all</em> human beings, solely on the basis of their belonging to the human species. It is not
                     at all the case, then, that our conventional understandings of politics have become
                     obsolete, as if superseded by biopolitics. Rather, and as the essays by Marc Redfield
                     and Emily Sun collected in this volume eloquently show, the emergence of the subject
                     is always accompanied by its disappearance into political and aesthetic modalities
                     of representation that, in turning living beings into political subjects, figures
                     the possibility of biopolitical power.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Of the many, often divergent articulations of biopolitics, the seminal account of
                  Michel Foucault and its reinterpretation by Giorgio Agamben have been the most influential;
                  they figure prominently in the essays collected here, and so deserve some elaboration.
                  Foucault introduced his use of the terms “biopower” and “biopolitics” in a series
                  of lectures given at the Collège de France in early 1976 and in the introductory volume
                  of the <em>History of Sexuality</em> also from 1976. Following on his earlier analyses of power in <em>The Birth of the Clinic</em> and <em>Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison</em>, Foucault traced the emergence, around the turn of the nineteenth century, of a new
                  form of power—“biopower”— that came to “complement,” “penetrate” and “permeate” the
                  sovereign power of the state. If sovereign power’s characteristic expression had been
                  the right to kill, to “take life or let live,” biopower named a new, opposing right:
                  the “right to make live and let die” (<em>‘Society’</em> 241). Power no longer worked principally by means of deduction, “a subtraction mechanism,
                  a right to appropriate a portion of the wealth, a tax of products, goods, and services,
                  labor and blood, levied on the subjects”; instead, it began to work in positive manner
                  to make its objects grow, “to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize
                  the forces under it” (<em>History</em> 136). In short, biopower witnesses the “entry of life into history, that is, the
                  entry of phenomenon peculiar to the life of the human species into the order of knowledge
                  and power, into the sphere of political techniques” (<em>History</em> 141).</p>
               <p>Foucault specifies that life entered into the calculations of power in two ways. From
                  the end of the seventeenth century the individual body was targeted “as a machine:
                  it disciplining the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion of its forces,
                  the parallel increase of its usefulness and docility, its integration into systems
                  of efficient and economic controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power
                  that characterized the <em>disciplines</em>: an <em>anatomo-politics of the human body</em>” (<em>History</em> 139). In the second half of the eighteenth century this form of biopower was supplemented
                  by a second, properly <em>biopolitical</em> technique that worked on biological features that became meaningful and efficient
                  only when aggregated and understood at the level of populations. From the perspective
                  of biopolitics the relation of “life” to an individual body is aleatory, but regular
                  with regard to a collection of bodies that exists over an extended period of time.
                  It hence became possible to establish control mechanisms—“forecasts, statistical estimates,
                  and overall measures”—whose “purpose is not ... to modify a given individual insofar
                  as he is an individual, but, essentially, to intervene at the level at which these
                  general phenomenon are determined, at the level of their generality” (<em>‘Society’</em> 246). The biopolitical intervention on life concerns not individual subjects, but
                  rather the production of figures—statistics, estimates, data, totals, sums—that provide,
                  and indeed are, the means to regularize, but also isolate and contain, the “random
                  element inherent in a population of living beings” so as to “optimize a state of life”
                  (246).</p>
               <p>That the project of biopower was to “make live” does not mean, however, that the old
                  sovereign right of death simply disappears. It is rather subordinated to the power
                  of making live, and manifests itself, Foucault writes, as “the reverse of the right
                  of the social body to ensure, maintain and develop its life” (<em>History</em> 136). The power of death is no longer wielded “in the name of a sovereign who must
                  be defended” but rather to protect the biological existence of a population (<em>‘Society’</em> 137). And since “death becomes, insofar as it is the end of life, . . . the limit,
                  or the end of power too” (<em>‘Society’</em> 248), the power <em>over</em> death itself becomes unbounded, freed from all previously existing constraints. This,
                  then, is a principal paradox of biopolitics: to the very degree that biopower makes
                  it its mission to foster and guarantee life, life itself comes to be threatened by
                  ever growing political and technological means of destruction: “It is,” Foucault writes,
                  “as managers of life and survival . . . that so many regimes have been able to wage
                  so many wars, causing so many men to be killed” (<em>History</em> 137). Foucault accounts for this paradoxical “death-function in the economy of biopower”
                  with the paradigm of racism, which serves two important purposes (<em>‘Society’</em> 258). It provides, first, the means to create biological “caesuras within the [population]”
                  that allow a line to be drawn “between what must live and what must die” and, secondly,
                  it creates a “positive relationship” in which “the death of the bad race ... is something
                  that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer” (254-55). Racism’s
                  inscription in the biopolitical in this way at once justifies, exacerbates and regulates

                     </div> Bringing together philosophical reflection and political critique with philological
                     erudition, Agamben’s book marked a significant theoretical revaluation of biopolitics.
                     Whereas Foucault’s analyses largely bypassed traditional political and juridical theories
                     of political power in favor of an analysis of the material mechanisms and techniques
                     that made life available to the political machinations of the state, Agamben’s work
                     marked a return to an analysis of the juridico-institutional model of power—albeit
                     with a two decisive twists. First, Agamben interpreted Aristotle’s account of the
                     Greek <span class="foreign">polis</span> as indicating that the central political binary was not that of friend and enemy,
                     as political theorists from Hobbes on had thought, but rather the distinction between
                     “bare” or “naked life” (<span class="foreign">zoé</span>) and political existence (<span class="foreign">bíos</span>). Secondly, drawing on Carl Schmitt’s definition of the sovereign as the one who
                     decides on the state of exception, Agamben argued that the decisive fact of modern
                     politics was not the mere inclusion of life in politics, but rather its inclusion
                     in the politico-juridical order by means of its exclusion. Hence the “<em>originary relation of law to life is not application</em>”—the Foucauldian schema in which life becomes the “principal object of the projection
                     and calculations of State power” (Agamben, <em>Homo</em> 9)—“<em>but Abandonment</em>” (29, original emphasis): the situation, brought around by the sovereign decision
                     on the state of exception, through which the bare life of political subjects, having
                     been abandoned by the law and lacking all legal protection, is exposed to the vicissitudes
                     of unregulated violence.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Both Foucault and Agamben’s accounts of biopolitics can be articulated in terms of
                  the relation of signifier and signified. As in Foucault, for Agamben biopolitics emerges
                  at the moment life enters into representation, but it does so in a quite different
                  sense. While for Foucault, representation concerns the relations—technical, material,
                  and mechanical—that bind a signifier to a signified (that apply to it), for Agamben
                  representation includes the <span class="foreign">de facto</span> exclusion of the signified from the signifier, its <span class="foreign">de jure</span> inclusion being merely the <em>form</em> of representation. The exemplary, paradigmatic figure of this predicament is the
                  obscure Roman legal figure of the <span class="foreign">homo sacer</span>, “who <em>may be killed and yet not sacrificed</em>” (8, original emphasis). Banned from the political community and abandoned by the
                  law, he no longer can be licitly represented in the politico-juridical order of the
                  state, and thus can be killed with impunity but not sacrificed, precisely because,
                  in the first case, there can be no penalty for murdering someone who has no legal
                  existence, and, in the second case, his very lack of representation protects him from
                  being sacrificed. For Agamben, in other words, the entry into representation is always
                  also accompanied by an exit from it; indeed, <span class="foreign">homo sacer</span> occupies the threshold of representation and its constitutive outside, always already
                  half live, half dead. With reference to Foucault, then, we might say that <span class="foreign">homo sacer</span> appears at and marks the discursive limits, not only of biopower, but of sovereign
                  power.</p>
               <p>Agamben’s theoretical intervention in this rearticulates the genealogy and horizon
                  of biopolitics outlined by Foucault. Insisting on an archaic, originary complicity
                  between the biopower and sovereignty, Agamben argues that, far from being peculiar
                  to our modernity, the inclusive exclusion of life in the Greek <span class="foreign">polis</span> meant that Western politics had from the very beginning been a biopolitics (181).
                  Foucault’s historical rupture is thus supplanted by a schema in which modernity is
                  distinguished from earlier periods merely by the acceleration of bare life’s movement
                  from the margins of political existence to the center of the political order. Hence,
                  Agamben writes, “the exception becomes the rule, and the difference between inside
                  and outside, fact and law enter into a zone of irreducible indistinction” (9). As
                  a consequence, the Nazi camps, which for Foucault were a contingent, singular paroxysm
                  in which the field of biopolitics became “absolutely coextensive with the sovereign
                  right kill,” in no way can be considered a historical exception but must rather be
                  understood as the “fundamental biopolitical paradigm of the West” (181). In the last
                  instance, then, biopolitics always amounts to a thanatopolitics, a murderous politics
                  of death. As Eva Geulen concisely puts it in her contribution to the present volume,
                  “For Agamben, then, sovereign politics is biopolitics and biopolitics is, at bottom,
                  always a politics of death and killing.” Indeed, the secret link binding bare life
                  to sovereign power—in short, biopolitics—has all along determined the trajectory of
                  Western politics. Hence our present political moment becomes legible, in Agamben’s
                  view, as the disastrous endpoint of a political tradition that, extending from ancient
                  Greece to the Nazi concentration camps and beyond, exhibits an “inner solidarity between
                  democracy and totalitarianism” (10).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the years since the appearance of Foucault’s and Agamben’s respective texts, scholars
                     have taken up, elaborated, and revaluated their concerns. Critics such as Paul Rabinow
                     and Nicholas Rose have built on Michel Foucault’s definition of “biopolitics” as “the
                     attempt, starting from the eighteenth century, to rationalize the problems posed to
                     governmental practice by phenomena characteristic of a set of living beings forming
                     a population: health, hygiene, birthrate, life expectancy, race . . .” (<em>Birth</em> 217), expanding his analysis to include those institutions and apparatuses, from ethics
                     councils to the doctor-patient relationship, in and through which the politicization
                     of biological life-processes takes place. Others, such as Achille Mbembe, have taken
                     up Agamben’s subjectivist and decisionist model, arguing that “the ultimate expression
                     of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate
                     who may live and who must die” (Mbembe 11). The decade since biopolitics’ explosion
                     onto the contemporary theoretical scene has also brought forward a number of important
                     theoretical reconsiderations of biopolitics more specifically relevant to the humanities,
                     which—even though we can’t them discuss here in any depth—deserve notice. We mention
                     especially Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s <em>Empire</em> (2000) and <em>Multitude</em> (2003) as well as Roberto Esposito’s recent account of the “immunity paradigm” in <em>Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy</em> (2008).

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Romanticism occupies an ambivalent position in the most influential contemporary theoretical
                     accounts of biopolitics. Even though the historical period that romanticism occupies,
                     especially in the British and German traditions, appears as a pivotal moment in the
                     history of biopolitics, biopolitical theorists have not paid any real attention to
                     romanticism as a literary, philosophical, and cultural formation, focusing rather
                     on contemporaneous developments that take place within the concrete arrangements and
                     theoretical paradigms of the social and political sciences. If at all, romanticism
                     appears in their accounts as only as a name, a gesture, or as the metonymic designation
                     of a historical moment outside of their critical purview. Thus, while Foucault locates
                     the emergence of biopower at the “threshold of modernity”—the very historical moment
                     punctuated by the emergence of romanticism—his historical analyses circumvent romanticism.
                     Similarly, while Agamben focuses on the consequential role of the National Assembly’s <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em> in 1789 in inscribing the natural life of citizens in the juridico-political order
                     of the nation-state (<em>Homo</em> 127)—an issue Marc Redfield takes up in his contribution to this volume—“romanticism”
                     appears in his work only briefly and in passing, most significantly as the name of
                     the pernicious ideology which “consciously created” the “symbiotic correspondence”
                     between “language as the fact of speech and the people as the fact of community” which
                     “defines modern political discourse” (<em>Means</em> 66).

                     “Thoughts on the Concept of Biopower Today.”
                      Having clarified and taken stock of the efficacy of the concept of biopower with a
                     view to its critical future, they conclude the essay with a look back: <span class="quote">‘One might well imagine what it might have been like in 1800 for an analyst attempting

                        Today we are equally in a situation of major historical change whose directions are
                        partially obscure and not yet solidified. … [W]e feel that the concept of biopower
                        is pertinent to grasping many diverse contemporary developments. But the concept remains
                        insufficiently developed, and has not yet demonstrated its analytic mettle in sufficient
                        cases. We would recommend that analysts attended to that task, rather than succumbing
                        to the allure of philosophies that turn a concept into a theory or a world view. (2003,

                     of a return of and to the historical moment of romanticism. Yet where we might expect
                     to find the name romanticism, we find instead the year “1800” and, moreover, not a
                     poet, novelist, playwright or philosopher but rather an “analyst”—an analyst, it turns
                     out, who not only, like Foucault and Agamben, does not pay any significant attention
                     to the literary, philosophical, and cultural stakes of romanticism, but appears, insofar
                     as he’s said to be examining the birth of the clinic, as their historical retrojection.
                     The effacement of romanticism is underscored in Rabinow and Rose’s critique of “philosophies
                     [the references are to Agamben and to Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri] that turn a
                     concept [biopower] into a theory or a world view.” In such resistance to theory it’s
                     not difficult to hear the accusation that what theorists of biopolitics are guilty
                     of is a certain version of the romantic ideology, which even as it can “see into the
                     life of things” excludes from its field of vision “certain conflictual sights and
                     meanings—roughly the <em>life</em> of things” (Levinson 24-25).

                              to his collection, The Meaning of ‘Life’ in Romantic Poetry and Poetics (3-4). While
                              we read this resistance to theory as an effacement of romanticism, the ambivalence
                              we’re interested intensifies if we acknowledge that, as David Simpson has shown, the
                              resistance to theory is also quintessentially romantic.</span></div>
                     </div> Yet consider the particular means by which Rabinow and Rose present their clear-sighted
                     prophetic analyst of history in 1800. It is upon the gesture of <em>imagining</em> the experience of “an analyst” trying to understand in 1800 that their theorization
                     of their own effort to understand the present and ongoing transformations in biopolitics
                     rests. To be sure, Rabinow and Rose would likely intend the analogy they draw between
                     the present study of biopolitics and the analyst of biopolitics in 1800 to be no more
                     than a heuristically useful rhetorical gesture. Nevertheless, in deploying the quintessential
                     romantic creative faculty, their closing remarks indicate that romanticism, both as
                     an object and act of imagination, is already a means by which biopolitics is made
                     available to reflection.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Despite the tangled knot of effaced references to and disavowed enactments of romanticism
                  in biopolitical theory, critics have long agreed that romanticism concerns itself
                  in a fundamental way with life. Indeed, scholars of romanticism have long characterized
                  the years Foucault and Agamben identify as a turning point in the history of biopolitics
                  as one of modernity’s most prominent and consequential sites for the intense thematization
                  of life. In discussing the various controlling categories that positively define romanticism,
                  M. H. Abrams gives life special prominence when he asserts that for romanticism, “The
                  ground-concept is life.” Indeed, he continues, “Life is itself the highest good, the
                  residence and measure of other goods, and the generator of the controlling categories
                  of Romantic thought. . . . Life is the premise and paradigm for what is most innovative
                  and distinctive in Romantic thinkers” (<em>Natural Supernaturalism</em> 431). For Abrams, the two principal signs of the life of romanticism are “vitalism”
                  — “the celebration of that which lives, moves, and evolves by an internal energy,
                  over whatever is lifeless, inert, and unchanging” — and “organicism”— “the metaphorical
                  translation into the categories and norms of intellection of the attributes of a growing
                  thing, which unfolds its inner form and assimilates to itself alien elements, until
                  it reaches the fullness of its complex, organic unity” (ibid. 431-32). Abrams extends
                  this growth in life to figural language, most particularly to those tropes whose “valid
                  animation of natural objects … now came to be a major index to the sovereign faculty
                  of imagination, and almost in itself a sufficient criterion of the highest poetry”
                  (<em>Mirror</em> 55). Romanticism is a poetic project whose aim is to ‘make live’, and whose very
                  rhetoricity denoted the sovereignty of its animating powers—not a political but a
                  poetic sovereignty, a sovereignty of art on the far side of politics.</p>

                  <p>The study of organicism in turn has developed into a concern for a greater variety
                     of romanticism’s signs of life. Critics such as Denise Gigante, Charles I. Armstrong,
                     Robert J. Richards, and Arkady Plotnitsky have extended Abrams’ insight about the
                     discourse of organicism from poetry to texts drawn from the natural sciences and philosophy.
                     Scholars have also increasingly focused on the various modes by which romantic writers
                     engaged with and contributed to debates in the life sciences of the period, charting
                     the transformation in the discourse of life that occurred around the turn of the nineteenth
                     century—as Foucault notes in <em>The Order of Things</em>, the term “biology” was coined, first in French, in 1800 (xi)—even arguing for a
                     romantic science of life.

                     without reference to the life sciences, showing that the discourses about life in
                     romantic literature exceed the framework of organicism.

                              As Sara Guyer demonstrates in her contribution to the present collection, the deconstructive
                              rhetorical strain within the field has long been aware that romantic poetics turned
                              upon such figures of animation as apostrophe and prosopopeia.</span></div>
                     </div> In all these ways, then, the critical reflection on romantic organicism has given
                     way to a more comprehensive and fine-grained reflection on life that emphasizes the
                     variety of contexts and discursive modes in which it is constituted.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Nonetheless, the focus on the figure of life in the archive of romantic poetry, philosophy,
                  and science has yet to be matched by a complex understanding of the relation between
                  life and power. Recent research has no doubt complicated Abrams’ proposition that
                  life unproblematically generated “love” defined as “the confraternity of the one life
                  shared not only with other men but also with a milieu in which man can feel fully
                  at home” (<em>Natural Supernaturalism</em> 431). Nicolas Roe and Sharon Ruston have shown how vitalist and materialist positions
                  in the debate about the nature of life at the turn of the century translated into
                  normative political positions; Gigante point to the way in which poetic and scientific
                  conceptions of life were understood to be a form of discursive, if not political,
                  power; and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy and others have demonstrated
                  the ease with which modern political programs invoke romantic organicism. What remains
                  outside the conceptualization of such approaches—and what biopolitical theory offers
                  to teach us—is an appreciation of the possibility that “life” in romanticism is neither
                  just the analogue nor simply a form of power, but also and fundamentally a referent
                  of political power.</p>

                  <p>Faced with symmetrical views of the same terrain—the view of biopolitics without romanticism,
                     and the view of romanticism without biopolitics—the present volume of <em>Romantic Circles Praxis Series</em> undertakes to explore the implications of the biopolitical problematic for romanticism.
                     The initial results of our effort can be seen in the articles that follow. Each suggests
                     possible directions for future research, some of which we can already gesture towards
                     here. In no particular order, these include: aesthetics, which as Marc Redfield notes,
                     has always claimed to be biopolitics; human rights, which Agamben, partly via Edmund
                     Burke’s critique of the National Assembly’s 1789 declaration, has characterized as
                     a technology of biopolitics; demography and its instruments such as the census, the
                     institution of which in 1801 was precipitated by Malthus’s apocalyptic speculations
                     in <em>Essay on the Principle of Population</em> in 1798; the social sciences, especially Jeremy Bentham’s seminal version of utilitarianism;
                     the life sciences, including experimental projects at making inanimate matter live;
                     race, that “caesura in the biological continuum” (Foucault, <em>‘Society’</em> 255), the invention of which has been claimed to take place in the writings of Kant;
                     and the environment, identified by Foucault as one of four surfaces for the appearance
                     of biopolitical pressure and newly renovated by ecocritics as the central category
                     of romanticism.

               <h2><span class="head">III. The Literariness of Life</span></h2>
               <p>We hasten to add that we are not offering the electrifying proposition, <span class="foreign">le romanticisme, c’est biopolitique</span>, let alone that romanticism <em>is</em> biopolitics. Nor are we making the historical assertion that romanticism is the—or
                  the principal—origin of modern biopolitics. Romanticism is surely in the historical
                  DNA of biopolitics, but the contemporary biopolitical situation claims a diversely
                  branching genealogical web with multiple and often competing sources, not a single
                  or genetic origin. Yet we are arguing, to introduce the second sense of our central
                  hypothesis, that inasmuch as romanticism as a rhetoric of life responds to the question
                  of biopolitics, it does so not just as something we are not yet done with, but also
                  as something that is not yet done with us. Indeed, in our view, biopolitical theory
                  is one of the more vital instances of what Ian Baucom has called the “afterlives of
                  romanticism.” Biopolitics maintains romanticism’s afterlife in this sense not because
                  life would be a romantic concept, but because claims to have made or to make life
                  available—as an object of cognition, food for thought, or the grounds for action—call
                  on the “life and afterlives” of romanticism as a compelling and not merely archival
                  name of the difficulties such projects encounter (Baucom 20). The very fact that the
                  emergence of biopolitics has been accompanied by legible effacement of romanticism
                  in its official genealogies suggests that the current scholarly concern with life
                  as an object of power, far from simply indicating a loss of romanticism, marks its
                  radical survival.</p>
               <p>If contemporary biopolitical theory has become a necessary condition of our awareness
                  of the political stakes of romanticism’s obsession with life, one way we might remark
                  on romanticism’s biopolitical survival is to note that biopolitics, in constituting
                  its principle object of inquiry, actualizes that trope most proper to romanticism:
                  the substitution of language for life. As the focus of biopolitical studies on biomedicine,
                  biocapital, sovereignty, humanitarianism, and so on all too easily allow us to forget,
                  life, both in the work of Foucault and Agamben as well as of other theorists of biopolitics,
                  becomes accessible to biopolitical intervention, not as such, but through its entry
                  into language and representation. In Foucault’s account, the intersection of language
                  and life takes the form of a discursive threshold, but not one that is located in
                  any single subject or body. Rather, insofar as politics intervenes on life through
                  the production, regulation and manipulation of figural regimes—the statistics, estimates,
                  data, totals, and sums that represent the life of the population at a general level—the
                  objective of power is to control the “random element inherent in a population of living
                  beings,” where the “random element” names an anomaly in a statistical distribution
                  with regard to the norm that is identified by means of a calculating apparatus rather
                  than by discursive means (2003, 246). What is decisive is not any positive knowledge
                  of the relation of power and life, but rather the mere facticity of the substitution
                  of language for life that enables that intervention in the first place. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Given that this substitutive structure is properly that of figural language in general,
                     it is somewhat surprising that the specificity of literature’s contribution to, as
                     well as its role in, the biopolitical project of “making live and letting die” have
                     received little attention from either literary critics or biopolitical theorists.
                     In a Foucaultian account of biopolitics, literature at most might be said to appear
                     as but one discursive formation among many involved in the machinations of power-knowledge,
                     as a concrete instance of the mechanism by which biopower mediately takes hold of
                     the life of the body. Yet inasmuch as the quantitatively organized discourses of public
                     health, criminology, labor management, and so forth are more effective ways of managing
                     ‘life,’ literature would seem to be hardly pertinent to a form of (“post-ideological”)
                     politics that targets bodily life. Agamben’s account will seem more amenable to inquiries
                     attentive to the density of language, not least, as Eva Geulen observes, because of
                     its roots in philology and its engagement with the philosophical tradition. Modeling
                     his account of biopolitical sovereignty on a reading of the negative event of language
                     in Hegel and Heidegger, Agamben can write that “Language is the sovereign who, in
                     a permanent state of exception, declares that there is nothing outside language and
                     that language is always beyond itself” and that the potentiality to signify is given
                     to the precise degree that “language withdraws itself from every concrete instance
                     of speech” (<em>Homo</em> 21).

                     </div> The structure of abandonment that underlies the sovereign exception thus corresponds
                     exactly to the negativity of representation. In their deprivation of language, the
                     enemy combatant, the <span class="foreign">homo sacer</span>, the subject of human rights, and, in the extreme instance, the <span class="foreign">Muselmänner</span> of the Nazi death camps, each personify a figure of life that political power effectively
                     takes hold of precisely by abandoning it at the limits of language. Thus unmoored
                     from the referential force of language, they are given over to the sheer arbitrariness
                     of their substitutive determination.</p>
               </div>
               <p>A principal contention of the current volume is that if biopolitics is intimately
                  involved with and intervenes on a language about life deeply informed by the legacy
                  of romanticism, romanticism’s “literariness” might itself provide a compelling avenue
                  to critically rethink the most influential biopolitical theories. As the essays collected
                  in this volume demonstrate, in romantic texts the biopolitical intervention on life—the
                  political project of targeting, capturing, making, and taking life—plays out as a
                  venture fraught with difficulties and contingencies that unsettle theoretical models
                  of biopolitics. In this sense, the encounter with romanticism reanimates biopolitics,
                  restoring to it not a lost life but rather a critical awareness of the contingency
                  of the uncertain literariness of its making live.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">IV. Romanticism, Biopolitics, and Literature</span></h2>
               <p>The present collection began life as a special session of the Modern Language Association
                  convention in San Francisco in December 2008. Despite being scheduled at the last
                  timeslot of the last day of the convention, the session drew such a sizeable and enthusiastic
                  crowd that we were encouraged to seek a larger avenue for the project. Continuities
                  and differences between the two iterations of the project are worth noting. Marc Redfield’s
                  and Emily Sun’s articles are substantially revised versions of the papers they presented
                  at the convention; Sara Guyer chose to contribute to the present volume an entirely
                  new piece on John Clare, loosely based on of the one she presented in 2008. Eva Geulen
                  was not present at the MLA convention, and her essay responds to the version of the
                  articles collected in this volume.</p>
               <p>Scholars of romanticism should not be surprised to see that we asked Sara Guyer to
                  contribute to our volume. Her book, <em>Romanticism After Auschwitz</em> (2007) is the first and so far only book-length study of, among other things, romanticism,
                  biopolitics, and literature. Guyer’s essay 
                  “Biopoetics”
                  opens by elegantly noting that it was not just natural and social scientists who became
                  interested in life around 1800, but also poets. What, Guyer asks, would be a poetic
                  understanding of the relationship between literature, power, and life? To answer this
                  question, she turns to Barbara Johnson’s account of the relation of poetic apostrophe,
                  a rhetorical figure of animation, and the politics of abortion. Elaborating on her
                  insight that the apostrophe to the not-yet born makes it “impossible to tell whether
                  language is what gives life or what kills” (Johnson 34)—a gesture that anticipates
                  Agamben’s notion of a “zone of indistinction” between life and politics—Guyer argues
                  that “what occurs in the sphere of politics shares a structure with—indeed is—a problem
                  in poetry. What Johnson reveals is not a literary biopolitics, but biopolitics as
                  indissociable from literature and its indeterminacies.” While Guyer’s turn in the
                  second half of her essay to John Clare’s romantic-period poem, 
                  “To Mary,”
                  might come as a surprise—the poem thematizes neither biopolitics nor abortion—the
                  conjugation of Clare and Johnson in itself already suggests that what is at stake
                  in the relationship between romanticism, biopolitics, and literature is not a shared
                  thematic representation of life but, rather, a shared predicament concerning the representation
                  of life. Guyer reveals the nature of this predicament in an economic reading of the
                  poem’s apostrophic complex. If the speaker’s address to his dead lover fails to make
                  her live or to let her die, then this ineffectivity is precisely what Guyer calls
                  the “lyric structure of sovereignty.” Life is not simply a given to be quantified
                  or captured, nor is the life of the lyric subject who makes live and lets die simply
                  the life of a sovereign opposed to naked life. What rather emerges is a life whose
                  viability is contested, a life contingent upon a failed abortion. Thus the lyric is
                  not the symptom of some romantic ideology; it is the structure of power—and contestation.
                  Such is the lesson of what Guyer, in a powerfully speculative coda, calls biopoetics:
                  “This biopoetics sets out, as this essay set out, by admitting two scenes of making
                  live, and it concludes by exposing the impossibility of a politics of life or a science
                  of literature that would be free from poetics.”</p>
               <p>The event that Emily Sun treats in her essay 
                  “Mill’s Wordsworthian Turn: Poetry, Politics, Eloquence”
                  is well known: John Stuart Mill’s emotional breakdown at the age of 20 and the important
                  role that the poetry of William Wordsworth played in his recovery. What is so novel
                  is her reading of this event as a real-world encounter between biopolitics and romantic
                  poetics. Indeed the conditions that make the event such an encounter are so precise
                  as to approximate those of a controlled laboratory experiment. Mill’s breakdown took
                  the form of a loss of faith in utilitarianism. And utilitarianism, Sun observes, with
                  its assumption that the good life can be measured, calculated, and manipulated provided—and
                  arguably still provides—a crucial part of the liberal social scientific method for
                  the efficient biopolitical administration of life. Reading the account of Mill’s crisis
                  in his <em>Autobiography</em>, Sun demonstrates that the utilitarian reformer finds that his personal life is unaccounted
                  for in the world he is supposed to reform. What restores his happiness, on the far
                  side of utilitarianism, is an experience of reading poetry, specifically the poetry
                  of Wordsworth. Indeed, the tropes by which Mill accounts for his recovery repeat and
                  displace those of Wordsworth: where Wordsworth has Nature to aid him overcome his
                  crises, Mill has Wordsworth’s poetry of Nature. Reading Mill’s essay 
                  “What is poetry?”
                  as the account of poetry’s capacity to lead the self beyond the manufactured subjectivity
                  of a strict utilitarian upbringing, Sun argues, against the critical opinion that
                  Mill’s expressivist conception of poetry is apolitical or antipolitical, that the
                  essay complicates the distinction between political speech and poetic speech. Poetry,
                  for Mill, is not simply the antithesis of eloquence, somehow outside the circuits
                  that tie it to an audience. For in characterizing poetry as “soliloquy,” he defines
                  it as having an audience in a mode that exposes the audience’s world as incomplete.
                  “If, according to Aristotle in the <em>Politics</em>, the human as a political animal is an animal that has speech,” Sun writes in a manner
                  that resonates with the argument of Jacques Rancière, “Mill’s theatrical theory of
                  poetry seems to imply that the human is the animal for whom what it means to have
                  speech always remains in question. Politics, then, would consist of the interminable
                  interrogation of that question and the renewal of the criteria for eloquence.”</p>
               <p>Anyone who has read <em>Phantom Formations</em> (1996) and <em>The Politics of Aesthetics</em> (2003) knows how much Marc Redfield has taught us about the thick entanglement of
                  aesthetics and politics that we call romanticism. He opens his contribution to the
                  collection, 
                  “Aesthetics, Sovereignty, Biopower,”
                  by effortlessly grasping the power of the concept of biopolitics to illuminate aesthetics:
                  “biopolitics is precisely what the aesthetic, particularly in its modern form, has
                  always claimed to be.” However, his principal contention is that the very density
                  of aesthetics means that biopolitics may not be exactly what contemporary theorists
                  claim it to be. As much as aesthetics can be read as an extension of biopolitics,
                  biopolitical sovereignty finds itself subject to the technicity of aesthetics. The
                  biopolitical reach of modern aesthetics is exemplified, Redfield argues, in Friedrich
                  Schiller’s <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em>. Explicitly a political response to and solution for the violence of the French Revolution,
                  Schiller’s treatise outlines an aesthetic program that aims for nothing less than
                  a body at one with the law. What aesthetic education forms—or at least tries to form—is
                  a political body whose life expresses the law. This intimacy of life and art is in
                  principle non-coercive, as Schiller insists, and yet such insistence also turns out
                  to reveal aesthetics’ capacity for violence. What Redfield focuses on, however, is
                  not just the violence that sovereignty performs and disavows, but also the force that
                  it exploits yet cannot control. To elaborate this claim, he turns to a text published
                  in the same year (1795) as Schiller’s treatise, Goethe’s <em>Conversations of German Refugees</em>. In some ways a parodic response to Schiller aesthetic program, the unusual text
                  comprises seven stories, all of which are intended by their refugee tellers to embody
                  the promises of aesthetic culture to restore the moral and political order of the
                  <span class="foreign">ancien régime</span> after the violence of the French Revolution. The controlling figure for this order
                  is, in the words of the leader of the refugees, the Baroness, <span class="foreign">der gute Ton</span>, a literal translation of the French <span class="foreign">bon ton</span>. Yet <span class="foreign">Ton</span> in German also means “noise.” Exploiting this double meaning, Redfield traces a remarkably
                  consistent pattern by which sovereign responses to shocking noises in the frame narrative
                  and the seven stories reproduce rather than put an end to the revolutionary shock
                  such noises are associated with. “<span class="foreign">Ton</span> is Goethe’s deceptively modest figure for aesthetics as a discourse animated by shock.”
                  Insofar as Goethe’s text is itself an aesthetico-pedagogical effort to disseminate
                  <span class="foreign">den guten Ton</span>, it allegorizes its own inability to rigorously distinguish between the shock to
                  which it responds and the shock upon which it turns. What Redfield usefully points
                  out to us is “a fundamental powerlessness underlying the violent operations of body-making.”
                  Summing up his argument in his climactic reading, Redfield’s suggests that the story
                  of an aesthetically reformed political revolutionary is “a story about the unruly
                  critical force of aesthetic discourse, which exposes the violence and incoherence
                  it is supposed at all costs to conceal.”</p>
               <p>Eva Geulen’s response to the essays included in this volume is both bold and provocative.
                  Drawing upon both her extensive work on modern literature and aesthetics since German
                  romanticism (<em>The End of Art: Readings in a Rumor After Hegel</em> [2006]) and her comprehensive familiarity with the work of Agamben (<em>Giorgio Agamben zur Einführung</em> [2005]), she contends that all three essays more or less explicitly defend romanticism
                  “from any biopolitical charges and suspicions” by calling on the literary aesthetic,
                  a move she takes as an indication that what is at stake for our contributors is not
                  so much biopolitics as such as it is “aesthetics by way of biopolitics.” Rather than
                  opening up new lines of inquiry, the appearance of theoretical accounts of biopolitics
                  provides the occasion to redraw, however contingently, the lines defending the literary
                  aesthetic. In view of her earlier observation that all three essays tend to “use [the
                  term] biopolitics in such a way that it encompasses disciplinary strategies while
                  the [the regulatory aspect of biopower] is eclipsed entirely,” we might read Geulen’s
                  concession that there nonetheless might be “no better, more interesting or specific
                  way of considering the question of romanticism and biopolitics” than by way of aesthetics
                  to bear witness to the difficulty of conceiving the relation of literature to a form
                  of politics that targets the biological life of a population rather than, say, the
                  psychic life of an individual subject.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps for this reason that Geulen’s discussion turns to and remains focused
                  on Agamben’s account of sovereignty and bare life. On her reading, the concept of
                  sovereignty provides a critical, if tenuous, opening onto the relation of biopolitics
                  and literature. Indeed, it is as if the intersection of Agamben’s claim that sovereign
                  power is always already biopower with the well known romantic-era conception of the
                  sovereignty of art (cf. Beiser, Menke) itself forms the nexus of biopolitics and aesthetic
                  theory. Yet contrary to the readings offered by Guyer, Redfield, and Sun, Geulen suggests
                  that aesthetics does not as much mark an aesthetic resistance to biopolitics as it
                  paradoxically participates in and furthers biopolitical violence. Following Agamben’s
                  critique of deconstruction in <em>Homo Sacer</em>, Geulen argues that merely identifying and recognizing moments of textual ambivalence
                  and rhetorical undecidability—which Guyer and Redfield, more so than Sun, cast as
                  signs of a literary-aesthetic resistance to biopolitics—does little to resist, let
                  alone change, the effectivity of the biopolitical structure.</p>
               <p>Geulen’s skepticism stems from her agreement with Agamben that what is ultimately
                  at stake in biopolitics is the question of relationality. Drawing on his discussion
                  of <span class="foreign">forma-di-vita</span>, Geulen insists that the challenge to biopolitics, as well as the promise of the
                  literary aesthetic, lies in thinking the nexus of life and law otherwise than in terms
                  of a relation, since the form of relation as such always already “succumb[s] to the
                  logic of the ban which … is the most extreme, most tenuous, hence most powerful form
                  of all possible relations.” If any attempt to ‘relate’ aesthetics and politics runs
                  the danger of being co-opted by biopolitics, the alternative she proposes at the close
                  of her essay curiously bypasses both the question of Romanticism and that of aesthetics’
                  complicity with biopolitics. Through a reading of Lukacs’ <em>Theory of the Novel</em> as a “site where the question of form and life is played out exclusively as a problem
                  of aesthetic form,” and thus also as a test of Agamben’s “enigmatic idea of non-relationality,”
                  Geulen takes issue with the idea that one can “draw the line between aesthetic forms
                  and politics,” (which, since it presupposes their relation, would be to remain caught
                  up in the logic of the sovereign ban). What emerges from her reading is the account
                  of the novel as “a form of life in which no bare life can be separated, whose law
                  is life and whose life is its law,” with the consequence that “[t]here is no politics
                  of the novel and there can never be one, neither biopolitical nor sovereign.” In the
                  novelistic beyond of relation, then, and at an indistinct remove from Romanticism,
                  the question of politics loses its force, and the novel comes to be “not about art
                  but about life.” But if we are unable to decide whether this is a triumph of art or
                  the evacuation of its critical force, what Geulen’s turn to modernism’s quest to “abolish
                  or transform the distinction between art and life” <em>does</em> suggest is that the very idea of a “form-of-life” beyond politics, even and precisely
                  in its turn away from the question of romanticism, reiterates romanticism’s substitution
                  of language for life in the very effacement of what might yet be its critical legacy.</p>

               of power that target individuals not as “legal subjects” but as “living beings” (<em>Sexuality</em> 142-43), while for Giorgio Agamben the nation-state is biopolitical to the degree
               that it engages “not man as a free and conscious political subject but, above all,
               man’s bare life” (<em>Homo</em> 128).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               over the last 30 years reveals the following: between 1980 and 1989 we find one instance
               (by Donna J. Haraway), between 1990 and 1999 we find three, and between 2000 and 2009
               there are 65. The astonishing increase in biopolitical studies since 2000 in which
               we’re interested is corroborated by the same search on WorldCat, a database unrestricted
               to just critical studies: between 1980 and 1989 there were 105 publications on biopolitics,
               between 1990 and 1999 there were 164, and between 2000 and 2009 there were 756. Comparing
               the two sets of data, one can see that studies of biopolitics grew at a much faster
               rate since 2000 in critical studies than in the academy in general. Both searches
               were conducted in June 2010.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               it more clearly exemplifies the ambivalence with which we’re concerned. However, this
               ambivalence is also legible in the later version: <span class="quote">‘One might well imagine what it might have been like in 1800 for an analyst attempting
                  to grasp the transformative implications of the forerunners of the ‘birth of the clinic.’
                  Today we might well be in an analogous situation, where the drivers of change can
                  be already be discerned, some consequences predicted, but where the overall directions
                  remain obscure and their implications still in doubt. Thus it is hard to tell whether
                  we are at the early stages of a momentous shift, in the middle of a process that is
                  well under way towards stabilizing new forms, or in a conjuncture that will prove
                  to be a dead end or at least marginal to other changes that we cannot envisage today.
                  But in attempting to make a diagnosis from ‘in the middle’, we think that the concept
                  of biopower focuses our attention on three key elements that are at stake in any transformation—knowledge
                  of vital processes, power relations that take human beings as their object, and the
                  modes of subjectification through which subjects work on themselves qua living beings—as
                  well as their multiple combinations. (215)’</span></span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
