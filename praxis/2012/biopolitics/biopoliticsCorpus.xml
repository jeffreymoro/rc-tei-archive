                  <p>Were one to write a history of how late twentieth-century political concepts
                  emerged, and how they changed as they migrated across fields, disciplines and
                  continents, the notion of ‘biopolitics’ would make for an interesting case
                  study—which is to say that at this point in time it is both too late and too early
                  for such a project: too late, because the term has accrued such a variety of
                  meanings and encompasses so many different aspects, from prenatal diagnostics and
                  euthanasia to the treatment of refugees, smoking bans and ecology, that
                  restricting its meaning, for example, to Foucault’s understanding of biopolitics,
                  would be beside the point; and too early as well, precisely because the term still
                  carries acute, albeit unspecific, significance and therefore lacks the historical
                  distance required for critical assessment. Hence my first obligation as
                  commentator is to determine what each contributor means by the term. To facilitate
                  this task, a few orienting remarks are in order. </p>
                  <p>Even though Hannah Arendt never used the word biopolitics, she was among the first
                  to register and lament the increasing political preoccupation with the natural
                  processes of living such as sustenance and reproduction which, she believed, had
                  displaced politics and the public sphere in the pre-modern sense of classical
                  antiquity. Her diagnosis in <title level="m">The Human Condition</title> (1958) is
                  tentatively, by association more than argument, tied to her earlier investigation
                  of in <title level="m">The Origins of Totalitarianism</title> (1951). The link
                  between the decline of classical politics and the emergence of 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century totalitarianisms is given in the concept of nature. As nature
                  and natural life moved to the center of politics, nature (as well as history
                  understood as a force of nature) became trans-legal authorities totalitarian
                  politics appealed to in order to justify their actions. At the same time, Arendt
                  is also known as an avid critic of human rights because, in her view, those rights
                  were bound to produce right-less fugitives since the very declaration of those
                  rights (at least in France) was premised on citizenship and statehood. With her
                  critique of human rights, Arendt resumed a line of argument originally suggested
                  by Karl Marx in his problematic essay <title level="a">On the Jewish
                     Question</title> (1842), in which he argued that human rights refer to the
                  rights of property owners. </p>
                  <p>In his series of books on the figure of the <emph>homo sacer</emph>, Agamben names
                  Arendt as a predecessor for his own understanding of biopolitics (<title level="m">Homo Sacer </title>3ff). According to Agamben, Arendt had profound insights
                  into the biopolitical logic of modernity, but she failed to firmly connect her
                  critique of the ‘unnatural growth of the natural’ and the problematic parameters
                  of human rights to her investigation of modern totalitarianisms. Agamben believes
                  that Arendt was not up to the task because she lacked the concepts Michel Foucault
                  eventually provided with his notion of biopolitics some twenty years after Arendt
                  and without reference to her.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Among the most relevant texts by Michel Foucault on this subject belong the
                     following: <title level="m">History of Sexuality, Vol. 1</title>; <title level="m">Security, Territory, Population</title>; <title level="m">The
                        Birth of Biopolitics</title>; <title level="m">Society Must Be
                        Defended</title>. </note> In Foucault, biopolitics signifies a particular
                  point in the development of modern governmentality when population (rather than
                  territory) became the preferred object of political and social concerns. Foucault
                  contrasts this new notion of biopower or biopolitics to the older notion of
                  sovereign power. According to the most frequently (also in the present volume)
                  quoted definition, sovereign politics was about letting live and actively
                  exercising a right to kill; by contrast, biopolitics lets die but actively engages
                  the right (of the state) to enforce life and, in this sense, "makes live" (<title level="m">Society </title>241). However neatly the opposition of these two
                  paradigms appears initially, Foucault has occasionally pointed out that sovereign
                  power and biopower or biopolitics can overlap. Thus he remarked on the irony that
                  Franco, the last European political sovereign in the old sense, became subject to
                  biopolitical techniques aimed at prolonging his life when he fell ill. Nazi
                  ideology is another site where older sovereign power and modern biopower converge:
                     <quote>Nazism was doubtless the most cunning and the most naïve (and the former
                     because of the latter) combination of the fantasies of blood and the paroxysms
                     of a disciplinary power. A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied
                     in the way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the guise of
                     unrestricted state control (<emph>étatisation</emph>), was accompanied by the
                     oneiric exaltation of a superior blood; the latter implied both the systematic
                     genocide of others and the risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice. It is
                     an irony of history that Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignificant
                     practice while the blood myth was transformed into the greatest blood bath in
                     recent memory. (<title level="m">History</title> 149-50)</quote> The situation
                  is further complicated by the fact that Foucault introduced the term biopolitics
                  relatively late in life. He is certainly better known for his analyses of
                  disciplinary power, subject of his most famous studies on the clinic, the
                  penitentiary and the mental asylum.<note resp="editors" place="foot">See <title level="m">The Birth of the Clinic</title> and <title level="m">Discipline and Punish.</title>
                     </note> While boundaries between disciplinary power and biopolitics are certainly
                  more difficult to draw than those between sovereign and biopower, it is safe to
                  say that they are not the same thing. However, the three articles under
                  consideration here tend to confound the two concepts. Their authors often use
                  biopolitics in such a way that it encompasses disciplinary strategies while the
                  latter term is eclipsed entirely. One difference between disciplinary power and
                  biopower suggested by Foucault himself concerns the different ‘materials’ and the
                  different bodies of knowledge they require. Disciplinary powers tend to work on
                  individuals who are turned into docile bodies by institutions such as schools and
                  hospitals. Biopower, however, has populations as its object. Hence biopower is
                  inconceivable without the new type of knowledge provided by Malthusian statistics
                  at the close of the eighteenth century. Later on, eugenics, social Darwinism and
                  scientific racism produce similarly structured knowledge. While the distinction
                  between individuals and larger entities is initially helpful, it is far from
                  clear-cut when issues like education or sexuality are under consideration where
                  the very relation of the individual to entities (such as nations, races or
                  populations) is at stake, as Foucault himself pointed out in the last chapter of
                  his <title level="m">History of Sexuality: An Introduction</title> from 1978. </p>
                  <p>To make matters even more confusing, Foucault actually uses two different terms
                  for this phenomenon, namely biopower and biopolitics. There is scant evidence that
                  the two concepts need to be distinguished, as some believe. Given that Foucault
                  was more interested in the minutiae of particular practices than in conceptual
                  precision, it is doubtful whether biopolitics and biopower can or should be
                  distinguished. It would certainly be more desirable to explore the relations
                  between disciplinary power and biopolitics/biopower, but that would be better left
                  to a Foucault specialist. Suffice it to say that the most pertinent definition of
                  biopower and biopolitics most frequently cited by Foucault emphasizes its
                  difference from classical sovereignty. </p>
                  <p>However, their opposition is not exhausted by the obvious reversal of the
                  respective positions of life and death in the sense of the definition referred to
                  above, but also extends to the respective spheres in which sovereignty and
                  biopolitics are situated. Sovereignty is, for all intents and purposes, a legal
                  discourse contingent on jurisprudence (and theology), whereas both disciplinary
                  power and particularly biopower develop technologies based on the kind of
                  knowledge produced by newly emergent sciences such as biology and statistics in
                  the late eighteenth century (whose legal codification in racial laws, for example,
                  is secondary). This marks the very juncture where Agamben’s notion of biopolitics
                  diverges most obviously from Foucault. Agamben refuses to accept this historical
                  distinction and argues instead for a constitutive nexus of biopolitics and
                  sovereign power. According to Agamben, sovereign power has been biopolitics all
                  along. Both are essentially legal notions and the famous <emph>homo sacer</emph>,
                  briefly referred to as an archaic practice of Roman law in the fragmentary
                  compilations of Pompejus Festus, is the most significant piece of evidence in
                  Agamben’s attempt to make the case that sovereign power has always been
                  biopolitics. Their nexus unfolds in what Agamben calls the logic of the ‘ban’
                     (<title level="m">Homo Sacer </title>15-29, 104-110). Isolating, ex-cepting and
                  exempting a ‘natural’ life (however that might be defined) from the sovereign
                  sphere is said to be any sovereignty’s original and constitutive move. By banning
                  it, the ruling law delivers this outlawed life over to death with impunity. For,
                  according to Festus, the <emph>homo sacer </emph>is a person who cannot be
                  sacrificed, but whose killing also does not amount to a sacrilege and will not
                  entail any consequences, neither with respect to divine nor to any other law. For
                  Agamben then, sovereign politics is biopolitics and biopolitics is, at bottom,
                  always a politics of death and killing. That biopolitics, defined by Foucault as a
                  politics of fostering and enforcing life should turn out to have been a
                  ‘thanatopolitics’ from the start, is revealed most radically (and lethally) in the
                  concentration camps. In Agamben’s view, the death camps are permanent sites of
                  exception where the survival of the German race is produced by killing Jews. In
                  the camps, the difference between rule and exception, between life and death
                  disappears in what Agamben calls a zone of indistinction (47). Also disappearing
                  into a zone of indistinction are historical and local differences. Agamben traces
                  his idea of a lethal biopolitics at the heart of all sovereignty all the way back
                  to archaic Roman law and he extends it to encompass contemporary sites such as
                  Guantanamo Bay, European refugee camps, and airport transit zones, all of which
                  supposedly share the structure of the camps. </p>
                  <p>Given the range of possible sites for <emph>homines sacri</emph> in the present
                  and throughout history, one begins to see why Agamben’s studies have had such a
                  profound impact in so many different areas of culture and politics. For those of
                  us in the business of philology and Western literature, there are two topics that
                  immediately suggest themselves as promising sites for engaging Agamben’s theory.
                  There is modernism and, with it, the various Avant-gardes which seek to abolish or
                  transform the distinction between life and art (Cf. Bachmann et al.), and there
                  is, of course, the earlier blue-print for such experiments, Romanticism, with its
                  emphatic notion of nature and its organicism, all of which co-emerged with the
                  very technologies Foucault associates with the rise of biopolitics (or biopower). </p>
                  <p>All three contributors agree that re-considering Romanticism in light of
                  biopolitics is worthwhile, and, surprisingly, despite their different subject
                  matters and approaches, they all turn out to be more or less fervent defenders of
                  Romanticism. One might have expected the opposite, given that many analyses tend
                  to use the perspective of biopolitics to indict or, at least, challenge the
                  cherished icons of the Romantic tradition. One could imagine that particularly
                  those working in the field of German, who just witnessed the Schiller anniversary,
                  would seize the opportunity to question the author of the <title level="m">Letters
                     on Aesthetic Education of Man</title> and hero of the Left up to and including
                  his peculiar reception by Jacques Rancière. However, the authors collected in this
                  volume are determined to relieve Romanticism from any biopolitical charges and
                  suspicions. In fact, they seem to use the question of biopolitics and Romanticism
                  as an opportunity to rehabilitate much-maligned aesthetics. Perhaps these scholars
                  are actually fighting demons other than biopolitics. Occasional references to
                  Terry Eagleton or Paul de Man suggest dissatisfaction with the aversion against
                  aesthetics notorious in deconstructive readings as well as in older left-wing
                  ideological critique. Clearly, all three contributors perceive of biopolitics as a
                  version of that earlier charge and they rebel against it in different ways. </p>
                  <p>However, considering that it was Agamben whose books ignited current discussions
                  of ‘biopolitics and X’, perhaps expectations of critical indictment of Romanticism
                  are flawed to begin with. Any reader of Agamben will not fail to notice that he is
                  not only a scathing critic of our current politics, but that he, perhaps even more
                  so then Derrida before him, is drawing on rich, often arcane, sources of
                  Old-European learnedness such as Pindar and Plato, Aristotle and Augustine, to
                  name just a few. Moreover, he is also a highly astute reader of poetry and
                  literature, as his marvelous book <title level="m">Stanzas</title> or the prose
                  vignettes collected in <title level="m">The Open: Man and Animal</title> show.
                  Even in his book on the camps, <title level="m">Remnants of Auschwitz</title>,
                  Primo Levi is his main source, while Hölderlin and other authors hover in the
                  margins. With those and additional pieces on Robert Walser, for example, and his
                  re-discovery of Max Kommerell in mind (<title level="m">Potentialities</title>),
                  positive assertions of aesthetics seem very much in line with Agamben’s own
                     interests.<note resp="editors" place="foot">Yet it is worth
                     mentioning that in his early works Agamben is very much a critic of aesthetics
                     in the tradition of Heidegger and others. Cf. <title level="m">The Man without
                        Content</title>. </note> Indeed, much of the attraction he currently exerts
                  on the intellectual (and by no means exclusively academic) imagination has to do
                  with his literary and aesthetic sensibilities which, for once, do not come at the
                  price of political stakes but appear to be in tune with them. However, even this
                  reminder could not quite dispel my initial surprise; I will return to this. </p>
                  <p>In any case, from the initially unexpected consensus among them one might infer
                  that the readings, while nominally about biopolitics, actually belong to a
                  recently emerging trend to re-consider and re-evaluate aesthetics. This interest
                  might have been occasioned by discussions surrounding biopolitics, but it is
                  certainly not limited to that issue. Recall, for example, Elaine Scarry’s elegant
                  quasi-platonic defense of beauty from the late 1990s as an early instance of
                  reconsidering the role of aesthetics. The already mentioned Jacques Rancière also
                  made great efforts to rehabilitate the tradition of autonomous art since Schiller
                  from an idiosyncratic but certainly political perspective. Christoph Menke, whose
                  work offers the most significant contributions to date in reshaping our
                  understanding of aesthetics, even took on the question of biopolitics and
                  aesthetics directly, seeking to distinguish Foucault’s disciplinary power from
                  aesthetic practice in an essay aptly entitled ‘Two kinds of exercise’ (‘Zweierlei
                     Übung’).<note resp="editors" place="foot">See also Menke
                     and Rebentisch. </note> However, none of these authors figures here. But it is
                  rather obvious that biopolitics appears to have assumed the place occupied by
                  older ideology critiques of aesthetics. At issue in all articles is aesthetics by
                  way of biopolitics and not the other way around as one might have expected. That
                  is not to say that the issues at hand—abortion in the case of Sara Guyer,
                  education in Marc Redfield and Mill’s utilitarian philosophy in Emily Sun’s
                  text—have nothing to do with biopolitics. However, the specificities of
                  biopolitics tend to be assigned lesser importance vis-à-vis the overt interest in
                  rehabilitating aesthetics. Having made this observation, I hasten to add that I
                  find this objective rather intriguing and that I certainly have no better, more
                  interesting or specific way of considering the question of Romanticism and
                  biopolitics. All I can offer in the final pages is an attempt to recast the
                  question of aesthetics and biopolitics by way of two concepts from their
                  respective spheres, namely form and life. To this end I will turn to Lukáçs’
                     <title level="m">Theory of the Novel</title> from 1916. However, having
                  isolated, for now, the re-emergence of aesthetics as the dominant motif uniting
                  the different contributions to this volume, I would like to examine each a bit
                  more closely on its own terms before considering Lukáçs in the last section. </p>

                  <head>II</head>
                  <p>Of the three contributions, Sara Guyer’s article on ‘Biopoetics’ is most obviously
                  programmatic in nature. What she proposes as ‘biopoetics’ is sharply distinguished
                  from and even opposed to its meaning and use in Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner’s
                  1999 anthology of the same name. While they profess faith in the existence of
                  artistic universals defining “our common humanity” (qtd. in Guyer), Guyer’s own
                  tentative appeal to an alternative “new humanistic method” is based on the
                  rejection of the scientific approach favored by the authors of <title level="m">Biopoetics: Evolutionary Exploration in the Arts</title>, which she associates
                  with the scientifically generated techniques of social control originally
                  described by Michel Foucault as biopolitics (or biopower, respectively).
                  Alternatively, her sense of ‘biopoetics’ relies on the power (but also: the
                  failure) of specific poetic operations—tropes of animation such as prosopopeia and
                  apostrophe. In outlining this other sense of biopoetics, she pursues a double
                  strategy. In the first part of her article, she engages various critics and
                  theoreticians to explore different ways of relating biopolitics and the lyric. In
                  the second part, she offers an elegant reading of a particular poem by John Clare
                  in which biopolitics in Foucault’s sense and the lyric come together in a way
                  obliquely suggested by Barbara Johnson, but more poignantly articulated in the
                  poem at hand. On Guyer’s reading, the poem exposes itself neither as a power over
                  life nor a power to kill but as a dissipating power, a weakness, as it were. At
                  stake in her reading is the failure of address, poetry’s failure to conjure up a
                  life no longer or not yet there but not exactly dead either. This poetically
                  performed failure of poetic sovereignty results in the insight that “sovereignty
                  and abandonment can share the same rhetoric”. In this, she finds an implicitly
                  consoling answer to the question that looms large in the first part of the essay:
                  Is literature, in particular Romantic literature, which emerges at the same time
                  as the newly devised strategies of biopolitics, analogous to those mechanisms,
                  perhaps even complicit with them? What does the biopolitical wish to wield power
                  over life have to do with the lyric modes of animating inanimate objects? Is
                  Romanticism, in fact, a secret agent of biopolitical technologies and strategies?
                  Assuming this is Guyer’s question, her answer is absolutely clear: literature
                  plays a different role with regard to life; it is neither a latent medium nor a
                  manifest agent of biopolitics. Yet literature’s chief concern is not death either,
                  as a certain reading of de Man’s deconstruction tends to suggest. Instead, poetry
                  and, by extension, biopoetics, is, for Guyer, a human and humanistic account of
                  life deeply opposed to biopolitics. </p>
                  <p>With her emphatic insistence on poetry as a humanistic concern not exhausted by
                  science or technique, Guyer relieves poetry from the suspicion of being an
                  accomplice to biopolitics; at the same time she rejects the older prejudice
                  against Romanticism as organicist ideology. On her reading, biopoetics is an
                  ambivalent—but in its ambivalence unequivocally so—counter-concept and antidote to
                  biopolitics. While her position is clear, I am less certain about the motivation
                  and more uncertain still about the way she stages her questions and her answers.
                  Some of these difficulties may well have to do with the conceptual problems
                  surrounding biopolitics. The focus on abortion, as introduced by Johnson and
                  Deutscher, raises additional problems. For Guyer, abortion is per se a
                  biopolitical issue, as is the death penalty. However, this is debatable. According
                  to Foucault’s notion of biopolitics, abortion is not biopolitical because it does
                  not concern populations (or races) but individuals in relation to other sovereign
                  instances such as the state, which does or does not legalize abortion. The
                  question is more complicated when viewed from Agamben’s perspective. According to
                  him, the biopolitical goal to further, prolong, extend, and foster life was, at
                  bottom, always the desire to obtain a license to kill with impunity. The logic at
                  work here is most radically exemplified by Nazi-Racism in which the death of Jews
                  ensures the survival, the life of the Arian race. I hesitate to draw this analogy,
                  but no state will question abortion if the mother’s life is at stake. Hence
                  abortion is not biopolitical in Agamben’s sense either. (Since he harks back to
                  Roman law it is worth pointing out that one of the ways biopolitics reared its
                  head in the Roman Republic was the <emph>potestas vitae necisque</emph>, the right
                  of the father to decide whether his already born son should live or die. In his
                  analysis of this legal term, Agamben argues that this absolute power over the son
                  is the condition on which one becomes a free Roman citizen and thus a political
                  subject.) However, in another sense the issue of abortion is indeed strictly
                  biopolitical because what is legally, morally and medically at stake is the very
                  question which, according to Agamben, is the fatal problem of all politics to
                  date: what constitutes life or, more specifically, what constitutes viable life? I
                  do not know what Agamben would have to say about abortion, but one could argue
                  that the very fact that there are legal and moral debates about abortion is a sign
                  that politics has indeed been reduced to (or rather: still is) all about drawing a
                  (legal) boundary that separates life from what is not yet, or no longer, life. In
                  this perspective, abortion is indeed on par with the problematic state of comatose
                  patients who are either dead or alive depending on which legal and medical rule is
                  brought to bear on their case, and fetal life does indeed begin to look like
                  occupying a zone of indistinction similar to that of the comatose or the
                     <emph>Muselmann</emph> in the camps. Obviously, that is a highly problematic
                  line of argument, which I would rather not pursue. Suffice it to say that I am not
                  sure what to make of the notion of fetal life as introduced by Guyer via Johnson. </p>
                  <p>While the biopolitics of abortion and the idea of fetal life are pertinent but
                  somewhat fuzzy (perhaps necessarily so), biopolitics moves into full view just
                  when Guyer believes to have broken its shackles and moved beyond it into the realm
                  of what she calls biopoetics. This occurs in her reading of Clare’s poem. Here the
                  notion of a fetal life in a zone of indistinction is linked to a poetic
                  sovereignty that fails to govern, a poetic power that fails to animate. This
                  failure exposes the co-existence, even dependency of sovereign rhetoric and a
                  rhetoric of abandonment, failure, and impotence. The reason why the biopoetic as
                  presented in this article could, in fact, be identified as the biopolitical
                  itself, has to do with one of Agamben’s more interesting but less cited arguments.
                  According to him, the constitutive nexus between sovereign power and biopower lies
                  in the fact that the ultimate power of the sovereign (or, for that matter: the
                  law) is its ability to withdraw and suspend itself. By surrendering its powerful
                  hold on a life, it exposes this life to death with impunity. True power is the
                  power to abandon power, as the law does when a state of emergency or exception is
                  announced. As is well known, what Agamben’s calls the ‘logic of the ban’ is
                  indebted to Carl Schmitt, who made the decision to suspend the rule of law in the
                  state of exception the cornerstone of his theory of sovereignty. Whereas Schmitt’s
                  decisionism celebrates the active act of deciding as proof of sovereign power,
                  Agamben, by contrast, emphasizes the passivity and the powerlessness of power as
                  the key element. (In part, this has to do with his reading of Aristotle as
                  developed in the essays collected in <title level="m">Potentialities</title>.)
                  When Guyer emphasizes the intertwinement of powerlessness and sovereignty, she
                  comes rather close to describing Agamben’s logic of the ban that is at the core of
                  biopolitics.</p>
                  <p>Like Sara Guyer, Marc Redfield, too, is invested in literature as a site where the
                  workings of biopower are, if not resisted, then at least revealed in their
                  dependence on specifically literary operations that “compose and exceed not just
                  law or right per se, but also the sovereign exception that founds and exceeds law”
                  (6). In other words: literature is the better theory of biopolitics. After an
                  impressively succinct summary of both Foucault and Agamben, Redfield focuses on
                  ‘Bildung’, the formation of subjects, as a supposedly non-coercive model of
                  control that can also be read in a more sinister vein as a biopolitical phantasm
                  (Redfield’s measured agreement with Eagleton’s critique of Romantic aesthetics
                  evidences that he too considers the charge of biopolitics leveled against
                  Romanticism of a kind with earlier ideology critiques). His subsequent readings of
                  Schiller and Goethe are designed to demonstrate that their texts, even and
                  especially when they are not thematically concerned with biopolitical issues,
                  reflect on what Redfield with Agamben calls the “inscription of natural life in
                  the juridico-political order” (5), which Agamben (as Arendt before him) locates in
                  the Declaration of the Rights of Man. </p>
                  <p>He readily concedes that Schiller’s notion of aesthetic education does indeed lend
                  itself to a biopolitical reading (although, like Guyer, he also seems to identify
                  Foucault’s biopower with his idea of disciplinary power). What concerns him most
                  is the concealed violence of aesthetic education and practice. And his point is
                  well taken. Education, considered by Kant the greatest task because the welfare of
                  the entire species depends on it [‘das Geheimnis der Gattung’] is, on the face of
                  it, a highly suggestive candidate for biopolitical interests precisely because the
                  future of the species depends on the individual and vice versa. However, in a
                  closer reading of Schiller’s famous passage on the artist and the politician from
                  the <title level="m">Letters on Aesthetic Education</title> Redfield can show that
                  things are more complicated, involving duplicities and slippages. Where Guyer
                  focuses on undecidability, Redfield emphasizes an ‘instability haunting’
                  Schiller’s text, its figures and tropes. While acknowledging peculiar and
                  suspicious convergences between the free play of the faculties in the aesthetic
                  state and the state of exception, Redfield eventually sides with (Schiller’s)
                  aesthetics against biopolitics because Schiller’s text exposes any pretensions to
                  aesthetic sovereignty as illusory. As in the case of Guyer’s reading of Clare’s
                  “To Mary,” aesthetic artifacts question the sovereignty of sovereignty. If,
                  however, sovereignty’s power resides precisely in its ability to surrender power,
                  in the power to exempt lives from its hold, then recognizing that sovereignty does
                  not govern does little to alter the operative biopolitical structure. Redfield’s
                  reading of Goethe’s as opposed to Schiller’s response to the revolution in his
                  “Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten,” which, incidentally, is indebted to
                  Andreas Gailus’ interpretation of this text, proceeds along similar lines. </p>
                  <p>While Redfield and Guyer’s respective texts offer very different perspectives,
                  they both intend to show that the texts under consideration “stage and deconstruct
                  sovereign violence” (Redfield 19). Just as Guyer, Redfield argues that art and
                  aesthetic theory expose and reveal what would otherwise remain hidden. Aesthetics
                  (not in general, but in the works of Schiller and Goethe he has chosen) is
                  heralded as a discourse capable of displaying “traces of a violence that
                  sovereigns commandeer but cannot properly command”. However, a free-floating
                  violence (as in the case of constitutionally anchored states of exception) that is
                  no longer tied to a person is no less violent and perhaps even more so, as Agamben
                  shows when he suggests that the problem of sovereignty is not person-bound (as
                  Schmitt believed) but structural. In other words: I am not sure whether an
                  ambivalence discovered, an inconsistency revealed, a delusion exposed are in
                  themselves improvements of any sort. At work in both essays is a fundamental
                  belief in the powers of enlightenment—as if the recognition and articulation of
                  instabilities and inconsistencies, which readings of literature can reveal, made
                  the operative norms any less normative. The implicit value attributed to moments
                  of undecidability and ambivalence is all the more remarkable in light of the fact
                  that Agamben’s success probably has something to do with his oedipal revolt
                  against Derrida and deconstruction where ambivalence was held in high esteem. One
                  could even speculate that Agamben’s insistence on the fatality of indistinction
                  calls the value deconstruction accorded to ambivalence into question. This much is
                  suggested by his rather explicitly anti-Derridean reading of Kafka’s parable
                  ‘Before the Law’ when Agamben writes: <quote>The prestige of deconstruction in our
                     time lies precisely in its having conceived of the entire text of tradition as
                     being in force without significance, a being in force whose strength lies
                     essentially in its undecidability and having shown that such a being in force
                     is, like the door of the Law in Kafka’s parable, absolutely impassable. But it
                     is precisely concerning the sense of being in force … that our position
                     distinguishes itself from that of deconstruction. (<title level="m">Homo Sacer
                     </title>54)</quote> Agamben interprets the figure of the man before the law as
                  a Messianic figure whose very goal is to get the open door of the Law to close.
                  With reference to deconstruction he continues: <quote>What threatens thinking here
                     is the possibility that thinking might find itself condemned to infinite
                     negotiations with the doorkeeper, or, even worse, that it might end by itself
                     assuming the role of the doorkeeper who, without really blocking the entry,
                     shelters the Nothing onto which the door opens. (54)</quote> Those are rather
                  strong words, aimed at questioning an overestimation of ambivalence and
                  undecidability. </p>
                  <p>Of all three contributions, Emily Sun in her intriguing essay on John Stuart
                  Mill’s encounter with Wordsworth has the strictest conceptual sense of
                  biopolitics. She relies not on the Foucault of the lectures on Racism with their
                  famous juxtaposition of sovereign power and biopower, nor the <title level="m">History of Sexuality</title>, but draws instead primarily on Foucault’s
                  lectures in the <title level="m">Birth of Biopolitics</title> from the late 70s,
                  where biopolitics is related to the emergence of liberalism beginning in the late
                  eighteenth century. By the same token, Sun’s interesting essay is also the least
                  concerned with traces of the biopolitical within aesthetic artifacts. Rather, her
                  reading of Wordsworth’s significance for John Stuart Mill amounts to something of
                  a case study in the power of aesthetic education in Schiller’s sense. Haven fallen
                  into crisis, Mill’s turn to Wordsworth affects a turn away from the liberal
                  utilitarianism he had previously espoused. Less ambiguously than Redfield and
                  Guyer, Sun views art more straightforwardly as antidote to a notion of politics
                  reduced to managing populations. However, she also acknowledges a link between the
                  two worlds of Benthamite reasoning and Wordsworth’s poetry. As in the
                  contributions by Guyer and Redfield, (literary) rhetoric is once more at issue. In
                  her case, a rhetoric of theatricality enables and underpins the transformation of
                  Mill’s utilitarianism. Whether that implicates art in liberalism or liberalism in
                  aesthetics is of lesser concern for Sun, in part because of her very clearly
                  defined notion of biopolitics and in part because she confines herself to tracing
                  the noticeable shifts affected by Mill’s discovery of Wordsworth. </p>

                  <head>III</head>
                  <p>At one point in her article, Sara Guyer refers to Agamben’s notion of
                     <emph>forma-di-vita</emph>. While Agamben has neglected to elaborate this term
                  in greater detail, it is certainly legitimate to identify form-of-life as an
                  alternative to the bare life produced by sovereignty. Form-of-life, Guyer writes
                  with reference to a short text by Agamben of that title, entertains “a relation to
                  the indeterminate and unprogrammed” (Guyer). As <emph>forma-di-vita</emph>, life
                  is indeed about the (non-actualized or unlived) possibilities of life as opposed
                  to sovereignty’s efforts to separate and isolate a mere life. Thus the term points
                  to Agamben’s idiosyncratic ontological re-description of possibility in his
                  readings of Aristotle. All other definitions of the enigmatic concept of
                  form-of-life are based on negation. Accordingly, form-of-life is a life in which
                  no life can be abstracted or isolated from the form this life has assumed. Leaving
                  aside the general semantic overdetermination of <emph>forma-di-vita</emph>,
                  form-of-life or, in German, <emph>Lebensform</emph> (which, incidentally,
                  signifies a qualified life just as much as a life-form, i.e. species), it is worth
                  pointing out that problems of life and form are a great concern in at least two
                  spheres of thought. Since Romanticism (in the widest sense), life and form and
                  their numerous permutations have been subject to aesthetic practice and theory. In
                  addition (and, conceptually speaking, in close vicinity), the compound noun unites
                  two concepts circulating in many strands of late nineteenth- and early
                  twentieth-century <emph>Lebensphilosophie</emph>. While Agamben never refers to
                  any of the relevant authors explicitly, his proximity to Deleuze, whom we owe one
                  of the most sophisticated readings of Bergson to date, might have influenced his
                  terminological choice. More obviously, <emph>forma-di-vita</emph> is also a
                  reformulation of Heidegger’s <emph>Dasein.</emph>
                     <note resp="editors" place="foot">See Agamben’s essay “Form of
                     Life,” in <title level="m">Means without End</title>. Though Agamben does not
                     cite Heidegger directly, most of the essay’s diction and content, however, very
                     clearly point back to § 9 of Heidegger’s <title level="m">Being and
                        Time</title>. </note> Bringing together in some way or other the notion of
                  life as unformed flow and form as lasting shape is a central topic in authors like
                  Bergson, Simmel, and others up to and including Heidegger. However, whether the
                  nexus of life and form can or should be thought of as a <emph>relation</emph>, is,
                  in fact, at issue in all of these authors and also informs Agamben’s own
                  discussions of <emph>forma-di-vita. </emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps his most sustained but also speculative and enigmatic elucidations of
                     <emph>forma-di-vita</emph> are part of the very chapter in which he offers his
                  already quoted critique of Derrida and deconstruction. In those sections, entitled
                  ‘Form of Law’, Agamben interprets Kafka’s famous parable ‘Before the Law’ as an
                  allegory of the sovereign exception or ban which includes what it excludes and
                  hence maintains a relation to it by not relating to it. What holds bare life and
                  mere form (of the law) together is nothing else than this relationship which
                  Agamben designates as ban (<title level="m">Homo Sacer </title>49-62). Borrowing a
                  phrase from the correspondence between Gershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin on
                  Kafka, the law in “Before the Law” is said to be “in force but without
                  significance” (51). In the state of exception the law is stripped of any content
                  and “the empty potentiality is so much in force as to become indistinguishable
                  from life” (51). Against this background Agamben raises the question of whether
                  there might be a “form of life (…) that corresponds to the form of law” (52). The
                  dissolution of the ban with its peculiarly extreme relationship of relating by
                  not-relating would require, Agamben argues, to acknowledge that life and law, just
                  like Heidegger’s being and Being, do not have “the form of a relation” (60). He
                  further suggests that this “implies nothing less than an attempt to think the
                  politico-social factum no longer in the form of a relation” (60). For if one
                  thinks of life and law in terms of a relation, any relation, one has already
                  succumbed to the logic of the ban which, according to Agamben, is the most
                  extreme, most tenuous and hence most powerful form of all possible relations.
                  Agamben concludes that the mere form of law (as given in the state of exception
                  and resulting in the indistinguishability of life and law) can be countered or
                  “confronted by life that, in a symmetrical but inverse gesture, is entirely
                  transformed into law” (55) which presumably would amount to a true (Messianic)
                  state of exception rather than the permanent state of exception we are said to
                  live in. The only examples of such a form of life can be found in the bizarre
                  gallery of <emph>homines sacri</emph> at the close of Agamben’s book, featuring
                  the <emph>Muselmann</emph>, a comatose patient, the Roman priest <emph>Flamen
                     Diale</emph> and Hitler, among others. The Roman priest as well as Hitler may
                  perhaps be considered as figures whose life has been transformed into law, whereas
                  the comatose patient like the <emph>Muselmann</emph> might represent a law that
                  has become life. Disturbing as this prospect is, Agamben appears to have his hopes
                  staked on this inversion:<note resp="editors" place="foot">Ambivalent formulations are part of Agamben’s provocations. An example of
                     deliberate ambivalence can be found in the beginning of the chapter on
                     “Sovereignty and Bare Life”: “The ‘enigmas’ that our century has proposed to
                     historical reason and that remain with us (Nazism is only the most disquieting
                     among them) will be solved only on the terrain—biopolitics—on which they were
                     formed” (<title level="m">Homo Sacer</title> 4). For a more thorough discussion
                     of this aspect, see Geulen.</note> if a life could transform itself into law as
                  its form and thus become a form of life in which law and life are inseparable,
                  there would be no room for relations and hence no room for the logic of the
                  sovereign ban that upholds the logic of relations by holding its elements in
                  permanent suspense. </p>
                  <p>While it is perhaps impossible to conceive of a politics of
                     <emph>forma-di-vita</emph> or, for that matter, of any politics, without
                  recourse to the notion of relation, there exists indeed a form, an aesthetic form,
                  that is virtually indistinguishable from life, a form that does not relate to its
                  content in any way because its form, its formal law binds it directly to the
                  (discrete, heterogeneous, form- and law-less) empiricism of life; a form,
                  moreover, which for this very reason has frequently been judged to be a formless
                  form or a ‘half-art [<emph>Halbkunst</emph>]’ (Lukáçs 73). That form, a modern
                  form, is the novel. At least this is what Georg Lukáçs sought to argue in his
                     <title level="m">Theory of the Novel</title> from 1916, which remains one of
                  the most powerful and rich theoretical explorations of the novel as a form
                     <emph>sui generis</emph> (rather than a genre among others). Given the
                  prominence of the terms ‘life’ and ‘form’ in his text, it is highly instructive to
                  re-read his book in light of the question of biopolitics and aesthetics. The
                  point, however, is not to provide any answers to the question whether aesthetics
                  is complicit with biopolitics, but to reframe the very question by shifting the
                  terrain. Instead of asking about possible relations between aesthetics and
                  biopolitics, Lukáçs’ <emph>Theory of the Novel</emph> may be productively (re)read
                  as a site where the question of form and life is played out exclusively as a
                  problem of aesthetic form. Therefore, his essay may be considered a testing
                  ground, as it were, for the conceptual viability of Agamben’s enigmatic idea of
                     <emph>forma-di-vita</emph>. Before making the case for such a re-reading, an
                  obvious objection or question needs to be addressed: what are the reasons for
                  doing so? If Agamben and notions of biopolitics allow us to relate politics and
                  aesthetics in a number of different ways, should one not hold on to that
                  possibility rather than giving up on politics and, once more, withdrawing into the
                  aesthetic sphere? Indeed, but any attempt to ‘relate’ aesthetics and politics
                  upholds their distinction and separateness. If Agamben has a lesson to teach, it
                  is that distinction and relation can result in a highly problematic collapse of
                  distinctions. In other words: if there is something to Agamben’s claim that
                  relationality has proven inherently problematic with respect to law and life, it
                  might be worthwhile to pursue the non-relational idea of
                     <emph>forma-di-vita</emph> in aesthetics without relating it to politics. Of
                  course, this is bound to raise the specter of the aestheticization of politics; at
                  the very least it could be misinterpreted as an attempt to call Agamben’s
                  political stakes into question by showing that the core problems are aesthetic in
                  nature and only parade as political. Yet such an argument would also depend on
                  being able to draw the line between aesthetic forms and politics. And it is to
                  challenge this idea that I am enlisting Lukáçs. As an added benefit this might
                  also shed some light on the enigmatic idea of non-relationality associated with
                     <emph>forma-di-vita. </emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the many terms Lukáçs’ account of the novel employs, such as law, life and
                  form, none is more dominant than that of form. Contrary to many readings
                  (including his own assertions in the later preface) and his supposed Hegelianism,
                  he is less concerned with philosophy of history than with intrinsic questions of
                  form. And it is important to note that, in a manner inconceivable for Hegel,
                  philosophy too is for Lukáçs an aesthetic form, which he places next to epic and
                  tragedy as the third of “the great and timeless paradigmatic forms of world
                  literature [<emph>Weltgestaltung</emph>]” (35). Moreover, the emergence of all
                  three forms already presupposes the loss of totality and a rupture between subject
                  and object, soul and action, life and its significance. This is true of philosophy
                  “as a form of life” (29) and it is also true of the great Homeric epics. They are
                  certainly not the adequate expression of a totality enjoyed by the Greeks and
                  forever unattainable to the moderns. On the contrary, the very existence of
                  Homer’s epics proves that life has lost its immanent significance. This is not to
                  say that there are no differences between Homer, Dante, and the modern novel, but
                  they all respond in different ways to the same problematic: “Every art form is
                  defined by the metaphysical dissonance of life which it accepts and organizes as
                  the basis of totality complete in itself” (71). Admittedly, for Homer it was just
                  a matter of lifting the meaningful forms of life to consciousness, whereas the
                  modern novel forever seeks and seeks to produce what it would rather just find.
                  This is why the novel is called the epic “of an age in which the extensive
                  totality of life is no longer given, in which the immanence of meaning in life has
                  become a problem, yet which still thinks in terms of totality [<emph>die Gesinnung
                     zur Totalität hat</emph>]” (56). Persisting through its different
                  manifestations in the epic, the novella or the novel is what Lukáçs calls “the
                  formative <emph>a priori</emph>” (44) or “formal <emph>a priori</emph>”
                     (46)—<emph>Formapriorität</emph>—shared by all epic forms. Whereas tragedy’s
                  ‘formal <emph>a priori</emph>’ consists in answering the question: “how can
                  meaning [<emph>Wesen</emph>] come to life?” all epic forms respond to the inverse
                  question: how can life transcend itself and become meaningful: “How can life
                  become essential [<emph>wesenhaft</emph>]?” (35). In Agamben’s terminology, how
                  can life become form-of-life, in Heidegger’s, how can being become Being? The
                  undeniable uniqueness of Homer’s works over and against all other ‘great epic
                  forms’, including the novel, stems from the fact that Greek epic gave an answer to
                  that question before the question arose as such (13). Its formulation was
                  philosophy’s task, which succeeded the epic and articulated the very problem to
                  which the former had already found the solution. This peculiarity of Greek epic
                  removes it forever from our grasp. In fact, the radicality with which Lukáçs
                  insists on the epos’ ultimate otherness surpasses both Nietzsche’s earlier and
                  Benjamin’s later reflections on Greek antiquity in general and tragedy in
                  particular.</p>
                  <p>The rhythm of the emergence and transformations of these three forms (epic,
                  tragedy and philosophy) is indeed, if not exactly preordained by, then at least
                  synchronized with “the historic-philosophical position of the world’s clock” (91).
                  However, the conclusion that the very purpose of art and its respective forms is
                  to provide a dissonant world and fragmented life with the meaningful totality both
                  are lacking is deceptive. Instead, each form must obey its own structural logic
                  and formal law, independent of the state of affairs (which philosophy charts):
                     <quote>Each form appears positive because it fulfills its own structural laws:
                     the affirmation of life that seems to emanate from it as a mood is nothing
                     other than the resolving of its form-conditioned [<emph>formgeforderten</emph>]
                     dissonances, the affirmation of its own, form-created
                        [<emph>formgeschaffenen</emph>] substance.<note resp="editors" place="foot">In an earlier passage, Lukáçs had written: “Art always
                        says ‘And yet!’ to art” (72).</note> (128) </quote> The emphasis should be
                  on “form-conditioned” and “form-created”. The dissonances and their dissolution
                  into a meaningful totality are equally functions of the internal law of forms,
                  quite independent of everything else. The historical fate of the various forms is
                  thus determined by the formal specificities in accordance with the questions a
                  particular aesthetic form attempts to answer. Hence, tragedy, which responds to
                  the question how essence can come alive, is more immune to changes in what Lukáçs
                  calls “the transcendental structure of the form-giving subject and the world of
                  created forms” (40f). The reason why tragedy survived longer and adapted better to
                  the fundamental rifts in the relationship of life and meaning is to be found in
                  its ‘formative a <emph>priori</emph>.’ In all drama, meaning is given or posited
                  and at issue is how to bring it to life. Therefore, drama is more likely to
                  produce a perhaps in many ways problematic, but nevertheless a whole world (for
                  example in the figure of the hero). Epic does not have this option because its
                  Form <emph>a priori</emph> is entirely different. What is given to the epic is not
                  any transcendent meaning of life but just life itself. All epic forms are such
                  that “the world at any given moment is an ultimate principle; they are empirical
                  at their deepest, most decisive, all-determining transcendental base“ (46). A few
                  pages later, Lukáçs adds that all epic’s empiricity is “form-demanded
                     [<emph>formgewollt</emph>]” (49).<note resp="editors" place="foot">The translation has been modified, since, unfortunately, the
                     English rendition misses the point. </note> The ‘f<emph>ormgewollte</emph>’ or
                     ‘<emph>formgeforderte</emph>’ empiricism of all epic forms resists its
                  assimilation into a meaningful whole. Whenever an epic form attempts to do so in
                  modernity, it inevitably violates its intrinsic formal law. As a consequence, the
                  epic is constantly threatened to deteriorate into lyrical subjectivity or into the
                  objectivism of drama: <quote>This indestructible bond with reality as it is, the
                     crucial difference between the epic and the drama, is a necessary consequence
                     of the object of the epic being life itself. The concept of essence leads to
                     transcendence simply by being posited, and then, in the transcendent,
                     crystallizes into a new and higher essence expressing through its form an
                     essence that <emph>should be</emph>—an essence which, because it is born of
                     form, remains independent of the given content of what merely
                        <emph>exists</emph>. The concept of life, on the other hand, has no need of
                     any such transcendence captured and held immobile as an object. (47) </quote>
                  In modernity, with its shifts in the concept of life, epic forms find themselves
                  in a very different situation than drama. Already in the epos of antiquity, this
                  form was bound to life, but the epic had only to let the essence emerge through
                  its form. But life’s stubborn resistance has grown enormously. On account of their
                  “formal a priori”, epic forms “can never of their own accord charm something into
                  life that was not already present in it” (47). It is important to bear in mind
                  that the empiricism of life that is epic’s subject is not its content or object,
                  but is itself, as Lukáçs says, demanded by form. It is therefore not a matter of
                  epic forms somehow relating to life; in the epic, being bound to life is its
                  formal requirement, the law of its form. </p>
                  <p>In the course of his book, Lukáçs suggests several solutions to the dilemma epic
                  faces in modernity. The totality epic forms are to achieve by virtue of their
                  formal law can be relegated to a fragment—as in novellas, ballads or the idyllic.
                  But all those epic forms remain threatened and flawed as they transgress into the
                  lyric (by making an individual subject the bearer of totality) or into drama by
                  abstractly claiming a meaning life does not have on its own. All of these remain
                  partial and for the most part non-satisfactory solutions to a dilemma that the
                  novel as the epic’s true successor faces head-on, so to speak: “The dissonance
                  special to the novel, the refusal of the immanence of being to enter into
                  empirical life, produces a problem of form whose formal nature is much less
                  obvious than in other kinds of art” (71). The novel is an epic form and as such it
                  cannot distinguish between life and form because it is bound to empirical life qua
                  form. The bizarre solution the novel finds for its peculiar form-problem is, above
                  all, to acknowledge that its solutions must all be deficient in view of what is
                  required: “the immanence of meaning required by the form
                     [<emph>formgeforderte</emph>] is attained precisely when the author goes all
                  the way, ruthlessly, towards exposing its absence” (72). From this dialectical
                  ruse issues Lukáçs’ theory of irony: “Irony, the self-surmounting
                     [<emph>Selbstaufhebung</emph>] of a subjectivity that has gone as far as it is
                  possible to go, is the highest freedom that can be achieved in a world without
                  God” (93). But this solution too remains, as many forms of drama, too abstract and
                  “intellectualist [<emph>intellektualistisch</emph>]” (44). </p>
                  <p>However, the novel also has a purely formal solution for the problems it faces as
                  an epic form. Bound to life, it takes one of life’s essential dimensions and
                  adopts it as its proper form. In the novel, time becomes process and process
                  becomes (dynamic) form: “Thus the novel, in contrast to other genres whose
                  existence resides within the finished form, appears as something in process of
                  becoming“ (72). This is why Lukáçs likes to invoke the novel as “the form of
                  mature virility” (85). It is a reminder of the fact that a life’s story is the
                  usual form of the novel and biography one of its essential possibilities. In
                  short: the form of the novel is formed life.<note resp="editors" place="foot">For Lukáçs the life of the novel has to be an individual
                     life in accordance with his premises. Rüdiger Campe, taking his cue from
                     Lukáçs, has shown that there is another, older type of novel not concerned with
                     the individual’s life but with the life of institutions, which resurfaces in
                     early 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>-century once the biographical novel has run its
                     course. Campe identified novels by Kafka and Robert Walser as institutional
                     novels, and perhaps Dostoyevsky—whom Lukáçs exempts from his discussion of the
                     novel as an altogether new form—could also be read along these lines. See
                     Campe, <title level="a">Robert Walsers Institutionenroman</title>. On the
                     problem of form and the novel and the emergence of life in those theories, see
                     also Campe, <title level="a">Form und Leben in der Theorie des Romans</title>.
                  </note> The novel’s solution is thus not even to try to find meaning in any
                  particular contents; rather in adapting the life-worldly fact of time as its form,
                  the sheer becoming can now appear as essential and meaningful. This is how the
                  novel can be like life but “as form, the novel establishes a fluctuating yet form
                  balance between becoming and being; as the idea of becoming, it becomes a state
                     [<emph>Zustand</emph>]. Thus the novel, by transforming itself into a normative
                  being of becoming, surmounts itself” (73). In life, time has no beginning and no
                  end, but the novel achieves the transformation of time into a process that
                  subsequently appears as the very essence of all life. This is the novel’s chance
                  to be the old epic’s legitimate successor and, at the same time, an entirely new
                  epic form. This chance is highly improbable and the ways in which Lukáçs
                  underscores the contingency of that form as a form bound to the contingencies of
                  life is nothing less than remarkable. </p>
                  <p>The highly critical form of the novel “prescribes still stricter, still more
                  violable artistic laws for itself than do ‘the closed forms,’ and those laws are
                  all the more binding because they cannot be defined or formulated” (73).<note resp="editors" place="foot">The translation has been
                     modified since the translator elided part of the sentence. </note> Just as
                  time, which also inheres in the “sphere of mere life,” becomes the idea of process
                  when the novel adopts it as its organizing principle, the indefinable but strictly
                  binding principles governing the success of the novel also have their origin in
                  the life world: <quote>Tact and taste, in themselves subordinate categories which
                     belong wholly to the sphere of mere life and are irrelevant to an essential
                     ethic world, here acquire great constitutive significance; only then is
                     subjectivity, at the beginning of the novel’s totality and at its end, capable
                     of maintaining itself in equilibrium, of positing itself as epically normative
                     objectivity and thus of surmounting abstraction, the inherent danger of the
                     novel form. (74) </quote> Laws of tact are laws defying articulation. They are
                  in force but without significance. By entrusting each novel’s fate to the tact of
                  the aesthetic subjectivity, Lukáçs re-turns something to the novel that it
                  threatened to have lost when it found the solution of its challenges in the idea
                  of irony and the adaptation of time as a formal principle. Subjecting the novel to
                  the wholly unknowable and indefinable laws of tact, Lukáçs restores to the novel
                  the very life-worldly contingency that its formal a priori demands. The novel is
                  thus not only a critical and permanently endangered form but also highly
                  paradoxical: Its goal is to find meaning in life but whenever it succeeds in doing
                  so it has potentially betrayed the very life that it is bound to: “the great epic
                  is a form bound to the historical moment [<emph>an die Empirie des geschichtlichen
                     Augenblicks gebunden</emph>], and any attempt to depict the utopian as existent
                  can only end in destroying the form, not in creating reality” (152). For Lukáçs
                  this (form-generated) fate of the novel is mirrored in the life of this form. In
                  Dante, the epic is on the way to being supplanted by the novel; all subsequent
                  novels, from Goethe to Tolstoy, from the abstract idealist novel to the novel of
                  disillusion [<emph>Desillusionsroman</emph>], with rarest and highly improbably
                  exceptions, remain flawed. However, their very deficiencies confirm the novel as
                  the form bound to life as chance and contingency. With Dostoyevsky, finally, who
                  dawns at the end of Lukáçs’ book, the novel has disappeared: <quote>Dostoyevsky
                     did not write novels, and the creative vision revealed in his works has nothing
                     to do, either as affirmation or as rejection, with European nineteenth-century
                     Romanticism or with the many, likewise, Romantic reactions against it. Only
                     formal analysis of his works can show whether he is already the Homer or the
                     Dante of that world or whether he merely supplies the songs which, together
                     with the songs of other forerunners, later artists will one day weave into a
                     great unity. (152f) </quote> Whether Dostoyevsky did not write novels after all
                  is another question. Be that as it may, as a form bound to life, the life of the
                  novel itself has the form of life: contingent and flawed. And like its characters
                  the novel itself is always searching and never finds itself. The novel is a form
                  of life in which no bare life can be separated, whose law is life and whose life
                  is its law. If the novel is <emph>forma-di-vita, </emph>or, less emphatically, if
                  the novel as described by Lukáçs affords the possibility to make sense of
                  Agamben’s enigmatic term and its implied anti-relational logic, then one may raise
                  the question of the novel’s politics. Lukáçs could not be more concise on this
                  point. There is no politics of the novel and there can never be one, neither
                  biopolitical nor sovereign. However, the novel is the one genre least guilty of
                  the notorious “exaggeration of the substantiality of art [<emph>Überspannung der
                     Substantialität der Kunst</emph>]”, least guilty of the equally notorious
                  “hypostasy of aesthetics into metaphysics” (38) because as a form of art, and,
                  more specifically, as a genre of great epic art, the novel is not about art but
                  about life. </p>

               <p>In his last lecture of 1975-76, Michel Foucault focused on “power’s hold over life”
               (239), and in particular the emergence in the nineteenth century of sovereignty as a
               power over life, rather than death, sovereignty as “the right to make live and let
               die” (241). As Foucault explains in the <title level="m">History of
               Sexuality</title>, “The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power was now
               carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies and the calculated management of
               life” (262), two “techniques” that Foucault identifies not in philosophy but “in the
               form of concrete arrangements” (262). Foucault’s insight has opened up the epoch of
               biopower, providing the terms and frames though which everything from sexuality to
               human rights can be understood as occurring in the aftermath of this shift in the
               very significance of life itself.</p>
               <p>British (and French) poets writing at more or less the same time as the planners and
               statisticians who Foucault considers, that is, from the late-eighteenth to
               mid-nineteenth centuries, might also be understood to register a new significance of
               life itself. As Denise Gigante most recently has argued in <title level="m">Life:
                  Organic Form and Romanticism</title>, a preoccupation with life—in her case,
               understood as organicism, vitality, or nature—binds the poets we typically call
               romantic. For Gigante, the romantics were writers (like the scientists who are their
               contemporaries) “committed to defining and representing the incalculable,
               uncontrollable—often capricious, always ebullient—power of vitality” (3). This is a
               power that the poets also sought to categorize, calculate, and manage, if not through
               new forms of record keeping and sanitation, then through new uses of older tropes and
               figures. In this sense, poetry can be understood as another of the “concrete
               arrangements” or “techniques” of power for the management of life, another site of
               the power over life, like vaccination or the variety of emergent forms of public
               health to which he alludes. This is true both in a thematic and a strategic sense:
               literature of the period takes the power over life as a theme, but it also takes life
               as its object. We would have to look no further than a novel like Mary Shelley’s 1818
                  <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> to find a clear example in which all of
               these senses of life and power emerge. There we find that race, the question of the
               human species, education, the threat to populations, and the emergence of new
               projects in biomedical engineering are construed as analogous to literature itself;
               and literature (formed as a novel, but figured as poetry) emerges as a kind of life.
               Indeed, Shelley famously refers to her literary fiction as a newly formed life, more
               or less substitutable with and even allegorized by the life-form whose existence the
               novel traces. Thus <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> could be read as a vivid
               example of the analogy between what Foucault calls <emph>biopower</emph>
               and literary power—or literature as a form of biopower. Yet, that what is at stake in
               this convergence is a monstrous formation whose full frontal force never can be
               grasped suggests, at least allegorically speaking, the sublime impact—on poetry and
               politics both—of this new power over life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For
                  further discussion of <title level="m">Frankenstein </title>and biopolitics, see
                  the chapter “Testimony and Trope in <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>” in my
                     <title level="m">Romanticism After Auschwitz</title>. While most examples of
                  lyric life are not concerned with the species, <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> is a notable exception, as it is precisely man as species
                  and its future that is at issue throughout the novel. Furthermore, other
                  iterations of biopolitics, notably that of Giorgio Agamben, are not focused on the
                  question of species (or human as species), but rather of the human and its
                  political possibility and impossibility. For a discussion of the difference
                  between a power <emph>of</emph> life and a power <emph>over</emph> life, see Roberto Esposito. </note>
               </p>
               <p>One way of understanding this convergence—the more or less simultaneous emergence of
               life as the medium of political <emph>and</emph> poetic power, the
               emergence of biopower <emph>and</emph> romantic poetry—is as an historical
               or terminological <emph>accident</emph>, rather than a series of effects
               with a shared cause. Indeed, the romantic preoccupation with sovereignty (as lyric
               subjectivity) and poetic power as a vital force sits uneasily with Foucault’s account
               of biopower, even as it shares its constitutive terms. The lyric subject, at least as
               it is conventionally characterized, is a resoundingly individual formation, whereas
               biopower, in Foucault’s account, is administrative and neither oriented towards nor
               executed by the individual. Moreover, recent critics of biopower, including Lauren
               Berlant and Eric Santner, also have noted the flawed tendency to correlate the
               variety of conceptions of sovereignty (personal, political, and theological), a
               tendency that the correlation between romanticism and biopolitics could even be said
               to repeat.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Berlant, “Slow Death” and
                  Santner, <title level="m">The People’s Two Bodies</title>. For an account of
                  romanticism attuned to the rhetoric of species and at odds with conventional
                  characterizations, see Alastair Hunt, <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romantic
                     Species</title>. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, following Foucault, we might go further and ask about the conditions that allow
               life at this moment to emerge as an object (both aim and concern) of poetry and
               politics, of lyric subjectivity and political sovereignty? Put another way, we might
               ask whether this is strictly a nineteenth-century formation or rather, a
               late-twentieth-century one articulated in and through a return to the nineteenth
               century texts and contexts that have been called our contemporaries?<note place="foot" resp="editors"> See Cynthia Chase, Marc Redfield. </note> Does this new
               preoccupation with the power over life simply occur in the nineteenth century as an
               arbiter of modern poetry and politics or is it a retroactive formation framed by two
               competing theoretical gestures belonging to the 1970s and figured through a past that
               it recasts even as it is conditioned by it? Is this the modernity of the
               nineteenth-century or of the late-twentieth century? </p>
               <p>It is the very shape of this temporal knot that has led me, elsewhere, to conceive of
               romanticism as a <title level="m">poetics of survival</title>, that is, as
               preoccupied with and producing a condition of living on, while at the same time
               figuring and instantiating life as beyond or in excess of the opposition between life
               and death. In this essay, I wish to develop my earlier account in a somewhat
               different direction by focusing on the concurrent socio-political and
               rhetorico-lyrical preoccupations with making live. Taking seriously the shifting
               conception of life as the object of politics and poetics in the nineteenth
               century—and the initial articulation of this shift in the 1970s, the years of
               Foucault’s “Society must be defended” lectures, the publication of the first volume
               of his <title level="m">The History of Sexuality</title> [1976], and of Paul de Man’s
               essays “Autobiography as De-Facement” and “Shelley Disfigured” [1979]—I will argue
               that there is a correspondence between biopolitics and romanticism that is captured
               in this shared preoccupation with life, and that it is a conception of poetry and
               politics that is uncontained by the nineteenth century.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Uncontained” is Carol Jacobs’ term, see her <title level="m">Uncontainable Romanticism</title>. This point can be read to
                  resonate with one of Agamben’s criticisms of Foucault, that what he identifies as
                  a modern emergence, in fact has an ancient origin. </note> I will also suggest
               that this conjunction becomes an occasion to recognize life as survival, and thus to
               consider something about life that the various demographers and managers who appear
               in Foucault’s texts (and in his only cursorily formulated and digressive account of
               biopower) may not be in a position to perceive or comprehend, but nevertheless
               continue to expose.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the lecture of 17 March
                  1976, where Foucault apologizes for “this long digression on biopower” (254).
               </note> In other words, far from exhausted by Foucault’s account of biopower and the
               theoretical accounts to which it has given rise, a lyric consideration of life, one
               formulated in and through romanticism trains us to see beyond the management of
               species and populations and to recognize the excesses that biopower and its
               institutions inherently fail to contain. In other words, while it might appear from
               my opening observation that modern poets are managers, belonging to the same category
               as statisticians and public health officials, and that lyric sovereignty, insofar as
               it is focused upon making live, is a mode of administration, several examples suggest
               instead the undoing of individual formations by the very gesture that appears to
               contain it. These lyric examples show that life is always on the side of nonpower,
               and that its containment fails to sustain the newly formulated opposition between
               life and death that is at the heart of the shift that Foucault so compellingly
                  describes.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Foucault is of course aware of
                  this uncontainment, and his example of Franco’s death “and the symbolic values it
                  brings into play” in the lectures on 1975-76 offers one example. <title level="m">Society Must be Defended</title>, 248. </note>
               </p>
               <p>In what follows, I will turn from Paul de Man’s formative rhetorical account of the
               lyric to Barbara Johnson’s feminist revision of de Man in order to develop my own
               analysis of <emph>biopoetics</emph>. Johnson’s consideration of a subgenre
               of abortion lyric fosters a rethinking of the modern lyric and its rhetorical
               effects, identifying a shift in its organization from aiming to overcome the
               opposition between the living and the nonliving (in other words, “making live”) to
               imagining a relation between mother and child, whether dead or alive, as two
               potentialities. This example is a clear instance of the intersection of poetics and
               politics around the question of life, and one that, like <title level="m">Frankenstein</title>, dramatizes the encounter between biopolitics and
               romanticism. Moreover, Johnson explicitly shows how lyric apostrophe can be
               understood not only as the trope of politics, but a trope that turns politics into
               biopolitics. From Johnson’s discussion of lyric animation and its political—or as I
               suggest—biopolitical—implications, I turn to a poem by John Clare that offers another
               way of imagining the lyric and its relation to biopolitics. Clare, a poet known as
               much for his lurid biography, his use of local idiom and eccentric grammar, and his
               opposition to the Enclosure Acts that divided his parish, spent a third of his life
               in a mental asylum. By focusing on questions of animation in the context of a lived
               fiction experienced as a pathology, a debilitating delusion that kept Clare from
               living among others, I propose to develop Johnson’s reading of lyric apostrophe into
               a theory that further emphasizes the lyric rhetoric at work in the politics of life
               and making live. </p>

                  <head>I. A Fetal Address</head>
                  <p>Despite having written extensively on romantic lifewriting and on Percy Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, Paul de Man seemed to have very little
               interest in the question of life itself. Indeed, life, like death, for de Man is a
               linguistic predicament, and those texts that seem most preoccupied with life (I am
               thinking here of “Autobiography as De-facement” and “Shelley Disfigured”), are not
               simply “about” death or even the undecidability between life and death (recall: “one
               moves, without compromise, from death <emph>or</emph> life to life <emph>and</emph> death [<title level="m">Rhetoric of Romanticism,</title>
               74]), but about figures and figural language. When in his essays of the late-1970s,
               later collected in <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, de Man
               apparently turns away from organicist accounts of language (that is, language as a
               vehicle of life), he does so in order to turn our attention to the ideology of
               rhetoric (or literature) as a restorative, indeed indissociably restorative and
               privative, operation. Autobiography (or lifewriting) operates through a figurative
               movement that “deprives and disfigures to the precise extent that it restores.” (And
               returning to the example I introduced above, Mary Shelley’s <title level="m">Frankenstein</title> recognizes this in all of the scenes where the encounter
               between Victor Frankenstein and his creature, involves a series of faintings and
               restorations.) Although de Man focuses on Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Essays upon
                  Epitaphs</title> and Percy Shelley’s “Triumph of Life,” privation, disfiguration,
               and restoration in his account are not matters of life and death, an assumption that
               would remain within an organicist paradigm, albeit a negative one, but rather matters
               of cognition, apparition, and image. It is sensation, and the relation between the
               visible and the knowable worlds, rather than life and death, that are at the core of
               de Man’s observations. </p>
                  <p>For all of these reasons, it might seem antithetical to turn to de Man in an effort
               to track the relation of literature to life and develop a theory of <emph>biopoetics</emph>, unless <emph>biopoetics</emph> is only another name
               for figure, just as it might be another name for romanticism itself. However, despite
               his own apparent allergy to questions of life and his indifference to biological
               processes or political analysis on a grand scale, de Man’s understanding of
               figuration has laid the groundwork for other accounts of lyric figures (apostrophe,
               prosopopoeia) that take place in a more explicit relation to the politics of life,
               namely those of Barbara Johnson. </p>
                  <p>In her 1986 essay “Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion,” Johnson draws upon de Man’s
               account of figure to ask whether “the very essence of a political issue—an issue
               like, say, abortion—hinges on the structure of figure,” and she goes on to wonder if
               there is “any <emph>inherent</emph> connection between figurative language
               and questions of life and death, of who will wield and who will receive violence in a
               given human society?” (<title level="m">World of Difference </title>184). The key
               word here is “inherent.” For figurative language, insofar as it relies upon a
               seemingly infinite capacity for substitution, is driven by the establishment of
               connections where there are none. Figuration is in this sense a matter of the
               non-inherent, or the inherent as mere substitutability. So, to ask about ‘inherence,’
               to consider the possibility of an essential and permanent relation between
               “figurative language” and “questions of life and death,” or to ask whether figure is
               the “hinge” that bears the essence of politics, including the politics of life and
               death, as Johnson does, is to suggest that there can be no politics of life without
               this poetics. Johnson’s task is to understand and track the meaning and shape of this
               poetics. Turning to abortion, Johnson conjoins questions of figure or poetic address
               with what Penelope Deutscher has called “one of the major nodes of biopolitics” (55):
               abortion. Johnson seems to ask, although not in quite so many words, whether
               biopolitics is essentially <emph>biopoetics</emph>. And while she will go
               on to develop her initial consideration of the inherent relation of lyric figures and
               politics into a speculative consideration of motherhood (“there may be a deeper link
               between motherhood and apostrophe” [198]), the theoretical landscape is such that she
               is not yet in a position to reflect directly upon the relation of biopolitics and
               biopoetics. In the mid-80s, when Johnson’s essay is published, Foucault’s various
               discussions of “making live” in the nineteenth century remained overshadowed by his
               much more substantial considerations of governmentality, the body, and its
               discipline. Thus, while Johnson presciently evokes the question of the relation
               between biopolitics and poetics in her discussion of abortion and lyric, it remains a
               question that still bears asking directly—one insinuated but not exhausted by the
               example of abortion and poetry addressed to unborn fetuses. It is also the question,
               I want to suggest, of the lyric itself. In other words, the question for us, as it is
               to a certain extent for Johnson, is how important—how essential or <emph>inherent</emph>—is life for the discussion of literary rhetoric (or poetry), and is
               this matter of life, rather than a programmatic attachment, not only a matter of
               politics, but in fact the political nexus of literature itself? Put another way, the
               question for us is whether life is the poetic nexus of the political? For Johnson,
               insofar as politics is a matter of power and power a matter of violence, the essence
               of any political issue is the question of life and death, of <emph>the
                  power over life and death</emph>. And to suggest that politics “hinges on the
               structure of figure,” as she does here, is also to suggest that it hangs on a
               rhetorical device that <emph>makes</emph> “present, animate, and
               anthropomorphic,” a device that, recalling Foucault’s account of political power,
               makes live. This figure, apostrophe, has a particularly compelling presence in the
               late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries and an afterlife in some unlikely
               places. For example, as Johnson shows, it is at work in the case of abortion, where
               the question of viability may not be altogether new, but it does become newly visible
               and, thanks to new technologies for managing the ends of life—from pills to
               respirators—newly ubiquitous. Now, as anyone even minimally familiar with the
               rhetoric around abortion in the US knows, a central claim on one side of the debate
               is the assumption of fetal life as having an unproblematic relation to human,
               speaking life, indeed of fetal life as rights-bearing life or as personhood. Hence,
               as Catherine Mills recently has shown, the use of 4D sonograms in antiabortion
               materials has as its aim the production of the fetus as a face-bearing entity—and
               person or personage. Here, political and poetic rhetoric, the rhetoric of persuasion
               and the rhetoric of tropes and figures, enter in to a heightened relationship. </p>
                  <p>Johnson begins by showing how lyric apostrophes, as acts of animation that assume the
               difference between the living and the dead, turn out to undo the very distinctions
               upon which they seem to rely. Her initial examples, drawn from Baudelaire and Percy
               Bysshe Shelley, relay scenes in which a lyric subject addresses an inanimate object
               in order to endow it with the power that will retroactively animate the very subject
               responsible for the address in the first place. Johnson reads these poems in the
               romantic (and post-romantic) lyric tradition in which a (male) poet undertakes to
               obtain a voice from the outside together with poems (by women) in which “the question
               of animation and anthropomorphism is…given a new and disturbing twist,” poems that
               “textually place aborted children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead,
               inanimate, or absent entities previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Like
               Foucault, Johnson seems to register a shift in modernity’s relation to sovereignty,
               showing that an emergent structure of animation in the nineteenth century remains at
               the core of political thinking in the late-twentieth-century; and, like Foucault,
               again, she is interested in re-reading and re-casting an earlier emergence (which we
               could in both cases call <emph>biopower</emph>) from the perspective of its
               violent future.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Agamben suggests that Foucault
                  doesn’t do this sufficiently. Also, Penelope Deutscher persuasively considers the
                  reasons why Agamben never takes up the matter of abortion—in part the complexity
                  of analogizing abortion and the Holocaust, an analogy which is the
                  bread-and-butter of the anti-abortion movement and something one would not want to
                  touch. </note> It is in these poems that a new, specifically biomedical
               uncertainty about the nature and meaning of the living and the dead emerges. It is
               also here that Johnson explicitly registers a continuity—or analogy—between poetry
               (the rhetoric of animation) and biopolitics (abortion). </p>
                  <p>Johnson begins her exploration of another lyric scene with Gwendolyn Brooks’ “The
               Mother,” a poem that, in her account, traces the disappearance and appearance of the
               first person subject, rendering the lyric subject an object of the abortion itself
               (“Abortions never let <emph>you</emph> forget”); the addressee of aborted
               fetuses (“I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed
               children”); and finally the subject addressing them, albeit through a citation (“I
               have said, Sweets, if I sinned….”). Even as a subject, she remains uncertain about
               their status (“oh what should I say, how is the truth to be said?”) and thus her own.
               Indeed, Brooks’ poem reflects a particularly complex case where in actuality she did
               not want to bring the objects of her address to life even as this animation is what
               occurs when she continues to hear the voices that sound only through her. Thus, as
               Johnson notes, “the poem can no more distinguish between ‘I’ and ‘you’ than it can
               come up with a proper definition of life” (190). This ambivalence about life and
               death is fundamental to the structure of apostrophe, and in this sense it also
               reveals what is at stake in abortion itself. Whatever our politics or rhetoric, from
               the perspective of politics or rhetoric, it is not clear whether a life that is not
               viable (an embryonic life) can be considered a life at all, just as it is not always
               clear whether a life, even if not viable, is anything other than a life. From a
               biopolitical perspective, like the one that Agamben offers at the end of <title level="m">Homo Sacer</title>, the fetus also would emerge as one of those lives in
               which the political and the biological have entered into a domain of indistinction.
               For Agamben, this would be only a particularly vivid example of a quotidian
               situation. The same could be said for Johnson, insofar as this is the structure of
               lyric, a structure upon which “the essence of politics hinges.” Yet, for Johnson, who
               approaches the political scene through poetry and rhetoric, what is at stake is not
               only the indistinction between political life and biological life, but political life
               and poetic (or rhetorical) life. Poetry and rhetoric supplement the place of biology
               so that the question of species, populations, and measure, that is, the objects of
               social science become a question for literary theory and history.</p>
                  <p>My point here is not to suggest that Johnson <emph>only</emph> registers
               life or death as a fundamentally linguistic (and hence nonhuman) predicament, as de
               Man does, but to show that her essay raises some highly specific questions about the
               relation of poetry <emph>to</emph> life and death, indeed the power of
               poetry (or language) <emph>over</emph> life and death, when it registers
               the poetic and biological questions of life as thoroughly indissociable. It is in
               this sense that what Agamben refers to as a “zone of indistinction” comes to involve
               poetry and lyric subjectivity; for lyric (or poetic or rhetorical), biological, and
               political notions of life emerge as indistinguishable. While Johnson considers the
               ways that the lyric, as an exemplary form of language, can repeat and re-enact the
               violence it aims to overcome, she also challenges conventional accounts of lyric
               subjectivity as they relate to life itself. Johnson not only argues that debates
               about abortion can be seen as debates about apostrophe and the rhetoric of animation
               and address, but equally that lyric poetry can be seen as part of the abortion
               debates—or construed more generally—debates within the politics of life. She goes so
               far as to suggest (while attributing this suggestion to Brooks’ poem) that “arguments
               for and against abortion are structured through and through by the rhetorical limits
               and possibilities of something akin to apostrophe.” And further that: “The fact that
               apostrophe allows one to animate the inanimate, the dead, or the absent, implies that
               whenever a being is apostrophized, it is thereby automatically animated,
               anthropomorphized, ‘person-ified’. (By the same token, the rhetoric of calling makes
               it difficult to tell the difference between the animate and the inanimate, as anyone
               with a telephone answering machine can attest)” (191). </p>
                  <p>For Johnson, this “automatic animation” that occurs within a rhetoric of address
               raises questions about the relation between what Agamben has called life and
               form-of-life. Agamben describes his task as completing and correcting Foucault’s work
               on biopolitics. He insists upon the ancient origins and specifically modern
               tendencies of biopolitics by reminding us that initially two words, <foreign>bios</foreign> and <foreign>zoe</foreign>, were used to designate life, and
               focuses on what he calls “form-of-life,” a life in which it is never possible to
               isolate something such as naked life, by which he means “a life for which what is at
               stake is living itself, in which the single ways, acts, and processes of living are
               never simply <emph>facts</emph> but always and above all <emph>possibilities</emph> of life, always and above all power” (<title level="m">Means</title> 4). Here, Agamben understands a form of life as separate from
               automation, repetition, habit, or prescription, seeing it rather as possibility or
               potential, a relation to the indeterminate and unprogrammed. Agamben distinguishes
               between this “form-of-life,” a life of reflection, and what is translated
               alternatively as bare or naked life, although even bare or naked life is not simply a
               given, but an assumed category. Yet, when Johnson suggests that arguments about
               abortion (about biological or sacred life) are structured “through and through by
               something akin to apostrophe,” and when she suggests that apostrophe <emph>automatically</emph> animates, which is to say that it is a power over
               life without intentionality, deliberation, or control, she seems to recognize the
               separability or division within life not as something that could be gotten beyond or
               resolved, but as the very structure of life, just as it is so central to language
               fraught between performative and constative powers. The distinction essential to
               Agamben’s insight is not at all essential here. This is the parallel of de Man’s
               understanding of death as a linguistic predicament, for now <emph>life</emph> emerges as a linguistic predicament; and Johnson suggests that “it
               becomes impossible to tell whether language is what gives life or what kills” (192).
               Johnson accounts for language or the lyric subject as displacing sovereignty,
               operating as a power to give or take life itself, rather than a power to kill, as
               under the older, premodern model. Yet, it is not because of this impossibility of
               determining the nature of linguistic power that there is a debate about abortion.
               Rather, what occurs in the sphere of politics shares a structure with—indeed is—a
               linguistic predicament. Johnson reveals that biopolitics, understood as this power
               over life, is indissociable from lyrical language as a power over life. Thus,
               returning to my initial questions concerning the concurrent emergence of biopower and
               romanticism as two nineteenth-century scenes of power as making live, Johnson’s
               simultaneous reading of the romantic lyric and <emph>its</emph> legacies
               with biopower and <emph>its</emph> legacies offers a clear response.
               Johnson’s reading of lyric apostrophe suggests that the poetic and political
               preoccupation with life is not merely an historical accident nor an occasion where
               poetry reflects the politics or culture of the age, but rather that this convergence,
               through Johnson’s reading, reveals the lyrical structure of biopolitics: biopolitics
               as a politics of apostrophe. In this sense, the politics that Johnson identifies
               throughout her essay is an unmarked biopolitics, which is structured like the lyric. </p>
                  <p>But Johnson’s essay does not stop here, for it challenges us to consider what happens
               when this is the case, that is, when politics and poetry hinge upon apostrophe and
               when making live becomes the operative mode of poetry and politics both. Johnson not
               only perceives the conjunction of poetics and politics, but also exposes the
               implications of this conjunction on conventional accounts of subjectivity. It is not
               just that abortion poetry offers a particular case, and not only that debates about
               abortion “hinge on a structure akin to apostrophe,” but she goes further to show that
               lyric subjectivity as a variety of subjectivity more generally has hinged upon the
               assumption or production of a life akin to the one ended in an abortion <emph>or</emph> survived in birth. It is this survival that Johnson reminds
               us Baudelaire flaunts when he opens <title level="m">Les Fleurs du Mal</title> by
               representing himself as a failed abortion, as an originary survivor. Johnson’s
               insight, drawn from her reading of Baudelaire, is that something like fetal or
               embryonic life remains the life of the lyric subject—even in its most
               quintessentially sovereign form.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This is a
                  prescient precursor to Agamben’s account of the indistinction between the two
                  figures of exception: the sovereign and so-called bare life. See <title level="m">Homo Sacer</title>. Also, it is worth noting that Johnson does not distinguish
                  between embryo and fetus, a distinction that is typically linked to gestational
                  age. In this analysis the distinction is not especially meaningful as what remains
                  at stake is viability or the indistinction between living and nonliving which is
                  at issue whether the being is more or less than eight weeks in utero. </note>
               Lyric apostrophe assumes and produces the subject as fetal life. This is true not
               only in poetry like Brooks’ that takes abortion as its theme, but as the reference to
               Baudelaire and more generally to romantic and postromantic lyric poets reveals,
               “fetality,” rather than sovereignty, is the position of the romantic lyric
                  subject.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Agamben on <foreign>infans</foreign> and infancy. </note> Thus, just as Agamben considers the paradox
               of political sovereignty as positioning the sovereign and the exile in the same
               position of exceptionality <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> the law, Johnson, reading Baudelaire and Shelley
               after Brooks and Adrienne Rich, articulates a paradox of lyric sovereignty (which is
               also political sovereignty) as positioning the fetus and the (male) subject in the
               same position of fetality <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> apostrophe. </p>
                  <p>Penelope Deutscher distinguishes this fetal life from the so-called bare life that
               Agamben associates with biopolitics. For Deutscher, the distinction is a temporal and
               categorical one: the fetus is a scene of contested life prior to loss or privation.
               As she writes: “A consideration of fetal life does not fit the series [Muselmanner,
               overcoma, etc.], as it usually is not situated at the threshold of depoliticization
               or dehumanization of previously politicized or humanized life. The fetus represents
               the zone of contested and intensified political stakes around the threshold between
               what some would consider ‘prelife’ and what is to be identified as nascent human
               life, meaningful human life, and/or rights-bearing life” (58). When Johnson reads
               Baudelaire and Brooks, she identifies poetic life as a zone of fundamentally
               contested viability. Yet the difference between Baudelaire and Brooks, on Johnson’s
               reading, is that whereas lyric life and subjectivity in Baudelaire are issued from
               the position of a failed abortion or fetal life, that of the child, for Brooks and
               Clifton and others it is the position of a mother, albeit one who is not a mother, a
               mother of aborted or miscarried children live only within the space of literature,
               and a mother whose position within that space is at once always assumed and almost
               always denied. </p>
                  <p>In concluding the essay, Johnson builds upon this understanding to conceive of lyric
               expression beyond that of the fetus/subject. Spawned by Brooks’ poem as well as other
               poems of the same subgenre by Rich, Anne Sexton, and Lucille Clifton, poems in which
               the subject is figured as a mother who is both addressed by and addresses herself to
               her dead offspring, Johnson suggests that the entire history of the lyric—of poetry
               or politics, insofar as it is bound up with calling, is the repetition of a primal
               apostrophe, the entrance into language and subjection through a demand placed upon
               the mother who is called upon to make the child live. These poems that remember the
               stakes of apostrophe—poems issued in the voices of mothers addressed by children who
               may never have lived—also reveal the structure of apostrophic animation. They suggest
               that the hidden structure of the lyric and its mode of animation resembles and
               depends upon a mother who is almost always unremarked. Johnson seems to suggest that
               were we to recast our prevailing accounts of subjectivity, were we to recognize the
               place of the lyric subject as one not of infinite substitution (“men have in a sense
               always had no choice but to substitute something for the literal process of birth”
               [198]), but rather of unsubstitutability, we might find a path outside that of
               childhood (or masculine subjectivity). This suggests that we might come to recognize
               that the relation of apostrophe to animation is a relation to motherhood itself.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For another account of the centrality of the
                  mother to romantic subjectivity, see Cathy Caruth, “Past Recognition: Narrative
                  Origins in Wordsworth and Freud.” </note> The risk of unsubstitutability of the
               sort that Johnson describes is not simply the loss of lyric power and the shift from
               a dyadic conception of apostrophic animation (making live) to one that recognizes
               that the lyric subject figured is a fetus is indissociable from a maternal subject.
               It is also one that opens up a space for another subject position: that of the mother
               who does not “make live” or who makes live that which she also has let die, even if
               she may nor have killed.<note place="foot" resp="editors">These formulations
                  evoke Agamben’s account of homo sacer as a life that can be killed but not
                  sacrificed. See Deutscher for a speculative discussion of Agamben’s avoidance of
                  abortion in the <foreign>Homo Sacer</foreign> volumes. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>On Johnson’s reading apostrophe emerges as a maternal structure: if the lyric subject
               is conventionally figured as a sovereign, and if rhetorical reading exposes instead
               that it is variously a fetus, embryo, infant, or child, Johnson aims to break the
               fetus-sovereign dyad by recognizing that what has not or cannot be said is that lyric
               animation is akin to motherhood, that we ought to begin to see the lyric subject not
               as a man or a child (which is to say a fetus), but as (or wanting to be) a
                  mother.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Of course, Wordsworth had a strong
                  sense of the lyric subject as child. </note> It is as if our failure to recognize
               the lyric subject as mother has left us with a structure of animation that cannot but
               leave the subject a child whose viability and power is in question.</p>
                  <p>Johnson exposes fetal life as the life of lyric subjectivity as we know it. Put
               otherwise, it is this life that she reminds us Baudelaire already recognizes as the
               life of lyric subjectivity when he refers to himself as an abortion manqué. Yet, the
               lyric subject is a fetus only because we do not see it (or him) as a mother. Rather
               than an originary split in life, we have an originary question of viability itself
               (and with it the particularly complex question of rights) at the heart of the
               subject. Rather than operating like other techniques of power over life, and rather
               than a symptom of romantic ideology, for Johnson the lyric is the structure of this
               scene of indissociable power and contestation. While Johnson sets out to revise this
               scene by focusing on the relation of apostrophe to motherhood, in what follows, I
               wish to expand our thinking of apostrophe and viability by considering a poem that
               couples the poetics of life with the history of madness, a poem written by a subject
               who, like Baudelaire, often was figured as a child, and yet whose own lyric
               productions recover not a mother, but an asylum.</p>

                  <head>II. Apostrophe’s Inmate</head>
                  <p>I opened with the observation that the romantic lyric emerges alongside biopower as
               two forms of a power over life. Reading Johnson, I also considered how politics might
               be seen to “hinge” on the structure of a poetic figure, and further that to recognize
               this structure is to see poetry as assuming a life at the threshold of viability, a
               situation that further conjoins poetry with biopolitics, at least in the version
               articulated by Giorgio Agamben. In this last section I want to consider how this
               conjunction of poetry and biopolitics also leads to a further development in our
               conception of poetry, and how the lyric has a particularly direct relation to the
               shift from sovereignty to biopower. For Johnson the presence of the lyric subject
               indicates the absence of the mother, an absence that Johnson’s account of the lyric
               undertakes to remedy. This recovery of the (theoretical) mother—the establishment a
               position where she can speak and be addressed and the “achieve[ment] of a full
               elaboration of any discursive position other than that of a child”—might go far in
               alleviating certain forms of personal and cultural pathology. But if we were to
               accomplish this would it be the end of the story? While, abortion—its poetry and
               politics - opens up one especially crucial case for thinking about the poetics of
               animation and politics of life, the various forms of social abandonment and
               questionable viability fostered by animating acts, whether in politics or poetry,
               reveal another.</p>
                  <p>On December 28, 1841, Clare became an inhabitant of the Northampton General Lunatic
               Asylum, one of the genre of institutions that Foucault identifies with the management
               and restoration of the population.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Joanna
                  Ball’s discussion of the asylum and its commitment to a “gentle” system of care
                  and Jonathan Bate’s description of the asylum’s “liberal regime” (469). </note>
               Clare wrote extensively while in the asylum, where he went largely unmonitored. While
               much of his poetry of this period (he was there until his death in 1864) has not been
               preserved, an undated apostrophic lyric addressed “To Mary” is one of the hundreds of
               poems that survive. “To Mary” conjoins apostrophe and “lunacy,” exposing an inherent
               failure to arbitrate between the living and the dead or the self and another, as both
               rhetorical effect and medical symptom. It is this disorder that the asylum is called
               upon to manage, but like the lyric, instead sustains.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the intake form at the lunatic asylum, Clare’s condition is understood
                  as associated with and preceded by “years addicted to poetical prosing” (qtd in
                  Bate, 466). </note> Thus, if the institutions of biopower are structured like
               apostrophe insofar as they are oriented towards animation or survival, it is
               precisely survival or “making live” that leads to haunting, confusion, and enduring
               symptoms of madness. </p>
                  <p>Clare, famous first for being a <emph>poor</emph> poet and later, a <emph>mad</emph> one, archives this radical privation in a poem that
               strangely, even perversely, registers the effects of making live. Like the abortion
               poems that Johnson reads, what we have here is not simply an example of a personal
               intervention or an encounter with the personal as political, but rather a poem that
               bears witness to the lyric and the asylum as two scenes of managing life that both
               house and sustain a form a madness or haunting. In fact, the relation in this case is
               even closer than first meets the eye, for this poem, like all of those that survive
               Clare’s twenty-three year internment, comes to us thanks to its transcription and
               preservation by the asylum’s steward, William Knight. There is no remaining
               manuscript, only a transcript composed in Knight’s hand. “To Mary” is therefore a
               poem whose survival is the effect of the very institution called upon to keep Clare
               alive <emph>and</emph> separate him from the living; it is a poem that
               registers not the work of “madness and civilization,” but of “madness and biopower,”
               and the apostrophic or biopoetic structure of both.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Johnson’s reading focuses on the relation between political, biological, and
               poetic life, revealing the limits of the romantic figuration of the lyric subject as
               man-child, in “To Mary,” we encounter romantic animation not from the perspective of
               the mother, but of the lover who (inextricably from his persistent love) is also an
               inmate. “To Mary” is addressed to a girl that Clare loved in childhood, but whose
               father prevented their marriage because of Clare’s low social standing and fate for
                  poverty.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a psychoanalytic and rare
                  theoretical account of Clare’s love and poetry, see Sigi Jöttkandt, <title level="m">First Love: A Phenomenology of the One</title>. Melbourne: Re-Press,
                  2010. Jöttkandt recalls that Clare believed he was confined in the asylum because
                  of his polygamy. </note> While Clare went on to marry and build a family with
               another woman, Patty Joyce, he remained irremediably attached to Mary, as is evident
               in the journal that he wrote during his escape from his first asylum, which concludes
               with a letter to Mary Clare whom he addresses as “My dear wife.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the “Journey out of Essex” included in <title level="m">John Clare by Himself</title>, 265. </note> In the journal, Clare explains that
               he is told of Mary’s death, but that he simply does not believe it, complaining that
               “neither could I get any information about her further then the old story of her
               being dead six years ago which might be taken from a bran new old newspaper” (264).
               Clare remains convinced that Mary is alive and often acknowledges that he has two
                  wives.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the “Asylum Observations” from
                  Northampton, where he writes: “God almighty bless Mary Joyce Clare and her family

                  and forever – Amen.” In <title level="m">John Clare by Himself</title>, 266.

                  </p>
                  <p>As an apparently conventional love poem, one that assumes and reflects upon the
               communion of a living lover and his dead beloved, “To Mary” evokes tropes of
               remembrance and loss, presence and absence. As a stubborn account of survival—of life
               beyond life and death—it also indicates the poetry and the politics that produces and
               sustains a life perceived to be unfit for society. What we have here is neither a
               scene of the mourning—fulfilled or not—of a maternal poetics (in which we would have
               to include Victor Frankenstein), nor a strictly political exclusion that reveals the
               new politics of public health. Rather, we encounter an apostrophic poetics in which
               making live coincides with a denial of loss, but in which this denial, this insistent
               animation, becomes unmanageable and emerges as a form of lunacy. Here poetry and
               mental illness converge not only through the instruments of lyric, but also the
               instruments of biopower that resemble them. In other words, the symptom and the
               remedy (if not the cure) are both forms of apostrophe. </p>

                  <p>The poem opens with the chilling announcement—directed at its addressee—that while
               the subject sleeps and wakes with Mary, she is not there. The poem candidly
               acknowledges the failure of poetic address to solve the problem of absence or death
               (“and yet thou art not there”), and likewise, the failure of absence or death to
               exhaust direct address and the presence that it remarks and effects (“I sleep with
               thee and wake with thee”). Thus, Mary is at once too resilient and utterly absent. We
               could say that Mary’s presence is the effect of psychosis or delusion, <emph>this</emph> is why Clare is in the asylum, and not just the outcome of
               lyric surmise; and yet we would be hard pressed to rigorously distinguish on the
               basis of this poem, between madness and poetry. In fact this confusion comports with
               Roy Porter’s hesitations about diagnostic readings of Clare, and Porter’s suggestion
               that what we call madness in Clare might not be madness at all, just as it might
               suggest that there is a deeper link between madness and apostrophe than we have
               hitherto suspected.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See the essay collected in
                     <title level="m">John Clare in Context</title>. </note> This becomes a poem of
               madness (rather than passion and allegory) because of its history, because of
               indicators outside of the poem rather than internal to it. Or, put another way, it is
               a poem that reveals the conventions of the lyric to be indistinguishable from those
               markers of mental disorder that are meaningful only outside of poetry, rather than
               within it. However, in a case like Clare’s when the lyric becomes a vehicle for
               autobiography, and indeed in any autobiographical or testimonial text that relies
               upon lyric figures for its narration, what is at stake is not only the non-opposition
               between the living and the dead, but the emergence of that non-opposition as a
               pathology. </p>
                  <p>In a second episode, Clare describes an embrace that only can remain imaginary, for
               he fills his arms not with a body, but with “common air,” suggesting that it is both
               quotidian and shared, the stuff of life that signals in this case the absence of the
               living. And in a line that resonates with Wordsworth’s “A Slumber did my spirit
               seal,” admits: “I think and speak of other things/To keep my mind at rest,”
               suggesting that Mary, like Wordsworth’s Lucy, is “a thing,” that is, that she is not
               animate, even as the entire poem is organized around managing the opposite statement.
               Thus, in a third episode Clare is the object of Mary’s gaze, but a gaze that, far
               from direct or reciprocal, occurs only when she is out of sight, which is to say, <emph>always</emph>. The first stanza also concludes with an infinite kiss,
               a gesture whose possibility relies upon its impossibility and the absence of its
               recipient (or otherwise a death that it would deliver). As an exercise in the
               temporal logic of presence and absence, the infinite relation here is presented as an
               impossible one, one that we might also call literary or poetic. In other words, the
               power over life described here occurs only in and through poetry (or delusion): this
               is a life indifferent to certificates of birth and death, statistics, or populations.
               And yet, it is the very condition archived here, the very condition of a virulent
               apostrophe, that leads to the convergence of poetry and politics as two scenes of
               animation, for it is this condition that shapes Clare’s supposed inability to live
               among others and his removal in the name not only of his own survival but theirs as
               well. He is unable or refuses to distinguish between the living and the dead or, put
               another way, he is unable to choose to reside among the living, and by failing to
               choose life, by staying with Mary (or by attaching himself to the dead poets, like
               Shakespeare or Byron, whose poems he will “continue”), Clare registers a poetry in
               which the lyric subject is absorbed by a loss in the dramas of animation. And yet,
               this is precisely what all lyric poems do when they marshal the powers of apostrophe.
               What Clare’s poem then reveals is another scene in the emergence of the poetics of
               animation and the politics of life: a conjunction not only between romanticism and
               madness, but romanticism and the asylum. </p>
                  <p>Returning to Clare’s poem, we can further specify its experience of apostrophe. If
               this poem assumes the presence of its addressee, it also breaks the analogy between
               life and presence, absence and death. Moreover, unlike Shelley or Brooks, Clare asks
               nothing of his addressee, he merely describes his relation to her. (The nature of
               this description nevertheless makes it seem a creepy demand.) In a move that seems
               almost to concede, finally, the absence that the act of address rejects, a move that
               also evokes some of the moments of strange concession that occur in Clare’s journals,
               the poem leaves its addressee in a position of utter non-responsiveness, or to recall
               the line I noted above, she becomes a <emph>thing</emph>, the matter of
               this address, rather than its addressee.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For
                  example, in the Journey out of Essex, Clare’s account of his escape from the
                  asylum, he writes describes his entry into his village and a woman jumps out to
                  great him. He decides she’s drunk or mad, and writes: “But when I was told it was
                  my <hi rend="underline">second</hi> wife Patty I got in and was soon at
                  Northborough, but Mary was not there, neither could I get any information about
                  her further other than the old story of her being dead six years ago, which might
                  be taken from a bran new old newspaper printed a dozen years ago, but I took no
                  notice of the blarney having seen her myself about a twelvemonth ago alive and
                  well and as young as ever.” </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the poem, the solution is not to turn <emph>to</emph> the addressee.
               Recalling that other sense of apostrophe or trope as turning away, Clare turns <emph>away</emph> from her (“I think and speak of other things/To keep my
               mind at rest”), whether for his own sanity or out of fear of humiliation.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In this sense, the poem can be understood not
                  only to use apostrophe, but also to theorize it. </note> Still, the permanent
               presence of the absent lover archived in the first stanza is repeated in the second
               stanza where it is the poet’s memory that remains fixated, even despite the effort to
               turn away. Here, the <emph>subject</emph> becomes the <emph>object</emph> of address, but it is not Mary who speaks or whose voice he hears.
               Rather he hears <emph>of</emph> her through the whispering wind. This is
               the convention of Clare’s contemporaries, Wordsworth and Shelley, but also a
               convention that, as Johnson shows, Brooks reworks by “textually placing aborted
               children in the spot formerly occupied by all the dead, inanimate, or absent entities
               previously addressed by the lyric” (189). Still, what occurs here also differs from
               the address in the other poems, for it is not the addressee who speaks—directly or
               indirectly—through or to the wind; it is not Mary’s voice that Clare hears. Rather,
               the wind speaks to him in its “own” voice <emph>of</emph> Mary (“The night
               wind whispers in my ear…”). This apostrophe does <emph>not</emph> raise
               significant questions about the power to marshal life or death (Shelley) or about the
               sovereignty of the lyric subject as poet or as mother (Brooks), but exposes the
               subject’s impotence and haunting, rather than its ultimate power. It may be that a
               weak or triangulated apostrophe, like this one, an apostrophe that breaks the dyadic
               subjectivism of the conventional lyric reveals another poetics of life. </p>
                  <p>Clare reports to Mary that he hears tales told of her. She at once inhabits the
               position of the second and third person, just as he inhabits the first and second
               persons (“All sighing on, and will not hush, / Some pleasant tales of thee”). The
               tales are also the return of what the subject attempts to repress or conceal,
               figuring yet another scene of ineffectivity. Much as he tries to say something else,
               the tale of Mary can be displaced, but not extinguished; he can voice it or hear it,
               but cannot abandon—or be abandoned by—it. Put another way, the third stanza seems to
               describe a scene that might be one of revelation—that might expose the ghostliness
               and disturbance of this relation, as if he finally were to learn the truth of her
               absence and the mistake of his assumption of her presence. However, what is revealed
               here is instead another form of haunting. Still related to Mary, it is not she, only
               stories of her; her life and voice are now displaced onto the nightscape. In a turn
               that already begins at the end of the second stanza (“But soft, the wind comes from
               the sky,/And whispers tales of Mary”), by the third stanza, the world has become
               animated once more in a speaking scene that occludes the beloved. Mary’s absence is
               replaced by the “whispering” and “sighing” of tales, what Sigi Jöttkandt calls
               Clare’s “mary-ing” of the world.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> First Love
                  119.</note> While the poem initiates with a lyric address, by the end, the subject
               becomes the addressee, and the addressee, far from disappearing, has become an
               object. While this is the case in “Ode to the West Wind” and “The Mother,” here we
               are left to ask who is addressing the subject? In this case we have not a mirroring,
               a reciprocal animation, or even a crossing of lyric and maternal animation. Rather,
               when Clare thinks and speaks “of other things,” when he turns from his beloved to the
               landscape, he finds not that he has turned away, but the very resilience of this
               passionate attachment. Yet who is attached to whom and how do we decipher a scene in
               which hyperanimation has riven subject and object, person and place both? </p>
                  <p>It is this excessive animation that leaves Clare writing from the asylum, and it is
               this mode of apostrophe that, like Johnson’s account of apostrophe in abortion
               poetry, and for that matter, de Man’s account of death (and life) as a linguistic
               predicament leads us to rethink the relation of lyric to life, apostrophe to
               sovereignty, for it is anything but sovereignty that apostrophe in this instance
               seems to wield. Yet, the risk of this non-sovereignty is that it remains tied to new
               institutions in which the nourishment of life and violence against the living are
               conjoined. The lunatic asylum is just one of these examples. It is the asylum that
               protects Clare from society, preserves his poetry, transcribes and archives it, and
               yet that also keeps him from seeing his family for over twenty years (from his
               commitment until his death). If this poem bears witness to a poetics of life that
               breaks with the dyadic model, it also can be seen to proliferate it, for when Clare
               describes the lyric subject as the object of address he may already, proleptically be
               describing a structure of reception in which his own voice becomes a “whisper” and in
               which is own poem comes to us in a double form, borne by a writer who is ultimately
               not the poet, and another listener who may or may not be its addressee: William
               Knight.</p>
                  <p>Johnson’s reading of Brooks after Shelley and Baudelaire allows us to witness anew
               the lyric structure of sovereignty—and to see in the place of the lyric subject,
               perceived as sovereign (Mill) or as mute (de Man) before her, a subject whose very
               viability is in question. My reading of Clare proposes another iteration of lyric
               subjectivity as it relates to life. The poem seems to rely upon another dyad; no
               longer mother (living)/child (dead) nor poet (living)/breeze (nonliving); but rather
               a more familiar encounter between the lover and beloved. Yet here, the dyad, while
               utterly intense dissipates into a scene in which <emph>nothing</emph> and
               no one can be fully recovered. Here, uncertain viability is shared between the poet
               and addressee; just as the power of over life is shared between the poet, his
               steward, and the whispering breeze. This whispering also returns us to the question
               of life. It leads not only to poetic fame or posthumous life (as in the case of
               Shelley or Wordsworth), but also to what Joao Biehl has called “social abandonment”
               or actual incarceration, to a life lived in the asylum. Indeed, behind the relation
               of lover and beloved, here, there is the relation of inmate and asylum. The inmate
               who suffers from a confusion of voices, a loss of his actual loved ones, not only his
               fictional lover, and the disappearance of his manuscript. Yet, a typescript and a
               place in the archive replace the absent manuscript, a freedom of mobility and
               protection from worry and poverty substitute for the loss of family and obligation.
               If these substitutions are forms of “making live” they also bear the structure of an
               apostrophe, like the one in “To Mary,” that sustains, rather than remedies a malady. </p>
                  <p>What kind of power of or over life is the lyric? Thanks to de Man and Johnson, we
               have seen how this power can be alternatively, even simultaneously restorative and
               privative, how it can refigure or transfigure the subject exposing the question of
               her very viability. Yet with Clare we see how lyric sovereignty dissipates into
               voices everywhere, and how the question of poetic power intersects with that of
               biopower, with the rise of the Victorian asylum that became this poet’s place. In
               other words, developing Agamben’s account of the structure of <foreign>homo
                  sacer</foreign> into a poetic claim, we also see how sovereignty and abandonment share
               a rhetoric; how the lyric is one manifestation of this rhetoric; and how, at least in
               this case, independent of an originary fissure in the meaning of life we have instead
               the birth of biopoetics, not a literary biopolitics or a biopolitics of literature,
               but a lyric thinking life itself. </p>

                  <head>Coda</head>
                  <p>In 1999, Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner published a collection of essays entitled
                  <title level="m">Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts</title>. In an
               introductory essay, “Biopoetics: The New Synthesis,” Cooke outlines the theory of
               sociobiology (or evolutionary psychology) upon which the essays collected in the
               volume rely, and suggests that the aim of biopoetics is to “seek artistic universals
               and features that reflect our common humanity” (5). In establishing the term <emph>biopoetics</emph>, he explains: “I propose that we add the prefix
               ‘bio’ to the Aristotelian root ‘poetics,’ a word which describes the science of at
               least one art—there is no English term for the study of <emph>all</emph>
               the arts. Derived from the Greek word for making, ‘poetic’ also refers to our impulse
               to create beauty. We then nominate the term ‘biopoetics’” (6). Here, biopoetics is a
               name for the evolutionary account of aesthetics. This <emph>biopoetics</emph>, while in no way evoking <emph>biopolitics</emph>, as
               elaborated by Foucault, Agamben, and others, nevertheless shares with these
               approaches a focus on new scenes of scientific method. For <emph>biopoetics</emph>, in this sense, it is a matter of using scientific method to
               understand the emergence of art as a living thing; for <emph>biopolitics</emph>, in the sense offered by Foucault, it is matter of recognizing
               how the sciences of demography and public health, among others, obtain a new power
               over life and the living. Yet, the example of another, critical biopoetics, which
               this essay has sought to isolate, begins to tell another story, one attuned to a
               rhetoric of figure and to the question of literature’s power over life. By taking
               seriously the relation of lyric animation to the politics of life, we discover the
               example, not only of a haunting that poetry fails to manage (Johnson, Brooks), but
               also a mode of subjectivity at the threshold of viability and survival. For Clare,
               this is manifest as delusion and madness, as the failure to distinguish between what
               is living and dead and the emergence of the poetic subject not merely as madman, but
               as psychiatric object. If biopoetics in this sense returns us to Foucault’s
               biopolitics, then, it does so by exposing a new humanistic method. This is the
               inverse of the biopoetics formulated by Turner and Cooke. For rather than dismissing
               literary criticism and theory—whether in the name of natural or social scientific
               method—it reaffirms literary criticism’s uncanny ability to say something about life. </p>
                  <p>When E.O. Wilson, on the jacket of Cooke and Turner’s <title level="m">Biopoetics</title>, writes that he can see the methods proposed there “taking
               over from deconstruction by 2010, and permanently,” he advocates a methodological
               turn away from the linguistic and other turns that have marked humanistic method
               since the 1970s. As 2010 draws toward a close, the prediction seems not to have borne
               out. It is time therefore that we begin to recognize another biopoetics. Not the
               biopoetics of evolutionary arts, but of the conjunction of rhetorical and
               biopolitical reading. This biopoetics sets out, as this essay set out, by admitting
               two scenes of making live, and it concludes by exposing the impossibility of a
               politics of life or a science of literature that would be free from poetics.</p>

                  <p>Sometime during 1819, Percy Shelley interrupted the process of drafting his
                  longest prose text, <title level="m">A Philosophical View of Reform</title>, and
                  began working on an essay equally fated to remain a fragment—<title level="a">On
                     Life,</title> which Shelley wrote into the back of the same notebook he was
                  drafting the <title level="m">Philosophical View of Reform</title> in. Donald H.
                  Reiman and Neil Fraistat, the editors of the Norton Critical Edition of <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, write that the fragment “grew
                  directly from an early passage” in the former text (505, n. 1). Their choice of
                  metaphor characterizes an essay “on life” as an organic, living outgrowth of a
                  treatise on politics—as if life were continuous with and already contained by
                  politics. At the same time, the animation bestowed by the metaphor renders the
                  relationship of the two texts decidedly apolitical—not so much an action or even a
                  response to a historical or writerly exigency, but rather the manifestation of a
                  natural process, perhaps one as inevitable as Shelley’s individual disposition
                  towards abstract and ineffectual musings. Yet, and notwithstanding the suicidal
                  irony of an enlivened politics that, following this metaphor, does not so much
                  politicize life as depoliticize politics, the significance of the inscription of
                     <title level="a">On Life</title> in the pages of the draft of <title level="m">A Philosophical View of Reform</title> might have less to do with
                     <emph>what</emph> compelled Shelley to turn from a treatise on politics—a
                  survey of the historical and contemporary workings of political power that was to
                  demonstrate a “necessary” because “inevitable” political change and to culminate
                  in a practical proposal to enact a more egalitarian political model—to a
                  metaphysically tinged reflection on life, than in the fact that he did so. From
                  this perspective, the sheer material coincidence of these two fragments indicates
                  an historical and theoretical exigency in which politics—the possibility of
                  political change and more just government—comes to be staked on life and life
                  predicated on politics. In this light, the conjunction of the two texts
                  allegorizes a biopolitical relation between power and life, and so furnishes an
                  occasion to read romanticism’s engagement with “life” as a formative moment in the
                  modern genealogy of biopolitics. How, then, to read this turn to life?</p>
                  <p>At first sight, <title level="a">On Life</title> would seem to suggest that life
                  offers an escape from politics. In the opening paragraph Shelley asks: “What are
                  the changes of empires, the wreck of dynasties with the opinions which supported
                  them; what is the birth and the extinction of religions and of political systems
                  to life?” (505). The question is the first of three, and, insofar as it is merely
                  rhetorical, is a more effective way of asserting that power is trivial next to the
                  magnificence of life. However, this reading is immediately complicated by the fact
                  that, of the three questions, this is the only one lacking the phrase “compared
                  with” that unequivocally tells us that life is being measured or weighed up
                  against something else. While the question can still be rhetorical, without the
                  comparative prepositional phrase it also becomes increasingly legible as a sincere
                  question: what <emph>is</emph> the relation of power to life? This is not only a
                  question of what power makes of life, where life is rendered as the object of
                  power, for insofar as the speaker asks what the cycles of power are “to” life, it
                  is almost as if life itself, indirectly apostrophized, were called upon to give an
                  account of its relation with power.</p>
                  <p>This question is further sounded in the figuration of power’s historical forms as
                  themselves alive: beginning in “birth” and ending in “extinction,” political power
                  takes on the properties of a living being—a figuration that calls to mind
                  Foucault’s quip about biopower as a “magnificent beast” (“<foreign>bête
                     magnifique</foreign>,” qtd. in Chebili 142). Life, then, is not merely being
                  compared to, or even being valued over, power when the very act of that assertion
                  renders the relation of life and power indistinct. Shelley’s question instead
                  suggests that power is staked on the separability and difference of “life” from
                  itself, and that to intervene in politics always <emph>also</emph> entails coming
                  to grips with the uncertain legibility of the relation between power and life.</p>
                  <p>We would like to take Shelley’s meditation on the relation between power and life
                  as the occasion to introduce a collection of scholarship intended to initiate a
                  conversation about and between what is called “biopolitics” and what is called
                  “romanticism.” The broad contention of this volume is that the study of
                  biopolitics reanimates the question of romanticism. We mean this in two senses.
                  First, the set of conceptual resources provided in recent work on biopolitics
                  opens up inventive lines of inquiry that enable scholars to re-think the already
                  established awareness that the literature, philosophy, and culture of romanticism
                  displays an obsession with life. Biopolitics reanimates romanticism in the
                  additional sense that the current scholarly concern with life as an object of
                  power marks the radical survival of romanticism. If romanticism responds well when
                  examined in the light of contemporary biopolitical theory, then a constitutive
                  part of this response is a certain resistance to biopolitical theory. As the
                  contributors to this volume demonstrate, the biopolitical intervention on life—the
                  political project of targeting, capturing, making, and taking life—engages
                  paradoxes, predicaments, and aporias that have been widely or fully appreciated
                  neither by theorists of biopolitics nor by critics who take up their work.
                  Romanticism, we suggest, is a privileged locus for the awareness that even the
                  most assured representation of life turns upon an irreducible “literariness.”</p>

                  <p>Before we go any further, let us offer an overview of the current understanding of
                  biopolitics. The term “biopolitics” has a prehistory stretching back to the early
                  1900s, but in the last quarter of the twentieth century it emerged in the context
                  of heterogeneous attempts to account for the novel intersections between power,
                  the law, technology, culture, economics and the social sciences that over the last
                  few centuries have increasingly come to shape and dominate social and political
                  life—disputes over human rights and citizenship, the medical and demographic
                  monitoring of population, the management of relations between a population and the
                  environment, the legal regulation of abortion, the normative control of sexuality,
                  the shifting strategies and objectives of war, the conflict over the status and
                  rights of so-called enemy combatants, the emergence of biotechnologies, and the
                  harnessing of life processes for economic purposes. <note place="foot" resp="editors">On the prehistory of the term “biopolitics,” see Dan Stone’s

                     </note> Behind the
                  diverse surfaces of appearance of biopolitics, what theories of biopolitics have
                  in common is a radical overturning of traditional models of politics as a specific
                  sphere of human practice. Whereas, politics, following Arendt’s canonical
                  elaboration of Aristotle’s account of political action in <title level="m">The
                     Human Condition</title>, names the activity of collective, non-coercive
                  deliberation on the most just ways to organize community, biopolitics refers to
                  political practices in which the capacity of collective deliberation is at best of
                  secondary importance, since what is at issue is the biological life of the
                  community. From this perspective, the emergence of biopolitics marks a fundamental
                  transformation of the political order: from an order based on and involving
                  individual “subjects” as active participants to one in which the biological life
                  of “living beings” becomes the center and object of political intervention and
                  practice. <note place="foot" resp="editors">In Michel Foucault’s seminal
                     theory, biopolitics takes the form of concrete techniques of power that target
                     individuals not as “legal subjects” but as “living beings” (<title level="m">Sexuality</title> 142-43), while for Giorgio Agamben the nation-state is
                     biopolitical to the degree that it engages “not man as a free and conscious
                     political subject but, above all, man’s bare life” (<title level="m">Homo</title> 128).</note> If, as both Foucault and Agamben argue, human
                  beings were for two thousand years understood to be animals whose capacity for
                  politics was an extra-added feature that raised it above the life of animals, the
                  modern human being is “an animal whose politics places his existence as a living
                  being in question” (Foucault, <title level="m">History</title>, 143). We would add
                  that the modern placing-into-question of human life by politics is all the more
                  powerful and effective because, as Arendt’s critique of human rights in <title level="m">The Origins of Totalitarianism</title> suggests, the possibility of
                  separating the juridico-political “subject” from the “living being” that was its
                  ostensible bearer was the enabling premise of the French Revolution’s extension of
                  the political capacity for collective deliberation and self-determination—which
                  since its inception in the Greek <foreign>polis</foreign> had been confined to
                  particular classes (social, economic, gendered) of human beings—to
                     <emph>all</emph> human beings, solely on the basis of their belonging to the
                  human species. It is not at all the case, then, that our conventional
                  understandings of politics have become obsolete, as if superseded by biopolitics.
                  Rather, and as the essays by Marc Redfield and Emily Sun collected in this volume
                  eloquently show, the emergence of the subject is always accompanied by its
                  disappearance into political and aesthetic modalities of representation that, in
                  turning living beings into political subjects, figures the possibility of
                  biopolitical power.</p>
                  <p>Of the many, often divergent articulations of biopolitics, the seminal account of
                  Michel Foucault and its reinterpretation by Giorgio Agamben have been the most
                  influential; they figure prominently in the essays collected here, and so deserve
                  some elaboration. Foucault introduced his use of the terms “biopower” and
                  “biopolitics” in a series of lectures given at the Collège de France in early 1976
                  and in the introductory volume of the <title level="m">History of
                     Sexuality</title> also from 1976. Following on his earlier analyses of power in
                     <title level="m">The Birth of the Clinic</title> and <title level="m">Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison</title>, Foucault traced the
                  emergence, around the turn of the nineteenth century, of a new form of
                  power—“biopower”— that came to “complement,” “penetrate” and “permeate” the
                  sovereign power of the state. If sovereign power’s characteristic expression had
                  been the right to kill, to “take life or let live,” biopower named a new, opposing
                  right: the “right to make live and let die” (<title level="m">‘Society’</title>
                  241). Power no longer worked principally by means of deduction, “a subtraction
                  mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of the wealth, a tax of products,
                  goods, and services, labor and blood, levied on the subjects”; instead, it began
                  to work in positive manner to make its objects grow, “to incite, reinforce,
                  control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it” (<title level="m">History</title> 136). In short, biopower witnesses the “entry of life into
                  history, that is, the entry of phenomenon peculiar to the life of the human
                  species into the order of knowledge and power, into the sphere of political
                  techniques” (<title level="m">History</title> 141). </p>
                  <p>Foucault specifies that life entered into the calculations of power in two ways.
                  From the end of the seventeenth century the individual body was targeted “as a
                  machine: it disciplining the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion of
                  its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and docility, its integration
                  into systems of efficient and economic controls, all this was ensured by the
                  procedures of power that characterized the <emph>disciplines</emph>: an
                     <emph>anatomo-politics of the human body</emph>” (<title level="m">History</title> 139). In the second half of the eighteenth century this form
                  of biopower was supplemented by a second, properly <emph>biopolitical</emph>
                  technique that worked on biological features that became meaningful and efficient
                  only when aggregated and understood at the level of populations. From the
                  perspective of biopolitics the relation of “life” to an individual body is
                  aleatory, but regular with regard to a collection of bodies that exists over an
                  extended period of time. It hence became possible to establish control
                  mechanisms—“forecasts, statistical estimates, and overall measures”—whose “purpose
                  is not ... to modify a given individual insofar as he is an individual, but,
                  essentially, to intervene at the level at which these general phenomenon are
                  determined, at the level of their generality” (<title level="m">‘Society’</title>
                  246). The biopolitical intervention on life concerns not individual subjects, but
                  rather the production of figures—statistics, estimates, data, totals, sums—that
                  provide, and indeed are, the means to regularize, but also isolate and contain,
                  the “random element inherent in a population of living beings” so as to “optimize
                  a state of life” (246).</p>
                  <p>That the project of biopower was to “make live” does not mean, however, that the
                  old sovereign right of death simply disappears. It is rather subordinated to the
                  power of making live, and manifests itself, Foucault writes, as “the reverse of
                  the right of the social body to ensure, maintain and develop its life” (<title level="m">History</title> 136). The power of death is no longer wielded “in the
                  name of a sovereign who must be defended” but rather to protect the biological
                  existence of a population (<title level="m">‘Society’</title> 137). And since
                  “death becomes, insofar as it is the end of life, . . . the limit, or the end of
                  power too” (<title level="m">‘Society’</title> 248), the power <emph>over</emph>
                  death itself becomes unbounded, freed from all previously existing constraints.
                  This, then, is a principal paradox of biopolitics: to the very degree that
                  biopower makes it its mission to foster and guarantee life, life itself comes to
                  be threatened by ever growing political and technological means of destruction:
                  “It is,” Foucault writes, “as managers of life and survival . . . that so many
                  regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed”
                     (<title level="m">History</title> 137). Foucault accounts for this paradoxical
                  “death-function in the economy of biopower” with the paradigm of racism, which
                  serves two important purposes (<title level="m">‘Society’</title> 258). It
                  provides, first, the means to create biological “caesuras within the [population]”
                  that allow a line to be drawn “between what must live and what must die” and,
                  secondly, it creates a “positive relationship” in which “the death of the bad race
                  ... is something that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer”
                  (254-55). Racism’s inscription in the biopolitical in this way at once justifies,
                  exacerbates and regulates the asymmetrical play between the unbounded power over
                  death and biopower’s control over life—a “play” that constitutively exposes state
                  and population to the limits of its life-fostering power: death (260). </p>
                  <p>If Foucault’s studies of biopower introduced the essential conceptions with which
                  we still work, it was Giorgio Agamben’s <title level="m">Homo Sacer: Sovereign
                     Power and Bare Life</title> (Italian 1995; English 1998) that the immediate

                     Bibliography for scholarship on “biopolitics” over the last 30 years reveals
                     the following: between 1980 and 1989 we find one instance (by Donna J.
                     Haraway), between 1990 and 1999 we find three, and between 2000 and 2009 there
                     are 65. The astonishing increase in biopolitical studies since 2000 in which
                     we’re interested is corroborated by the same search on WorldCat, a database
                     unrestricted to just critical studies: between 1980 and 1989 there were 105
                     publications on biopolitics, between 1990 and 1999 there were 164, and between
                     2000 and 2009 there were 756. Comparing the two sets of data, one can see that
                     studies of biopolitics grew at a much faster rate since 2000 in critical
                     studies than in the academy in general. Both searches were conducted in June
                     2010.</note> Bringing together philosophical reflection and political critique
                  with philological erudition, Agamben’s book marked a significant theoretical
                  revaluation of biopolitics. Whereas Foucault’s analyses largely bypassed
                  traditional political and juridical theories of political power in favor of an
                  analysis of the material mechanisms and techniques that made life available to the
                  political machinations of the state, Agamben’s work marked a return to an analysis
                  of the juridico-institutional model of power—albeit with a two decisive twists.
                  First, Agamben interpreted Aristotle’s account of the Greek
                     <foreign>polis</foreign> as indicating that the central political binary was
                  not that of friend and enemy, as political theorists from Hobbes on had thought,
                  but rather the distinction between “bare” or “naked life” (<foreign>zoé</foreign>)
                  and political existence (<foreign>bíos</foreign>). Secondly, drawing on Carl
                  Schmitt’s definition of the sovereign as the one who decides on the state of
                  exception, Agamben argued that the decisive fact of modern politics was not the
                  mere inclusion of life in politics, but rather its inclusion in the
                  politico-juridical order by means of its exclusion. Hence the “<emph>originary
                     relation of law to life is not application</emph>”—the Foucauldian schema in
                  which life becomes the “principal object of the projection and calculations of
                  State power” (Agamben, <title level="m">Homo</title> 9)—“<emph>but
                     Abandonment</emph>” (29, original emphasis): the situation, brought around by
                  the sovereign decision on the state of exception, through which the bare life of
                  political subjects, having been abandoned by the law and lacking all legal
                  protection, is exposed to the vicissitudes of unregulated violence. </p>
                  <p>Both Foucault and Agamben’s accounts of biopolitics can be articulated in terms of
                  the relation of signifier and signified. As in Foucault, for Agamben biopolitics
                  emerges at the moment life enters into representation, but it does so in a quite
                  different sense. While for Foucault, representation concerns the
                  relations—technical, material, and mechanical—that bind a signifier to a signified
                  (that apply to it), for Agamben representation includes the <foreign>de
                     facto</foreign> exclusion of the signified from the signifier, its <foreign>de
                     jure</foreign> inclusion being merely the <emph>form</emph> of representation.
                  The exemplary, paradigmatic figure of this predicament is the obscure Roman legal
                  figure of the <foreign>homo sacer</foreign>, “who <emph>may be killed and yet not
                     sacrificed</emph>” (8, original emphasis). Banned from the political community
                  and abandoned by the law, he no longer can be licitly represented in the
                  politico-juridical order of the state, and thus can be killed with impunity but
                  not sacrificed, precisely because, in the first case, there can be no penalty for
                  murdering someone who has no legal existence, and, in the second case, his very
                  lack of representation protects him from being sacrificed. For Agamben, in other
                  words, the entry into representation is always also accompanied by an exit from
                  it; indeed, <foreign>homo sacer</foreign> occupies the threshold of representation
                  and its constitutive outside, always already half live, half dead. With reference
                  to Foucault, then, we might say that <foreign>homo sacer</foreign> appears at and
                  marks the discursive limits, not only of biopower, but of sovereign power.</p>
                  <p>Agamben’s theoretical intervention in this rearticulates the genealogy and horizon
                  of biopolitics outlined by Foucault. Insisting on an archaic, originary complicity
                  between the biopower and sovereignty, Agamben argues that, far from being peculiar
                  to our modernity, the inclusive exclusion of life in the Greek
                     <foreign>polis</foreign> meant that Western politics had from the very
                  beginning been a biopolitics (181). Foucault’s historical rupture is thus
                  supplanted by a schema in which modernity is distinguished from earlier periods
                  merely by the acceleration of bare life’s movement from the margins of political
                  existence to the center of the political order. Hence, Agamben writes, “the
                  exception becomes the rule, and the difference between inside and outside, fact
                  and law enter into a zone of irreducible indistinction” (9). As a consequence, the
                  Nazi camps, which for Foucault were a contingent, singular paroxysm in which the
                  field of biopolitics became “absolutely coextensive with the sovereign right
                  kill,” in no way can be considered a historical exception but must rather be
                  understood as the “fundamental biopolitical paradigm of the West” (181). In the
                  last instance, then, biopolitics always amounts to a thanatopolitics, a murderous
                  politics of death. As Eva Geulen concisely puts it in her contribution to the
                  present volume, “For Agamben, then, sovereign politics is biopolitics and
                  biopolitics is, at bottom, always a politics of death and killing.” Indeed, the
                  secret link binding bare life to sovereign power—in short, biopolitics—has all
                  along determined the trajectory of Western politics. Hence our present political
                  moment becomes legible, in Agamben’s view, as the disastrous endpoint of a
                  political tradition that, extending from ancient Greece to the Nazi concentration
                  camps and beyond, exhibits an “inner solidarity between democracy and
                  totalitarianism” (10).</p>
                  <p>In the years since the appearance of Foucault’s and Agamben’s respective texts,
                  scholars have taken up, elaborated, and revaluated their concerns. Critics such as
                  Paul Rabinow and Nicholas Rose have built on Michel Foucault’s definition of
                  “biopolitics” as “the attempt, starting from the eighteenth century, to
                  rationalize the problems posed to governmental practice by phenomena
                  characteristic of a set of living beings forming a population: health, hygiene,
                  birthrate, life expectancy, race . . .” (<title level="m">Birth</title> 217),
                  expanding his analysis to include those institutions and apparatuses, from ethics
                  councils to the doctor-patient relationship, in and through which the
                  politicization of biological life-processes takes place. Others, such as Achille
                  Mbembe, have taken up Agamben’s subjectivist and decisionist model, arguing that
                  “the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power
                  and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die” (Mbembe 11). The decade
                  since biopolitics’ explosion onto the contemporary theoretical scene has also
                  brought forward a number of important theoretical reconsiderations of biopolitics
                  more specifically relevant to the humanities, which—even though we can’t them
                  discuss here in any depth—deserve notice. We mention especially Michael Hardt and
                  Antonio Negri’s <title level="m">Empire</title> (2000) and <title level="m">Multitude</title> (2003) as well as Roberto Esposito’s recent account of the
                  “immunity paradigm” in <title level="m">Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy</title>

                  <head>II. Romanticism and Biopolitics</head>
                  <p>Romanticism occupies an ambivalent position in the most influential contemporary
                  theoretical accounts of biopolitics. Even though the historical period that
                  romanticism occupies, especially in the British and German traditions, appears as
                  a pivotal moment in the history of biopolitics, biopolitical theorists have not
                  paid any real attention to romanticism as a literary, philosophical, and cultural
                  formation, focusing rather on contemporaneous developments that take place within
                  the concrete arrangements and theoretical paradigms of the social and political
                  sciences. If at all, romanticism appears in their accounts as only as a name, a
                  gesture, or as the metonymic designation of a historical moment outside of their
                  critical purview. Thus, while Foucault locates the emergence of biopower at the
                  “threshold of modernity”—the very historical moment punctuated by the emergence of
                  romanticism—his historical analyses circumvent romanticism. Similarly, while
                  Agamben focuses on the consequential role of the National Assembly’s <title level="m">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</title> in 1789
                  in inscribing the natural life of citizens in the juridico-political order of the
                  nation-state (<title level="m">Homo</title> 127)—an issue Marc Redfield takes up
                  in his contribution to this volume—“romanticism” appears in his work only briefly
                  and in passing, most significantly as the name of the pernicious ideology which
                  “consciously created” the “symbiotic correspondence” between “language as the fact
                  of speech and the people as the fact of community” which “defines modern political
                  discourse” (<title level="m">Means</title> 66).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Agamben discusses romantic writers and texts on several
                     occasions, specifically Sade (<title level="m">Homo</title> 134-35), Keats
                        (<title level="m">Remnants</title> 112-13), and Hölderlin (<title level="m">Homo</title> 32-33).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose provide a compressed instance of this ambivalence in
                  a programmatic essay from 2003 titled <title level="a">Thoughts on the Concept of
                     Biopower Today.</title> Having clarified and taken stock of the efficacy of the
                  concept of biopower with a view to its critical future, they conclude the essay
                  with a look back: <quote>One might well imagine what it might have been like in
                     1800 for an analyst attempting to grasp the transformative implications of the
                     forerunners of the ‘birth of the clinic.’ Today we are equally in a situation
                     of major historical change whose directions are partially obscure and not yet
                     solidified. … [W]e feel that the concept of biopower is pertinent to grasping
                     many diverse contemporary developments. But the concept remains insufficiently
                     developed, and has not yet demonstrated its analytic mettle in sufficient
                     cases. We would recommend that analysts attended to that task, rather than
                     succumbing to the allure of philosophies that turn a concept into a theory or a
                     world view. (2003, 34)<note place="foot" resp="editors"> We quote the
                        2003 version of the essay rather than the revised 2006 version only because
                        it more clearly exemplifies the ambivalence with which we’re concerned.
                        However, this ambivalence is also legible in the later version: <quote>One
                           might well imagine what it might have been like in 1800 for an analyst
                           attempting to grasp the transformative implications of the forerunners of
                           the ‘birth of the clinic.’ Today we might well be in an analogous
                           situation, where the drivers of change can be already be discerned, some
                           consequences predicted, but where the overall directions remain obscure
                           and their implications still in doubt. Thus it is hard to tell whether we
                           are at the early stages of a momentous shift, in the middle of a process
                           that is well under way towards stabilizing new forms, or in a conjuncture
                           that will prove to be a dead end or at least marginal to other changes
                           that we cannot envisage today. But in attempting to make a diagnosis from
                           ‘in the middle’, we think that the concept of biopower focuses our
                           attention on three key elements that are at stake in any
                           transformation—knowledge of vital processes, power relations that take
                           human beings as their object, and the modes of subjectification through
                           which subjects work on themselves qua living beings—as well as their
                           multiple combinations. (215)</quote>

                     </quote> Rabinow and Rose present the contemporaneity of their account of
                  biopolitics by way of a return of and to the historical moment of romanticism. Yet
                  where we might expect to find the name romanticism, we find instead the year
                  “1800” and, moreover, not a poet, novelist, playwright or philosopher but rather
                  an “analyst”—an analyst, it turns out, who not only, like Foucault and Agamben,
                  does not pay any significant attention to the literary, philosophical, and
                  cultural stakes of romanticism, but appears, insofar as he’s said to be examining
                  the birth of the clinic, as their historical retrojection. The effacement of
                  romanticism is underscored in Rabinow and Rose’s critique of “philosophies [the
                  references are to Agamben and to Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri] that turn a
                  concept [biopower] into a theory or a world view.” In such resistance to theory
                  it’s not difficult to hear the accusation that what theorists of biopolitics are
                  guilty of is a certain version of the romantic ideology, which even as it can “see
                  into the life of things” excludes from its field of vision “certain conflictual
                  sights and meanings—roughly the <emph>life</emph> of things” (Levinson
                     24-25).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Ross Wilson quotes and comments
                     on this passage from Levinson in the introduction to his collection, <title level="m">The Meaning of ‘Life’ in Romantic Poetry and Poetics</title>
                     (3-4). While we read this resistance to theory as an effacement of romanticism,
                     the ambivalence we’re interested intensifies if we acknowledge that, as David
                     Simpson has shown, the resistance to theory is also quintessentially romantic.
                  </note> Yet consider the particular means by which Rabinow and Rose present their
                  clear-sighted prophetic analyst of history in 1800. It is upon the gesture of
                     <emph>imagining</emph> the experience of “an analyst” trying to understand in
                  1800 that their theorization of their own effort to understand the present and
                  ongoing transformations in biopolitics rests. To be sure, Rabinow and Rose would
                  likely intend the analogy they draw between the present study of biopolitics and
                  the analyst of biopolitics in 1800 to be no more than a heuristically useful
                  rhetorical gesture. Nevertheless, in deploying the quintessential romantic
                  creative faculty, their closing remarks indicate that romanticism, both as an
                  object and act of imagination, is already a means by which biopolitics is made
                  available to reflection.</p>
                  <p>Despite the tangled knot of effaced references to and disavowed enactments of
                  romanticism in biopolitical theory, critics have long agreed that romanticism
                  concerns itself in a fundamental way with life. Indeed, scholars of romanticism
                  have long characterized the years Foucault and Agamben identify as a turning point
                  in the history of biopolitics as one of modernity’s most prominent and
                  consequential sites for the intense thematization of life. In discussing the
                  various controlling categories that positively define romanticism, M. H. Abrams
                  gives life special prominence when he asserts that for romanticism, “The
                  ground-concept is life.” Indeed, he continues, “Life is itself the highest good,
                  the residence and measure of other goods, and the generator of the controlling
                  categories of Romantic thought. . . . Life is the premise and paradigm for what is
                  most innovative and distinctive in Romantic thinkers” (<title level="m">Natural
                     Supernaturalism</title> 431). For Abrams, the two principal signs of the life
                  of romanticism are “vitalism” — “the celebration of that which lives, moves, and
                  evolves by an internal energy, over whatever is lifeless, inert, and unchanging” —
                  and “organicism”— “the metaphorical translation into the categories and norms of
                  intellection of the attributes of a growing thing, which unfolds its inner form
                  and assimilates to itself alien elements, until it reaches the fullness of its
                  complex, organic unity” (ibid. 431-32). Abrams extends this growth in life to
                  figural language, most particularly to those tropes whose “valid animation of
                  natural objects … now came to be a major index to the sovereign faculty of
                  imagination, and almost in itself a sufficient criterion of the highest poetry”
                     (<title level="m">Mirror</title> 55). Romanticism is a poetic project whose aim
                  is to ‘make live’, and whose very rhetoricity denoted the sovereignty of its
                  animating powers—not a political but a poetic sovereignty, a sovereignty of art on
                  the far side of politics.</p>
                  <p>The study of organicism in turn has developed into a concern for a greater variety
                  of romanticism’s signs of life. Critics such as Denise Gigante, Charles I.
                  Armstrong, Robert J. Richards, and Arkady Plotnitsky have extended Abrams’ insight
                  about the discourse of organicism from poetry to texts drawn from the natural
                  sciences and philosophy. Scholars have also increasingly focused on the various
                  modes by which romantic writers engaged with and contributed to debates in the
                  life sciences of the period, charting the transformation in the discourse of life
                  that occurred around the turn of the nineteenth century—as Foucault notes in
                     <title level="m">The Order of Things</title>, the term “biology” was coined,
                  first in French, in 1800 (xi)—even arguing for a romantic science of life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Hermione de Almeida, <title level="m">Romantic Medicine and John Keats</title> (1991), Helmut Müller-Sievers,
                        <title level="m">Self-Generation: Biology, Philosophy, and Literature Around
                        1800</title> (1997), Robert J. Richards, <title level="m">The Romantic

                     and Sharon Ruston, <title level="m">Shelley and Vitality</title> (2005).</note>
                  More recently a handful of critics have begun to make the case that life formed a
                  persistent object of representation in romantic poetry and poetics, both with and
                  without reference to the life sciences, showing that the discourses about life in
                  romantic literature exceed the framework of organicism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Charles I. Armstrong, <title level="m">Romantic Organicism:
                        From Idealist Origins to Ambivalent Afterlife</title> (2003), Ross Wilson,
                        <title level="m">The Meaning of ‘Life’ in Romantic Poetry and
                        Poetics</title> (2009), and Denise Gigante, <title level="m">Life: Organic
                        Form and Romanticism</title> (2009) as well as Paul Youngquist, <title level="a">Wordsworth’s Physiological Aesthetics.</title> As Sara Guyer
                     demonstrates in her contribution to the present collection, the deconstructive
                     rhetorical strain within the field has long been aware that romantic poetics
                     turned upon such figures of animation as apostrophe and prosopopeia. </note> In
                  all these ways, then, the critical reflection on romantic organicism has given way
                  to a more comprehensive and fine-grained reflection on life that emphasizes the
                  variety of contexts and discursive modes in which it is constituted. </p>
                  <p>Nonetheless, the focus on the figure of life in the archive of romantic poetry,
                  philosophy, and science has yet to be matched by a complex understanding of the
                  relation between life and power. Recent research has no doubt complicated Abrams’
                  proposition that life unproblematically generated “love” defined as “the
                  confraternity of the one life shared not only with other men but also with a
                  milieu in which man can feel fully at home” (<title level="m">Natural
                     Supernaturalism</title> 431). Nicolas Roe and Sharon Ruston have shown how
                  vitalist and materialist positions in the debate about the nature of life at the
                  turn of the century translated into normative political positions; Gigante point
                  to the way in which poetic and scientific conceptions of life were understood to
                  be a form of discursive, if not political, power; and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and
                  Jean-Luc Nancy and others have demonstrated the ease with which modern political
                  programs invoke romantic organicism. What remains outside the conceptualization of
                  such approaches—and what biopolitical theory offers to teach us—is an appreciation
                  of the possibility that “life” in romanticism is neither just the analogue nor
                  simply a form of power, but also and fundamentally a referent of political
                  power.</p>
                  <p>Faced with symmetrical views of the same terrain—the view of biopolitics without
                  romanticism, and the view of romanticism without biopolitics—the present volume of
                     <title level="m">Romantic Circles Praxis Series</title> undertakes to explore
                  the implications of the biopolitical problematic for romanticism. The initial
                  results of our effort can be seen in the articles that follow. Each suggests
                  possible directions for future research, some of which we can already gesture
                  towards here. In no particular order, these include: aesthetics, which as Marc
                  Redfield notes, has always claimed to be biopolitics; human rights, which Agamben,
                  partly via Edmund Burke’s critique of the National Assembly’s 1789 declaration,
                  has characterized as a technology of biopolitics; demography and its instruments
                  such as the census, the institution of which in 1801 was precipitated by Malthus’s
                  apocalyptic speculations in <title level="m">Essay on the Principle of
                     Population</title> in 1798; the social sciences, especially Jeremy Bentham’s
                  seminal version of utilitarianism; the life sciences, including experimental
                  projects at making inanimate matter live; race, that “caesura in the biological
                  continuum” (Foucault, <title level="m">‘Society’</title> 255), the invention of
                  which has been claimed to take place in the writings of Kant; and the environment,
                  identified by Foucault as one of four surfaces for the appearance of biopolitical
                  pressure and newly renovated by ecocritics as the central category of
                     romanticism.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="a">The
                        Biopolitical Unconscious</title> Lee Medovoi insightfully begins the task of
                     imagining an ecocriticism attentive to the “environment” as the figure of
                     “nature” interpellated by biopolitics.</note> This list is neither prescriptive
                  nor complete, but it nonetheless indicates some of the ways in which the
                  politicization of life is already a constitutive, if nonetheless submerged, aspect
                  of romanticism. </p>

                  <head>III. The Literariness of Life</head>
                  <p>We hasten to add that we are not offering the electrifying proposition,
                     <foreign>le romanticisme, c’est biopolitique</foreign>, let alone that
                  romanticism <emph>is</emph> biopolitics. Nor are we making the historical
                  assertion that romanticism is the—or the principal—origin of modern biopolitics.
                  Romanticism is surely in the historical DNA of biopolitics, but the contemporary
                  biopolitical situation claims a diversely branching genealogical web with multiple
                  and often competing sources, not a single or genetic origin. Yet we are arguing,
                  to introduce the second sense of our central hypothesis, that inasmuch as
                  romanticism as a rhetoric of life responds to the question of biopolitics, it does
                  so not just as something we are not yet done with, but also as something that is
                  not yet done with us. Indeed, in our view, biopolitical theory is one of the more
                  vital instances of what Ian Baucom has called the “afterlives of romanticism.”
                  Biopolitics maintains romanticism’s afterlife in this sense not because life would
                  be a romantic concept, but because claims to have made or to make life
                  available—as an object of cognition, food for thought, or the grounds for
                  action—call on the “life and afterlives” of romanticism as a compelling and not
                  merely archival name of the difficulties such projects encounter (Baucom 20). The
                  very fact that the emergence of biopolitics has been accompanied by legible
                  effacement of romanticism in its official genealogies suggests that the current
                  scholarly concern with life as an object of power, far from simply indicating a
                  loss of romanticism, marks its radical survival. </p>
                  <p>If contemporary biopolitical theory has become a necessary condition of our
                  awareness of the political stakes of romanticism’s obsession with life, one way we
                  might remark on romanticism’s biopolitical survival is to note that biopolitics,
                  in constituting its principle object of inquiry, actualizes that trope most proper
                  to romanticism: the substitution of language for life. As the focus of
                  biopolitical studies on biomedicine, biocapital, sovereignty, humanitarianism, and
                  so on all too easily allow us to forget, life, both in the work of Foucault and
                  Agamben as well as of other theorists of biopolitics, becomes accessible to
                  biopolitical intervention, not as such, but through its entry into language and
                  representation. In Foucault’s account, the intersection of language and life takes
                  the form of a discursive threshold, but not one that is located in any single
                  subject or body. Rather, insofar as politics intervenes on life through the
                  production, regulation and manipulation of figural regimes—the statistics,
                  estimates, data, totals, and sums that represent the life of the population at a
                  general level—the objective of power is to control the “random element inherent in
                  a population of living beings,” where the “random element” names an anomaly in a
                  statistical distribution with regard to the norm that is identified by means of a
                  calculating apparatus rather than by discursive means (2003, 246). What is
                  decisive is not any positive knowledge of the relation of power and life, but
                  rather the mere facticity of the substitution of language for life that enables
                  that intervention in the first place. </p>
                  <p>Given that this substitutive structure is properly that of figural language in
                  general, it is somewhat surprising that the specificity of literature’s
                  contribution to, as well as its role in, the biopolitical project of “making live
                  and letting die” have received little attention from either literary critics or
                  biopolitical theorists. In a Foucaultian account of biopolitics, literature at
                  most might be said to appear as but one discursive formation among many involved
                  in the machinations of power-knowledge, as a concrete instance of the mechanism by
                  which biopower mediately takes hold of the life of the body. Yet inasmuch as the
                  quantitatively organized discourses of public health, criminology, labor
                  management, and so forth are more effective ways of managing ‘life,’ literature
                  would seem to be hardly pertinent to a form of (“post-ideological”) politics that
                  targets bodily life. Agamben’s account will seem more amenable to inquiries
                  attentive to the density of language, not least, as Eva Geulen observes, because
                  of its roots in philology and its engagement with the philosophical tradition.
                  Modeling his account of biopolitical sovereignty on a reading of the negative
                  event of language in Hegel and Heidegger, Agamben can write that “Language is the
                  sovereign who, in a permanent state of exception, declares that there is nothing
                  outside language and that language is always beyond itself” and that the
                  potentiality to signify is given to the precise degree that “language withdraws
                  itself from every concrete instance of speech” (<title level="m">Homo</title> 21).
                     <note place="foot" resp="editors">Agamben elaborates this reading in
                        <title level="m">Language and Death: The Place of Negativity.</title>
                     </note>
                  The structure of abandonment that underlies the sovereign exception thus
                  corresponds exactly to the negativity of representation. In their deprivation of
                  language, the enemy combatant, the <foreign>homo sacer</foreign>, the subject of
                  human rights, and, in the extreme instance, the <foreign>Muselmänner</foreign> of
                  the Nazi death camps, each personify a figure of life that political power
                  effectively takes hold of precisely by abandoning it at the limits of language.
                  Thus unmoored from the referential force of language, they are given over to the
                  sheer arbitrariness of their substitutive determination. </p>
                  <p>A principal contention of the current volume is that if biopolitics is intimately
                  involved with and intervenes on a language about life deeply informed by the
                  legacy of romanticism, romanticism’s “literariness” might itself provide a
                  compelling avenue to critically rethink the most influential biopolitical
                  theories. As the essays collected in this volume demonstrate, in romantic texts
                  the biopolitical intervention on life—the political project of targeting,
                  capturing, making, and taking life—plays out as a venture fraught with
                  difficulties and contingencies that unsettle theoretical models of biopolitics. In
                  this sense, the encounter with romanticism reanimates biopolitics, restoring to it
                  not a lost life but rather a critical awareness of the contingency of the
                  uncertain literariness of its making live.</p>

                  <p>The present collection began life as a special session of the Modern Language
                  Association convention in San Francisco in December 2008. Despite being scheduled
                  at the last timeslot of the last day of the convention, the session drew such a
                  sizeable and enthusiastic crowd that we were encouraged to seek a larger avenue
                  for the project. Continuities and differences between the two iterations of the
                  project are worth noting. Marc Redfield’s and Emily Sun’s articles are
                  substantially revised versions of the papers they presented at the convention;
                  Sara Guyer chose to contribute to the present volume an entirely new piece on John
                  Clare, loosely based on of the one she presented in 2008. Eva Geulen was not
                  present at the MLA convention, and her essay responds to the version of the
                  articles collected in this volume.</p>
                  <p>Scholars of romanticism should not be surprised to see that we asked Sara Guyer to
                  contribute to our volume. Her book, <title level="m">Romanticism After
                     Auschwitz</title> (2007) is the first and so far only book-length study of,
                  among other things, romanticism, biopolitics, and literature. Guyer’s essay <title level="a">Biopoetics</title> opens by elegantly noting that it was not just
                  natural and social scientists who became interested in life around 1800, but also
                  poets. What, Guyer asks, would be a poetic understanding of the relationship
                  between literature, power, and life? To answer this question, she turns to Barbara
                  Johnson’s account of the relation of poetic apostrophe, a rhetorical figure of
                  animation, and the politics of abortion. Elaborating on her insight that the
                  apostrophe to the not-yet born makes it “impossible to tell whether language is
                  what gives life or what kills” (Johnson 34)—a gesture that anticipates Agamben’s
                  notion of a “zone of indistinction” between life and politics—Guyer argues that
                  “what occurs in the sphere of politics shares a structure with—indeed is—a problem
                  in poetry. What Johnson reveals is not a literary biopolitics, but biopolitics as
                  indissociable from literature and its indeterminacies.” While Guyer’s turn in the
                  second half of her essay to John Clare’s romantic-period poem, <title level="a">To
                     Mary,</title> might come as a surprise—the poem thematizes neither biopolitics
                  nor abortion—the conjugation of Clare and Johnson in itself already suggests that
                  what is at stake in the relationship between romanticism, biopolitics, and
                  literature is not a shared thematic representation of life but, rather, a shared
                  predicament concerning the representation of life. Guyer reveals the nature of
                  this predicament in an economic reading of the poem’s apostrophic complex. If the
                  speaker’s address to his dead lover fails to make her live or to let her die, then
                  this ineffectivity is precisely what Guyer calls the “lyric structure of
                  sovereignty.” Life is not simply a given to be quantified or captured, nor is the
                  life of the lyric subject who makes live and lets die simply the life of a
                  sovereign opposed to naked life. What rather emerges is a life whose viability is
                  contested, a life contingent upon a failed abortion. Thus the lyric is not the
                  symptom of some romantic ideology; it is the structure of power—and contestation.
                  Such is the lesson of what Guyer, in a powerfully speculative coda, calls
                  biopoetics: “This biopoetics sets out, as this essay set out, by admitting two
                  scenes of making live, and it concludes by exposing the impossibility of a
                  politics of life or a science of literature that would be free from poetics.”</p>
                  <p>The event that Emily Sun treats in her essay <title level="a">Mill’s Wordsworthian
                     Turn: Poetry, Politics, Eloquence</title> is well known: John Stuart Mill’s
                  emotional breakdown at the age of 20 and the important role that the poetry of
                  William Wordsworth played in his recovery. What is so novel is her reading of this
                  event as a real-world encounter between biopolitics and romantic poetics. Indeed
                  the conditions that make the event such an encounter are so precise as to
                  approximate those of a controlled laboratory experiment. Mill’s breakdown took the
                  form of a loss of faith in utilitarianism. And utilitarianism, Sun observes, with
                  its assumption that the good life can be measured, calculated, and manipulated
                  provided—and arguably still provides—a crucial part of the liberal social
                  scientific method for the efficient biopolitical administration of life. Reading
                  the account of Mill’s crisis in his <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, Sun
                  demonstrates that the utilitarian reformer finds that his personal life is
                  unaccounted for in the world he is supposed to reform. What restores his
                  happiness, on the far side of utilitarianism, is an experience of reading poetry,
                  specifically the poetry of Wordsworth. Indeed, the tropes by which Mill accounts
                  for his recovery repeat and displace those of Wordsworth: where Wordsworth has
                  Nature to aid him overcome his crises, Mill has Wordsworth’s poetry of Nature.
                  Reading Mill’s essay <title level="a">What is poetry?</title> as the account of
                  poetry’s capacity to lead the self beyond the manufactured subjectivity of a
                  strict utilitarian upbringing, Sun argues, against the critical opinion that
                  Mill’s expressivist conception of poetry is apolitical or antipolitical, that the
                  essay complicates the distinction between political speech and poetic speech.
                  Poetry, for Mill, is not simply the antithesis of eloquence, somehow outside the
                  circuits that tie it to an audience. For in characterizing poetry as “soliloquy,”
                  he defines it as having an audience in a mode that exposes the audience’s world as
                  incomplete. “If, according to Aristotle in the <title level="m">Politics</title>,
                  the human as a political animal is an animal that has speech,” Sun writes in a
                  manner that resonates with the argument of Jacques Rancière, “Mill’s theatrical
                  theory of poetry seems to imply that the human is the animal for whom what it
                  means to have speech always remains in question. Politics, then, would consist of
                  the interminable interrogation of that question and the renewal of the criteria
                  for eloquence.” </p>
                  <p>Anyone who has read <title level="m">Phantom Formations</title> (1996) and <title level="m">The Politics of Aesthetics</title> (2003) knows how much Marc
                  Redfield has taught us about the thick entanglement of aesthetics and politics
                  that we call romanticism. He opens his contribution to the collection, <title level="a">Aesthetics, Sovereignty, Biopower,</title> by effortlessly grasping
                  the power of the concept of biopolitics to illuminate aesthetics: “biopolitics is
                  precisely what the aesthetic, particularly in its modern form, has always claimed
                  to be.” However, his principal contention is that the very density of aesthetics
                  means that biopolitics may not be exactly what contemporary theorists claim it to
                  be. As much as aesthetics can be read as an extension of biopolitics, biopolitical
                  sovereignty finds itself subject to the technicity of aesthetics. The biopolitical
                  reach of modern aesthetics is exemplified, Redfield argues, in Friedrich
                  Schiller’s <title level="m">Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</title>.
                  Explicitly a political response to and solution for the violence of the French
                  Revolution, Schiller’s treatise outlines an aesthetic program that aims for
                  nothing less than a body at one with the law. What aesthetic education forms—or at
                  least tries to form—is a political body whose life expresses the law. This
                  intimacy of life and art is in principle non-coercive, as Schiller insists, and
                  yet such insistence also turns out to reveal aesthetics’ capacity for violence.
                  What Redfield focuses on, however, is not just the violence that sovereignty
                  performs and disavows, but also the force that it exploits yet cannot control. To
                  elaborate this claim, he turns to a text published in the same year (1795) as
                  Schiller’s treatise, Goethe’s <title level="m">Conversations of German
                     Refugees</title>. In some ways a parodic response to Schiller aesthetic
                  program, the unusual text comprises seven stories, all of which are intended by
                  their refugee tellers to embody the promises of aesthetic culture to restore the
                  moral and political order of the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> after the
                  violence of the French Revolution. The controlling figure for this order is, in
                  the words of the leader of the refugees, the Baroness, <foreign>der gute
                     Ton</foreign>, a literal translation of the French <foreign>bon ton</foreign>.
                  Yet <foreign>Ton</foreign> in German also means “noise.” Exploiting this double
                  meaning, Redfield traces a remarkably consistent pattern by which sovereign
                  responses to shocking noises in the frame narrative and the seven stories
                  reproduce rather than put an end to the revolutionary shock such noises are
                  associated with. “<foreign>Ton</foreign> is Goethe’s deceptively modest figure for
                  aesthetics as a discourse animated by shock.” Insofar as Goethe’s text is itself
                  an aesthetico-pedagogical effort to disseminate <foreign>den guten Ton</foreign>,
                  it allegorizes its own inability to rigorously distinguish between the shock to
                  which it responds and the shock upon which it turns. What Redfield usefully points
                  out to us is “a fundamental powerlessness underlying the violent operations of
                  body-making.” Summing up his argument in his climactic reading, Redfield’s
                  suggests that the story of an aesthetically reformed political revolutionary is “a
                  story about the unruly critical force of aesthetic discourse, which exposes the
                  violence and incoherence it is supposed at all costs to conceal.”</p>
                  <p>Eva Geulen’s response to the essays included in this volume is both bold and
                  provocative. Drawing upon both her extensive work on modern literature and
                  aesthetics since German romanticism (<title level="m">The End of Art: Readings in
                     a Rumor After Hegel</title> [2006]) and her comprehensive familiarity with the
                  work of Agamben (<title level="m">Giorgio Agamben zur Einführung</title> [2005]),
                  she contends that all three essays more or less explicitly defend romanticism
                  “from any biopolitical charges and suspicions” by calling on the literary
                  aesthetic, a move she takes as an indication that what is at stake for our
                  contributors is not so much biopolitics as such as it is “aesthetics by way of
                  biopolitics.” Rather than opening up new lines of inquiry, the appearance of
                  theoretical accounts of biopolitics provides the occasion to redraw, however
                  contingently, the lines defending the literary aesthetic. In view of her earlier
                  observation that all three essays tend to “use [the term] biopolitics in such a
                  way that it encompasses disciplinary strategies while the [the regulatory aspect
                  of biopower] is eclipsed entirely,” we might read Geulen’s concession that there
                  nonetheless might be “no better, more interesting or specific way of considering
                  the question of romanticism and biopolitics” than by way of aesthetics to bear
                  witness to the difficulty of conceiving the relation of literature to a form of
                  politics that targets the biological life of a population rather than, say, the
                  psychic life of an individual subject. </p>
                  <p>It is perhaps for this reason that Geulen’s discussion turns to and remains
                  focused on Agamben’s account of sovereignty and bare life. On her reading, the
                  concept of sovereignty provides a critical, if tenuous, opening onto the relation
                  of biopolitics and literature. Indeed, it is as if the intersection of Agamben’s
                  claim that sovereign power is always already biopower with the well known
                  romantic-era conception of the sovereignty of art (cf. Beiser, Menke) itself forms
                  the nexus of biopolitics and aesthetic theory. Yet contrary to the readings
                  offered by Guyer, Redfield, and Sun, Geulen suggests that aesthetics does not as
                  much mark an aesthetic resistance to biopolitics as it paradoxically participates
                  in and furthers biopolitical violence. Following Agamben’s critique of
                  deconstruction in <title level="m">Homo Sacer</title>, Geulen argues that merely
                  identifying and recognizing moments of textual ambivalence and rhetorical
                  undecidability—which Guyer and Redfield, more so than Sun, cast as signs of a
                  literary-aesthetic resistance to biopolitics—does little to resist, let alone
                  change, the effectivity of the biopolitical structure. </p>
                  <p>Geulen’s skepticism stems from her agreement with Agamben that what is ultimately
                  at stake in biopolitics is the question of relationality. Drawing on his
                  discussion of <foreign>forma-di-vita</foreign>, Geulen insists that the challenge
                  to biopolitics, as well as the promise of the literary aesthetic, lies in thinking
                  the nexus of life and law otherwise than in terms of a relation, since the form of
                  relation as such always already “succumb[s] to the logic of the ban which … is the
                  most extreme, most tenuous, hence most powerful form of all possible relations.”
                  If any attempt to ‘relate’ aesthetics and politics runs the danger of being
                  co-opted by biopolitics, the alternative she proposes at the close of her essay
                  curiously bypasses both the question of Romanticism and that of aesthetics’
                  complicity with biopolitics. Through a reading of Lukacs’ <title level="m">Theory
                     of the Novel</title> as a “site where the question of form and life is played
                  out exclusively as a problem of aesthetic form,” and thus also as a test of
                  Agamben’s “enigmatic idea of non-relationality,” Geulen takes issue with the idea
                  that one can “draw the line between aesthetic forms and politics,” (which, since
                  it presupposes their relation, would be to remain caught up in the logic of the
                  sovereign ban). What emerges from her reading is the account of the novel as “a
                  form of life in which no bare life can be separated, whose law is life and whose
                  life is its law,” with the consequence that “[t]here is no politics of the novel
                  and there can never be one, neither biopolitical nor sovereign.” In the novelistic
                  beyond of relation, then, and at an indistinct remove from Romanticism, the
                  question of politics loses its force, and the novel comes to be “not about art but
                  about life.” But if we are unable to decide whether this is a triumph of art or
                  the evacuation of its critical force, what Geulen’s turn to modernism’s quest to
                  “abolish or transform the distinction between art and life” <emph>does</emph>
                  suggest is that the very idea of a “form-of-life” beyond politics, even and
                  precisely in its turn away from the question of romanticism, reiterates
                  romanticism’s substitution of language for life in the very effacement of what
                  might yet be its critical legacy.</p>

                  <p>Of the narratives currently in circulation about the origin, tendencies, and
                  discontents of modernity, Michel Foucault’s account of the emergence of
                  biopolitics out of an older political model grounded in sovereignty has proved
                  particularly influential among cultural theorists and has gained further traction
                  in the wake of Giorgio Agamben’s imaginative complication of the distinction
                  between sovereign and biopolitical acts of power. Foucault, as is well known,
                  usually represents the relationship between sovereignty and biopolitics as sharply
                  contrastive and sequential. Sovereign power, which radiates from a center, is
                  “essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and ultimately life
                  itself”; biopower, which radiates from multiple, dispersed sites, works to
                  “incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it”
                     (<title level="m">History</title> 136). If sovereignty reduces to “the right to
                  take life or let live,” biopolitics unfolds as “the power to ‘make’ live and ‘let’
                  die” (<title level="m">“Society”</title> 241). Both are forms of organized
                  violence; and indeed, the biopolitical regimen of “making live and letting die”
                  has greater lethal force than its precursor: “wars were never as bloody as they
                  have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before
                  did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations” (<title level="m">History</title> 136-37). This destructive potential is the dark side of
                  biopolitics as the regulation of life: “Wars are no longer waged in the name of a
                  sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of
                  everyone; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter
                  in the name of life necessity; massacres have become vital. . . . the power to
                  expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an
                  individual’s continued existence.” Throughout this broad-brush historical account,
                  Foucault emphasizes the break distinguishing modernity from earlier eras. “If
                  genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent
                  return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised
                  at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of
                  population” (137).</p>
                  <p>Agamben’s by now well-known speculations on the origin of Western theories and
                  practices of sovereignty interlace the master tropes of sovereignty and
                  biopolitics to produce a narrative grounded more in figures of acceleration and
                  transformation than in those of rupture and contrast. According to this account,
                  which Agamben elaborates via the lurid fable of the ancient Roman figure of “homo
                  sacer”—the criminal who can be killed with impunity—sovereignty has always been an
                  archaic biopolitics. “[T]he inclusion of bare life in the political realm
                  constitutes the original—if concealed—nucleus of sovereign power. It can even be
                  said that the production of a biopolitical body is the original activity of
                  sovereign power” (6). This claim generates a perspective from which the complicity
                  between democratic and totalitarian forms of the modern state can be established
                  and renders visible shards of sovereign violence throughout the modern
                  biopolitical order; Agamben goes so far as to discover in the camp “the
                     <foreign>nomos</foreign> of modernity,” the “hidden matrix of the politics in
                  which we are still living” (75). <emph>Camp</emph> names any space in which
                  policing agents “temporarily act as sovereign,” from holding zones in airports, to
                  refugee camps, to sites of genocidal violence—any space, that is, that in some way
                  brings to manifestation an “absolute impossibility of deciding between fact and
                  law, rule and application, exception and rule” (173). Although the “sovereign,”
                  properly speaking, may have long since disappeared into the dispersed conglomerate
                  of biopolitical controls that Foucault calls “governmentality,” the biopolitical
                  order nonetheless, as Judith Butler puts it, “reanimates a spectral sovereignty
                  within the field of governmentality” (62).<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Governmentality,” Butler summarizes, “is broadly understood as a mode of
                     power concerned with the maintenance and control of bodies and persons. . . .
                     Marked by a diffuse set of strategies and tactics, governmentality gains its
                     meaning and purpose from no single source, no unified sovereign subject” (52).

                  </p>
                  <p>As my thumbnail summary also hopes to suggest, however, Agamben’s speculations do
                  not simply oppose head-on Foucault’s narrative of broad historical change. Agamben
                  accepts and builds on the Foucaultian thesis that modernity consists in the
                  management of life; and indeed, his analysis supplies at least one intriguing
                  addendum to Foucault’s account of the transformation of nineteenth-century Western
                  society. The thesis that sovereignty and biopolitics meet in the production of
                  “bare life”—the body politicized in and as quasi-biological existence: the body
                  that is born; the body that can be quite simply killed—allows Agamben to add to
                  the familiar Foucaultian list of nineteenth-century biopolitical developments
                  (sanitation reforms, population control, surveillance, sexuality, etc.) a
                  surprising supplement: the advent of human rights. Rights extended at birth are
                  rights inscribed, as it were, on the body: “Declarations of rights represent the
                  originary figure of the inscription of natural life in the juridico-political
                  order of the nation-state” (Agamben 127). Like Hannah Arendt before him, Agamben
                  notes that, since rights have historically depended for their enforcement on the
                  nation-state, the universality of human rights contracts rapidly to the emptiness
                  of “bare life” (“the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human,” as Arendt
                  puts it [300]) in the case of the stateless person. Nationalism, human rights, and
                  the refugee emerge together during the era that literary scholars call
                  romanticism; thus Agamben’s work opens for scholars of romanticism a fresh and
                  interesting line of questioning. </p>
                  <p>From this perspective the history of modern aesthetics asks to be rewritten in
                  relation both to the Foucaultian concept of biopolitics and to Agamben’s
                  modification of it. The link between aesthetics and biopolitics is easily
                  established. If we understand by modern aesthetics not a minor field of
                  specialization within philosophy but a broad discourse of acculturation and of
                  self-fashioning or <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, aesthetics visibly becomes what its
                  great modern theorists have always said it was: the name for a seemingly
                  non-coercive form of social control. This theme dominates to the point of defining
                  modern aesthetic discourse from Friedrich Schiller through Matthew Arnold, T.S.
                  Eliot, Norbert Elias, and the various tributaries of twentieth-century literary
                  and cultural criticism, including most formalisms (which rarely cut their ties to
                  the aesthetic-pedagogical dream of reshaping subjects) and the cultural criticism
                  of the present day (which, paradoxically and erroneously, often imagines itself to
                  be achieving critical distance on this tradition by calling it an
                     “ideology”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For a fuller account, see my <title level="m">Politics of Aesthetics</title> (2003), especially chapter 1; for a
                     study focused more specifically on the idea of <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, see
                     my <title level="m">Phantom Formations</title> (1996).</note> Terry Eagleton
                  helpfully updates this Schillerian theme by transposing it into an idiom closer to
                  that of Foucault: <quote>The ultimate binding force of the bourgeois social order,
                     in contrast to the coercive apparatus of absolutism, will be habits, pieties,
                     sentiments and affections. And this is equivalent to saying that power in such
                     an order has been <emph>aestheticized</emph>. It is at one with the body’s
                     spontaneous impulses, entwined with sensibility and the affections, lived out
                     in unreflective custom. (20)</quote> Eagleton’s concept of “the body,” as I
                  have commented elsewhere, may be a little simplistic, and his representation of
                  the causal efficacy of aesthetic discourse may be somewhat idealized (at times in
                  his survey he runs the risk of seeming to suggest that treatises on the beautiful
                  are magically capable, more or less on their own, of “refashioning the human
                  subject from the inside, informing its subtlest affections and bodily responses
                  with this law which is not a law” [42-43]). <note place="foot" resp="editors">For my
                     critique of Eagleton’s figure of the body as plenitude, see <title level="m">The Politics of Aesthetics</title>, 80-81). For a refreshingly skeptical
                     account of German cameralism that stresses the gap between theory and reality,
                     see Wakefield’s <title level="m">The Disordered Police State</title>
                     (2009).</note> But the notion that aesthetics forms an integral part of the
                  broad web of modern discourses, institutions, and practices responsible for the
                  production of docile bodies cannot but seem inherently plausible, for biopolitics
                  is precisely what the aesthetic, particularly in its modern form, has always
                  claimed to be. <note place="foot" resp="editors">On the training of the modern body, see
                     esp. Foucault’s chapter <title level="a">Docile Bodies</title> in <title level="m">Discipline and Punish</title> (1977), and compare Norbert Elias,

                  <p>Aesthetic education as Schillerian <foreign>Bildung</foreign> has also frequently
                  been cast as a temporizing and temporalizing response to the revolutionary
                  affirmation of the declaration of the rights of man by the Assemblée Nationale in
                  1789. Eagleton’s catalogue of Burkean virtues (“habits, pieties, sentiments, and
                  affections”) lists normativizing practices of socialization that shape subjects
                  over time and in local contexts. Rights, in contrast, make their claim with the
                  universalizing and impersonal immediacy of a law. The complexity of the history,
                  politics, and concept of human rights—of a right to have rights—cannot be properly
                  addressed here; <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For an exemplary collection of recent
                     work in the field, see the collection <title level="m">And Justice for All? The

                     (2004).</note> but the clashing temporalities of rights and aesthetics turn out
                  to relay a tension internal to aesthetic pedagogy itself in texts by Friedrich
                  Schiller and J. W. von Goethe that frame aesthetic education as a response to the
                  French Revolution and <foreign>les droits de l’homme</foreign>. The specific
                  problematic of human rights engages these texts only sporadically; the more
                  general question, however, of the “inscription of natural life in the
                  juridico-political order,” as Agamben puts it, turns out to be a recurrent motif.
                  Unlike Agamben’s, however, Schiller’s and Goethe’s texts represent the inscription
                  of life into law as a process dependent on a movement of iterability, a figural
                  and figuring violence, that composes and exceeds the temporality that sustains
                  both aesthetic organicism and sovereign decisionism. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                     limitations of Agamben’s study become particularly visible in its reiterated
                     affirmation of the equation between “language” and “sovereignty”: e.g.:
                     “Language is the sovereign who, in a permanent state of exception, declares
                     that there is nothing outside language and that language is always beyond
                     itself” (20; cf. 25, 50). Thanks to Matthias Rudolf and Alastair Hunt for
                     drawing my attention to these moments in Agamben’s monograph. </note>

                  <head>I. Schiller</head>
                  <p>With a bit of interpretive pushing, one could say that Schiller represents
                  aesthetics as a tentacle of biopolitics in <title level="m">Über die Ästhetische
                     Erziehung des Menschen</title> (<title level="m">On the Aesthetic Education of
                     Man</title> [1795, 1801]).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> As I shall be detailing in
                     a moment, Schiller’s treatise was first published in installments in his new
                     journal <title level="j">Die Horen</title>; the first nine letters appeared in
                     January, 1795; letters 10-16 followed in February, and the final eleven letters
                     were published in June. Schiller made modest revisions to the text when he
                     republished it in his <title level="m">Kleinere prosaische Schriften</title> in
                     1801. In what follows my citations of Wilkinson and Willoughby’s translation of
                     Schiller’s <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title> (1967) are referenced
                     by letter and paragraph number.</note> The political dimension of aesthetics
                  resides not simply in its transcendence of immediate politics, but in its ability
                  to ward off the shock of revolution by preserving the animal existence of
                  humanity—the <foreign>Tierheit</foreign> that is the condition of humanity’s
                  humanity, <foreign>die Bedingung seiner Menschheit</foreign> (3.3)—while the moral
                  existence of humanity is being formed. The aesthetic is to serve as the “support”
                  and “sensuous pledge” that will “ensure the continuance of society” as humanity
                  passes from a natural to a moral state (3.4). Aesthetic form mediates the moral
                  law’s impact upon the social body, thereby cushions the fragmenting force of
                  revolutionary change. The artwork (<foreign>die schöne Kunst</foreign>) is the
                  instrument (<foreign>Werkzeug</foreign>) of humanity’s historical transformation
                  (9.2). “In vain will you assail their precepts, in vain condemn their practice;
                  but on their leisure hours you can try your shaping hand” (“<foreign>Ihre Maximen
                     wirst du umsonst bestürmen, ihre Taten umsonst verdammen, aber an ihrem
                     Müssiggang kannst du deine bildende Hand versuchen</foreign>”; 9.7). It is not
                  a developed theme; but in embryo here (to pursue the organic metaphor) we have the
                  biopolitical strategy: immerse subjects in a sea of minute disciplinary practices,
                  shape them quietly, invisibly, when they are at work but above all when they are
                  consuming “leisure” (“<foreign>Müssiggang</foreign>”: idleness,
                     <foreign>otium</foreign>), without argument, or sovereign decree, or
                  spectacular acts of violence. Meanwhile—though here, to be sure, it is only the
                  barest hint—the figure of a “shaping hand” suggests an aftershadow of sovereign
                  force within this biopolitical process.</p>
                  <p>Of course the production of docile bodies is not the announced intent of aesthetic
                  culture—quite the opposite: Schiller, though anxious about the French Revolution,
                  writes as a champion of Kantian Enlightenment. But a reading of the <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title> along the lines sketched above is a fair
                  one if our guiding context is Foucault’s narrative of a transition from early
                  modern forms of sovereignty to late modern instantiations of biopower. It would be
                  wrong, however, to claim that Schiller is oblivious to the potential for violence
                  concealed within the aesthetic image of a non-violent synthesis between bodies and
                  the law. Though the artwork seemingly exemplifies this synthesis, and is the
                  instrument both of historical continuity and historical transformation, Schiller
                  draws attention to the difference between material and political artworks in a
                  famous passage: <quote>When the artisan lays hands upon the formless mass in order
                     to shape it to his own ends, he has no scruple in doing it violence; for the
                     natural material he is working merits no respect in itself, and his concern is
                     not with the whole for the sake of its parts, but with the parts for the sake
                     of the whole. When the artist lays hands upon the same mass, he has just as
                     little scruple in doing it violence; but he avoids showing it. For the material
                     he is handling he has not a whit more respect than has the artisan; but the eye
                     which would seek to protect the freedom of the material he will endeavor to
                     deceive by a show of yielding to this latter. With the pedagogic and the
                     political artist, for whom humanity is at once his material and his task,
                     things are very different. Here the end turns back into the material, and it is
                     only because the whole serves the parts that the parts should submit to the
                     whole. The statesman-artist must approach his material with a quite different
                     kind of respect from that which the artist feigns toward his, and must accord
                     consideration to its uniqueness and individuality not merely subjectively, so
                     as to create an illusory effect for the senses, but objectively, for the sake
                     of its inner being. </quote>
                     <quote>[<foreign>Wenn der mechanische Künstler seine Hand an die gestaltlose Masse
                        legt, um ihr die Form seiner Zwecke zu geben, so trägt er kein Bedenken, ihr
                        Gewalt anzutun; denn die Natur, die er bearbeitet, verdient für sich selbst
                        keine Achtung, und es liegt ihm nicht an dem Ganzen um der Teile willen,
                        sondern an den Teilen um des Ganzen willen. Wenn der schöne Kunstler seine
                        Hand an die nämliche Masse legt, so trägt er ebenso wenig Bedenken, ihr
                        Gewalt anzutun, nur vermeidet er, sie zu weigen. Den Stoff, den er
                        bearbeitet, respektiert er nicht im geringsten mehr als der mechanische
                        Künstler; aber das Auge, welches die Freiheit dieses Stoffes in Schutz
                        nimmt, wird er durch eine scheinbare Nachgiebigkeit gegen denselben zu
                        täuschen suchen. Ganz anders verhält es sich mit dem pädagogischen und
                        politischen Künstler, der den Menschen zugleich zu seinem Material und zu
                        seiner Aufgabe macht. Hier kehrt der Zweck in den Stoff zurück, und nur weil
                        das Ganze den Teilen dient, dürfen sich die Teile dem Ganzen fügen. Mit
                        einer ganzen andern Achtung, als diejenige ist, die der schöne Künstler
                        gegen seine Materie vorgibt, muss der Staatskünstler sich der seinigen
                        nahen, und nicht bloss subjektiv und für einen täuschenden Effekt in den
                        Sinnen, sondern objektiv und für das innere Wesen muss er ihrer
                        Eigentümlichkeit und Persönlichkeit schonen.</foreign>]</quote>
                     <quote>(4.4, translation slightly modified)</quote> The paradox flickering into
                  view here is that Schiller’s analogy between the politician and the artist itself
                  repeats the duplicity ascribed here to the latter. The artisan (<foreign>der
                     mechanische Künstler</foreign>) does violence to his materials and does not
                  care; the artist (<foreign>der schöne Künstler</foreign>) does violence to his
                  materials but conceals this violence; the politico-pedagogical artist or
                  statesman-artist (<foreign>der pädagogische und politische Künstler</foreign> or
                     <foreign>Staatskünstler</foreign>), however, should <emph>not</emph> do
                  violence to his materials—but precisely to the extent that the politician has
                  become a politico-pedagogical <emph>artist</emph>, the distinction between the
                  politician’s respect and the artist’s concealment of violence threatens to devolve
                  into another way of concealing violence. Thus a violence that ought to belong
                  strictly to art, not aesthetic politics, begins to spread throughout the <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title>. To the extent that the artwork forms the
                  matrix of this descriptive and prescriptive system, the politico-pedagogical
                  artist risks deforming his artwork in the very act of forming it—and, worse,
                  disguising this deformation as freedom, human dignity, and all the other
                  master-tropes of aesthetic pedagogy. Thus aesthetics itself becomes the site of a
                  certain autoimmune disorder within the body of aesthetic education: a place from
                  which violence and deceit (the deceit of violence as non-violence) promises to
                  spread through the text.</p>
                  <p>That is not Schiller’s official theme, of course; but a careful reading would
                  uncover various traces of the instability haunting the figure of art-as-life and
                  life-as-art in the <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title>. Hints of this
                  instability can even be detected in the framing contexts of the text. Consider
                  Schiller’s advertisement, published on 10 December 1794, for <title level="j">Die
                     Horen</title>, the ambitious cultural journal in which the <title level="m">Letters on Aesthetic Education</title> were first published. Schiller had
                  contracted with the Tübingen publisher J. F. Cotta to edit this new journal, which
                  had as its ambition nothing less than the creation—the aesthetic shaping—of a
                  national literary public. The journal was to unite Germany’s intellectual talent
                  and publish philosophical, historical, and literary texts aimed at the general
                  cultivated reader. The diversity of its genres and topics was to submit to one
                  overall restriction: discussions of anything related to established religion and
                  the political constitution was forbidden, as was discussion of “the favorite topic
                  of the day” (“Lieblingsthema des Tages”), that is, the French Revolution
                  (“Ankündigung” 870).<note place="foot" resp="editors">A few subsequent references to the
                     “Ankündigung” will be cited by volume and page number in the body of the text.
                     Here and elsewhere, unless otherwise noted, translations are mine.</note> In
                  his advertisement, Schiller explains that the new journal takes its name from the
                  three Horae, Eunomia (“good legislation”), Dike (“justice”), and Irene (“peace”),
                  who personify agrarian temporal order (the times, the seasons, “the rhythm of the
                  sun”). “Legend makes them the daughters of Themis and Zeus, of Law and Power; of
                  the very law that rules over the change of seasons in the corporeal world, and
                  preserves harmony in the world of the spirit” (5: 871). Furthermore, in the
                  variant of the myth that Schiller expounds (his source is one of the Homeric Hymns
                  to Aphrodite), <quote>It was the Horae who received the newborn Venus at her first
                     appearance in Cyprus, clad her in divine garments, and thus brought her,
                     adorned by their hands, into the circle of the immortals: a charming story,
                     through which it is signified that already at its birth Beauty must submit to
                     rules, and only through lawfulness can become worthy of maintaining a place in
                     Olympus, immortality, and a moral value. </quote>
                     <quote>[<foreign>Die Horen war es, welche die neugeborene Venus bei ihrer ersten
                        Erscheinung in Cypern empfingen, sie mit göttlichen Gewanden bekleideten und

                        eine reizende Dichtung, durch welche angedeuted wird, daß das Schöne schon
                        in seiner Geburt sich unter Regeln fügen muß und nur durch Gesetzmäßigkeit
                        würdig werden kann, einen Platz im Olymp, Unsterblichkeit und einen
                        moralischen Wert zu erhalten</foreign>.] (5: 871-71)</quote> This version of
                  one of the most tenacious figures of the aesthetic—the aesthetic as Venus
                  veiled—hints at a certain violence marking the intersection of body and law.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This is not the place to embark on an enumeration—let alone
                     a sustained reading—of Schiller’s various appeals to the “feminine” as the
                     privileged figure of aesthetic figuration; let Hegel’s comment in his <title level="m">Aesthetics</title> suffice: “he makes the praise of women his
                     particular subject matter, since in their character he recognized and
                     emphasized just that present-in-itself unification of the spiritual and the
                     natural [that constitutes the beautiful]” (Hegel, 91). My most sustained
                     attempt to write on the vast topic of aesthetics, gender, and the figure of
                     Venus is to be found in the fourth chapter of my <title level="m">Politics of
                        Aesthetics</title>, which reads Friedrich Schlegel’s novel <title level="m">Lucinde</title> in concert with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe’s ambitious essay
                        <title level="a">The Unpresentable.</title> Lacoue-Labarthe, analyzing some
                     passages in Hegel, argues that “between woman and art, the ‘symbolic’
                     equivalence, or the analogy, is rigorous and strong,” and that the figure of
                     Venus figures “the ‘truth’ of figure and the fictional” in Hegel and in Western
                     aesthetics (136, 155). I offer a critique of Lacoue-Labarthe’s brilliant but,
                     it seems to me, overhastily essentializing argument in <title level="m">Politics of Aesthetics</title>, 128-33.</note> This feminized body never
                  quite unites with the law that clothes it (it <emph>submits</emph> to rules—and
                     <emph>must</emph> submit to them: “<foreign>sich fügen muß</foreign>”), even
                  though we are being teased by the possibility that this aesthetic body does not
                  exist <emph>as</emph> body prior to its inscription by law (“already at its birth
                  Beauty must submit to rules”: according to that logic, Venus, even newborn, is
                  never quite unclothed). The aesthetic both veils and uncovers a body-making
                  violence at the origin of biopolitics. </p>
                  <p>If then, taking our cue from Agamben, we speak of a certain “sovereign” violence
                  being allegorized here, we uncover a tricky overlap between the states of
                  exception and of harmonious free play in which sovereignty and post-Kantian
                  aesthetics, respectively, manifest themselves. The sovereign decision, at once
                  “outside and inside the juridical order” (<title level="m">Homo Sacer</title> 15),
                  exceeds yet sustains law, much as Zeus exceeds and sustains Themis in Schiller’s
                  allegory. Aesthetic judgment, a seemingly much gentler
                  personification—sovereignty’s dutiful daughter—claims to act freely yet lawfully.
                  Aesthetic judgment would thus be a harmonious state of exception, a sovereign
                  decision taken without violence—yet just as the trickery of the artist is exposed
                  in the text that theorizes his exemplarity, so reflective judgment, reflecting on
                  itself, tells the story of a certain law-like force at work in the
                  coming-to-figuration of aesthetics. This force, furthermore, turns out to be hard
                  to locate in the topography of these scenes: on the one hand it seems to come from
                  “outside” the aesthetic phenomenon per se (coming from the artist, shaping his
                  art; from the Horae, clothing Beauty in the garments of the law); on the other
                  hand it seems to emerge “inside” aesthetic theory, as a force that aesthetics
                  seems obliged to represent as part of its narrative of its own origins. Aesthetic
                  theory thus tells the story of an insight that coexists with blindness, and of a
                  power—the artist’s power to conceal—that comes into existence thanks to a double
                  movement of revelation and concealment that the artist as sovereign demiurge
                  cannot master. For because the artist cannot control the repetition and potential
                  exposure (in, say, a treatise on aesthetic education) of a violence he imagines
                  himself (as shaping, violence-concealing artist) to be controlling, the
                  sovereignty of the artist becomes, within the terms of the text, a legible
                  delusion. All the more illusory, therefore, the sovereign willfulness of the
                     <foreign>pädagogische und politische Künstler</foreign>, who, modeling himself
                  on the artist, needs all the more desperately to conceal (or justify or
                  mythologize) the violence he does to his fellow human beings. These compulsively
                  reiterated acts of sovereignty, in other words, never know quite what they do nor
                  why. </p>
                  <p>Of course such political allegories, which inevitably appear when aesthetic
                  discourse reflects on its own origins and its own purchase on the world, should
                  not be taken at face value. We are, after all, dealing here with personifications,
                  not persons; with figures, not bodies; and why should we believe what aesthetic
                  discourse says about itself, anyway? Who would want to trust a trickster,
                  particularly when he (or she) claims to be exposing the sleight-of-hand for which,
                  as lovers of beauty, we are also supposed to fall every time? Yet precisely
                  because it reflects on figuration and iterability in reflecting on itself, a text
                  like the <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title> exposes sovereign
                  biopolitical body-making violence to the possibility of an irreducibly erratic,
                  non-end-directed movement of figure-making. The echo is faint; but if we strain
                  our ears we hear murmuring within the story of Beauty submitting to law the
                  counterplot of a law producing and gripping a body without quite knowing what it
                  is doing. Writing and erasing its story of the harmony of law and freedom,
                  aesthetics endlessly invokes and exorcises and reinvokes the specter of a freedom
                  or force—the “or” here marking an essential undecidability—that might
                     <emph>not</emph> reduce to law and to the sovereign decision that refers
                  exception back to law. This spectral freedom or force can be represented in
                  various ways: as blindness; as iterability; as singularity in excess of rule; as
                  desire or death-drive; as the absolute yet absolutely uninsurable right to
                  something more than “rights”; as an openness to the impact of revolution,
                  revelation, origin, death, event, miracle, catastrophe, history—the many names of
                  a potentiality in excess of positive existence, irreducible to a will to
                     power.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Among the various texts shadowing my thinking

                  aesthetic discourse in modern life derives from its uncertainly utopian promise to
                  display traces of a force that sovereigns commandeer, but cannot properly

                  my first task is to provide enough plot summary and contextual information to make
                  an interpretation communicable. In form Goethe’s text pays homage, at least to
                  some extent, to Bocaccio’s <title level="m">Decameron</title>. The
                  frame-narrative, set in 1792-93, and particularly in the spring of 1793 during the
                  siege of Mainz (which Goethe had witnessed, as I shall review in a moment), tells
                  the story of a noble German family headed by a gentle matriarch, the Baroness,
                  displaced by the war with France and then partly restored to its Rhine holdings by
                  the Prussian advance. By the time the story has really begun, these “refugees” are
                  in fact not really refugees at all, since they have reoccupied their property on
                  the east side of the Rhine, and can expect to recover possessions on the other
                  side when Mainz capitulates. They are at home yet not quite at home; borders are
                  shifting, the times are changing. As I hope to be able to indicate even within the
                  limits of a brief study, <title level="m">Unterhaltungen deutscher
                     Ausgewanderten</title> (hereinafter short-titled as <title level="m">Conversations</title>) is fundamentally—that is, not just in its range of
                  topical reference, but in its dominant figurative patterns—a text preoccupied by
                  war, revolution, and modernity. Until Goethe wrote and published his memoirs
                     <title level="m">Campagne in Frankreich 1792</title> and <title level="m">Belagerung von Mainz</title> (<title level="m">Siege of Mainz</title>) some
                  thirty years after the fact (they were written in 1820-22 and published in 1822),
                  the <title level="m">Conversations</title> may be said to be the text in his
                  oeuvre most obviously inspired by his grueling experiences at the beginning of the
                  revolutionary wars. Before continuing my summary of the plot of the <title level="m">Conversations</title>, therefore, let me offer a summary of the
                  campaigns of 1792-93, up through the siege that forms the backdrop for Goethe’s
                  narrative. </p>
                  <p>With the announced intention of restoring Louis XVI even at the cost of razing
                  Paris to the ground, an Austro-Prussian army commanded by the Duke of Brunswick
                  and King Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia crossed into France on August 19, 1792. Duke
                  Carl August, who was an officer in the Prussian army, contributed troops from
                  Weimar, and Goethe, at the duke’s request, accompanied his patron. Longwy and
                  Verdun were captured easily; but the French general Dumouriez maneuvered to
                  confine the invaders to the inhospitable terrain of the Argonne, through which the
                  allied army advanced slowly, hampered by unrelenting rain and insufficient
                  supplies. At Valmy, Brunswick found himself boxed in by a numerically inferior but
                  tactically well-positioned enemy possessed of an outstanding gunnery corps. After
                  an inconclusive artillery exchange on September 20, the “cannonade of Valmy” ended
                  in an Austro-Prussian retreat. Fewer than two hundred allied soldiers were killed
                  in the bombardment itself, but during the retreat the army endured losses in the
                  tens of thousands. The weather continued terrible, to the point that soldiers sank
                  in mud to their waists; dysentery was pandemic; the supply train broke down, and
                  men and horses starved. A minor battle in itself, Valmy was later recognized as a
                  turning point in the revolutionary wars: a moment when the French Revolution was
                  saved. In his memoir of the campaign, Goethe famously (and somewhat improbably)
                  claimed to have achieved and expressed this insight on the night following the
                  cannonade: “‘From this time and this place a new epoch is beginning, and you will
                  be able to say that you were there’” (10: 235/5:652).</p>
                  <p>The French then counterattacked, occupying Mainz and Frankfurt—Goethe’s natal
                  city—in late October. Prussia retook Frankfurt in December. On March 18, Mainz, in
                  the control of a local Jacobin club, proclaimed itself a republic; and at the end
                  of March an ascendant Prussian army surrounded Mainz. The blockade became a siege,
                  and bombardment began on the night of June 17, 1793. Goethe, having spent a few
                  months back home in Weimar, rejoined Carl August and witnessed the city’s
                  destruction. Mainz burned for five weeks, and capitulated on July 23. Over the
                  course of the siege, the city’s cathedral, library, churches, palaces, theater,
                  and custom-house were reduced to rubble. Tourists came from Frankfurt to watch the
                  fireworks. Thirty years later Goethe wrote of the “terrible spectacle” of Mainz, a
                  city he had visited and admired before the war, burning at night under shellfire:
                  “the bombs seemed to vie with the heavenly lights, and there were moments when it
                  was really impossible to distinguish between the two. The ascending and descending
                  of the incendiary bombs was something new to us....” (10:375/5:757). He went on to
                  recall that two of his talented companions, the English painter Charles Gore, and
                  the director of the drawing academy at Weimar, Georg Kraus, “treated this event
                  artistically and made so many sketches of fires that they were later able to
                  produce a translucent model of the night scene; the model still exists, and when
                  well illuminated it is capable of conveying, better than any number of words, the
                  representation of an unfortunate, burning major city of the fatherland”
                  (10:375/5:757-58). </p>
                  <p>I cite these remarks because they relay a blend of voyeuristic aestheticism and
                  unease that has certain equivalents in the text we shall be considering.
                  Fascinated though he is by the satanic glitter of bombs vying with stars, Goethe’s
                  persona remains touched by—overvulnerable to—the sublime vista, and never quite
                  settles comfortably into the slot of spectator <foreign>ab extra</foreign> before
                  it. Instead, proxies are generated who produce a “model” of this “unfortunate,
                  burning major city of the fatherland”: a gesture that doubtless serves as an
                  avatar of a coming spectatorial media culture, yet also hints at a compulsive,
                  Shandean reenactment of an experience that relays the shock of an event that is
                     <emph>historical</emph> insofar as it outstrips sensory and cognitive
                     processing.<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Since later in this essay I am going to
                     be considering news and newspapers, it is worth noting in passing that, in
                     Sterne’s <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title>, Uncle Toby and Corporal
                     Trim, having built their model fortifications on Uncle Toby’s bowling-green,
                     reenact battles from the wars of the Spanish Succession as they are reported in
                     the newspaper: “regulating their approaches and attacks, by the accounts my
                     uncle Toby received from the daily papers—they went on, during the whole siege,
                     step by step with the allies” (Sterne, 313 [vol. VI, ch. 22]). Readers of the
                     novel will recall that Toby’s model-building responds to his inability to tell
                     the story of the wound to his groin that he received at the siege of Namur (see
                     vol. II, ch. 1, and passim).</note> Goethe’s story of his

                  to have been able to experience—to perceive, process, and recognize—the historical
                  event as such. His story about watching Mainz burn is less brash, and the story he
                  wrote some thirty years previously—twenty-odd months after Valmy, about twelve
                  months after Mainz—is cagier still. A sense of everything solid melting into air
                  characterizes the opening lines of the <title level="m">Conversations</title>,
                  spoken by a narrator agitated enough to hint at anal rape as he describes the
                  French army violating both the body of the fatherland and the piety due to
                  fathers: <quote>In those unhappy days that brought such sad consequences to

                     properties in that region and fled over the Rhine, in order to escape the
                     afflictions threatening all distinguished persons, who were treated as
                     criminals because they remembered their fathers with joy and respect, and who
                     enjoyed many advantages that any right-thinking father would want to provide
                     for his children and descendants. (10:15)</quote>

                  from Valmy, when Custine’s army poured through Landau (the “ill-kept gap”) to
                  capture Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and Frankfurt. The world has been turned so
                  upside-down that, when first absorbing the trauma that makes her a refugee, the
                  Baroness’s eldest daughter loses self-control to the point of entering “a sort of
                  complete absent-mindedness [<foreign>Abwesenheit</foreign>]”, in which state she
                  mistakes “an old servant for her fiancé” (126/16). The Baroness and her entourage
                  are thus grappling not just with the age-old horrors of war, but with the
                  fragmenting force of a political struggle that affects both
                     <foreign>polis</foreign> and <foreign>oikos</foreign>, endangering
                  relationships between master and servant, parent and child. For within the family,
                  as within Mainz (and, for that matter, within “Germany, Europe, and the rest of
                  the world”), internal differences are generating conflict. Cousin Karl has allowed
                  himself to be “seduced by that blinding beauty [<foreign>blendenden
                     Schönheit</foreign>] who under the name of Freedom had known how to acquire so
                  many admirers, first secretly and then openly” (127/16). A fervent supporter of
                  the French Revolution, he gets into such violent arguments with the
                     <foreign>Geheimrat</foreign> (“Privy Councillor”), a conservative friend of the
                  family, that the latter leaves in anger (“exiled a second time, and this time
                  through a countryman” [134/21]), taking with him his wife, who is the childhood
                  friend of the Baroness. Karl repents of having caused his aunt pain; and the
                  Baroness, after excoriating the damage done by the male desire for sovereignty
                     (<foreign>Herrschaft</foreign>), prohibits all conversation having to do with
                  the “interest of the day” (“<foreign>Interesse des Tages</foreign>”; 139/24)—a
                  version of the prohibition we saw Schiller propounding in the prospectus for
                     <title level="m">Die Horen</title> against the “favorite topic of the day”
                     (“<foreign>Lieblingsthema des Tages</foreign>”). Her command has no more
                  performative felicity than Schiller’s (when she goes to bed, the group—like the
                     <title level="m">Conversations</title> itself and, for that matter, the <title level="m">Aesthetic Education</title> itself—continues to discuss the news and
                  rumors of the day). But the family members agree to tell and listen to stories
                  that, nominally, will have no connection to current events. </p>
                  <p>The seven stories told make up a curious bouquet. Only the final two are, strictly
                  speaking, original to Goethe: the first is a supernatural story from an
                  eighteenth-century French source; the second is a ghost story that was circulating
                  orally in Weimar in Goethe’s day; the third and fourth are translations of tales
                  by the seventeenth-century French writer François de Bassompierre; the fifth is a
                  story from a popular, much-republished Renaissance collection, <title level="m">Cent Nouvelles nouvelles</title>; the sixth, <title level="a">The Story of
                     Ferdinand’s Guilt and Reformation,</title> is original to Goethe; and the
                  seventh, which breaks the frame of the frame-narrative and ends the text, is
                  Goethe’s famous <title level="a">Fairy Tale,</title> a richly enigmatic text that
                  has often been studied in isolation from the <title level="m">Conversations</title>. It is little wonder that Schiller and the journal’s
                  first readers felt some disappointment, even frustration, when they read Goethe’s
                  contribution. The <title level="m">Conversations</title> exemplify one of the many
                  ways in which Goethe is a far more interesting writer than the marmoreal image of
                  him as the mainstay of the classical German literary canon would suggest. No less
                  than such famously difficult works as <title level="m">Wilhelm Meisters
                     Wanderjahre</title>, <title level="m">Faust II</title>, and the late poetry,
                  the <title level="m">Conversations</title> is an experimental text, and a shrewd
                  and disturbing one. It is not just <emph>about</emph> liminal conditions, border
                  crossings, and ambiguous states of warfare, homelessness and exception; it
                  welcomes foreign bodies into itself. It reveals that conversation
                     (<foreign>Unterhaltung</foreign>) destroys itself in becoming a form of
                  socio-aesthetic support (<foreign>Unterhalt</foreign>). And in doing so, the text
                  stages and deconstructs the sovereign violence entwined with the biopolitics of an
                  aesthetic education. Often dismissed as a <foreign>Nebenwerk</foreign> to Goethe’s
                  more serious work, <title level="m">Unterhaltungen deutscher
                     Ausgewanderten</title> is a highly ambiguous instance of light literature
                     (<foreign>Unterhaltungsliteratur</foreign>), to say the least.</p>
                  <p>Let us look again, and this time a little more closely at the Baroness’s command
                  that the community renounce political conversation—which is to say, political
                  strife, for when Karl and the <foreign>Geheimrat</foreign> reach the climax of
                  their argument, they are exchanging death threats (the
                     <foreign>Geheimrat</foreign> hopes to see the collaborationists in Mainz
                  hanged; Karl, losing all control, desires that “the guillotine would reap a rich
                  harvest in Germany too” [133/20]). Newly politicized and imbued with revolutionary
                  and counterrevolutionary violence, conversation must now undergo a new process of
                  de-politicization. The Baroness proposes that under her gentle, matriarchal
                  leadership, both the phallic brutality of the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> and
                  the anarchy of revolution will be overcome. “‘Come here, children!’ called the
                  Baroness. ‘We have had a serious discussion, one that, I hope, will restore to us
                  peace and unity, and once more bring us the manners [<foreign>den guten
                     Ton</foreign>] that we have lacked for awhile’” (139/24). <foreign>Der gute
                     Ton</foreign>: the Baroness proposes this old-regime Franco-Germanic
                  expression, a literal translation of <foreign>bon ton</foreign>, as the figure for
                  an aesthetic culture that will trump the French Revolution and restore old-world
                  manners, yet without violence, without manifestations of male
                     <foreign>Herrschaft</foreign>. Though she imagines herself to be proposing a
                  return to the old ways (138/23), the Baroness is offering something closer to
                  Schiller than to Castiglione. Her new maternal, aesthetic state will unite law and
                  freedom. “I do not like to give orders,” the Baroness states; rather, she will
                  provide a piece of advice (<foreign>einen Rat</foreign>) and a request
                     (<foreign>eine Bitte</foreign>). “And,” replies one of her auditors, “both
                  shall be an unbreakable law [<foreign>ein unverbrüchliches Gesetz</foreign>] for
                  us” (137/23). The law is that of conversation as good tone: the company is to
                  converse pleasantly, <foreign>sich angenehm unterhalten</foreign>, and to tell
                  stories that engage the imagination in harmony with reason and understanding. In
                  and through this aesthetico-politico-linguistic law, a newly aesthetic community
                  is to emerge: a storytelling community that begins by hearing ghost stories (while
                  the Baroness is in bed, since they are beneath her dignity) and progresses toward
                  the heights of the <title level="a">Fairy Tale.</title> Many critical analyses of
                  the <title level="m">Conversations</title> have interpreted the text as narrating
                  the arc of such a communal aesthetic <foreign>Bildung</foreign>, though more
                  common in recent years has been a skeptical approach, in which the <title level="m">Conversations</title> is read as an ironization of Schiller’s program
                  of aesthetic education.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For an important study in this

                        deutschen Ausgewanderten</title>; his main argument is that Goethe
                     represents the emigrants as failing to respond in a disinterested, Kantian
                     fashion to the tales they hear. See also Ulrich Gaier, <title level="a">Soziale

                  The present interpretation belongs, broadly speaking, to the second camp, but with
                  the proviso that Schiller’s writings on aesthetics, as we have seen, are
                  themselves haunted by half-acknowledged instabilities. Goethe exacerbates those
                  instabilities in the <title level="m">Conversations</title> in several ways, and
                  perhaps above all by extending, elaborating, and exploding the figure of the law
                  of aesthetic conversation and community, <foreign>guter Ton</foreign>. In passing
                  from custom to law-without-law—in passing, that is, from being the tacit watchword
                  of <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> courtliness to being the figurative, seemingly
                  non-coercive, “maternal” law of modern aesthetic acculturation—<foreign>guter
                     Ton</foreign> figures the arrival of a biopolitical era of discipline and
                  rights. This new community of refugees—refugees restored to their property, but
                  forever exposed to future deracinations and displacements—is built on aesthetic
                  citizenship as the right to speak and to be listened to without fundamental
                  political consequence (a right that unfolds in and as the dialectical tension
                  between, on the one hand, high aesthetic disinterestedness—the right of literature
                  or art to say <emph>anything</emph>—and on the other hand, that great modern
                  aggressively passive middle-class prerogative: the right to be entertained).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For some brief but far-reaching speculations on literature

                  its context the political and technical dislocations of modernity: a plague that
                  cannot be kept outside the city walls. Predictably, <foreign>guter Ton</foreign>,
                  a figure that etymologically reiterates the French invasion that it sets out to
                  cure, generates echoes of war, revolution, and sovereign or pseudo-sovereign
                     violence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">The German word <foreign>Ton</foreign> (as
                     sound, noise, accent, tone, etc.) returns to older Germanic forms
                        <foreign>don</foreign> or <foreign>ton</foreign> (melody, song, sound,
                     noise), and ultimately to the Latin <foreign>tonus</foreign> and Greek
                        <foreign>tonos</foreign> (tension, cord, string). The English word
                        <emph>din</emph> comes from the same source (as does the English word
                        <emph>tone</emph>, of course). (German has another meaning for
                        <foreign>Ton</foreign>, “clay,” but that is by way of a different
                     etymology.) My authority here is the <title level="m">Etymologisches Wörterbuch
                        des Deutschen, Q-Z</title> (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1989).
                        <foreign>Ton</foreign> as sound or tone has as much claim as any other
                     Latino-German word to be deeply and traditionally “German.” Yet it shades into
                     the other languages being spoken by the major European powers in the 1790s. In
                     the context we are examining, its tone is being disturbed by the French word
                     from the same etymological background, <foreign>ton</foreign>, as activated by
                     the French aristocratic marker <foreign>bon ton</foreign>, stamping the German
                        <foreign>calque guter Ton</foreign>. <foreign>Ton</foreign> and
                        <foreign>ton</foreign> are (almost) cross-linguistic honomyms (the
                     capitalization of nouns in German marks a tiny difference); they are pronounced
                     a little differently in German and French, but they have an audible kinship.
                     All of this makes this word a rich resource for a text interested in
                     representing war and revolution by way of representations of familial violence.
                     The authoritative study of the figure of <foreign>Ton</foreign> and

                     Menke, <title level="m">Prosopopoiia</title>. Although Menke discussses Goethe
                     only in passing, her powerful readings of texts by Brentano, Hoffmann, Kleist,
                     Kafka, and many other writers underscore both the importance and the rhetorical
                     instability of the figure of <foreign>Ton</foreign> within this
                     tradition.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the frame narrative and in the two ghost stories, disruptive noises and shocks
                  inscribe and disfigure the figure of <foreign>Ton</foreign> (a word that not only
                  translates the English word “tone,” but also has as one of its principal meanings
                  “sound” or “noise”). The opening sentence, with the French army breaking in, sets
                  the tone; and a page or two later, when the refugees return to their right-bank
                  estate, their ontological vulnerability becomes encoded as a tonal disturbance:
                  “Unfortunately their joy in the enchanting area was often disturbed by the thunder
                  of cannon [<foreign>Donner der Kanonen</foreign>], which was heard more or less
                  distinctly in the distance as the wind shifted. No less could political discussion
                  be avoided, with the many in-streaming news items of the day
                     [<foreign>zuströmenden Neuigkeiten des Tages</foreign>]” (130/18). At home but
                  never enough at home, these refugees are enduring what Mary Favret has described
                  as the everyday peace of wartime in late-eighteenth-century Europe; their ears are
                  cocked to the sounds of “a history not entirely possessed” (605).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Favret’s references are to British texts and contexts, but
                     her account of romanticism as marked by the low-grade trauma of distant war is
                     certainly relevant here.</note> In her scrupulous reading of eighteenth-century
                  British georgic poetry, Kevis Goodman disinters a symptom akin to the one we
                  encounter here: “the figure of ‘noise,’ non-ideational sound experienced as
                  sensuous unpleasure” functioning as “the noise of history, or, more accurately,
                  the presentness of ongoing history beyond lived experience or phenomenological
                  verification” (63, 64). One of the contextual frames for Goodman’s study is the
                  newspaper as a figurative “limit of conversability” (87); consistent with this
                  pattern, Goethe’s text encourages associations between the sound of cannon-fire
                  destroying Mainz and the invasion of news items, <emph>Neuigkeiten</emph>, about
                  Mainz (and more broadly about the “topic of the day. At one point the old family
                  priest (<foreign>der Geistliche</foreign>, <foreign>der Alte</foreign>: an
                  authority figure who will tell the most important of the text’s stories) comments
                  that a drive for novelty (<foreign>etwas Neues</foreign>) is more exciting than
                  serious subjects; novelty (<foreign>die Neuheit</foreign>) gives incidents a
                  dangerous charm that depends neither on internal coherence
                     (<foreign>Zusammenhang</foreign>) or on self-sufficiency (141/25). As Andreas
                  Gailus has pointed out, the text thus encourages an opposition between “sociable
                  speech” and “the plague of revolutionary news” (453). Yet the Baroness’s attempt
                  to revive the former by banning the latter is undermined by spectral disturbances
                  afflicting the figure of sociable speech, <foreign>guter Ton</foreign>, itself. In
                  the first story told, the <title level="a">Story of the Singer Antonelli,</title>
                  the singer’s jilted lover returns from the dead to haunt her in the form of a
                  “violent, fearful sound” (“<foreign>gewaltsame, fürchterliche Ton</foreign>”;
                  152/33). This sound appears variously as a voice (<foreign>Stimme</foreign>) or
                  cry (<foreign>Schrei</foreign>), but also as a shot (<foreign>Schuß</foreign>).
                  Lingering in ears and limbs, it threatens to disarticulate the body. It is
                  “penetrating” (“<foreign>durchdringend</foreign>”; 152/33), appearing between
                  walls, between lovers, crossing borders between insides and outsides, and bringing
                  with it a little death: in one instance, when “the shot penetrated through the
                  carriage,” the women inside are lifted out, taken for dead (155/35). Finally the
                  mysterious noise is successfully aestheticized; it changes into “more pleasant
                  sounds [<foreign>angenehmer Töne</foreign>] . . . not actually melodious, but
                  unbelievably pleasant and delightful. . . . It was as if a heavenly spirit wanted
                  to draw attention by a beautiful prelude to a melody he was just about to perform”
                  (156/35). </p>
                  <p>The phenomenon being sublimated, however, is aptly described by Gailus as a
                  “trauma of communicative desire” (467).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> Gailus comments
                     that “the terrifying nature of the sounds is intimately connected to their
                     communicative character….The sounds are not simply physical phenomena but
                     communications—that is, messages addressed to Antonelli and calling for a
                     reply—and they terrify her not because they are untraceable in origin but
                     because they are unfathomable in meaning” (467). Gailus’s essay contributes
                     richly to the long tradition of understanding the <title level="m">Conversations</title> as a crucial text in the development of the modern
                     German <foreign>Novelle</foreign>. He argues persuasively that all the tales
                     told in the <emph>Conversations</emph> (except for the <title level="a">Fairy
                        Tale,</title> which falls outside the purview of his study) “are built
                     around an incomprehensible kernel” (466), and that this circling around a
                     trauma or secret characterizes the modern novella.</note> The haunting
                     <foreign>Ton</foreign> strikes its hearers with near-deadly force because it
                  renders undecidable the difference between meaningful speech and sheer noise. It
                  is a little like cannon-thunder and a little like news (news so new or so
                  uncannily mediated that it cannot be assimilated without stress); and this
                  “likeness” has to do not, finally, with any phenomenal characteristic that can be
                  perceived as such, but with the threat of difference and dislocation that all
                  these phenomena convey. If the strange sounds in the Antonelli story sometimes
                  resemble the sounds of the cannonballs that nearly killed Goethe at Verdun and
                  Valmy, as he was to describe them three decades later (“suddenly there was a
                  fierce, whistling-crashing sound [<foreign>grimmige, pfeifend-schmetternde
                     Ton</foreign>] behind me”), what this means is not that a fictional image has
                  been traced back to a real-life experience, but rather that haunting, like
                  cannon-fever, is being represented as a form of shock.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Goethe’s memoir is in any case no unmediated act of memory. It was written so
                     long after the fact that he had to rely heavily on maps, documents, and other
                     people’s journals: see Trunz, <title level="a">Nachwort,</title> 10:661ff.
                        <title level="m">Campagne in Frankreich 1792</title> dwells repeatedly on
                     the fascinations and horrors of modern artillery bombardment. Goethe had his
                     first real taste of war at Verdun, where he nearly lost his life to a
                     cannonball (this is the passage to which I alluded above): “suddenly there was
                     a fierce, whistling, crashing sound [<foreign>grimmige, pfeifend-schmetternde
                        Ton</foreign>] behind me so that I turned around immediately, without being
                     able to say whether this about-face had been caused by the sound
                        [<foreign>Ton</foreign>], the rushing air, or an inner, psychic, moral
                     stimulus” (10: 209/5:633). In his account of the battle of Valmy, the scene in
                     which Goethe stages his famous line about the “new epoch” is preceded by an
                     almost equally famous scene in which he tempts the gods of war. “I had heard a
                     lot about cannon fever and wanted to find out exactly what it was like. . . . I
                     had now reached the area where the cannon balls were landing; the sound
                        [<foreign>Ton</foreign>] is strange enough, as though composed of the hum of
                     a top, the bubbling of water, and the whistling of a bird. . . . I could soon
                     tell that something unusual was happening inside me” (233-34/651-52).</note> I
                  draw here, of course, on Walter Benjamin’s classic account of the shock experience
                  as humanity’s historical encounter with the various phenomena we sum up as
                  modernity, and above all with the dislocating force of technical reproducibility.
                  Benjamin offers various examples of the shock experience: the reading of
                  newspapers; the sterile repetitiveness of unskilled factory work; contact with the
                  urban crowd; gambling and amusement park “fun”; photography; cinema; the ticking
                  of quantifiable, capitalizable clock-time. Shock is an effect of mediation rather
                  than simply of physical violence, though physical or literal battering is usually
                  a possibility—sometimes overwhelmingly so, as in the middle of a battle or (to
                  return to our text) as in the second story told in the <title level="m">Conversations</title>, <title level="a">The Story of the Mysterious
                     Knocking,</title> in which a fourteen-year-old servant girl suddenly begins to
                  be accompanied around a nobleman’s house by knocking sounds (which are also
                  described as irregular blows, <foreign>Schläge</foreign>). The nobleman conquers
                  this figurative irruption of female sexuality and revolutionary violence by
                  threatening a simpler and more terrible violence: “He took his largest hunting
                  whip down from the wall and swore to beat the life out of the girl if the knocking
                  were ever heard again. From that time on she went all over the house without a
                  tap, and no further knocking was heard” (158/36).<note place="foot" resp="editors">All the
                     stories in the <title level="m">Conversations</title> dramatize in some way or
                     other the threat of ungovernable female sexuality. Luise’s mistaking a servant
                     for her fiancé hints at an association between political and sexual trouble.
                     The “mysterious knockings” begin when the servant girl reaches puberty and
                     begins to attract admirers. Other stories feature sexually active women who
                     cause trouble and endure various sorts of punishment: the singer Antonelli, who
                     casts off her lover and refuses to see him on his deathbed (which is why,
                     presumably, his ghost returns as the uncanny <foreign>Ton</foreign>); and three
                     central female characters in three stories that I do not discuss in this essay:
                     the beautiful grocer and the penitent adulteress in the two (very short)
                     Bassompierre stories; the would-be adulteress in the “story of the Procurator”
                     from <foreign>Cent nouvelles nouvelles</foreign>. Among these figures of
                     threatening women there are a few dark doubles of the Baroness as gentle
                     matriarch: the singer Antonelli; Ferdinand’s castrating mother in <title level="a">The Story of Ferdinand’s Guilt and Reformation</title> (to be
                     discussed below); even the Beautiful Lily in <title level="a">The Fairy
                        Tale,</title> whose glance and touch are deadly prior to the fairy-tale
                     world’s redemption. Given the thematic and figurative link in the <title level="m">Conversations</title> between fatherhood and social order, these
                     figures of unruly women form a visible part of the threat of revolution.</note>
                  The violence of male <emph>Herrschaft</emph> returns endlessly; but the shock to
                  which it responds is always split, redoubled, iterative, impossible to pin down
                  spatially or temporally. The “news” of the French Revolution disrupts the peace of
                  the <foreign>ancien régime</foreign> not just because it is unheard of, but
                  because the hearing of it takes place in multiple places and times thanks to the
                  disseminating work of what we now call media. The “limit of conversability” that
                  Goodman traces in eighteenth-century georgic comes melodramatically into view as
                  the news of revolution as language as noise as technical proliferation. Such
                  “noise” is the shout of a crowd that is not simply present to itself: a shout
                  that, in Thomas Carlyle’s famous image, “prolongs itself not only over Paris, but
                  over France, but over Europe, and down to this generation.”<note place="foot" resp="editors">

                        globally communicated shout recurs frequently in writing about the
                        Revolution, particularly in the Anglo-American tradition, indebted as it is
                        to Carlyle. Here is an early twentieth-century example: “‘The Bastille has
                        fallen!’ was the glorious news that greeted the ear of humanity the world
                        over….There is force, tremendous force, in the shout of an incensed and
                        infuriated mob…. Who would have thought that this mighty fortress, bristling
                        with cannon, rock-ribbed from turret to foundation stone, fortified,
                        garrisoned, supplied with stores and ammunition sufficient to have withstood
                        the siege and assault of an army, would have fallen so quickly before the
                        shout of the multitude. It was not besieged by an army of disciplined
                        soldiers, but by a mob without order, organization or leadership. ‘And it
                        shall come to pass . . . that the people shall shout with a great shout and
                        the walls of the city shall fall down flat.’ As before the walls of Jericho,
                        so it was before the walls of the Bastile” (Warwick 272-73).</p>
                        <p rend="noCount">The allusion to Joshua 6:5 reminds us of the ancient roots of
                        the figure of the destructive shout, found in the Hellenic tradition as,
                        e.g., the shout of Pan that saves Olympus from the Titans; the war-cry of
                        Akhilleus; etc. Alala, the personification of the war cry in Greek
                        mythology, is daughter of Polemos and attendant to Ares (god of the war cry:
                           <foreign>alalaxios</foreign>). Her name can also mean a loud cry or
                        noise, and overlaps with <foreign>alalos</foreign>, “speechless, dumb,”
                           <foreign>alalaô</foreign>, “make dumb,” etc.; ancient etymologies have
                        her name deriving from the terrifying cry of the owl.</p>

                     <foreign>Ton</foreign> is Goethe’s deceptively modest figure for aesthetics as a
                  discourse animated by the historical event as the experience of shock. </p>
                  <p>After the first two stories noises and knockings become less prominent in the text
                  of the <title level="m">Conversations</title>, but not before migrating from the
                  embedded stories to the frame narrative itself. Just as the second ghost story has
                  ended and the company is discussing the difficulty of uncovering the true
                  causality of supernatural events, and just as the wise old Abbé has asked (for
                  Goethe is having his fun), “Is it, after all, so easy to detect a conjuror’s
                  tricks, even though we know he is deluding us?”, tonal shock recurs: “He had
                  barely finished speaking when a very loud crack [<foreign>Knall</foreign>] was
                  suddenly heard in the corner of the room. Everyone jumped . . .” (159/37). The
                  curved top of a writing-desk standing in the corner has split completely across
                     (<foreign>quer völlig durchgerissen</foreign>). “They had found the source of
                  the sound; nevertheless it seemed remarkable that this desk, which was an example
                  of Röntgen’s best workmanship and which had been standing for several years on the
                  same spot, should have chanced to split at just this moment” (159/37). The
                  emigrants measure the environment with barometer and thermometer, and regret they
                  have no hygrometer (“‘It seems,’ remarked the old man, ‘that we are always missing
                  the most necessary instruments when we want to experiment on spirits’”
                     [160/38]).<note place="foot" resp="editors"> A hygrometer measures relative dampness.
                     For a discussion of this scene attentive to the use of these instruments in the
                     context of late eighteenth-century theories of mesmeric fluid, see Niekerk
                     84.</note> Having been informed that a fire is burning in the district, they
                  consult a belvedere and locate the fire at their aunt’s estate; Friedrich, the
                  Baroness’s son, recalls that the aunt possesses “a similar, indeed, one might say,
                  identical desk…made with extreme care at the same time, from the same piece of
                  wood, by the same craftsman” (160-61/38). Perhaps the writing-desk has split in
                  sympathy with its burning twin. Friedrich, by this time a character nearly as
                  obsessive-compulsive as the narrator of Wordsworth’s <title level="a">The
                     Thorn,</title> has the refugees record the exact time when they heard the noise
                     (<foreign>Klang</foreign>). Later, near the end of the frame narrative—right
                  before the <title level="a">Fairy Tale,</title> which breaks the frame and ends
                  the text—with the Baroness in attendance, the problem of the split writing desk
                  returns: Friedrich has visited the aunt’s estate, and returns “cheerful, even
                  though he had just come from scenes of misery and devastation” (208/69). The
                  ravaging of family property is as nothing compared to the satisfaction of
                  establishing motivated connections among events and signs. The twin writing desk
                  had indeed burned, and a clock that stood on the desk had had its works broken
                  just as it was being saved, confirming that the aunt’s desk burned just as the
                  Baroness’s desk suffered its violent cracks (<foreign>heftige Sprünge</foreign>)
                  (208/69). This blizzard of coincidences fails to overcome the Humean skepticism of
                  one of the emigrants (“just because two events occurred simultaneously, one cannot
                  be sure of their connection [<foreign>Zusammenhang</foreign>]”)—though as the Abbé
                  had pointed out earlier, knowing about a conjuring trick does not necessarily keep
                  it from working.</p>
                  <p>Splitting and redoubling the writing desk, Goethe allegorizes his own text’s role
                  in the dissemination of shock in and as the aesthetic of <foreign>gutem
                     Ton</foreign>, which is to say the aesthetico-pedagogical project of <title level="m">Die Horen</title>. He has also, of course, written into the frame
                  narrative a surrogate for the siege of Mainz. The aunt’s ravaged estate, the
                  burning desk and its cracking twin form a figurative complex that, gathered around
                  the figure of <foreign>Ton</foreign>, relay a violence that is
                     <emph>historical</emph> both in its excess over sensory apprehension or
                  cognitive comprehension, and in the claim it makes on spectators who cannot
                  properly measure their distance. A full reading of the <title level="m">Conversations</title> would need to trace the aftershocks of the aesthetic
                  through all of this text’s embedded tales; here, I can only consider briefly the
                  story in which the political stakes of aesthetic education receive their fullest
                  elaboration, the “story of Ferdinand’s guilt and reformation.” As it happens, the
                  damaged writing-desk returns in this narrative.</p>
                  <p>Ferdinand, the son of a well-off but careless businessman, discovers, through a
                  strange accident (<foreign>sonderbarer Zufall</foreign>), that the lock of his
                  father’s desk is defective, and the top will fly up if the desk is given a
                  side-blow (<foreign>Seitenstoß</foreign>). The desk contains money that the father
                  is in the habit of grabbing without counting to satisfy his pleasures; Ferdinand,
                  in a domestic parody of revolution, steals from his father to support his own
                  impulsive passions. (The parody is sharply drawn: Ferdinand chafes against
                  parental restrictions in the idiom of <foreign>les droits de l’homme</foreign>:
                  “And with what right [<foreign>mit welchem Rechte</foreign>] do they have to do
                  it? And how did they get this right [<foreign>Und wie sind sie zu diesem Rechte
                     gelangt</foreign>]? Should it depend on chance alone, and can there be a right
                     [<foreign>Recht</foreign>] where chance is at work?” [192/58].) After stealing
                  for awhile, Ferdinand repents and secretly pays back the money (unlike his father,
                  who never notices the thefts, Ferdinand knows how to count and has kept track of
                  what he owes); alas, his mother, stepping in to supplement the paternal role, has
                  found out his crime, and suspects him of taking gold ducats that in fact he did
                  not take. Threatened by his furious mother with legal persecution and public
                  exposure, Ferdinand despairs; he prays to his <foreign>Vater im Himmel</foreign>
                  (203/66), and is rewarded with an immediate act of providence: his mother, now
                  cheerful, enters the room to tell him that, miraculously, the missing ducats have
                  just then been found (the father had forgotten he had given them to his cashier
                  for safekeeping). Ferdinand, having thoroughly submitted to paternal law by
                  acceding to a guilt that outstrips his literal transgression, goes on to found a
                  business and a family of his own in a different part of Germany (most of the
                  characters in the <title level="m">Conversations</title>, unsurprisingly, are
                  exiles or emigrant of some sort). For our purposes the most interesting part of
                  the story comes when the Abbé (who is telling the story and who claims to have
                  known Ferdinand in later life) describes what sort of <foreign>pater
                     familias</foreign> Ferdinand becomes. Anyone who imagines that Goethe is
                  incapable of subjecting his great theme of renunciation
                     (<foreign>Entsagung</foreign>) to astringent parody has not read this story to
                  the end: <quote>He told me his story himself, and as it happens with people to
                     whom something significant has happened in early years, this story had
                     impressed itself so deeply on him that it had a deep influence on his life.
                     Even as a husband and a father he often took it upon himself to deny himself
                     something that would have given him pleasure, simply in order not to get out of
                     practice of such an admirable virtue, and his entire principle of education
                     was, so to speak, that his children must, off the cuff as it were, be able to
                     deny themselves something.</quote>
                     <quote>In a way that I at first could not approve, he would, for instance, at
                     dinner forbid one of the boys to eat a favorite food. To my surprise the boy
                     remained cheerful, and it was as if nothing special had happened.</quote>
                     <quote>And so the eldest children, on their own initiative, often used to allow a
                     special piece of fruit or some such delicacy to pass; and yet he allowed them,
                     I would almost say, everything, and there was no lack of good and bad behavior
                     in his house. He seemed indifferent to everything and allowed them almost
                     unbridled freedom, except that once a week he would get the notion that
                     everything had to happen to the minute. Then first thing in the mornings the
                     clocks would be synchronized, everyone got his orders for the day, chores and
                     amusements were piled up, and no one was allowed to miss a second.

                  in Goethe’s work), and as we know, the violence with which the political and

                  Ferdinand’s household, Goethe suggests, is one version of what an
                  aesthetico-bio-political state in which law and freedom coincide would look
                  like—an obsessive-compulsive nightmare. The Baroness, who immediately draws the
                  larger political parallel, is mad enough (or desperate enough) to approve of this
                  crazed aesthetic polis: “The Baroness made a few comments, and confessed that this
                  friend [Ferdinand] on the whole was probably right, for in a kingdom, too,
                  everything depended on the executive power [<foreign>exekutive Gewalt</foreign>];
                  the legislative power could be as rational as it liked, it would avail the state
                  nothing if the executive [<foreign>ausführende</foreign>] power were not strong”
                  (208/69). But sovereignty reduced to sheer will-power becomes nothing more than a
                  spasmodic effort to convince itself of its own existence. Ferdinand’s impulsive
                  negations and compulsive bouts of temporal ordering relay and refigure the shock
                  of a body- and subject-making power that cannot underwrite or understand
                  itself.</p>
                  <p>We may take this story as a little allegory about the degradation and dispersal of
                  sovereign power within a biopolitical regime, or (which is perhaps not so very
                  different) as a little allegory about the violence of aesthetic politics. Either
                  way, it is also a story about the unruly critical force of aesthetic discourse,
                  which exposes the violence and incoherence it is supposed at all costs to conceal.
                  Let me close with a small clutch of images drawn from near the end of the <title level="a">Fairy Tale</title> the appendix-text that ruptures the body of the
                     <title level="m">Conversations</title>. The Abbé offers the <title level="m">Fairy Tale</title> as a story of pure imagination: “imagination itself cannot
                  demand, it must await what is given it. It makes no plans, chooses no path, but
                  instead it is borne and led by its own wings; and as it swings back and forth it
                  traces the strangest courses, which constantly shift and change direction”
                  (209/70). This strange, intriguing text does indeed often give one the sense of a
                  world controlled by slightly mad laws that proliferate unpredictably and
                  dizzyingly: in the opening paragraphs alone we encounter will-o’-the-wisps who
                  feed on gold; a snake that feeds on gold; a river that will rise up to swallow
                  anyone who tosses gold into it; a lamp that turns rock to gold (but timber to
                  silver and dead animals to gems)—and on and on. The tale has a redemptive arc (at
                  the end “all debts are paid”) and closes with a king restored to his throne; yet
                  it also closes with a weird regicidal image. Over the course of the story we meet
                  four living statues of kings (as distinct from the human king): one of gold, one
                  of silver, one of bronze, and one of a mixture of metals; and this last statue,
                  the mongrel “fourth king,” suffers a fate worse than the guillotine when, near the
                  end of the <title level="m">Fairy Tale,</title> his veins of gold are licked out
                  of him by the will-o-the-wisps, causing him to collapse into himself formlessly
                     (<foreign>unförmlich zusammengesunken</foreign>): <quote>But when at last even
                     the most delicate veins were consumed, the statue suddenly collapsed,
                     unfortunately at just those places that hold their shape when one sits down;
                     whereas the joints, which ought to have bent, remained stiff. There was no
                     choice but to laugh or to look away; this middle-thing between form and lump
                     was a hideous sight. (89)</quote>
                     <quote>[<foreign>Als aber auch zuletzt die zartesten Äderchen aufgezehrt waren,

                        sich hätten biegen sollen, steif. Wer nicht lachen konnte, mußte seine Augen
                        weg wenden; das Mittelding zwischen Form und Klumpen war widerwärtig
                        anzusehen</foreign>.] (237)</quote> This comic, slightly obscene figure of a
                  king disfigured, collapsing as he attempts the royal act of sitting down, is then
                  concealed under “a magnificent covering that no eye could penetrate and no hand
                  dared remove” (241/91). As a “middle-thing between form and lump” (237/89), his
                  deformed body offers a visual equivalent of the uncanny <foreign>Ton</foreign> (a
                  middle-thing between speech and noise) in the Antonelli story. Both of these
                  tropes figuratively register an uncertainty afflicting the secure establishment of
                  figure, body, or meaning. The image (or, better, anti-image) of the disfigured
                  king hints at a fundamental powerlessness underlying the violent operations of
                  body-making. We may hypothesize that this deformed, material lump of sovereignty
                  constitutes, for aesthetics, the repressed truth of sovereign and biopolitical
                  violence. Alternatively, we could think of it as, aesthetically speaking, a
                  metamorphic lump of history.</p>
                  <p>What remains of the sovereign? A certain residue, to be sure. Ghostly to begin
                  with, sovereignty disperses, degrades, and returns as its own attenuated figure. I
                  mentioned earlier that at the end of the <title level="a">Fairy Tale</title> a
                  king has been restored; at the very end of the tale we are told that he leaves the
                  temple (where the obscene remains of the “fourth king” lie covered) to go off to
                  his palace by “hidden passageways” while “the people dispersed through the temple
                  to satisfy their curiosity” (241/91). In a quasi-fairy-tale spirit, let us
                  conclude with the observation that this king has no clothes. At best he is a
                  chastened, post-revolutionary king, scurrying to his secure location; but we might
                  just as well think of him simply as a minor celebrity, pursued by paparazzi and
                  running for cover—a sliver of pseudo-sovereignty within a biopolitical order or,
                  indeed, within a debased aesthetic state turned entertainment center. The
                  temple-exploring <foreign>Volk</foreign> resembles a fan base or a tour group here
                  far more than it does a people subject to a monarch. And indeed, in the final
                  sentences of the text, government becomes sheer population control, and the fairy
                  kingdom a theme park, the cynosure of a world-wide tourist industry: <quote>
                        <p rend="noCount">The people would never have tired of looking and marveling,
                        and the pressing crowd would have crushed itself inside the temple, had its

                        <p rend="noCount">Unexpectedly gold coins were falling, as if from the air,
                        ringing on the marble pavement, the closest travelers rushed to seize them.
                        This miracle was repeated intermittently, now here, now there. It is easy to
                        conceive that the departing will-o’-the-wisps were at it again and merrily
                        squandering the gold from the limbs of the collapsed king. Greedily people
                        continued to run about for awhile, jostling and fretting even when the gold
                        coins stopped falling. At last they gradually dispersed, set out on their
                        journeys, and to this day the bridge teems with travelers, and the temple is
                        the most frequented in the entire world. (92)</p>

                     </quote> A hint of revolutionary energy flickers, perhaps, in the violent shoving
                  with which the <foreign>Volk</foreign> (as crowd, <foreign>Menge</foreign>)
                  threatens to destroy itself, though the dominant impression is that of a crowd
                  that needs for its own safety to be manipulated from above. Certainly a touch of
                  sovereign violence—a last an echo, within the context of the
                     <foreign>Märchen</foreign>’s frame-story, of the bombs that have been falling
                  on Mainz—is displaying itself as the manna-money that briefly trickles down from
                  heaven as a crowd control device. As the gold pieces ring
                     (<foreign>klingend</foreign>) on the pavement, one hears as well a last echo of
                  the <foreign>Ton</foreign> that has been spurring and disrupting narrative and
                  meaning, while doubling and undermining sovereign force, in this text. It is of
                  course no accident that the will-o’-the-wisps are miming divine power—the mythic
                  yet also, of course, emphatically modern, militarized power to deliver death and
                  life from the sky—by excreting gold sucked from royal veins. Their manna carries
                  the faint whiff of the blood of a beheaded monarch, even as it testifies to the
                  survival of a certain mobile form of sovereignty in an era of population control
                  and mass entertainment. The residue of sovereignty in the biopolitical order is
                  reducible neither to sovereign-state intentionalism nor economic rationalism. If
                  the <emph>Irrlichter</emph> parody God and king, they also parody any
                     <foreign>Aufklärung</foreign> that would enthrone reason in the place of the
                  divine. They are only half-present anyway, in the concluding paragraph of this
                  strange and prescient fairy tale: they enter and leave it not as entities directly
                  described, but as a narrator’s directive (“<foreign>Man begreift
                  wohl...</foreign>”), and as the putative causal adjunct of the disappearing gold
                     (“<foreign>da keine Goldstücke mehr herabfielen</foreign>”). The gold,
                  vaporizing into sheer motion, may be said to be turning into capital, while the
                     <foreign>Irrlichter</foreign>, the will-o’-the-wisps, at this point may be
                  taken as parodies of “power” in Foucault’s sense. They disappear into a
                  mass-in-movement—a multitude rather than a chosen people, caught up not in a
                  divinely directed exodus, but rather in an <foreign>Auswanderung</foreign> as a
                  dispersal or getting-lost (“<foreign>verlief...sich</foreign>”) that vacillates
                  between intentional movement (“<foreign>zog seine Straße</foreign>”: the
                     <foreign>Volk</foreign> takes its path, sets out on its journey) and swarming
                  excess (“<foreign>wimmelt die Brücke von Wanderen</foreign>”: the bridge teems
                  with travellers). Power, if we extrapolate from these images, has no center; we
                  are dealing rather with multiple and mobile centering-effects: markets and profit
                  mechanisms; localities with pseudo-religious (if never quite simply “secular”)
                  auratic privilege (“<foreign>der Tempel ist der besuchteste auf der ganzen
                     Erde</foreign>”). If one personifies power, one comes up with nothing more than
                     <foreign>Irrlichter</foreign>: the lightning-flashes of sovereign violence
                  within the biopolitical order. And in performing this personification, Goethe’s
                  text performs yet another dislocation of sovereignty as a coherent and
                  self-sufficient instance. The twin <foreign>Irrlichter</foreign> figure an errant,
                  doubled and redoubled power of figuration that <foreign>n’en est pas un</foreign>:
                  a power that cannot measure, represent, coincide with, or otherwise account for
                  “its” own shaping, embodying, illuminating force.</p>
                  <p>In its final sentence Goethe’s text registers this force in another way, as a
                  disconcerting acceleration into the present tense (“<foreign>Endlich verlief es
                     sich allmählig, zog seine Straße, und bis auf den heutigen Tag wimmelt die
                     Brücke von Wanderen, und der Tempel ist der besuchteste auf der ganzen
                     Erde</foreign>”). The eerily calm speed with which Goethe often tells stories
                  has been a defining characteristic of the <foreign>Unterhaltungen</foreign>
                  throughout this text’s many voices and genres; this final, uncanny acceleration,
                  which breaks the frame of the frame-narrative, reads as a last affirmation of an
                  imaginative power that exceeds sovereign control. Imagination, “<foreign>von ihren
                     eigenen Flügeln getragen und geführt</foreign>,” would then no longer be the
                  expression of an author-father’s will and identity, but rather a name for
                  literature’s ability to open onto something else. That disruptive aesthetic
                  movement underwrites yet also exceeds the discourse of aesthetic education as
                  biopower.</p>

                  <p>The famous distinction John Stuart Mill makes in his 1833 essay, <title level="a">What is Poetry?</title>—between eloquence as "heard" and poetry as
                     "<emph>over</emph>heard"—is subtended by a theatrical metaphor whereby the
                  young political philosopher attempts to reimagine, in aesthetic terms, the
                  organization of the nation. In making the distinction, Mill contrasts two ways of
                  speaking correlative to two interlinked models of theatricality: in "nations" that
                  excel at eloquence, the citizen as actor-spectator addresses himself to the
                  "feelings of others" on whom he depends for "applause," "sympathy," and
                  "concurrence"; in "nations" that excel at poetry, the citizen turns away from
                  directly addressing the audience of his fellows to cultivate in solitude the
                  expression of private feelings the utterance of which constitutes its own end
                  (110). Mill compares the latter to “soliloquy,” with poetry in print being “a
                  soliloquy in full dress, and upon the stage” (109). Poetry, in this formulation,
                  does not simply consist of an anti-theatrical turn away from the public realm of
                  eloquent discourse but, paradoxically, inhabits and participates obliquely in this
                  realm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">What is Poetry?</title> may be said to adumbrate a theater of
                  poetic citizenship. Mill imagines citizens as actors and spectators who perceive
                  and become perceptible to one another as participants in public, communal life,
                  but he qualifies his conception of the citizen as an actor-spectator with a
                  conception of this citizen as an invisible speaker and eavesdropper. The present
                  essay aims to reconsider Mill’s political theatrical imagination in the context of
                  the genealogy of modern biopolitics and in relation to its two main influences–the
                  panopticist theater of Benthamite utilitarianism that Mill inherits and attempts
                  to revise, and the Wordsworthian strategy he adapts to formulate this revision. </p>
                  <p>In a series of letters written in 1787, Bentham presented his design of the <title level="m">Panopticon, or The Inspection-House</title>. An architectural
                  proposal aimed at the construction of penitentiaries, this design applied also to
                  workhouses, madhouses, hospitals, factories, and schools. The paradigmatic
                  building would be circular, with an inspector’s lodge at the center. Between the
                  center and the circumference would be vacant space. Around the circumference would
                  be distributed the solitary cells of prisoners, workers, or inmates, each divided
                  from the other “by <emph>partitions</emph> in the form of <emph>radii</emph>
                  issuing from the circumference towards the centre” (40). The principal advantage
                  of this plan, according to Bentham, is the “<emph>apparent omnipresence</emph> of
                  the inspector…combined with the extreme facility of his <emph>real
                  presence</emph>”; and a collateral advantage is “on the score of frugality,” for
                  the schema would require a minimum number of inspectors and administrators to
                  function (45). Bentham praises the elegance and efficiency of his own design in
                  the Preface: “<emph>Morals reformed–health preserved–industry
                     invigorated–instruction diffused–public burthens lightened–Economy seated, as
                     it were, upon a rock</emph>” (30). The panopticon, for Bentham, promotes the
                  betterment of the community insofar as it offers a greater number of members of
                  the community the power to augment their happiness.</p>
                  <p>As Foucault argues in <title level="m">Discipline and Punish</title>, the
                  panopticon is exemplary among the instruments and techniques invented in the
                  eighteenth century that accompanied the formation of a new disciplinary society
                  that wields power over subjects through relations of discipline rather than, as in
                  the previous era, relations of sovereignty. This new society organized,
                  categorized, and systematically produced subjects through such disciplinary
                  institutions as factories, schools, clinics, barracks, and prisons. Subsequently,
                  in his 1977-8 lectures, <title level="m">Security, Territory, Population</title>,
                  Foucault would turn his attention from the emergence and operations of
                  disciplinary institutions per se to the concept of “population” that in the late
                  eighteenth century made possible what he calls a new “governmentality.” Linked
                  with the spread of disciplinary institutions, the concept of “population”
                  subjected human beings to mathematization and made them the objects of statistical
                  calculability. “Population” functions as the basis for the development of
                  techniques, e.g., the Census in Britain, first taken in 1801, whereby government
                  undertakes to administer and regulate the very biological existence of its
                  citizens. The new governmentality, according to Foucault, is a
                  bio-governmentality.</p>
                  <p>In his 1978-9 lectures, <title level="m">The Birth of Biopolitics</title>,
                  Foucault advances the further claim that liberalism serves as the very framework
                  of this new bio-governmentality. Treating liberalism, construed as essentially
                  capitalist, as a development continuous with utilitarianism, Foucault discerns as
                  the “fundamental question of liberalism” the following: “What is the utility value
                  of government and all actions of government in a society where exchange determines
                  the true value of things?” (46). The new governmentality is oriented by the
                  privileging of the market as site of “veridiction,” or the determination of value,
                  and hence source of criteria for judgment. This new governmentality is “frugal”:
                  government is to be limited and evaluated according to the utility and efficiency
                  with which it administers to the needs of a population. According to this model,
                  the task of government is to take care of the necessities of life as if they
                  belonged to a sphere separate and distinct from the realm of freedom, which would
                  be located beyond governmental jurisdiction in the private sector. Where
                  government ends, freedom begins. In accordance with the logic of the market cycle,
                  this liberalist freedom is, for Foucault, a freedom to consume. “The new
                  governmental reason needs freedom, therefore, the new art of government consumes
                  freedom,” writes Foucault, “It consumes freedom, which means that it must produce
                  it…The formula of liberalism is not ‘be free.’ Liberalism formulates simply the
                  following: I am going to produce what you need to be free. I am going to see to it
                  that you are free to be free” (63). Liberalism concerns itself, then, with the
                  delimitation of government according to the usefulness and efficiency of the
                  latter’s institutions and practices in securing freedom as promise and end of
                  government.</p>
                  <p>This liberalist delimitation presents a reconfiguration of what Arendt describes
                  in <title level="m">The Human Condition</title> as the classical relationship
                  between the <foreign>polis</foreign> and the <foreign>oikos</foreign> or household
                  in ancient Greece. “The realm of the <foreign>polis</foreign>,” she writes, “was
                  the sphere of freedom,” while the household was the site where the necessities of
                  life were taken care of as the “condition for freedom of the
                     <foreign>polis</foreign>…What all Greek philosophers…took for granted is that
                  freedom is exclusively located in the political realm, that necessity is primarily
                  a prepolitical phenomenon, characteristic of the private household organization”
                  (30-1). In modern liberalism, government assumes the tasks of the
                     <foreign>oikos</foreign>, extending its activity or power into areas of life
                  previously deemed pre- or non-political. No longer the sphere of freedom, the
                     <foreign>polis</foreign> loses its hierarchical privilege and becomes conflated
                  with the household to serve the function of making its subjects, in Foucault’s
                  formulation, “free to be free”–to exercise such freedoms as “freedom of the
                  market, freedom to buy and sell, the free exercise of property rights, freedom of
                  discussion, possible freedom of expression, and so on” (63).</p>
                  <p>The market, in Foucault’s analysis, emerged as the privileged site that governs
                  and gives value to public, communal life. The conflation of the
                     <foreign>polis</foreign> and the <foreign>oikos</foreign> subordinates both to
                  the market insofar as it serves to produce and uphold the conditions for freedom
                  as, specifically, the freedom to participate in activities related to exchange and
                  consumption. Liberalism, as the framework of bio-governmentality, enables the
                  citizen to be free to act and to appear in the market as paradigmatic public space
                  that has displaced the position of the <foreign>polis</foreign> in ancient Greece.
                  This public space is not political in the classical sense but rather apolitical or
                  even anti-political. In Arendtian terms, it corresponds rather to the category of
                  the social, insofar as “[s]ociety is the form in which the fact of mutual
                  dependence for the sake of life and nothing else assumes public significance and
                  where the activities connected with sheer survival are permitted to appear in
                  public” (46).</p>
                  <p>Benthamite panopticism serves as an instrument of the liberalist utilitarian
                  framework of bio-governmentality by operating at the nexus of the governmental and
                  the social. It functions as an instrument of government and caters to the needs of
                  a population by organizing, regulating, and maximizing the efficiency of such
                  disciplinary institutions. And it performs the function of producing and
                  regulating the conditions for subjects to appear to each other in public, managing
                  the terms of perceptibility whereby subjects may exercise their freedom to
                  participate in the activities of exchange and consumption and derive value from
                  such activity. Benthamite panopticism is the principle in the eighteenth century
                  behind a bio-political dramaturgy of public, communal life. </p>
                  <p>In her invigorating reconsideration of utilitarianism and pornography as parallel
                  eighteenth-century developments, Frances Ferguson argues that the achievement of
                  Benthamite utilitarianism was to move politics away from the traditional emphasis
                  on individual beliefs, identities, and essences to the discussion of the social
                  value of actions that acquire significance and exert effects within a relativizing
                  system. In contrast to Rousseau’s notion of the social contract, which “could not
                  be connected with a sensible meaning,” Bentham’s experiments with social
                  structures, Ferguson argues, were “an effort to replace a metaphysical account of
                  the general will with a physical account of how the preferences of a group might
                  visit themselves on individuals” (15). Benthamite social structures–the classroom,
                  the workhouse, and the prison–correlate individuals with the groups in which they
                  temporarily participate. The actions of individuals are evaluated in relation to
                  the group, and the possibility of new actions likewise arises in relation to the
                  actions of one’s group or another contiguous to it. What makes the system work is
                  the high degree of perceptibility it relies on. Benthamite panopticism serves to
                  engineer “an array of systematic social practices that have made it possible for
                  us to evaluate individuals by making their actions look as though they could
                  plausibly be described in terms of their perceptibility and value in public” (xv).
                  It serves to “<emph>give social groups the means to make themselves felt by
                     individuals.</emph> Such representations…must present the artificial reason
                  that they embody in strongly perceptible terms. They must promulgate order–but,
                  more, visible order. They must create perceptibility for purely social
                  productions–hierarchy, rank order, and social evaluation” (15).</p>
                  <p>For Ferguson, Benthamite utilitarianism reconstituted public, communal life by
                  organizing individuals into highly perceptible social groups within which they may
                  move vertically and between which they may move laterally, e.g., from school to
                  hospital, in accordance with procedures of evaluation. This reconstitution of
                  public, communal life is egalitarian insofar as it gives a greater number of
                  individuals social mobility and the freedom to act and appear to others in ways
                  that are no longer determined by birth or rank. If the <foreign>polis</foreign>
                  was in ancient Greece the sphere of freedom, it functioned as such for the few,
                  whose freedom was supported by the labor and work of women and slaves, who
                  administered to the necessities of life in the private realm of the household. The
                  conflation of the <foreign>polis</foreign> and the <foreign>oikos</foreign> in
                  liberal utilitarianism achieves the result of allowing the entry of the many into
                  public, communal life. This articulation of public, communal life is constrained,
                  however, by the fluctuating criteria of the market as site of a bio-politically
                  promised and produced freedom. Ferguson’s interpretation of Benthamite
                  utilitarianism underlines how much we remain shaped by and inscribed within its
                  legacy, and how the critical effort to go beyond the version of freedom it
                  promises and produces must reckon with and acknowledge its structuring
                  efficacy.</p>
                  <p>The scaffolding of panopticism is evident throughout texts by John Stuart Mill,
                  who bears the distinction of having been pre-eminent proponent, symptomatic
                  subject, and revisionist critic of liberal utilitarianism. Trained by his father
                  from early childhood to become a “Benthamite reasoning machine,” Mill was caught
                  and inscribed like none other within the framework of utilitarian social
                  engineering (111). He gives an account of this formation in his <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, published posthumously in 1873, as well as of his
                  effort to exceed its limitations via an emphasis on poetry as “not only on a par
                  with, but the necessary condition of, any true and comprehensive Philosophy”
                  (131). I would like to revisit this account before turning to passages from <title level="a">What is Poetry?</title> and the 1859 essay <title level="m">On
                     Liberty</title> to examine more closely Mill’s interrogation of the limits of
                  bio-political subject formation.</p>
                  <p>Mill’s <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, as many readers have noted, is a
                  strangely reserved and impersonal text. In a tone at odds with expectations
                  concerning the genre, Mill writes in the prologue: “I do not for a moment imagine
                  that any part of what I have to relate, can be interesting to the public as a
                  narrative, or as being connected with myself” (6). He announces, rather, that he
                  has written the text as the story of an education. His insistent aim is to portray
                  himself as a lifelong student, his mind “equally ready to learn and to unlearn
                  either from its own thoughts or from those of others” (25). Mill addresses his
                  readers insofar as they may be interested in the topic of education in an age in
                  which “education, and its improvement, are the subject of more, if not of
                  profounder study than at any former period of English history” (25). He alludes
                  here to mid-century debates about national education in England, which led up to
                  the 1870 Education Act, presenting his story in the context of these debates to
                  justify its usefulness and interest to the reading public.</p>
                  <p>In its narrative structure, the <title level="m">Autobiography</title> follows in
                  the tradition of spiritual autobiography to take the shape of a conversion
                  narrative. The first four chapters tell of Mill’s childhood and early education,
                  and his self-education as a youth; they are dominated by the figure of his father,
                  James Mill, as his formative, initiatory teacher. Chapter V, <title level="a">A
                     Crisis in my Mental History,</title> occupies a pivotal position in the text
                  and relates “the important transformation in [his] opinions and character” that
                  took place when Mill was in his early 20s. Mill recounts falling into a serious
                  depression, and being aided in his recovery by Wordsworth’s poems, which offered
                  “a medicine for my state of mind” and would form “the occasion of my first public
                  declaration of my new way of thinking” (121-2). In the last two chapters, Mill
                  introduces Harriet Taylor Mill, his wife, as the second of his two most important
                  teachers. From her he would learn, through the mode of conversation, in a
                  substantially different style than from his father. In between , Wordsworth’s
                  poetry appears to have effected a break and transition: the reading of Wordsworth
                  made possible for Mill a displacement of his father’s model of education and
                  authority.</p>
                  <p>Bentham’s oldest collaborator, James Mill was also a close associate of Ricardo
                  and Malthus in the circles of philosophical radicalism. His reformist agenda
                  manifested itself in his own household as an experiment to educate his eldest son
                  in accordance with his idea of a reformer–to the effect that John Stuart Mill
                  recalls having in his youth the reputation of being a “‘made’ or manufactured man”
                  (126). Mill was immersed in an intense curriculum that involved beginning Greek at
                  age three, reading the whole of Herodotus, the first six dialogues of Plato, among
                  numerous other texts, before age eight, when he began studying Latin and
                  advancing, in another area, from arithmetic to Euclid and algebra. In his account
                  of his childhood, Mill notably does not mention his mother and refers to his
                  younger siblings only insofar as he was delegated the responsibility, at age
                  eight, to begin tutoring them in their studies. He was isolated from other boys
                  because his father, as he recollects, was “earnestly bent upon my escaping not
                  only the ordinary corrupting influence which boys exercise over boys, but the
                  contagion of vulgar modes of thought and feeling” (47). The education was unusual
                  and remarkable on several counts: the early age of Mill’s initiation into various
                  courses of study, the sheer voluminousness of what was prescribed for him, his
                  isolation from others, and the totalizing rigor of his analytical training. </p>
                  <p>The Mill household resembles in Mill’s description a micro-panopticist
                  institution, with his father occupying the central position of the inspector. Mill
                  recalls the ubiquitous presence of his father, noting how he himself “went through
                  the whole process of preparing my Greek lessons in the same room and at the same
                  table at which he was writing” (28). Even on morning walks with his father, Mill
                  would have no break from his schedule of study but give reports of what he had
                  read the day before. Besides being constantly monitored, he was called upon to
                  oversee his siblings by teaching them when he reached the age of eight; and his
                  siblings were asked subsequently to repeat the lessons to their father as part of
                  a two-tier evaluation process. “It was a part which I greatly disliked,” he
                  admits, “the more so, as I was held responsible for the lessons of my pupils, in
                  almost as full a sense as my own” (30-1). In relation to his father as chief
                  inspector, Mill was assigned the part of a subordinate. The household functioned
                  as a site contiguous with and structurally similar to social institutions and
                  served as a preparatory space that mediated Mill’s entry into public, communal
                  life. </p>
                  <p>This strenuous pedagogical program launched Mill on a precocious career as a
                  public advocate of utilitarianism. Writing for newspapers and organizing the
                  Utilitarian Society before age twenty, Mill thought he had before him “an object
                  in life”–“to be a reformer of the world. My conception of my own happiness was
                  entirely identified with this object” (111). He recollects, however, finding one
                  day in the autumn of 1826 the insubstantiality of this conception of happiness:
                  “the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down…I seemed to have
                  nothing left to live for” (112). </p>
                  <p>In the wake of this crisis, he found relief in reading Marmontel and Byron but
                  singles out, above all, Wordsworth’s poetry–especially <title level="m">Poems
                     1815</title>–as essential to his recovery. In describing his reading of
                  Wordsworth, Mill uses the language of didacticism, remarking that “Wordsworth
                  taught me this” (121) and writing about “the way in which he was now teaching me
                  to find it” (121). He accounts for the therapeutic efficacy of Wordsworth’s poetry
                  by pointing to the poet’s description of rural objects and natural scenery, in
                  which he himself was also wont to take pleasure. But, more importantly,
                  Wordsworth’s poems do not just express “mere outward beauty” but “states of
                  feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of beauty”
                  (121). Expressivism is not, however, the final criterion for Mill’s judgment of
                  the poetry’s therapeutic power, for “poetry of deeper and loftier feeling could
                  not have done for me at that time what his did” (121). What Mill claims he learns
                  from none other than Wordsworth is that “there was real, permanent happiness in
                  tranquil contemplation. Wordsworth taught me this, not only without turning away
                  from, but with a greatly increased interest in, the common feelings and common
                  destiny of human beings” (121). </p>
                  <p>The summation of Wordsworth’s lesson Mill finds in the <title level="a">Immortality Ode,</title> in which “I found that he too had had similar
                  experience to mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful
                  enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, and
                  found it, in the way in which he was now teaching me to find it” (122). Mill
                  accentuates here the parallelism of experience between himself and Wordsworth, who
                  in a similar mood had asked, “whither is fled the visionary gleam?,” and who Mill
                  sees as “teaching” the reader “now” a means of restoration. In Wordsworth he
                  claims to have found a fellow and a teacher whose poetic lesson relieves him from
                  the effects of his utilitarian formation. His narrative dates back to this period
                  a turn in which the “cultivation of the feelings became one of the cardinal points
                  in my ethical and philosophical creed,” and from which he would re-enter and seek
                  to re-articulate the terms and conditions governing public, communal life
                  (147).</p>
                  <p>Mill writes of his fellowship with Wordsworth in an autobiographical text that
                  shows obvious structural affinity with the latter’s poems of crisis and
                  restoration, including the <title level="a">Immortality Ode</title> and, in book
                  length, the 1850 <title level="m">Prelude</title>. Significantly, Wordsworth’s
                  narratives of crisis and restoration do not simply parallel Mill’s story but,
                  indeed, <emph>inhabit</emph> it as that which mediates Mill’s restoration. Mill’s
                  account of reading Wordsworth reverberates <foreign>passim</foreign> with
                  Wordsworthian formulations. His description of Wordsworth’s poems as expressions
                  of “states of feeling, and of thought coloured by feeling, under the excitement of
                  beauty,” echoes Wordsworth’s definition of poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of
                  powerful feelings,” and he repeats Wordsworth in his insistence on the importance
                  of “tranquil contemplation.” His claim that Wordsworth’s poems were “a source of
                  inward joy, of sympathetic and imaginative pleasure,” attest to his assimilation
                  of the language of such poems as “Tintern Abbey” and “I wandered lonely as a
                  cloud.” His very language of restoration–“Wordsworth’s poems [were] a medicine for
                  my state of mind”–and his figuration of Wordsworth as teacher redouble
                  Wordsworth’s own tropes.</p>
                  <p>The <foreign>locus classicus</foreign> of Wordsworth’s language of restoration is,
                  of course, the passage on “spots of time” in Book XII of the 1850 <title level="m">Prelude</title>, in which the poet-narrator attributes to them “a renovating
                  virtue” and the capacity for “our minds” to be thence “nourished and invisibly
                  repaired” (XII.210, 215). These “spots of time” the poet-narrator would “enshrine”
                  as “the spirit of the Past/ For future restoration” (XII.285-6). On one level, the
                  term designates memories from the poet’s past, on another, the very lyrical
                  passages that render these memories as “spectacles and sounds” strewn episodically
                  throughout the poem. The passage provides meta-poetic commentary on the formal
                  structure of <title level="m">The Prelude</title> itself, articulating the new
                  poetics the very discovery of which the poem seeks to narrate.</p>
                  <p>This discovery coincides with the poet-narrator’s resolution to write a “poetry of
                  Nature” founded on the premise that “love of Nature” leads necessarily to “love of
                  Man.” The poet aims to show how “Nature” may serve as the basis for a new claim to
                  community. The most important and, at the same time, most unstable of terms in
                  Wordsworth, “Nature” designates in the exegeses of Abrams and Hartman, the
                  uncertain relationship between sense perception and sense. It is precisely in
                  cases of the disjunction between sense perception and sense, between the
                  apprehension through the senses of the external world and the capacity of the mind
                  to make sense of the data, that “Nature” “teaches” most powerfully; and it is
                  often such disjunctions that are registered as “spots of time.” To such “spots”
                  the poet returns for future restoration as to inexhaustible because essentially
                  enigmatic sources. When he writes, “There are in <emph>our</emph> existence spots
                  of time,” Wordsworth not only implies, on an individual psychological level, that
                  everyone, like him, has spots of time in his or her own life but that his poems
                  may serve as such for the reader.</p>
                  <p>Mill assimilates to his own prose Wordsworth’s language of restoration. Where
                  Wordsworth makes “Nature” guide and source of renovation, Mill substitutes
                  “poetry.” “Poetry” as “instrument of human culture” plays in Mill’s new “ethical
                  and philosophical creed” a function analogous to “Nature” in Wordsworth’s poetry
                  (147). In making this substitution, Mill appropriates and displaces Wordsworth’s
                  reflections on his own poetry for an attempt to modify utilitarian thought by
                  aesthetic means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="a">What is Poetry?,</title> published in 1833 in conjunction with
                  the essay, <title level="a">The Two Kinds of Poetry,</title> marked Mill’s
                  earliest engagement with questions of aesthetics. While the definition of poetry
                  Mill proposes there is most often linked with Wordsworth’s lyric practice, it is
                  important to note that Mill not only does not mention Wordsworth but does not even
                  define poetry in formal or generic terms. Rather, he defines poetry as a specific
                  mode of expression or utterance that may occur outside lyric poetry proper in
                  other genres such as drama, the novel, and narrative poetry; and in other arts
                  such as music and opera, as well as painting, sculpture, and architecture. In
                  distinction to poetry, Mill contrasts narrative, simple imitation or description,
                  and, finally, eloquence or oratory, elements of which, he claims, can be found in
                  varying combination in different works of art across the multiple arts. The last
                  of these modes of speech, eloquence, Mill finds closest to poetry insofar as
                  eloquence and poetry both consist of “the expression or uttering forth of feeling”
                  (109). In contrast, narrative, for instance, is directed towards “action and
                  events,” not feeling (107). </p>
                  <p>At the climactic point of the essay, Mill writes, “eloquence is
                  <emph>heard</emph>, poetry is <emph>over</emph>heard” (107). In elaborating on
                  this distinction, he uses a theatrical metaphor, invoking in relation to these
                  modes of speech “audience” and “listener.” “Eloquence,” Mill distinguishes,
                     <quote>supposes an audience; the peculiarity of poetry appears to us to lie in
                     the poet’s utter unconsciousness of a listener. Poetry is feeling confessing
                     itself to itself, in moments of solitude, and bodying itself forth in symbols
                     which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling in the exact
                     shape in which it exists in the poet’s mind. Eloquence is feeling pouring
                     itself forth to other minds, courting their sympathy, or endeavoring to
                     influence their belief, or move them to passion or to action. (109)</quote> The
                  figure of theater comes to the fore when he claims, “All poetry is of the nature
                  of soliloquy. It may be said that poetry, which is printed on hot-pressed paper,
                  and sold at a bookseller’s shop, is a soliloquy in full dress, and upon the stage”
                  (109).</p>
                  <p>The distinction between poetry and eloquence serves in turn as the basis for a
                  theatrical articulation of the “nation” itself: <quote>The persons, and the
                     nations, who commonly excel in poetry, are those whose character and tastes
                     render them least dependent for their happiness upon the applause, or sympathy,
                     or concurrence of the world in general. Those to whom that applause, that
                     sympathy, that concurrence are most necessary, generally excel most in
                     eloquence. (110)</quote> Mill juxtaposes here two theatrically conceived
                  versions of communal life that bespeak two articulations of happiness: one in
                  which happiness consists of the opening up, through poetry, of the possibility for
                  new and unprecedented feelings, and one in which happiness consists of the
                  circulation and endorsement of feelings that have already been in circulation.</p>
                  <p>This contrast anticipates to some degree Mill’s critique of a society regulated by
                  “custom” versus a society of individualist self-expression in the essay <title level="m">On Liberty</title>. In a famous passage, Mill imagines the members of
                  a society regulated by “custom” as inhabitants of a panopticist structure. In this
                  space, <quote>from the highest class…down to the lowest, everyone lives as under
                     the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. Not only in what concerns others,
                     but in what concerns only themselves, the individual or the family do not ask
                     themselves, what do I prefer? Or, what would suit my character and disposition?
                     Or, what would allow the best and highest in me to have fair play and enable it
                     to grow and thrive? They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? What
                     is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse
                     still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstance superior
                     to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is customary in preference to what
                     suits their own inclination. It does not occur to them to have any inclination
                     except for what is customary. (88)</quote> Public, communal life is here
                  articulated in terms of a circular, tower-like construction ruled by a central and
                  elevated gaze that defines hierarchy and order. The inhabitants of this vertically
                  arranged society are all alike preoccupied with rank; whatever class they come
                  from, they are concerned alike with the actions and behavior appropriate to their
                  socio-economic circumstances and to those in the tier above them. All alike are
                  governed by what is expected of their group by “custom,” or received opinions that
                  have become unexamined criteria and grounds for action. </p>
                  <p>For its operation, “custom” depends on the central and elevated gaze, the
                  internalization of which is manifest in the questions Mill ventriloquistically has
                  the individual or the family asking themselves. These questions constitute the
                  verbal and audible complement (though the speech may take the form of inner
                  monologue) to the visibility of the individual or the family to the “eye of
                  censorship.” The individual or the family are visible not only to that central
                  gaze but to other individuals and families, of whatever rank, that are likewise
                  oriented by that gaze. It is this visibility that determines the kind of questions
                  that get asked, and it is this visibility that denies the posing of the questions
                  concerning individual preference and disposition. By implication, it might seem
                  that a certain invisibility is necessary to break the congruence between
                  exteriority and interiority–or to open up a space of interiority to begin with–and
                  to disrupt the relationship of adequation between seeing, being seen, and speaking
                  according to the dictates of “custom.” The break this invisibility would
                  facilitate involves at the same time a re-ordering of the relationship between the
                  visible and the audible corollary to a new determination of the terms of
                  perceptibility governing the relationships of subjects to one another in public,
                  communal life.</p>
                  <p>In <title level="a">What is Poetry?,</title> Mill already places emphasis on the
                  dimension of the audible over the visible in his imagination of a theatrical
                  community oriented by poetry. Both eloquence and poetry are forms of utterance,
                  but eloquence involves a continuity between the visible and the audible, while
                  poetry involves a necessary suspension of visibility: “What we have said to
                  ourselves, we may tell to others afterwards; what we have said or done in
                  solitude, we may voluntarily reproduce when we know that other eyes are upon us.
                  But no trace of consciousness that any eyes are upon us must be visible in the
                  work itself” (109). Poetry originates in invisibility, though it may be rehearsed
                  and reproduced before the eyes of others after this originating moment. Likened to
                  soliloquy, poetry is the medium of a voice that circulates beyond the regulatory
                  gaze of panopticism and has the potential to disrupt its effective operation.</p>
                  <p>As evident in the passage from <title level="m">On Liberty</title>, panopticism
                  implies a central and elevated observer around which are arrayed concentric tiers
                  of adjacent cells. The central observer is positioned so that he may see everyone,
                  but in principle anyone may occupy this interchangeable position. As Foucault
                  writes in <title level="m">Discipline and Punish</title>, “He who is subjected to
                  a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the
                  constraints of power…he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he
                  simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection”
                  (202-3). The subject, then, subjects himself by internalizing the capacity to
                  regulate himself and others. The field of visibility constructed by panopticism is
                  circumscribed, at the same time, by inherent blind spots. While the occupants of
                  the cells are positioned to perceive the inspector with whom they may in principle
                  exchange roles, and while they may see others at a distance, they remain
                  necessarily blind and invisible to those in their proximity who occupy adjacent
                  and neighboring cells.</p>
                  <p>As the medium of a voice that circulates beyond the central regulatory gaze,
                  poetry has the potential to open up alternative modes of communication within the
                  theater of panopticism and to introduce an alternative logic of subject-formation.
                  To exemplify his definition, Mill quotes from Burns’s <title level="a">My Heart’s
                     in the Highlands</title> and comments, “That song has always seemed to us like
                  the lament of a prisoner in a solitary cell, ourselves listening, unseen, in the
                  next” (111). Such eavesdropping has the effect of de-centering and disorienting
                  the listener away from the regulatory gaze and toward, instead, the song of the
                  neighbor, in relation to whom he is neither superior nor subordinate but peer and
                  fellow subject. The subjection that thus takes place is at odds with the logic of
                  Benthamite panopticist subjection since, in the latter case, what subjects the
                  prisoners and makes them equals of one another is the unitary and elevated gaze,
                  while, in the former, it is a proximate yet enigmatic utterance that is neither
                  addressed to one nor to anyone in particular, and that one can do nothing about,
                  but in relation to which one is nevertheless implicated and interpellated as
                  helpless overhearer.</p>
                  <p>In Mill’s theater of poetic citizenship, citizens are imagined as actors and
                  spectators who perceive and become perceptible to one another in public, communal
                  life, but their capacity as participants in communal life is qualified by
                  supplemental roles as invisible speaker and eavesdropper. In these latter roles,
                  they are temporarily <emph>in</emph>capacitated as actors–whether the actor be
                  defined within the logic of utilitarian subject-formation as a rational,
                  intentional agent capable of undertaking actions with statistically calculable
                  consequences, or as an agent whose array of possible actions is immanently
                  delimited by the field of already available actions perceptible to them. In this
                     <emph>in</emph>capacity, they are “unworked” or <foreign>désoeuvrés</foreign>,
                  to use Nancy’s term from <title level="m">The Inoperative Community</title>, as
                  members of a maximally frugal and efficient, market-oriented community that
                  promises to produce freedom as, specifically, the freedom to participate in the
                  activities of exchange and consumption–to produce free subjects as, specifically,
                  subjects that perform the roles of seller and consumer. In relation to poetry as
                  the song of the unseen neighbor (or the song that one sings, unseen), the subject
                  is re-oriented and potentially re-constituted in excess of the logic of
                  panopticist subject-formation.</p>
                  <p>This re-orientation and reconstitution of the subject provides the potential means
                  of a liberation from the theater of bio-politics. The means it provides is,
                  however, precarious. The liberation in question may take place as a mere
                  liberation <emph>from</emph> the constraints of bio-political subject formation, a
                  quietist exercise of “negative liberty” that ends up re-affirming, again and
                  again, the framework of bio-governmentality. In this case, the freedom the subject
                  enjoys may take the form of a retreat or refuge from public, communal life that
                  leaves the basic structure of the latter intact and to which the subject returns,
                  renovated but substantially unaltered. Another scenario involves a re-orientation
                  and reconstitution of the subject that produces or generates a new role, a new
                  form-of-life, as it were, to be added to the, in principle, infinitely
                  proliferating repertoire of roles and forms-of-life in public, communal life. The
                  precariousness of this latter scenario hinges on the question of whether the
                  emergence of a new role would adhere once again to a liberalist-capitalist logic
                  of subject-formation, wherein the new role is molded into that of a
                  seller-consumer, or whether this emergence may manifest the enactment of a
                  genuinely alternative logic of freedom and reconfiguration of political space.</p>
