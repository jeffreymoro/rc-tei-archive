               <p>The Prince Regent was a notorious “ruin gazer.” Colonel Hanmer Warrington, the British
                  consul-general in Tripoli, knew this, and in 1816 he persuaded the local governor
                  to allow the Prince Regent to “help himself” to the remains of the Roman imperial
                  city of Leptis Magna in Libya. Despite local opposition and resistance, Warrington
                  arranged for Commander W.H. Smyth to ship many pieces of this ruin to England: twenty-two
                  granite columns, fifteen marble columns, ten capitals, twenty-five pedestals, seven
                  loose slabs, ten pieces of cornice, five inscribed slabs, various sculptural fragments.
                  When the shipment arrived in London it also included the colossal bust of Memnon from
                  the temple of Ramesses at Thebes (the provocation for Percy Shelley’s 
                  “Ozymandias”
                  ), which had been collected at Malta. Between August and October 1826, after several
                  years in the British Museum, the ruins from Leptis Magna were transported on gun carriages
                  to Virginia Water, a royal site within Windsor Great Park. There, according to <em><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/leptis_magna_ruins.pdf">The Royal Landscape</a></em> website, between June 1827 and March 1828, they “were arranged by Sir Jeffry Wyatville,
                  George IV’s architect, in the form of a ruined Roman temple,” which came to be called
                  the “Temple of the Gods” or “Temple of Augustus.”</p>
               <p>Christopher Woodward and Sophie Thomas have given informative accounts of this project
                  through which King George IV entered the annals of princes and aristocrats who created
                  fake ruins out of real ones (Woodward 136-9, Thomas 177-8, 185). It seems that over
                  600 columns from Leptis Magna had been given to Louis XIV for use in his palaces at
                  Versailles and Paris—so in quantitative terms the Prince Regent’s expropriation was
                  relatively modest by comparison. By the end of the Victorian period, time and the
                  English weather were discovered to have been ruining the fake ruins. Efforts at preservation
                  and restoration were undertaken and have continued intermittently into the present.
                  The final page on <em><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/leptis_magna_ruins.pdf">The Royal Landscape</a></em> website is devoted to the very recent work of the Ruins Repair Project Team: “All
                  of the stone and brick used in the reconstruction was found on the site, and all the
                  building methods used were traditional ones that would have been used in the early
                  19<sup>th</sup> century.” This text is accompanied by a photo:

                  </p>
               <p>I begin with this anecdote from Regency ruin culture as a way of framing the following
                  exploration of contradictory discourses of ruin in a sequence of historically and
                  intertextually connected poems from this decade. My argument particularly attends
                  to ruin’s abiding companion process, restoration. The centuries-long European tradition
                  of gazing at, meditating upon, representing, selling, and buying ancient ruins is
                  persistently accompanied by the compensatory activities of reconstructing, conserving,
                  preserving them. Ruin fosters restoration, which in turn may variously constitute
                  itself as a kind of ruin, even as a form of disaster—and not only in the sense in
                  which Ruskin and Morris denounced the destruction of Britain’s medieval architectural
                  heritage in the effort to “restore” it. “Restoration” means political as well as architectural
                  or aesthetic reconstitution and needs to figure persistently in efforts to rethink
                  the cultural politics of ruin and of ruins. Restoring an artificial ruin so that it
                  continues to look like a ruin is one of many permutations of the ruin/restoration
                  dyad.</p>
               <p>To this dyad we may add a third term intrinsic to the cultural-political process at
                  issue: survival. Ruins presuppose survival and materialize it; restoration seeks to
                  sustain the survival of ruins, but in doing so imperfectly arrests and undoes both
                  ruin and survival. In a trenchantly comprehensive essay entitled 
                  “Imperial Debris,”
                  Ann Laura Stoler says of Derek Walcott: <span class="quote">‘Rejecting the pathos of ruins, he opted for a celebration of survival. But his vision
                     was not only romantic. It was full of rage. . . . Melancholy, compassion, and pity
                     nourish imperial sensibilities of destruction and the redemptive satisfaction of chronicling
                     loss. Ruins hold histories but are less than the sum of the sensibilities of people
                     who live in them. Instead we might turn to ruins as epicenters of renewed claims,
                     as history in a spirited voice, as sites that animate new possibilities, bids for
                     entitlement, and unexpected political projects. (Stoler 197)’</span> “Survival” for Stoler means the simultaneous living on of ruins and of people whose
                  lives are defined and constrained but also charged with critical resistance by them.
                  Her remarks make implicit contact with but move in a direction quite distinct from
                  Derrida’s effort to inhabit the unfinished inbetweenness of Romantic—and specifically
                  Shelleyan—survival in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (
                  “Living On: Borderlines,”
                  1979). It is at once surprising and confirming for Stoler to say that “[Walcott’s]
                  vision was <em>not only</em> romantic [my emphasis],” for this implies that any dichotomizing opposition between
                  “pathos” and “rage,” between “romantic” melancholy and “renewed claims,” belies the
                  way in which one kind of affective relation to ruins can transform itself into another.
                  Ruins survive insofar as people to whom they have meaning invest them, nostalgically
                  or resistingly, with their sense of living on. There is a grotesque difference—but
                  also an occluded relationship—between the Caribbean “sugar estates and abandoned forts”
                  to which Walcott refers and the Prince Regent/George IV’s Leptis Magna folly. England’s
                  ruins, both the fake and the not-so-fake—lived on via the flow of colonial wealth.
                  In 1817 Byron managed to sell Newstead Abbey to Thomas Wildman, an old Harrovian and
                  British army officer, for 94,500 pounds. These funds, and the 100,000 pounds Wildman
                  subsequently spent in restoring the Byron family property, were generated by a sugar
                  plantation in Jamaica (Marchand 275-6 and note).</p>
               <p>The historical crossings between ancient ruin culture and more recent imperial ruination
                  are semantic as well as historical. As Stoler observes, “‘Ruin’ is both the claim
                  about the state of a thing and a process affecting it. . . . To turn to its verbal,
                  active sense is to begin from a location that the noun ruin too easily freezes into
                  stasis, into inert object, passive form. Imperial projects are themselves processes
                  of ongoing ruination, processes that ‘bring ruin upon,’ exerting material and social
                  force in the present” (Stoler 195). Refashioning the Roman imperial ruins of Leptis
                  Magna at Virginia Water, we might say, is enabled by and enables the “ongoing ruination”
                  of British imperial exploitation. </p>
               <p>Yet critical reflection on this process—even on this very example—can also be part
                  of resisting the ways in which ruin gazing and ruin culture function within ongoing
                  processes of imperial ruination. Some of the poetic texts I will explore here derive
                  their political and aesthetic integrity from such critical reflection; others promote
                  a celebratory enthusiasm, at once aesthetic and political, designed to pre-empt and
                  block a resistant critical understanding of what and how ruins come to be valued.
                  Julia Hell recognizes this constitutive ambivalence in her Introduction to <em>Ruins of Modernity</em>, where she focuses momentarily on “a veritable explosion” of texts deploying the
                  thematics and the rhetoric of ruins to represent “some of romanticism’s core concerns.”
                  These include “the political ramifications of the French revolution, an event in Roman
                  (dis)guise that opened a gap between the modern and premodern worlds; the nature of
                  the modern, its aesthetics, and its philosophies of history; and Rome, both republican
                  and imperial, which constitutes one of the most enduring topoi of the ruin archive,
                  the theme of the rise and decline of empires” (<em>Ruins of Modernity</em>, 2). These Romantic “concerns” figure prominently but ambiguously in the texts that
                  interest me, especially with respect to their articulations of Britain’s role in determining
                  the trajectory of the Napoleonic imperial project at moments unstably situated between
                  triumph and catastrophe, commercial and military pre-eminence and social crisis.</p>
               <p>Reading this historical process in Regency poetry will mean extending Hell’s naming
                  of “romanticism’s core concerns” to include “England’s ruins” alongside the ruins
                  of Roman and of post-Napoleonic Europe. As Anne Janowitz has argued, native ruins
                  (particularly landscape ruins) performed powerful ideological work in shaping national
                  identity during Britain’s eighteenth-century rise to global prominence, its confrontation
                  with Revolutionary and then with Napoleonic France as rival hegemon, and its post-Waterloo
                  emergence from this confrontation as an imperial power with deep internal contradictions
                  (Janowitz 1-19). England’s ruins and the ruins of ancient imperial cultures speak
                  to each other in Regency poetry. What they say is over-determined and conflicted in
                  ways that produce both conformity and confrontation. </p>
               <p>Canonical ruin culture transvalues fall, decay, collapse, disaster into sites and
                  objects of positive aesthetic and ideological value: the positive transvaluation subsumes
                  and idealizes the negation of ruin as historical, material reality. Critical ruin
                  discourse enters this realm of aesthetic transvaluation and discloses historical and
                  material circumstances that otherwise remain suppressed and mystified. As Stoler observes,
                  it is Benjamin who establishes the most productive precedent for a critical reading
                  of ruin that begins by inhabiting a “dream-collective,” an ideologically saturated
                  terrain of idealization and mystification. <em>The Arcades Project</em>, Stoler writes, “provides the canonical text for thinking about ruins as ‘petrified
                  life,’ as traces that mark the fragility of power and the forces of destruction” (Stoler
                  194). In this as in many other respects, Benjamin articulates the crucial interface
                  between what we might broadly call Romantic and post-Romantic forms of modernity.
                  His focus on nineteenth-century Paris constitutes as primary field of ruin the historical
                  and cultural terrain between the Revolution and the beginnings of Romanticism on the
                  one hand, and twentieth-century modernism on the other. In the culminating moment
                  of European capitalism, Benjamin says, “we begin to recognize the monuments of the
                  bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled” (
                  “Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century”
                  [1935], <em>Arcades Project</em> 13). It is what Stathis Gourgouris calls “Benjamin’s idiosyncratic anti-Romanticism”
                  that gives his commentary on the Romantic century its remarkable suggestiveness and
                  force. When Stoler distinguishes what she sees as her own less tragic line of analysis—“ruins
                  are also sites that condense alternative senses of history”—she mischaracterizes Benjamin’s
                  critical commitment to this very project. His reading of the Paris arcades as structures
                  incorporating the fantasies of a new kind of consumer society evolves via passages
                  from affective participation to dialectical critique, from knowing seduction to historical
                  awakening. “The new, dialectical method of doing history presents itself as the art
                  of experiencing the present as waking world, a world to which that dream we name the
                  past refers in truth. To pass through and carry out what has been in remembering the
                  dream!” (<em>Arcades Project</em> 389). This “method” becomes distinctively productive in constructing as its “dialectical
                  image” the ruined arcade, for it is in its conditions as already ruined that the architecture
                  of capitalist culture most fully discloses its status in the ongoingness of social
                  history.</p>
               <p>The value of Benjamin’s ruin-reading becomes especially evident in comparison to the
                  more limited neo-Romantic claims of Georg Simmel’s famous 1911 essay 
                  “The Ruin.”
                  Simmel revives both the Schillerian and the Hegelian idealist dialectic of “spirit”
                  and “nature,” of human mental agency and a material realm that is at once resistant
                  to and—uniquely, for Simmel, in the art of architecture—complicit in “carrying out
                  the [mind’s] plan, as it were, with its own forces.” This generates Simmel’s celebration
                  of the architectural ruin’s “unique balance . . . between mechanical, inert matter
                  . . . and informing spirituality” (Simmel 259). Simmel’s dialectic remains entirely
                  conceptual and metaphysical; it offers no purchase on ruins as indices or tropes of
                  material history—which is why he insists that the “fascination of the ruin” derives
                  not from “destruction by man” but from an ineluctable “effect of nature.”</p>
               <p>Benjamin inverts Simmel’s hymn to “that metaphysical calm which attaches to the decay
                  of a material work by virtue of a profound a priori,” tracing instead the ways in
                  which ruins make legible simultaneously natural and social processes. We have much
                  still to learn by rereading Romantic discourses of ruin through the lens of Benjamin’s
                  post-Romantic dialectics. The first arcades in Paris were constructed in anticipation
                  of Napoleon’s return from his Egyptian campaign; by the time the Suez Canal was opened
                  in 1869, some arcades were already beginning to deteriorate as architectural and social
                  spaces. Meditating on arcades and associated urban structures fallen into ruin, Benjamin
                  finds himself returning to that canonical site of ancient natural/social ruination,
                  the ruins of Pompeii (Leslie 108). <em>The Arcades Project</em> points the way to freshly elaborated understandings of how the ruins of ancient empires
                  shaped—and still shape—the political and cultural ruins of the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>We need to recognize, however, that eighteenth-century ruin culture had already developed
                  critical as well as melancholic and nostalgic perspectives. Goldsmith’s 
                  “The Deserted Village”
                  is not just a wistful lament for the bygone days of “sweet Auburn”; it also offers
                  a kind of critique of modern commercial, urbanizing existence. Less reactionary ways
                  of deploying a vocabulary of ruins were also available, as Andreas Huyssen has shown
                  in recent work on Piranesi’s distinctive concept of the “authentic ruin,” which enters
                  European culture of the 1740s and 1750s not as the melancholy revival of an originary
                  past but as a critical—and self-critical—imaging of cultural instability (<em>Ruins of Modernity</em>, 22-7). Huyssen’s argument is directly pertinent to my readings of Barbauld and Byron—and
                  also, less directly, of Hemans, whose early poems of ruin and restoration illuminate
                  by contrast the potential within Romantic ruin culture for a poetry of defiant resistance.</p>
               <p>Anna Barbauld’s <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em> shocked and dismayed Regency readers. Published in early February 1812, some seven
                  months after the Prince of Wales celebrated his promotion to Prince Regent, the poem
                  opens with an attack on a disastrous war from which nobody but the old ruling class
                  could benefit. It goes on to elaborate a future vision of England in ruins—of England
                  as ruins—whose value will derive entirely from their transformation into forms of
                  cultural property and cultural capital. The countervailing forces in the poem—the
                  opening condemnation of the Napoleonic “despot’s sway,” the celebration of Britain’s
                  current though threatened commercial pre-eminence, the extended praise of British
                  artistic and scientific achievement—failed to moderate the outrage of readers and
                  reviewers who (rightly) felt themselves compelled to question British exceptionalism:
                  “Britain, know, / Thou who hast shared the guilt must share the woe./ . . . Ruin,
                  as with an earthquake shock, is here” (45-6, 49). If the present ruins of imperialist
                  war are still distant for Britons not directly engaged in fighting, the future ruins
                  the poem imagines pervade the core of the metropole, as “London’s faded glories rise
                  to view” (157) and “pilgrims” from Canada and the United States “some crumbling turret,
                  mined by time, / The broken stairs with perilous step shall climb” (171-2).</p>
               <p>Barbauld invests this future England in ruins with a contradictory double valence.

               <p> Within these evocations of recurrent, cyclical ruin, however, are the seeds of a
                  process of transvaluation that moves in a direction quite different from anything
                  in Volney. England’s loss of economic and political power produces a new kind of cultural
                  wealth that assumes the form of ruin—that preserves the greatness of Locke and Milton,
                  of Fox and Nelson, as a heritage of ruin available only, or most dramatically, to
                  visitors from former North American colonies. Barbauld rejects any prospect of restoration,
                  elaborating instead a form of preservation- and propagation-in-ruin. British national
                  heritage, one might say, will be available only to “Nations beyond the Apalachian
                  hills” (83), to “the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires / With pictured glories of illustrious
                  sires” (126-7). Perhaps some Briton may “lead his wondering guests” to the ruined
                  sites of former power—but in Barbauld’s vision the value of such sites accrues to
                  the tourists, not to their native guides or, presumably, to those who still own these
                  sites as “real” property.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Barbauld reverses the characteristic movement of Benjamin’s ruin-reading: instead
                     of proceeding from affective participation to critical awakening, <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em> begins with critical alarm at the ruins of war and out of this shapes an elegiac future
                     for British culture as ruin. The terms on which British greatness will survive as
                     ruin are additionally articulated through the reversal of an Enlightenment and Romantic
                     master-trope, according to which human history progresses as the diurnal movement
                     of light from east to west. Barbauld deploys the trope conventionally early in the
                     poem: “And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now.” She complicates it, however, by imagining
                     England’s future ruins in the shape of palaces and museums that contain, as did earlier
                     imperial ruins, expropriated representations of this very process. Visitors who view
                     these ruins-within-ruins have political lessons to learn as they acquire the cultural
                     capital of their forbears:

                     be found in London’s ruined institutions were and remain the “spoils” of empire—depends
                     on a countermovement to the east-to-west direction of cultural progress and decline.
                     It is a west-to-east retrogression that will produce both touristic pleasure and critical
                     knowledge among future generations, a return to the parent nation in ruins that “shall,”
                     in a concluding vision remapping the constitutive east-west coordinates onto a new
                     north-south axis, lead to a “world” that is “free.”

               <p>If <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em> was the most reviled major poem of the early Regency, the first two cantos of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, published just over a month later on 10 March 1812, was the most celebrated. Strangely,
                  Byron seems never to have said a word about Barbauld’s poem, perhaps because at that
                  moment, as he wrote to Francis Hodgson on 16 February of that year, “I won’t even
                  read a word of the feminine gender;—it must all be <span class="foreign">propria quae maribus</span>” (<em>Byron’s Letters and Journals</em> 2. 163). Yet the movement from England’s ruins to the ruins of Greece and the Ottoman
                  Empire in <em>Childe Harold</em> stands in complex and revealing relationship to what the reviewer for the <em>Universal Magazine</em> read as Barbauld’s “tragical” satire (Barbauld 310).</p>
               <p>Byron’s “Romaunt” opens with a scene of double ruin: Childe Harold’s personal ruin,
                  his “crime” (1.27) or “Sin” (1.37), has introduced “uses vile” into what we are given
                  to accept as the noble ruin of “his father hall,” “a vast and venerable pile, / So
                  old, it seemed only not to fall” (1.55-7). His motivation for leaving “his native
                  land” to “visit scorching climes beyond the sea” (1.51-2) arises from shame—he is
                  ruining the family ruin, we might say—and from a kind of boredom or “satiety” (1.34)
                  that becomes part of what makes his confessed “crime” glamorously alienating. Childe
                  Harold’s departure from England’s ruins, then, is at once obedient and transgressive,
                  and evokes analogous fantasies in the reader. There is no mention here at the outset
                  of an England ruined by war, as in <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em>. Byron’s England is initially an Albion whose ruins are intrinsic to its ancient
                  “heritage” (1.91). Childe Harold’s threat to that heritage is staged in terms that
                  make it fascinatingly ruinous; “crime” and “satiety” become signs of a darkly desirable
                  perversity whose trajectory points forward to the “scorching climes” of an orientalist
                  quest.</p>
               <p>Between Harold and the ruins, ancient and modern, that he seeks to the east lies the
                  reality of the Peninsular War. “[L]ovely Spain! renown’d, romantic land!” (1.386)
                  is being destroyed, and not only by Napoleon’s armies and a faltering Spanish resistance.
                  “Albion” is now “the fond ally / That fights for all, but ever fights in vain” (1.445-6),
                  lines that recall—and may even echo—Barbauld’s image of a Britain that “Bravely, though
                  vainly, dares to strive with Fate, / And seeks by turns to prop each sinking state”
                  (5-6). Byron’s criticism of British military aims goes further than Barbauld’s, however.
                  Though his original note on stanza 33 praises “The late exploits of Lord Wellington”
                  who “has, indeed, done wonders,” Byron’s stanzas on the Battle of Talavera present
                  a grim vision of the blind futility of war quite close to Barbauld’s. The contending
                  armies “Are met—as if at home they could not die— / To feed the crow on Talavera’s
                  plain, / And fertilize the field that each pretends to gain” (1.447-9). The sequence
                  that follows dissolves all patriotic glory in an apprehension of mutual disaster.
                  Albuera, where the French were defeated on 16 May 1811 by British, Spanish, and Portuguese
                  forces, is a “glorious field of grief,” “A scene where mingling foes should boast
                  and bleed” (1.459, 462). Byron’s resistance to militarized patriotism will be for
                  him, as it is on different terms for Barbauld, deeply connected to their respective
                  interventions into the politics of ruin culture. The meditation at the very end of
                  Canto 1 most immediately registers Byron’s personal grief over the death of John Wingfield,
                  but its movement from “dreams” to “Consciousness awakening to her woes” (1.938, 941)
                  also looks forward to the ruins of Greece.</p>
               <p>These ruins have already made a preemptive if indirect intrusion into the stanzas
                  on Spain: </p>

               <p> This disruption of the travel narrative by a narrative of compositional desire (Byron
                  did not draft the stanzas on Portugal and Spain, which he visited in the summer of
                  1809, until he arrived in Greece in the late autumn) indicates the supervening force
                  of Greece in ruins for the entire textual performance. At the same time, the opening
                  address to Athena and to Athens in Canto 2 presupposes the ruins of “war and wasting
                  fire” (2.4) that Harold has witnessed on the Iberian Peninsula, and that he now confronts
                  in Greece itself. His response to Athens is historical and political from the outset:
                  “o’er each mouldering tower, / Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of
                  power” (2.17-18). Then gradually, via stanzas of generalized reflection on “yon defenceless
                  urn” (2.20) and “the vanish’d Hero’s lofty mound” (2.37), the Parthenon rises in the
                  shape of a question: “Is that a temple where a God may dwell?” (2.44).</p>
               <p>Byron’s question opens a space in which the poem’s first major critical excursus on
                  the ruins of empire unfolds. As the narrator displaces Harold and seems to occupy
                  the conventionalized Piranesian position of the reflective ruin connoisseur seated
                  upon “this massy stone, / The marble column’s yet unshaken base” (2.82-3), he quickly
                  makes clear that the British have replaced the Ottomans as the most flagrant “plunderers
                  of yon fane” (2.91). The five stanzas condemning the removal and sale of the Parthenon
                  sculptures to the British government involve a relation between the politics of imperialist
                  war and the politics of culture that differs sharply from Barbauld’s vision. Elgin
                  is the “last, the worst, dull spoiler” (2.94), a “barbaric” aristocrat who has ruined
                  by expropriating “what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared” (2.101). In a note “too
                  long to be placed here” (within the poem’s text), Byron explains that “Lord Elgin
                  [may] boast of having ruined Athens” (
                  “Appendix to Canto the Second,”
                  Note [A]). French and Italian as well as British interests converge in a “devastation”
                  marked by a grotesque mixture of trivial dilettantism, military coercion, and vast
                  private wealth. At the center of the scene is Giovanni Lusieri, the Neapolitan court
                  painter and cultural middleman whom Elgin hired to supervise the removal: “While he
                  and his patrons confine themselves to tasting medals, appreciating cameos, sketching
                  columns, and cheapening gems, their little absurdities are as harmless as insect or
                  fox-hunting, maiden speechifying, barouche-driving, or any such pastime; but when
                  they carry away three or four shiploads of the most valued and massy relics that time
                  and barbarism have left to the most injured and celebrated of cities, when they destroy,
                  in a vain attempt to tear down, those works which have been the admiration of ages,
                  I know no motive which can excuse, no name which can designate, the perpetrators of
                  this dastardly devastation” (Byron 190-91). Byron follows but goes beyond Gibbon here
                  in extending the discourse of barbarism to the inheritors and exploiters of empire.
                  Elgin’s deal with the Turks for the Parthenon ruins enacts, at the level of cultural
                  property, a degradation of Greek potential for liberty and self-determination—however
                  distant the prospect of realizing this potential may have seemed at the time. Byron
                  goes on to distance himself from the entire sphere of cultural investment and acquisition—“I
                  am not a collector or admirer of collections”—in a gesture with critical implications
                  for the status of cultural politics as it evolves in the later cantos of <em>Childe Harold</em>. He also extends his attack on imperialist cultural predation back into its founding
                  moment by linking Elgin to Gaius Verres (120-43 BC), the notoriously corrupt Roman
                  governor of Sicily prosecuted by Cicero for, among other things, devastating the temples
                  and private houses of that province (Miles 19-34).</p>
               <p>Addressing the full critical scope of Byron’s stanzas on Greece in Canto 2 is beyond
                  the reach of my argument here. It would mean tracing the aftermath of the “Elgin Marbles”
                  controversy into its present status in the polemics of books such as James Cuno’s
                  <em>Who Owns Antiquity: Museums and the Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage</em>. It would also mean extending Saree Makdisi’s challenging account of the ways in
                  which “the text of [Byron’s] musings on Hellenistic antiquity is shaped by the context
                  of the Oriental world within which he finds the ruins of ancient Greece” (Makdisi
                  206). The Albanian sequence later in Canto 2 is especially important in making legible
                  an erotics of ruin that is suppressed in the moment when “Greek love” might have figured
                  into the narrator’s elegiac anger towards the desolation of modern Athens. I defer
                  detailed discussion of these issues, however, in order to sustain a more delimited
                  focus on the critical import of Byronic ruin discourse. It is emphatically a discourse
                  that repudiates “restoration”: </p>

               <p> Whatever form Byron’s early philhellenic impulses may take, they will not attach
                  themselves to visions of either antiquarian reparation or political restitution (in
                  the sense of “restoring” a previously existing form of the state). Elgin has seized
                  “relics ne’er to be restored” (2.132) and made them British property; there can be
                  no undoing of this ruin as historical event. The future of Greece’s political and
                  aesthetic renewal will have to be built in the midst of this ruin, through the survival
                  of a hope that, in the words of Shelley’s Demogorgon, “creates, / From its own wreck,
                  the thing it contemplates” (<em>Prometheus Unbound</em> 4.573-4).</p>
               <p>For Byron and his Regency contemporaries, Waterloo marked a watershed in the valuing
                  of ruins and the meaning of restoration. Felicia Hemans’s <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em>, her first significant poetic success, responds to the immediate post-Waterloo moment
                  in terms antithetical to those I have been looking at in Byron and Barbauld. The first
                  edition was published by Byron’s own publisher, John Murray, in May, 1816, and it
                  did well enough to justify a second, much-expanded edition later that year—this one
                  identifying Hemans as author. Byron told Murray in September that he found <em>The Restoration</em> “a good poem—very” and intended to take it with him on his anticipated travels through
                  Italy (<em>Byron’s Letters and Journals</em>, 5. 108). Whatever may have motivated this judgment, it is surprising: Hemans writes
                  about British patriotism and its relation to the timeless, transcendent claims of
                  art in ways that conflict dramatically with the cultural politics of <em>Childe Harold</em>.</p>
               <p>The first edition of Hemans’s poem opens with a complicated epigraphic sequence. A
                  line from Byron’s <em>The Giaour</em> celebrating the Greek Isles appears on the title-page: “AS IF FOR GODS A DWELLING
                  PLACE.” This is followed by five lines from a famous sonnet by Count Vincenzo da Filicaja
                  (1642-1707) representing Italy as a woman burdened with a “<span class="foreign">Dono infelice di bellezza</span>” (“graced / With ill-starred beauty” in Hemans’s own 1818 translation), then by a
                  passage from the Rev. J.C. Eustace’s popular <em>A Classical Tour Through Italy</em> (3rd edition, 1815) in which Napoleon’s project of making Italy part of the French
                  Empire is said to “have rivaled or rather surpassed the rapacity of the Goths and
                  Vandals” (Hemans 31). These gestures set in motion a performance in which an elegiac
                  idealization of Italy’s supreme but tragic artistic heritage, recurrently identified
                  with an aesthetic of “romantic” ruin, coexists with a celebration of “restoration”
                  understood, as Susan Wolfson notes, both as reestablishment of the papacy and aristocracy
                  and as restitution of the works of art which Napoleon’s forces had “liberated” and
                  taken to Paris. Just how the “grandeur” of “decay” that defines Italian artistic culture
                  is to survive its “restoration” arises as a central question in both early versions
                  of the poem.</p>
               <p>The thematic complex of Italy’s glorious “Desolation” (112) in relation to its splendid
                  restoration (101-4) is linked emphatically in the expanded second edition to a triumphant
                  affirmation of Britain’s heroic military intervention: “Land of the lyre! ‘twas there
                  th’avenging sword / Won the bright treasures to thy fanes restored” (87-8). It is
                  hard to imagine that Byron was responding to such lines as these when he praised Hemans’s
                  poem to Murray. Or that he would have tolerated, much less admired, Hemans’s epically
                  inflected encomium of Wellington: </p>

               <p> Under the sign of “restoration,” a mystified British patriotism converges so fluently
                  with the image of Italy as “Land of departed fame!” (1)—as “Proud wreck of vanish’d
                  power” (7)—that the potentially contradictory dimension of this variation on the ruin/restoration
                  dynamic remains submerged, for the most part, beneath the poem’s impassioned affective
                  continuity.</p>
               <p>For the most part—but not entirely. Twice in the second edition of 
                  “The Restoration”
                  Hemans shifts abruptly against the surge of “romantic” Italophile pathos and into
                  a different discursive register. Turning from Florence and Venice to Rome in her narrative
                  of Italy as a land where “Each ruin tells of Earth’s departed lords” (118), Hemans
                  imagines that “from the sacred ashes of the first, / Might a new Rome in phoenix-grandeur
                  burst” and “With one loud call wake Empire from the tomb” (301-4). In the first edition
                  this call for a restoration of “Empire” is immediately followed by a celebration of
                  the Apollo Belvedere, one of the prize antiquities taken from the Vatican to the Louvre
                  in 1800 and “restored,” under the supervision of the sculptor Antonio Canova, in 1815.
                  But in the second edition Hemans finds it necessary to make a sudden correction of
                  perspective: “Vain dream! degraded Rome! thy noon is o’er, / Once lost, thy spirit
                  shall revive no more” (309-10). These lines, which echo Barbauld on London in 
                  “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven,”
                  cut sharply against the poem’s rhetoric of restoration—and so themselves require immediate
                  adjustment to allow a return to Hemans’s main line of argument: “Still, still to thee
                  shall nations bend their way, / Revered in ruin, sovereign in decay!” (317-18). The
                  difficulty here, it would appear, is that for political and ethical as well as aesthetic
                  reasons, Rome needs to remain in ruins; any prospect of a phoenix-like rise from its
                  ashes would compromise its distinctive value as ruin—and also threaten Britain’s ascendancy
                  as Europe’s new imperial champion of restoration.</p>
               <p>A similar disruption occurs some 150 lines later in the second edition. Hemans’s account
                  of the Vatican Museum’s Laocoön leads into a more encompassing tribute to the “pomp”
                  of </p>

               <p> The surviving power of Roman art-in-ruin is part of what Britain has restored. We
                  might say that Hemans found it necessary both to confirm and to confine this ruin,
                  as part of controlling her chosen narrative of restoration.</p>
               <p>Controlling the broader narrative of ruin/restoration/survival is fundamental to each
                  of the monumental set-pieces in <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em>. Hemans’s master-narrative is clear: Italy’s artistic patrimony was ruined when Napoleon
                  seized it as the spoils of war; Britain has nobly restored that artistic patrimony
                  as part of returning Italy to the control of the Church and the old ruling class.
                  But Italy’s antiquities are encoded with multiple narratives of ruin/restoration/survival,
                  and these narratives often stand in contradictory and ironic relation to each other
                  and to Hemans’s historical present. Napoleon took the Apollo Belvedere from the Vatican—but
                  how did this Roman copy of a fourth-century BC Greek original come to be there in
                  the first place? Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II, appropriated
                  it shortly after it was unearthed in 1489; for several years it was part of his private
                  collection and stood in the garden of his titular church, Santi Apostili. Upon his
                  election to the papacy he brought it across town to the Vatican (Brummer 66-81). Critical
                  knowledge of such history complicates the status of all the great monuments commemorated
                  in Hemans’s poem: the Venus de’ Medici in the Uffizi Gallery was exiled from Rome
                  to Florence by Pope Innocent XI in 1667, apparently because it had come to be regarded
                  as dangerously provocative (Haskell and Penny 71-83); the four bronze horses above
                  the main portal of the Basilica of San Marco in Venice were stolen from Constantinople
                  during the Fourth Crusade some six centuries before Napoleon stole them for France
                  (Freeman 11-36); the “Belvedere Torso” of Hercules, now believed to be a Roman copy
                  of a second-century BC original, circulated among Roman aristocrats and their artists
                  for more than a century before it entered the Vatican collections under unknown circumstances
                  (Sommalia 54-9); the Laocoön itself—probably a first-century BC Roman copy—was found
                  in 1506 near Nero’s Domus Aurea and bought by Julius II, who placed it alongside his
                  celebrated Apollo in the Belvedere Garden of the Vatican (Masson 317-19). The story
                  of Napoleonic rapacity reads somewhat differently within these contexts. Furthermore,
                  neither the Belvedere Torso nor the Laocoön was taken to France during the Napoleonic
                  occupation. Their inclusion in Hemans’s promenade of “restored” Italian antiquities
                  illustrates the controlling and at times misleading ideology of her poem’s defining
                  narrative.</p>
               <p>Byron may have read the first edition of <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em> sometime during the composition of Canto 3 of <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, between April and November 1816. But his explicit compositional response to it was,
                  with one possible exception, delayed. In resuming the poem as part of his self-exile,
                  Byron reprises the constitutive movement from ruins to ruins in Cantos 1 and 2. Harold
                  and the poet-narrator in Canto 3 are more defiantly embittered extensions of their
                  previous textual identities. This is especially true of the latter, who carries within
                  him now the ruins of his own unprecedented literary conquest: he is himself a kind
                  of ruin of empire. The internalizing and reflexive trajectory of the canto sustains,
                  however, a powerful outward-reaching relation to the immediate historical moment.
                  In his exilic travels the autobiographical subject tracks anew the disastrous course
                  of more than two decades of revolutionary struggle across the European continent,
                  pausing to consider its complete disintegration “upon this place of skulls, / The
                  grave of France, the deadly Waterloo” (3.154-5). Here Byron begins to rearticulate
                  an ironic and critical relationship between his own personal disaster and the demise
                  of freedom’s cause. The intermittent turnings to “nature” in Canto 3 will ultimately
                  mirror back to him the turbulence and despair by which these gestures are motivated,
                  resulting in rhetorical performances—like the famous lightning storm on Lake Leman—that
                  figure imaginative power in terms that are glamorously self-frustrating, self-withholding
                  (Emerson 363-78). His meditations on Rousseau late in the Canto lead him to declare
                  that “this will not endure, nor be endured!” (3.779). But by the end a defiant endurance,
                  which includes a determined belief in the efficacy of his own writing, is all that
                  remains, along with a parent’s fond hope for a daughter whom he will never see again.</p>
               <p>Where Byron’s reading of Hemans may have exerted an influence is in the proleptic
                  apostrophe to “Italia” that marks the transition to the concluding stanzas of Canto
                  3: </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">

                     <div class="l">Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill, </div>
                     <div class="l">Flows from the eternal source of Rome’s imperial hill.</div>
                  </div> (3.1027-30).</blockquote>
               <p> Before he crosses the Alps Byron imagines that—to a degree beyond what even the ruins
                  of Athens had afforded—the “knowledge” he now seeks is to be read from the ruins of
                  “imperial” Rome. This is why, three stanzas earlier, he identifies so forcefully with
                  Gibbon, the “lord of irony” whose “master-spell, / . . . stung his foes to wrath .
                  . . / And doom’d him to the zealot’s ready Hell” (3.1000-2).</p>
               <p>Byron would undertake his anticipated study of the ruins of Roman imperialism in April
                  and May 1817, six months after he had settled in Venice and a year after his self-exile
                  from Regency society and literary triumph. The fourth canto of <em>Childe Harold</em>, unlike the previous three, was not written during the events it narrates; it was
                  begun after Byron returned to the Veneto in the early summer. As he makes clear in
                  the prefatory letter to Hobhouse, he regarded Canto 4 as a “poetical work” in its
                  own right, as “the most thoughtful and comprehensive of my compositions.” Only in
                  critical retrospect, we may assume, did Byron believe he could know what Italy had
                  to teach him. We may also assume, accordingly, that there is nothing perfunctory about
                  the pervasive rhetoric of ruin in this text. The word ruin and its variants appear
                  fifteen times in 1674 lines of verse. The work this rhetoric performs has been extensively
                  and effectively examined in previous critical accounts; what I wish to contribute
                  lays no claim to being exhaustive or comprehensive. My more limited concern is with
                  the function of ruin in connecting two intricately aligned textual trajectories: a
                  self-critically updated re-production of the literary identity called “Byron” in the
                  aftermath of post-Waterloo restoration, and an equally self-critical extension of
                  <em>Childe Harold</em>’s status as travelogue—as a special kind of literary commodity consumed by readers
                  finally able to travel again to the treasured sites of Italian aesthetic achievement
                  and cultural value.</p>
               <p>In a chapter called 
                  “The Shaping Spirit of Ruin: <em>Childe Harold</em> IV,”
                  Jerome Christensen engages the issues I am emphasizing here with characteristically
                  bold and knowing penetration. For him, ruin in Canto 4 functions symptomatically rather
                  than critically: “Lord Byron monumentalizes himself by Byronizing all monuments,”
                  he writes. “The ruin of Lord Byron’s name (published abroad by scandal and reviews)
                  does not any more than the ruin of Italy mean extinction but allegorization: Byron
                  becomes the name of ruin” (Christensen 191). What this reading minimizes is the pressure
                  of political resistance generated through the dynamic Christensen so commandingly
                  conceptualizes. Byron does indeed represent himself “as both victim and exploiter”
                  of British commercial society and of the imperial expansion that is its analogue.
                  But what Christensen terms the “imperial self-division of Byronism” is more often
                  antagonistic to than complicit with, or merely allegorical of, British imperialism
                  and the poem’s status as cultural commodity. Hence the importance of Peter Manning’s
                  argument in 
                  “<em>Childe Harold</em> in the Marketplace: From Romaunt to Handbook”
                  —that Childe Harold simultaneously invokes and undoes both the ideology of the romance
                  genre and what a contemporary reviewer identified as “the narrative of a modern tourist”
                  (Manning 171). This dynamic is evident, as we have seen, in the anti-war sections
                  of Cantos 1 and 3. But it is most remarkably elaborated in the cultural politics of
                  Canto 4, where Byron performs his now sensational identity as a “ruin amidst ruins”
                  in ways that transform the glamour and pathos of the renegade British aristocrat into
                  a figure who evokes in order to disrupt the apparent triumphs of empire, literary
                  celebrity, and aesthetic monumentalism.</p>
               <p>Consider the sequence beginning with the stanza on Ariosto (4.361-9), whose fusion
                  of chivalric romance and satire (the epigraph to Canto 4 is from Ariosto’s Satire
                  3) is fundamental to the latter phase of Byron’s career. The salute to Ariosto is
                  followed, as a note in the first edition indicates, by an adaptation of Byron’s translation
                  of the Filicaja sonnet that Hemans excerpts at the beginning of <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em>. But Byron turns the trope of Italia’s “fatal gift of beauty” (4.371) in a quite
                  different direction. Recalling his youthful reading of Servius Sulpicius’s letter
                  to Cicero on traveling through Greece, Byron alludes to his own sail between Piraeus
                  and Corinth and reads from those unrebuilt ruins anticipations of present imperialist
                  realities: </p>

               <p>For Christensen, “Byron’s identification with the ruins of Italy” is such that “the
                  ruins of the modern age are themselves radically discontinuous with ruins in the past”
                  because of their “status as commodities” (Christensen 192). But Byron’s stanza would
                  appear to indicate the opposite: the ruins of the ancient Mediterranean acquire a
                  double meaning as cultural commodities because “all that was / Of then destruction
                  is.” As Janowitz argues, in <em>Childe Harold</em> 4 “the distance between past and present is significantly diminished by a labile
                  self and by the contemporaneity of the history the poet evokes” (Janowitz 41). Byron
                  links what was to what is through a tense-inflected copula not of identity but of
                  survival, of living on in “destruction” and “desolation.” The connection to Benjamin
                  here is striking: “It’s not that what is past casts its light on what is present,
                  or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has
                  been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (<em>Arcades Project</em> 462). As Mark Featherstone comments, Benjamin worked “through the excavation of those
                  ruins of the present that might allow for the rediscovery of the horrors of the past
                  qua the return of the historical repressed. . . . the traces of the past were encrypted
                  in the ruins of the present” (Featherstone 313). And so they are for Byron too. Though
                  Benjamin’s focus on the previous century’s relatively recent past-in-ruins differs
                  from Byron’s “all that was” of “imperial Rome,” their respective recognitions of material
                  history’s convergences in constellated representations of present cultural affect
                  and critical resistance put them into reciprocally revealing dialogue.</p>
               <p>Janowitz argues that in confronting this deep historical survival of ruin from past
                  into the “now” of social existence and of writing, “Byron restores Rome aesthetically
                  . . . In this dialectic of ruin, Byron is . . . authorized to emancipate aesthetic
                  value from its historical order, and fix its form against historical decay.” But the
                  “terrible cost of that emancipation,” she continues, “is the power of poetic monumentality,
                  which is collapsed into those historical wastes which face the speaker” (Janowitz
                  41). And which face the reader, of course. We may extend Janowitz’s insights along
                  more explicitly Benjaminian lines: the desire for aesthetic restoration and redemption
                  is powerfully inscribed in the language of Canto 4—but even more powerful is Byron’s
                  sense of a continuity of ruin that transmutes monuments regarded as transcendent into
                  critical historical texts of ongoing political significance. No nineteenth-century
                  writer would have assented more knowingly than Byron to Benjamin’s Thesis that “There
                  is no cultural document that is not at the same time a record of barbarism.” Like
                  Gibbon before and Benjamin after him, Byron knew that “barbarism” was and is a condition
                  intrinsic to all class society.</p>
               <p>From this perspective, we may follow Byron as he enters Rome in Canto 4 enunciating,
                  in the spirit of Benjamin’s “at the same time,” a vision of the “Lone mother of dead
                  empires” that simultaneously retraces the steps of melancholy ruinists and insists
                  on a critical awareness that “empire” lives on. His insistence on the limits, even
                  the futility, of both aesthetic and scientific recuperation are self-critical, not
                  self-satisfied: “Chaos of ruins! Who shall trace the void, / O’er the dim fragments
                  cast a lunar light, / And say, ‘here was, or is,’ where all is doubly night?” (4.718-20).
                  There is an element of rueful identification rather than of dismissal in Byron’s vignette
                  of those who are excited when “some false mirage of ruin rises near” (4. 729). What
                  matters is the ascendancy of historicizing self-consciousness over antiquarian connoisseurship.
                  Of the vast “mass of ruins” on the Palatine he asks: “Temples, baths or halls? / Pronounce
                  who can; for all that Learning reap’d / From her research hath been, that these are
                  walls — / Behold the Imperial Mount! ‘tis thus the mighty falls” (4.960-3). As empire
                  survives, ruin survives; it is in this sense that “History, with all her volumes vast,
                  / Hath but one page” (4.968-9).</p>
               <p>Byron turns our attention towards the revered monuments of ancient empire not to debunk
                  their affective force in the present but to redirect that force towards an awakened
                  sense of how they may be read as commentaries on the present—including the present
                  phenomenon of Byron’s own commodified celebrity. From this angle rereading the most
                  familiar and persistently decontextualized sequence in Canto 4—the eighteen stanzas
                  on the Coliseum—affords fresh opportunities for seeing how Byron performs his identity
                  as a special kind of tourist guide through acts of resistant ruin-reading. Stanza
                  128 opens the sequence by viewing this monument of Roman monuments in what will become
                  a clichéd ambience: a “wondrous,” “magic” atmosphere of “moonbeams” and “shadows”
                  (see the reference to “lunar light” in 4. 719). But in stanza 130, with its shift
                  from “Time! the beautifier of the dead” to “Time, the avenger!” (4.1162, 1169), Byron
                  enacts a desire for revenge against those who would ruin him and links it to the fate
                  of his writing: “. . . there is that within me which shall tire / Torture and Time,
                  and breathe when I expire; / Something unearthly, which they deem not of” (4.1228-30).
                  It is this affirmation of writing that lives on beyond the life of the writer in the
                  form of ruin that opens the way to his now seeing the Coliseum in the intense light
                  of historical reality—as a theatre of imperial brutality. The “dying gladiator” Byron
                  places before us has its origins in a celebrated work of art in the Capitoline Museum,
                  the second-century BC marble figure not of a gladiator but of a Gaul who fell fighting
                  against King Attalus I of Pergamon in Asia Minor (Sommalia 55-8). But through a process
                  of double transfer—from battlefield to public spectacle, from monumental marble to
                  covertly ekphrastic verbal fiction—Byron compels his readers to see the Coliseum historically,
                  as a site of ideological manipulation and control, as a stadium where enslaved human
                  beings were “Butcher’d to make a Roman holiday” (4.1267). By merging what the “dying
                  gladiator” was and is to his own vindictive impulses—“Shall he expire / And unavenged?”
                  (4.1268-9), Byron turns the culture of tourism his poem inhabits and participates
                  in against itself. When the moon rises over the Coliseum again in stanza 144, it rises
                  with a different kind of “magic,” with the power to “raise the dead” (4.1295). The
                  “Heroes” who haunt this ruin are the victims, not the victors, of empire. This is
                  the grim lesson of the Coliseum for Byron: “Rome and her Ruin past Redemption’s skill,
                  / The World, the same wide den—of thieves, or what you will” (4.1304-5). </p>
               <p>The cultural logic of ruin/restoration in <em>Childe Harold</em> 4 reverses that of <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em>. It shares with Barbauld’s argument in <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em> the conviction that the ruins of empire live on both as idealized cultural property
                  and as sites of critical and potentially liberatory knowledge. Near the end of the
                  letter to Hobhouse that introduces Canto 4, Byron comments on Britain’s post-war triumphalism
                  in terms congruent with if not identical to Barbauld’s wartime vision of a grim future
                  reckoning: “What Italy has gained by the late transfer of nations, it were useless
                  for an Englishman to enquire, till it become ascertained that England has acquired
                  something more than a permanent army and a suspended Habeas Corpus; it is enough for
                  them to look at home. For what they have done abroad, and especially in the South,
                  ‘Verily they will have their reward,’ and at no very distant period” (Byron 124).
                  This understanding of England’s role, now in post- rather than pre-Waterloo transfers
                  of wealth and power, cuts directly against the idealizing patriotism of Hemans’s <em>Restoration</em>—and of its contradictory sequel, <em>Modern Greece and the Elgin Marbles</em>.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The contradiction is overt: in the earlier poem Britain is celebrated for “restoring”
                     Italian artistic property expropriated by the French; in the latter, it is Britain’s
                     own expropriation of sculptural ruins from the Parthenon that is cause for culminating
                     celebration.

                              when he denounces Modern Greece as “trash,” “good for nothing,” in a letter to Murray
                              of 4 September 1817 (Byron’s Letters and Journals 5. 262-3), probably because he did
                              not know that the anonymous author was Hemans. Ironically—and astonishingly—the reviewer
                              of Modern Greece in the New British Ladies’ Magazine conjectured that the anonymous
                              author was Byron himself; see Wolfson’s headnote in Hemans, Selected Poems, 34.</span></div>
                     </div> What links <em>The Restoration</em> and <em>Modern Greece</em> across this striking shift in Britain’s role, however, is an idealized, explicitly
                     “romantic” discourse of ruin-value ideologically tied to myths of ancient Greco-Roman
                     political freedom, and to a belief in Britain as the modern imperial successor to
                     Greek and Roman greatness. It has been argued, initially by Susan Wolfson and then
                     somewhat differently by Francesco Crocco, that the idealizing patriotic emphasis of
                     Hemans’s philhellenism was motivated by her determination to gain credibility for
                     women poets working in poetic genres still dominated by men. The persuasiveness of
                     this view, however, further complicates a poetic agenda devoted to the idea that post-Napoleonic
                     Britain “has[ ] power to be what Athens e’er hath been” (line 990).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The “power” Hemans celebrates in <em>Modern Greece</em> involves her redefining “empire” in entirely mental terms. What we see in the vestiges
                  or traces of Greek ruins is “the awful wreck of mind, / That weareth still a glory
                  in decay” (lines 285-6). Antithetically, the conquering power of Ottoman Islam is
                  represented as crudely material and primitive; it derives from “Regions” that are
                  literally and figuratively barren, “to intellect a desert space” (lines 345-7). Greek
                  “ruin” is the result of barbaric Islamic conquest—and of the decay of the Greek “race.”
                  As material phenomenon, however, ruin now becomes the distinctive form of “Mind’s
                  unconquer’d power” (line 390). “Attica” was and is, for Hemans, both “empire” and
                  “little sphere, whose soul-illumined round / Concentrated each sunbeam of the mind”
                  (lines 691-4). The idealizing of “ruin” as mental trace or reflection becomes especially
                  evident as Hemans varies the vocabulary of “form” to include “archetype” (“Bright
                  archetypes of all the grand and fair,” line 834) and “model” (“nations rising to their
                  fame afar, / Still to thy model turn,” line 840; “art hath won a world in models pure
                  as thine,” line 950). An abstracted and purified aesthetic glory is what enables the
                  poem’s ultimate transfer of “power” via the culture of ruins from ancient Greece to
                  modern Britain.</p>
               <p>If ruin-as-form is the repository of ancient but still readable genius, it is also
                  the place where the life of the mind merges most affectively with organic nature:

                  of empire. In Hemans, this tension is replaced either by harmonious reciprocity between
                  nature and culture or, in some of the poem’s more arresting moments, by a melancholy
                  that borders on the macabre: </p>

               <p> Such somber, Wordsworthian hauntings depend on a kind of anti-pathetic fallacy, on
                  organic nature’s obliviousness to the pathos of human mortality. In the rhetoric of
                  Modern Greece they supplement the “secret magic” of Grecian ruins by giving the vestiges
                  of “Mind’s unconquer’d power” (line 390) an additional “romantic” charm.</p>
               <p>The poem’s concluding celebration of the Elgin Marbles begins by preemptively and
                  defensively linking “those” critical of Britain’s acquisition to the barbaric “conquerors
                  of Minerva’s land”: “Oh! Live there those who view with scornful eyes / All that attests
                  the brightness of thy prime?” (lines 851-2). The link is extended in the following
                  stanza’s claim that “No patriot feeling binds them to the soil” (line 865), where
                  the adjective “patriot” merges Greek and British loyalty. But it is the broader merging
                  of national and universal interests that is decisive. The universalizing agenda in
                  Hemans’s poem is crucially different from Byron’s and Shelley’s internationalism (“We
                  are all Greeks,” <em>Preface to Hellas</em>, Shelley 4431). From Hemans’s perspective the real “Spoilers” are Elgin’s critics,
                  who refuse to recognize that “Thy relics, Athens! borne to other lands, / Claim homage
                  still to thee from every heart” (lines 873-4). Hemans offers here a Regency version
                  of the central argument of Cuno’s <em>Who Owns Antiquity?</em>, with its reiterated case on behalf of the “universal museum,” the “museum dedicated
                  to ideas, not ideologies, the museum of international, indeed universal aspirations,
                  and not of nationalist limitations” (Cuno xxxii). Hemans is more forthright than Cuno
                  in acknowledging that, historically, these “universal” institutions just happen to
                  be located in imperialist metropoles. In fact it is Britain’s future role as imperial
                  power that generates the energy of Hemans’s conclusion: </p>

                     as well as ruin-critic. The question that makes all the difference, as Barbauld and
                     Byron differently make evident, is whether or not we awaken from what haunts us in
                     the ruins of empire to what can enable us to transform survival into freedom.</p>

               to Columbus (“Thy world, Columbus, shall be free”). See the note on the last ten lines
               of the poem in Barbauld, <em>Poems</em>, 317. The final line may be read as indicating that in the future the “new world”
               of South America will be liberated from and no longer belong to Columbus and the European
               imperial power he represents.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">Byron makes no mention of this reversal of perspective on national cultural property
               when he denounces <em>Modern Greece</em> as “trash,” “good for nothing,” in a letter to Murray of 4 September 1817 (<em>Byron’s Letters and Journals</em> 5. 262-3), probably because he did not know that the anonymous author was Hemans.
               Ironically—and astonishingly—the reviewer of <em>Modern Greece</em> in the <em>New British Ladies’ Magazine</em> conjectured that the anonymous author was Byron himself; see Wolfson’s headnote in
               Hemans, <em>Selected Poems</em>, 34.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               ruins. The emigrant/immigrant status of Barbauld’s returning “pilgrims” may well have
               influenced Hemans’s stanzas on Greek emigration to Asia and America (stanzas X-XX).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
