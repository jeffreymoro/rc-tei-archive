               <h2><span class="head"> </span></h2>
               <p>Our world appears to be on the brink of disaster, an appearance that is itself disastrous.
                  The disaster of disaster is that disaster is everywhere, all the time: while on the
                  one hand it appears obvious that disaster should be the exception that proves the
                  rule of a generally non-disastrous world, in actuality no non-disastrous moment arrives.
                  Like a deer in the headlights, thinking is paralyzed by disaster. Whether this is
                  strictly a function of modernity, beginning with the Romantic period, or whether it
                  is a function of disaster as such remains to be seen. But what Naomi Klein accurately,
                  but not thoroughly, calls “the shock doctrine” is the capitalist norm: the state of
                  exception is capitalist reality. For Klein, capitalists fleece the rest of us when
                  they need a whip-round. For Marxism, this is the normal state of affairs, the deep
                  structure of capitalism as such, which must keep on accumulating more money in order
                  to exist. And perhaps it is also the reality of actually existing socialism: to avert
                  the imminent disaster in capitalism, a socialist emergency must be declared. </p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is possible, argue Žižek and Badiou, that ecology is simply the latest version
                     of capitalist disaster ideology at work. 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See for example Žižek, Tragedy; http://www.lacan.com/zizecology1.htm; http://www.lacan.com/Žižekecologyvideo.html.</span></div>
                     </div> For instance, to ward off what is still seen (weirdly) as an imminent disaster of
                     global warming, it is entirely likely that a green bubble based on derivatives of
                     the existing carbon trading market will eventually eclipse the recent implosion of
                     global capital. (This is weird because science keeps telling us that the disastrous
                     climate change has already occurred and that we are now living in its aftermath.)
                     Nevertheless, truly to think what I call <em>the ecological thought</em> (and I believe that there is a thinking that is truthful here) is to recalibrate what
                     we mean by disaster, such that ecological thinking and practice must entail dropping
                     the imminence of disaster, with its resulting states of exception. This thinking would
                     be non-disastrous both in content and in form.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Take plutonium for instance: a disaster that has already occurred, and one that will
                  continue for at least 24 100 years. Just how many of those years do we think will
                  be capitalist? Do we seriously imagine that the end of the world is more likely than
                  the end of capitalism? Or consider global warming, the cause of the Sixth Mass Extinction
                  Event (there have been five since the beginning of life on Earth). This is not a disaster
                  waiting to happen. Atmospheric CO<span>2</span> levels are now well above the safety ceiling of 350 parts per million (ppm). Since
                  Neolithic times, humans have lived under about 275ppm. Current levels are around 387ppm
                  and climbing by about 2ppm annually (350.org). Percy Shelley was already talking about
                  pollution in 1813: “the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities; the exhalations of chemical
                  processes” (Note 17 to <em>Queen Mab</em>, 1.406–23 (411)). Or take petroleum: the product of whatever disaster wiped out the
                  dinosaurs (Žižek, <em>Defense</em>, 441–442). Thinking of past disasters causes thinking to leak out around the threat
                  of imminent disaster, like water seeping through a badly constructed dam. In the language
                  of fighter pilots, disaster “cones down” our attention to focus on a singularity that
                  is strictly unthinkable.</p>
               <p>We can visualize a time before and a time after disaster, in which disaster remains
                  as a fundamental category of our visualization. What about thinking beyond disaster,
                  or is thinking forever caught in disaster's shadow? Art imagines post-apocalyptic
                  worlds: Romanticism in particular is full of them, from Byron's 
                  “Darkness”
                  to <em>The Last Man</em>. Is poetry, as Allen Grossman puts it, “the postponement of the end of the world,”
                  and how Romantic is this postponement (Grossman and Halliday 336)? Or is there another
                  way to think, without disaster, a non-disastrous thinking, that isn't just postponement?
                  And is there any Romantic literature that can help us think this way? In this essay,
                  I shall consider three writers who adopt three quite different positions concerning
                  disaster. Percy Shelley, argues the essay, is fundamentally disaster-prone: despite
                  his proclaimed anti-capitalism, and indeed his objective usefulness to progressive
                  and socialist thinking, his poetry even anticipates some of the more recent moves
                  of global capital. I shall argue that Shelley did, to his credit, eventually figure
                  out (at least on the level of artistic form) that his poetic language was trapped
                  in disaster mode. William Blake satirizes the subject position from which disaster
                  becomes visible, in his special mode of ideology critique—part of his larger project
                  of trying to change the attitudes that come bundled with ideas such as disaster. William
                  Wordsworth emerges as a genuine poet of non-disaster, or post-disaster: his poetry
                  is perhaps the only one of the three still capable of performing something like thinking
                  while caught in disaster's headlights.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">The Disaster of Disaster</span></h2>
               <p>Strictly speaking, ecology is a discourse of non-disaster. Disaster is literally an
                  unfortunate star (<em>dis</em> plus <em>astron</em>), an astrological misfortune. This accident is a portent of things to come on Earth:
                  </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">
                     <div class="l">Stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, </div>
                     <div class="l">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, </div>
                     <div class="l">Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands, </div>
                     <div class="l">Was sick almost to dooms-day with eclipse.</div>
                  </div> (<em>Hamlet</em> 1.1.118)</blockquote>
               <p> In order to have disasters such as this, one needs an integrated world in which certain
                  astral phenomena are interpreted according to a stable key. The stars spatter the
                  edges of this world, illuminating it with their obscure but significant tracery, patterned
                  in recognizable constellations that are given rules for conjunction and disjunction.
                  Ecology is the collapse of astrology, and not simply because it belongs to a “secular”
                  era. Ecology abolishes the star-studded dome of the world insofar as ecological science
                  and ecological awareness force upon humans the collapse of any significant background
                  or horizon against which human activity can be placed and measured (Heidegger 39–122;
                  Morton, <em>Ecology</em> 94–101). Astrology turns the stars into significant documents, legible texts. Ecological
                  disasters are precisely not caused by the action of a beyond, for in ecology, there
                  is no beyond, no elsewhere, no “yonder,” however remote. Life forms are made from
                  their environments, including sunshine and chemicals from exploding stars. There is
                  no way rigidly to separate the biosphere and the non-biosphere. If the Earth had no
                  magnetic field, for instance, life forms would be sizzled by solar winds: one good
                  sign of extra-terrestrial life is planets with magnetic fields. As if life, once it
                  gets going, includes all that goes around it and before it: terrestrial oxygen and
                  iron are bi-products of bacterial metabolism, and hills are made of crushed shells
                  and bones.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In the technical literature of disaster management, an ecological disaster is precisely
                     an event for which “inside” resources do not suffice to provide a remedy—help from
                     “outside” must be brought in (European Environmental Agency, “disaster”). 
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                              (2)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The International Disaster Database defines a disaster such that at least one of the
                              following occur: ten or more people are reported killed; one hundred people are reported
                              affected; a state of emergency is declared; a call for international assistance is
                              made.</span></div>
                     </div> This rather elegantly encapsulates the problem—there remains no “inside,” or everything
                     is “inside” in the sense that there is no longer a beyond, since the beyond is only
                     legible on the horizon of a here and now.</p>
               </div>
               <p>We can only conclude, then, that “ecological disaster” is an oxymoron. To what purpose?
                  Paul Virilio predicted a long while ago that environmental threats would allow the
                  state to stage rehearsals for military and industrial displays of power (Virilio).
                  This is not congruent with ecological reality. The trouble with ecological awareness
                  is that it is drastically non-teleological. Life science has demonstrated that life
                  as such has no fixed, rigid origin: this is the lesson of the ironically titled <em>The Origin of Species</em>, in which Darwin successfully undermines every possible biological distinction (species
                  versus species, species versus variant, variant versus monstrosity, and so on) (Darwin,
                  <em>Origin</em>, 34, 94, 100, 109, 131, 133, 141). The rhetoric of disaster is the tropology of an
                  absolute end, a sudden misfortune. How sudden is the half-life of plutonium: what
                  is the span of that disaster? Does it have peaks and troughs? When did the disaster
                  called global warming begin? Is it at all possible to say with a straight face that
                  on a certain date at a certain time, a threshold will have been crossed that guarantees
                  the arrival of apocalyptic catastrophe?</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There is a rhetoric of catastrophe in which the narrator overleaps apocalypse altogether.
                     It is as if one could watch a video of one's own funeral. Of course, literature enables
                     us to fantasize this all the time: the act of narrating in the first person is just
                     this kind of doubling. But the totality of global ecological disaster, of which one
                     consequence might be human extinction (as in Mary Shelley's <em>The Last Man</em>), means that there is strictly no one around in the future to watch any videos whatsoever.
                     The ghostly presence of ourselves, spectators to a future in which we do not strictly
                     exist, can only be vicarious at best and is often sadistic. Elegies for deaths that
                     have not yet occurred, they mourn for the still living in a way that only repeats
                     the dreaded dualism of subject and object that many environmentalists see as public
                     enemy number one. For the subject who is reading the elegy is different from the subject
                     whose death is being witnessed, even if they have the same name, and are to some extent
                     the same person. Radically different: separated by an ontological firewall, indeed,
                     such that ecological elegy is a form of the Cretan liar paradox (“I am lying”).

                     </div> Byron's 
                     “Darkness”
                      manages this uncanny doubling by staging disaster as a dream. Shelley's <em>The Last Man</em> imagines a further future in which some people come across the story. Nevertheless,
                     in both cases, part of the pleasure of works such as these is that one can't help
                     thinking for a moment that one is voyeuristically privy to a future in which one does
                     not exist.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The ideology and the rhetoric of ecological disaster, then, have nothing to do with
                  actual ecology. They are “environmentalist” in the same sense as some ideas about
                  gender are sexist. That is, they set up the environment as a metaphysical construct
                  on a pedestal, torn down, built up, worshipped, admired as an aesthetic object, and
                  so on. Aesthetic images of the environment are predicated on disaster: we are shown
                  we want to avert it; we are compelled to imagine it vividly. This seems like a truism:
                  recordings of whale sounds and Douglas Adams's book <em>Last Chance to See</em> would not have appeared if human-caused extinction were not on the cards (<a class="link_ref" href="#WC" title="">see Works Cited</a>). It is always unfortunate when reality coincides with fantasy. The trouble is not
                  so much the quite legitimate wish to preserve species from dying out through human
                  misuse. The problem is in the attitude engendered in the disaster narratives we keep
                  telling ourselves. For at least one of these attitudes happens to provide some strong
                  cement for the maintenance of an oppressive status quo.</p>
               <p>If we are going to think ecology beyond capitalism, we shall need to think beyond
                  disaster and beyond disaster speak. It would be preferable to refer to ecological
                  difficulty as a “drag,” in both performative and work-related senses. Ecological difficulty
                  will beset us for the long run, perhaps forever (whatever that means). And ecology
                  is profoundly a view that accommodates display, performance, sheer aesthetic illusion
                  (for example in Darwin's theory of sexual selection), and so on (Darwin, <em>Descent</em>). Take the evolutionary notion of “satisficing.” A rabbit is not really a rabbit.
                  It is not that a rabbit by any other name would act as nose-twitchy. All the way down,
                  there is no rabbit, no rabbit flavored DNA. And all the way up: rabbits act like rabbits,
                  and thus pass on their genome. This is called “satisficing,” a form of performativity
                  (Dawkins 156). If a life form does its thing without dying, its descendant can keep
                  whatever it does. The fact that homosexuals exist across a vast array of sexually
                  reproducing life forms, for instance, indicates that evolution has no problem with
                  them. In fact, heterosexual behavior floats on top of a vast ocean of cloning, transgender
                  switching, homosexuality and intersexuality (Roughgarden). A genome could not care
                  less if its vehicle acts like someone else's idea of a rabbit. This includes having
                  mutations that not all rabbits might have. There is no essence called race, or gender,
                  or species—or environment. Thus there is no fixed gender against which “deviations”
                  are measured as disastrous.</p>
               <p>Ultimately, thinking ecology beyond disaster means thinking ecology without nature;
                  and even thinking ecology without environmentalism. Looked at one way, evolution is
                  a long history of disasters, such as extinction: which is to say, since disaster is
                  everywhere, it is of no cosmic significance. Ecological awareness demands that we
                  care for ourselves and nonhumans on time and space scales far in excess of the usual
                  parameters, even if the parameters are based on modified forms of self interest that
                  include greater numbers under the umbrella of “kith and kin” (Parfit, 355–357, 361,
                  371–377; Morton, 
                  “Hyperobjects”
                  ). It just does not make sense to try and find self-interest-based reasons to care
                  for a “hyperobject” such as plutonium 239, which has a half-life of 24 100 years:
                  what a drag. The kind of excitement demanded by disaster tropology will not serve
                  us well. We need something like Wordsworth with his adverse reaction to the “gross
                  and violent stimulants” of his literary age (Wordsworth, 
                  “Preface,”
                  746).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Percy Shelley</span></h2>
               <p>Are there archaeological remnants of oxymoronic “disaster ecology” in the British
                  Romantic period? And do these remains contain anything like a critique? Percy Shelley
                  is forever thinking of planetary and solar disaster. He favors the global over the
                  local in a way that would scandalize the typical Romantic ecocritic. For this very
                  reason his writing seems apt for an era of global warming. The poetry performs aesthetically
                  what ecological damage and global positioning technology perform in the real, swallowing
                  horizons and worlds (Morton, 
                  “Shelley's Green Desert”
                  ). This disorientation is indeed disastrous, a symptom of a general collapse of local
                  reference points.</p>

                     to the operations of celestial mechanisms. In a massive expansion of the classical
                     messenger speech (much of <em>Hellas</em> works this way), the workings of history are played out as astronomical portents.
                     Hassan curses Greece using the hyperbolic language of disaster: “Famine and Pestilence
                     / And Panic” (439–440) will ensue wherever “dews fall, or the angry sun look down
                     / With poisoned light” (438–439). Naturally, this language is framed by the encompassing
                     vision of Enlightenment, of stars beyond sun and moon threatening the heliocentric
                     world of a corrupt God and the dark theodicy of “The tempest of the Omnipotence of
                     God / Which sweeps all things to their appointed doom” (449–450).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The classical tropology of the globe was already out of date: some more up to date
                  poetry turned to what I've called the poetics of spice, the capitalist advertising
                  language that weaves together Earth's far flung corners via trade routes and precious
                  commodities (Morton, <em>Spice</em> 39–108). Shelley was well aware of this new menu of poetic devices, and used them
                  frequently and knowingly in allusions to Milton, one of their first great exponents.
                  The poetics of spice is significantly not a poetics of disaster but of continued and
                  undisturbed flow: a fantasy of luxury that airbrushed the ongoing disaster of slavery
                  and colonialism out of the global picture, rather like an Archer Daniels Midland 
                  “Supermarket to the World”
                  advert today. Although knowing this may upset the environmentalist apple cart, the
                  first stirrings of global awareness came from the heart of commercial capitalist fantasy,
                  not from within opposition to capitalism.</p>
               <p>Shelley, however, needed to think and imagine how it had all gone so wrong. He was
                  deeply aware of how the poetics of spice was tainted by commerce, and often uses it
                  perhaps rather too forcefully to make this very point. Unable to theorize fully how
                  disaster is intrinsic to capitalism (he writes it off as a rapacious, excessive farcical
                  repetition of aristocratic power), Shelley resorted to language that talks about the
                  disturbing of a fundamental balance. In this he shares much with contemporary anti-capitalist
                  writing such as Naomi Klein's. Yet Shelley is perhaps unique for the deadly seriousness
                  with which he articulates the imbalance. This becomes a matter of scientific and philosophical
                  positing, not just rhetorical play. For Shelley, Earth was a perpetual disaster, in
                  the precise astrological sense: a mishap in a planetary body. Earth's axis is bent.
                  This terrestrial disaster was caused by human injustice, including the eating of animal
                  flesh. In the utopian future, the Earth's axis is righted and the planet orbits “straight
                  up” around the sun. Ironically, Shelley's evidence for the disaster, and its solution,
                  is a snapshot of what later became known as continental drift and climate change.

                     points. It is exceedingly probable, from many considerations, that this obliquity
                     will gradually diminish, until the equator coincides with the ecliptic: the nights
                     and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year, and probably the
                     seasons also. There is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the
                     perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect; or that
                     there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the
                     human species. It is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease, and that,
                     in the present state of the climates of the earth, health, in the true and comprehensive
                     sense of the word, is out of the reach of civilized man. Astronomy teaches us that
                     the earth is now in its progress, and that the poles are every year becoming more
                     and more perpendicular to the ecliptic. The strong evidence afforded by the history
                     of mythology, and geological researches, that some event of this nature has taken
                     place already, affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation,
                     as has been surmised by some late astronomers. Bones of animals peculiar to the torrid
                     zone have been found in the north of Siberia, and on the banks of the river Ohio.
                     Plants have been found in the fossil state in the interior of Germany, which demand
                     the present climate of Hindostan for their production. The researches of M. Bailly
                     establish the existence of a people who inhabited a tract in Tartary 49º north latitude,
                     of greater antiquity than either the Indians, the Chinese, or the Chaldeans, from
                     whom these nations derive their sciences and theology. We find, from the testimony
                     of ancient writers, that Britain, Germany, and France were much colder than at present,
                     and that their great rivers were annually frozen over. Astronomy teaches us also that
                     since this period the obliquity of the earth's position has been considerably diminished.
                     (<em>Poems</em>, 1.373–374)’</span> Extraordinarily, then, borrowing from the ideas of Laplace and Cabanis, Shelley holds
                  that a more just human society will literally rebalance Earth's axis. Shelley thus
                  produced countless images we now associate with the photograph 
                  “Earthrise,”
                  the image of a fragile blue Earth from the Moon popularized by Al Gore. Shelley wants
                  desperately to achieve a point of view that is big enough in time and space to account
                  for disaster: as Archimedes' epigraph to <em>Queen Mab</em> puts it, “Give me somewhere to stand and I will move the Earth.” And he means it.
                  He literally means that Earth's axis can be corrected through progressive cultural
                  and political praxis. The trouble is Shelley finds it almost impossible to imagine
                  transformation without disaster: the fortunate disaster of the moving of Earth itself
                  is sure to be tremendous, shuddering life forms, not a peaceful working out of some
                  inner logic. Transitions from disaster to peace resound with the grinding of rhetorical
                  gears. Thus in <em>Laon and Cythna</em> everyone fights everyone else until someone yells for it to stop; immediately following
                  the carnage, the people stage a pacifist, vegetarian festival (Morton, <em>Shelley</em> 110–116). This implies that everyone has within them the capacity to hear the compassion
                  and reason within the yelling, and the capacity to turn on a dime to act on these
                  impulses. Yet these capacities are precisely not there: why else would Earth's axis
                  be so kinked? Shelley wants transitions that are precisely un-kinky, but what he gives
                  us is, on the figurative level at least, maximal kink.</p>
               <p>Earth-righting justice includes proto-feminism, atheism, democracy, some form of non-capitalist
                  economy, and vegetarianism. The sound minds in sound bodies who will enjoy this future
                  state will live in harmony with their world, conceived not as a patchwork of localities,
                  but as a genuine globality, as Book 9 of <em>Queen Mab</em> makes clear: “Oh Happy Earth! Reality of Heaven!” (9.1). Shelley's somewhat future-primitive
                  imagery imagines the future state as a blissful global village in which nonhumans
                  “sport around” human habitations, in a rewriting of Isaiah 11 that strikes us now
                  as rather New Agey (<em>The Daemon of the World</em>, 444). For instance, the following passage strikingly situates the future humans
                  on a republican lawn, level and smooth like the metaphorical level playing field:

               <p> The fusion of Biblical millenarianism and utterly sincere Enlightenment nonviolence
                  and reason produces the almost psychedelic image of the baby feeding the “green and
                  golden basilisk” with its friendly tongue (8.86). It is one of Shelley's many vivid
                  synecdochic sketches for a peaceful world whose every corner looks like this. This
                  is a world without disaster, whose disasters are all past. The happy future people
                  can look up to the sky and know that everything has been set right—not by some <span class="foreign">deus ex machina</span>, to be sure, but by their own hands and brains. The world has a center—the human
                  habitation, represented minimally by the “mother's door” (8.84), around which spreads
                  the rest of Earth's inhabitants in what appear to be concentric circles derived from
                  Pope's <em>Essay on Man</em> (3.27, 49–52). Vegetarianism serves as a hook (in Lacanian, a “point de caption”)
                  that links individual impulses to social welfare, and human society to nature, seeming
                  to ground the future in something we can practice right now (3.147–67).</p>
               <p>Yet while in Pope there is a reactionary knowingness that disaster continues, Shelley
                  truly wants to image a time without disaster, figured as a time of no meat eating
                  (not even for the lions) that we can achieve by not eating meat, among other things.
                  For Shelley, the Garden of Eden is a future state. Human being is and has been a disaster,
                  beginning with the Promethean (technological, that is) disaster of cooking animal
                  food. Thus at the end of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> the Earth herself is finally able to articulate how disastrous violence is transfigured:</p>
               <blockquote class="quote">
                  <div class="stanza">

                  </div> (4.400–405)</blockquote>
               <p>The trouble is, how do we get to the future Eden? As argued just above, this would
                  require the very state of mind (the nonviolent, non-disastrous one) that Shelley reckons
                  is unavailable to us in our disastrous present. All right then, try vegetarianism
                  in the mean time. But here the problem repeats itself: in order to become vegetarian,
                  one must be nonviolent (Morton, <em>Shelley</em> 126–169). Vegetarianism also presupposes the mindset it claims to generate. This
                  recursion is evidence of ideology at work. Shelley is in a bind because he cannot
                  think past disaster. How do you convince the unconscious (Demogorgon), which has no
                  sense of time, to behave differently—to imagine things differently? Shelley's progressive
                  political view wants this difference to be possible, but his poetics creates enormous
                  difficulties.</p>
               <p>What ecological thinking, emerging during his lifetime, opens up, Shelley includes
                  in his work. Yet with another hand, Shelley domesticates the disastrous vision, turning
                  disaster into a singularity through which human history will pass, as the rather grisly
                  introduction to Book 8 shows: “Time! … Render up thy half-devoured babes” (8.3–5).
                  It is hard not to think that at some level, the remarkably anti-capitalist and prescient
                  Shelley is stuck in a capitalist ideological mode, rather like the Enlightenment <span class="foreign">philosophes</span> he so admired and whom Marx later criticized for being as fetishistic, in their way,
                  as the “primitive” believers they undermine.</p>
               <p>Shelley appears trapped in the tropology of disaster, like an insect beating itself
                  against a glass window. Since what appears to be required is a dramatic inner transformation
                  that includes transcending prejudices of all kinds, how is it possible to think the
                  moment of change? Shelley obsesses over how to transition from the time of disaster
                  to the time of no disaster. It is only perhaps at the very end, with <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, that he opts for the judo-like approach of staying with the moment of disaster,
                  inventing a poetics of disaster appropriate to this staying. Yet it isn't quite right
                  to call this incomplete text a judo move. It's more as if Shelley was at last content
                  to see the implications of his poetic imagination through to some conclusions that
                  might be uncomfortable for the kinds of progressive box into which he fitted his politics.
                  For <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is incomplete both as literary text, and in terms of thinking through and beyond
                  the political and philosophical ramifications of disaster.</p>
               <p>The strange beginning of Shelley's <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, elucidated in Paul De Man's essay “Shelley Disfigured,” is a poetics of disaster,
                  literally a dis-astron, since the sun's weirdly sudden rising is the basis for De
                  Man's deconstructive essay. Talk about a “disaster in the sun” as Horatio puts it:

               <p> Here is the “good disaster” of an Enlightenment sunrise, and the gears don't grind—but
                  what acceleration! It is as if Shelley had overheard Wordsworth's paean to the French
                  Revolution, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive” (11.4), and teased out the queasy
                  horror—not of executing aristos, but the horror within bliss as such, its automatic,
                  orgasmic otherness. De Man's reading traces the intense play of light in Shelley's
                  poem, as blinding as it is revealing (De Man). This intensity is in part a reflex
                  of what he calls the “brusque” artificiality of the poem's guiding linguistic act,
                  positing. The inversion of the figure and the figured (“Swift as a spirit…the Sun”
                  (1–2)) is one of Shelley's typical uses of what old rhetorical manuals call <span class="foreign">obscurum per obscures</span>, describing something in terms of something less clear (Morton, 
                  “Shelley, Nature and Culture”
                  ). This device spells disaster, separating the figurative from the signified levels
                  while making the signified moot: poetry achieves escape velocity from pointing to
                  things outside of language, exploding beautifully in successful failure, like fireworks.
                  The first four lines dispense with measurably slow empirical dawns and the depth of
                  poetic tradition about the sun in a stroke (a sunstroke?): “The impossible position
                  is precisely the figure, the trope, metaphor as a violent—and not as a dark—light,
                  a deadly Apollo”—disaster (De Man 117–118). Light starts to become nuclear radiation.
                  It is as if it's beginning to dawn on Shelley that disaster is intrinsic to his poetics.</p>
               <p>The disruptive, fluid freefall of this poem's <span class="foreign">terza rima</span> enacts disaster at a textural level: you can feel it in the disorienting interweaving
                  of negation upon negation. Finally, Shelley appears content to court disaster. The
                  vertiginous way in which visions and dreams appear caught within one another in a
                  non-teleological parody of medieval allegory leaves the narrator trapped within the
                  glass of disaster, against which we saw Shelley's earlier work to be beating itself.
                  For to discover oneself in a dream, only to find that the exit from the dream is another
                  dream, puts in peril the neatly teleological story of disaster transcended or averted.
                  When everything is a disaster, it is not that nothing is a disaster: rather, we enter
                  a world of risk assessment without an exit, and find ourselves unable to shake the
                  monkey of too much consciousness off our backs (Beck).</p>
               <p>Perhaps, then, there is some truth in the idea that <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is deliberately unfinished—at least this intuition is congruent with some of the
                  conclusions the poem forces upon us. I prefer, however, to think of this poem as radically
                  impossible to finish by Shelley at the time of his death. Where do you go once you've
                  figured out that the future (and the future of your poem) leads you into another ream
                  of disaster? In this sense the unresolved poetic problem is also an unresolved philosophical
                  and political problem. Shelley's palpable boredom with old solutions, however, should
                  not lure us into concluding that he had given up on revolution. Quite the opposite:
                  the unhappiness with fake endings is a reflex of a continued revolutionary project.</p>

               <p>Perhaps the most obvious Blake “disaster poem” is his Song of Experience, 
                  “The Tyger.”
                  The tiger itself is “burning” (1) like an asteroid fallen to Earth, “In the forests
                  of the night” (2). It's thus no surprise that stars appear at a crucial moment: </p>

                  </div>
               </blockquote>
               <p> At the climax of the poem, Blake is satirizing the attitude that sees the tiger as
                  a terrifying product of a terrifying God, akin to Hegel's beautiful soul, whose own
                  gaze is the evil that it sees in the world at large (Hegel 383–409). The beautiful
                  soul, for whom the world is evil, is a type of environmentalist ideology, which makes
                  
                  “The Tyger”
                  even more apt for our purposes (Morton, <em>Ecology</em> 109–123). The narrator's description of the stars throwing down their spears arrives
                  at the climax of a series of industrial and infernal images of the tiger's physical
                  construction. The description serves as a kind of establishing shot that puts the
                  artificer's handiwork in perspective, a wide-angle lens on the Universe. The narrator
                  wishes to convey the cosmic dismay felt at the arrival of the tiger.</p>
               <p>The personified stars do not portend evil in this case as true astral “disasters”
                  would—they witness it. Their reaction of horrified pity is in accord with the narrator's
                  objectifying, materialistic gaze—they are the evil they see. Evil thus already haunts
                  the Universe, in the form of an unconscious subjectivity that sees certain phenomena
                  as material embodiments of evil, as if from a great distance. If the stars are angelic
                  titans (Lucifer being the chief among them), then God is the exception, the one that
                  creates an evil universe, much to their dismay. Yet evil has already manifested in
                  the form of an evil gaze. </p>
               <p>Blake comes close to articulating a theory of disaster that is highly relevant to
                  this essay's proposal that we think beyond disaster. This is unsurprising, since his
                  work is ideology critique through and through, and since the materialism and capitalism
                  that spawn disaster, and disaster thinking, were operational by the time he was writing.
                  Like Hegel, Blake had figured out that ideas come bundled with unconscious attitudes,
                  and he was determined to expose them. The portrayal of the tiger as terrifying misses
                  the uncanny familiarity of the tiger, hinted at in the cuddly toy illumination that
                  accompanies the poem. This missing of the mark resembles the way in which sublime
                  Nature, objectified as wilderness, is set up to loom around, beyond and behind human
                  activity like a distant mountain range. The reified sublimity passes too quickly over
                  the distressing intimacy and “lameness” (to use an appropriate modern adjective) of
                  human and nonhuman interaction. </p>

               <p>The most ambiguous disaster ecology is found, unsurprisingly, in that master of ambiguity
                  and anticlimax, William Wordsworth. The “dream of the Arab” episode, a spot of time
                  that occurs in the fifth book of <em>The Prelude</em>, is strictly about an apocalyptic flood; and about poetry as the medium, the telephone,
                  down which this telos is heard. Wordsworth's image within the dream of the book as
                  telephonic shell is remarkably phonocentric: intriguingly spiraled and opaque, silent
                  and mysterious, you don't even read it with your eyes, you have to put it to your

               <p> Wordsworth has been said to open an imaginary space in which film technology becomes
                  significant, in his liquid long form poems. Here he appears to do something similar
                  to the telephone. What you hear when you hold it to your ear, like a pre-recorded
                  message from the future, is the sound of the end of the world: who recorded it, this
                  <span class="foreign">phonos</span> of the <span class="foreign">telos</span>? This sound, heard in the present moment of the beach as a hugely amplified ambient
                  whisper like the sound of soft swirling waters in a seashell turned up high, is profoundly
                  environmental in form as well as in content. The disturbingly evocative voice without
                  a body is a floating sound coming from nowhere: in the term invented by Pierre Schaeffer,
                  the pioneer of musique concrète, it is “acousmatic”—an automated sound that appears
                  to come from no identifiable source (Morton, <em>Ecology</em> 41–43).</p>
               <p>This sound is a “blast,” sound as disaster, somewhere between an explosion and a fanfare
                  on a brass instrument. Like a hi-fi speaker whose volume is dangerously high, the
                  shell might cause pain: a message delivery system so potent that one becomes vividly
                  aware of what Jakobson called the “contact,” the material medium of communication
                  as such (Jakobson). The alarm-like blast wavers disturbingly between speech and noise
                  and music (“harmony”): it is “loud” and “prophetic,” made of “articulate” sounds.
                  Yet the sound is in a language the dreamer does not recognize—thus a language from
                  a beyond, over the horizon, outside, reinforcing the notion that disaster is the outside
                  impinging on an inside; a language that is doubly foreign, yet also a “tongue,” as
                  if the narrator had a tongue in his ear. In the both–and logic of a dream (Freud asserts
                  that the unconscious knows no negation), beautifully modeled in Wordsworth's description
                  of simultaneous unintelligibility and intelligibility, the sound is both noise and
                  meaning, recognized as such even though the words cannot be understood. Three possibilities
                  are superimposed: the sound is inarticulate noise; the sound is articulate, meaningful
                  yet not understood; the sound is meaningful and understood. </p>
               <p>The telephonic shell is itself an alien technology, and the narrator's account of
                  the Don Quixote-like Arab impressing him with shiny gadgets is reminiscent of first
                  contact narratives. Yet the scene is inverted, as if modern technology (this is after
                  all a highly ambiguous account of books and reading) arrived from another world onto
                  English shores. With its shiny, iPhone-like nacre, the shell impresses, and the narrator
                  perhaps appears to undergo the assumed embarrassment of the indigenous person who
                  does not know what to do with the objects presented to him. Then space and time collapse
                  in apocalyptic fashion, and suddenly the end of the world is “at hand.” One cannot
                  help finding in this passage something that is indeed prophetic about the distance
                  collapsing technologies of the last two centuries. It is particularly strange, this
                  effect, considering that the entire passage is in the context of a meditation on the
                  already existing technology of books. With their world-ending promises of instant
                  presence, modern communication media do indeed resemble material symptoms of a disturbing
                  new metaphysics. Many times ecological criticism has labeled technology as such disastrous,
                  precisely insofar as it is the end of the world as a bounded place of distances and
                  opacities and hidden corners—worlds need horizons, and global warming reduces these
                  horizons to mere abstraction and false immediacy. </p>
               <p>The immersive sound of the seashore, the quietness here amplified so as to threaten
                  overwhelming (literally, over-whelming) noise, is heard throughout modern new age
                  and environmental music as the sounds of a disaster-stricken planet: disappearing
                  lifeworlds recorded for elegiac evocative pleasure. The innocent seeming hush of an
                  environmental soundscape is thus a threat of imminent destruction: as if the recoding
                  said, “I could be your last chance to hear a world such as this.” In these fragmentary
                  voices of “real world” ambience, global capital and imperial power are audible both
                  in their phantasmagorical energy and penetrating scientific gaze. Such fragile sonic
                  worlds are objects of sadistic pleasure and Schadenfreude, as well as the more obvious
                  marketing of the “oceanic feeling” that constitutes a core of the long history of
                  consumerism (Morton, <em>Ecology</em> 111–112). “World” is strictly a function of modernity, like the idea of the Middle
                  Ages.</p>
               <p>Like Magritte's <em><span class="foreign">La condition humaine</span></em>, a painting of a painting of a landscape placed within the landscape it has painted,
                  such that the actual landscape overlaps with it, Wordsworth's narrator hears apocalyptic
                  ambience on the seashore itself. This coincidence of fantasy and reality takes place
                  within a dream whose dreamer is himself situated on a seashore. The dreamer awakens:
                  the ocean is the same; disaster has been framed by the drag of the real. It's a typically
                  Wordsworthian anticlimax, a “spot of time,” a record of weakness, failure and collapse.
                  Wordsworth is enabling thinking to carry on around and through disaster.</p>
               <p>As failure, it's the exact opposite of Freud's record of the dream of the burning
                  boy, in which the boy signals that the dreamer must wake up and smell the real smoke.
                  Perhaps the role of the dream in Wordsworth's poem is more like Lacan's reinterpretation
                  of Freud: Lacan argues that to spare himself the anxiety of the murderous erotic fantasy,
                  the dreamer awakens to the drag of the actual fire (Lacan 57–60, 68–70). The real
                  disaster would be remaining within the dream and giving vent to one's violent fantasies.
                  This is indeed salutary in an ecological sense. Environmentalism is perhaps nothing
                  but the desire that one's dream—that one inhabits a meaningful and immersive “lifeworld”
                  surrounded by familiar but not uncanny nonhumans—remain undisturbed. The persistence
                  of this dream inhibits directly intervening in the realm of “life on Earth” for the
                  sake of life forms. In this sense, as counter-intuitive as it sounds, environmentalism
                  is hostile to ecology. </p>
