                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Romanticism and Disaster</em> considers and responds to the timely concept of devastated life by thinking about
                  how the capacity to read, interpret, and absorb disaster necessitates significant
                  changes in theory, ethics, and common life. What if the consequences or "experience"
                  of a disaster were less about psychic survival than an unblinking desire to face down
                  the disaster as a challenge to normative structures? The essays in this volume attend
                  to the rhetorical, epistemological, political, and social effects of romantic critique,
                  and reflect on how processes of destruction and reconstitution, ruination and survival,
                  are part and parcel of romanticism’s grappling with a negativity that haunts its corners.
                  Put in this way, "disaster" does not signal a referential event, but rather an undoing
                  of certain apparently prior categories of dwelling, and forces us to contemplate living
                  otherwise. In confronting the end of things, what are the conditions or possibilities
                  of existence amidst catastrophe? What is a crisis, and what kinds of challenges does
                  it occasion? What can be philosophically gained or lost by analyzing disaster in its
                  multiple sites, contexts, and instances?</p>

                     “Mary Wollstonecraft's Perpetual Disaster”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay reads the moments in the <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796) in which Mary Wollstonecraft imagines future disasters and grieves for losses
                  yet to come. Taking his cue from William Godwin's comment that her prejudices suffered
                  a "vehement concussion" from the events of the French Revolution, Juengel argues that
                  these moments of disastrous affect register a traumatic apprehension she cannot otherwise
                  articulate - not even in her <em>Historical and Moral View of the Origins and Progress of the French Revolution</em> (1794). Devastated by a wounding realization of revolutionary hope, Wollstonecraft
                  is "[h]aunted by what was to have been the future," and weaves "the time of revolutionary
                  politics with what we might call 'species time,' resulting in forms of untimeliness
                  that figure as disaster without end." Her sense of this disaster, so threatening to
                  the value of individual lives, is attuned to the discovery of a planetary "deep time"
                  that took place in the decades before and after the 1790s and to the prospect, articulated
                  two years later by Malthus, of an ongoing "disaster of sensation and feeling that
                  paradoxically moves the species toward life rather than death." Yet all these untimely
                  reflections may enable her to avoid confronting the disasters of the present, such
                  as the consequences of the fire that destroyed large portions of Copenhagen just before
                  her arrival there; the thought of disaster, she suggests, would relieve her from the
                  task of treading on "live ashes," on ills not yet reduced to scenes in fancy. Ultimately,
                  Juengel argues, these movements of disastrous thought may all speak of what Reinhardt
                  Koselleck describes as the radical temporalization of revolutionary time, a temporalization
                  to which Wollstonecraft ultimately responds with a generous passivity, with a more-than-Kantian
                  hospitality to disaster itself.</p>

                     “The Ruins of Empire and the Contradictions of Restoration: Barbauld, Byron, Hemans”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">This essay explores how Regency ruin culture developed at once as the apogee and the
                  ambivalently repressive (and repressed) symptom of British imperialism, articulating
                  the nuances of “Britain’s role in determining the trajectory of the Napoleonic imperial
                  project at moments unstably situated between triumph and catastrophe, commercial and
                  military pre-eminence and social crisis.” Working through Walter Benjamin's comments
                  on ruination in <em>The Arcades Project</em>, Keach marks out how the difference between a “canonical” and “critical” ruin culture
                  depends on gestures of delayed fascination tempered by an “awakening” that throws
                  the ruin into sudden critical knowledge. For Keach, the ruin is indelibly coupled
                  to restoration, thus producing a double movement of destruction and reconstruction
                  that not only operates separately, but is intrinsic to the ideology of the ruin. As
                  fragment, the ruin figures as a remainder of other cultures newly “acquired” and transmuted
                  into the mournful excesses that haunt their reinstallment in pre- and post-Waterloo
                  Britain. Even more, it either constitutes a celebratory surplus that hints at renovation
                  or offers itself as unyielding matter—the debris of political and social violence.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Our world appears to be on the brink of disaster, an appearance that is itself disastrous.
                  The disaster of disaster is that disaster is everywhere, all the time: while on the
                  one hand it appears obvious that disaster should be the exception that proves the
                  rule of a generally non-disastrous world, in actuality no non-disastrous moment arrives.
                  Like a deer in the headlights, thinking is paralyzed by disaster. Do Romantic texts
                  reinforce this problematic state of affairs, or resist it, and if so, how?</p>

                     “Hegel's Bearings”
                     </span></h2>
               <p class="noCount">In her essay, Rei Terada ponders Hegel's style of "tarrying with the negative," particularly
                  with the narrowing of political possibility in German territories both under Napoleonic
                  liberalization and after Waterloo. In correspondence with his friend Friedrich Immanuel
                  Niethammer, who states his wish to persist in fighting a losing cause even - or especially
                  - if he is the "last man" to do so, as if to find sustenance in his inability to bear
                  his dark times. Hegel bears up in another manner, seeking a middle way that "<em>allows</em> nothing to get too bad and nothing too good." Rather than trusting himself to a truly
                  open history, Terada argues, Hegel protects the civic life of the middle class, but
                  in doing so he also carries through on a philosophy in which "another middle, the
                  middle of transition, always rules the world." Drawing on a description of a dream
                  Hegel sends to his friend, in which "a certain realist calculation and foresight is
                  implicit," his critique of "the mirror reifications of empiricism and idealism" in
                  the <em>Logic</em>, and his account in the <em>Encyclopedia</em> of how the subject, reading every negativity that comes from outside as actually
                  from inside, can become "a being capable of containing and enduring its own contradiction,"
                  Terada shows how Hegel becomes a "privileged figure of the new dispensation," someone
                  capable of enduring "the horizonless condition of an antipolitical society that extends
                  from the late Napoleonic era to our own."</p>
