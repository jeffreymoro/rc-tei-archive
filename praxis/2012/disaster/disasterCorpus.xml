                  <p>If anyone meets the challenge of “dark times” in the German nineteenth
                  century, it would seem to be Hegel. Hegel’s account of how the mind/spirit
                  tarries—literally, “stays with”—the negative in attentive
                  observation and recollection until it “turns it into being”
                     [“<foreign>in das Sein umkehrt</foreign>”] (<title level="m">The
                     Phenomenology of Spirit</title> 19) amounts to a theory of psychic working
                  through: how to introject objects, open the self to novelty, and render the
                  present into the past. As Rebecca Comay and Katrin Pahl have shown, <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Comay (<title level="m">Mourning
                        Sickness</title>), Pahl, Kristeva, and May. I highlight these texts because
                     they exemplify Hegel’s relevance for psychoanalysis and contemporary
                     theory as well as show the psychological import of his work in its own
                     terms.</note> Hegel’s philosophy is at once a psychology and a theory of
                  history. Taken as a whole, it is also, famously, one predominant story that
                  nineteenth century Europe tells to itself, the story of the gathering of
                  revolution and restoration into a single process crowned by the modern European
                  state. Acknowledging that the transitions on which individual and psychic history
                  depend are painful, Hegel models how to tolerate the pain.</p>
                  <p>In the waning days of Napoleon, just after Waterloo, and toward the beginning of
                  the “Vormärz”—desolate times for European radicals, when, as
                  Heinrich Heine wrote with black humor, “all of Europe became a St.
                  Helena” <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                        <title level="m">Sämmtliche
                        Werke</title>, vols. 13-14 (423).</note> —Hegel was engaged in
                  demonstrating to himself and others how <title level="m">The Phenomenology of
                     Spirit</title> would fare in the years following the battle of Jena. As
                  Hegel’s letters show, he is concerned in this “middle period”
                  with the formalization and extension of his philosophy <note place="foot" resp="editors">The major works that correspond to the period are the
                     overlapping <title level="m">Science of Logic</title> and <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> in their various forms. An extension of the principles
                     of the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> to human sciences conceived along
                     disciplinary lines, the <title level="m">Science of Logic</title> plausibly
                     contributed to Hegel’s securing his first professorship at Heidelberg in
                     1816. Thomas Pfau observes the “palpably bureaucratic” prose and
                     structure of the work: “the interiority of the Hegelian subject must
                     submit to an intricate disciplinary scheme, here set forth in a bureaucratic
                     prose that assigns each psychological state its own category, epistemological
                     rank and relative authority” (257). The gridlike structure of the <title level="m">Science of Logic</title> also renders Hegel’s philosophy
                     more repeatable and teachable. The system is then condensed and repeated in the
                        <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title>. </note> —its not being downhill
                  from there—and he thinks this issue, in turn, through his ability to live
                  his own theory in the “dark times.” Crucially, Hegel makes
                  establishing the reception of the <title level="m">Phenomenology</title> into the
                  same project as the psychic management of the restoration. He generates the effect
                  that his previous philosophy is correct by interpreting it himself, highlighting
                  what (in retrospect) it is already prepared to allow for; as Derrida points out,
                  Hegelian spirit “in advance interiorizes all content” (22a) and as
                  Adorno points out, that “advance” is also secured after the fact
                     (<title level="m">History and Freedom</title> 51). In self-interpretation,
                  Hegel coordinates the future anterior with metalepsis in order to place his
                  thought at their crossing, where a dynamic transition in the present would
                  logically be. So if Hegel’s “middle period” is especially
                  interesting, that’s also because generating a transition through
                  self-interpretation is what all of the work is about anyway. Self-interpretation
                  is its content and its procedure: “the subject of Hegelian thought only
                     <emph>is</emph> insofar as it is engaged in the process of interpreting
                  itself,” as Jan Mieszkowski phrases it. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Mieszkowski shows how Derrida offers a “vantage point from
                     which to assess the limits of any project that would base its critical
                     authority on its own self-reflexivity”; Derrida “reveal[s] language
                     to be a dynamic whose finite resources are not unfailingly devoted to its own
                     self-determination” (¶ 42).</note> Hegel’s techniques for arranging
                  that his philosophy is not left on the battlefield at Waterloo are therefore
                  necessarily the same techniques he uses to introject and transform postwar
                  phenomena that otherwise threaten catastrophe. Incorporating the restoration
                  through his philosophy both reinforces the philosophy and averts devastation. </p>
                  <p>For German radicals did experience the Vormärz as a disaster. It’s difficult
                  to describe, and was difficult for them to describe, exactly what kind of
                  disaster, because although they were of course disappointed that the
                  modernizations of the Napoleonic era did not bring democracy, <note place="foot" resp="editors">By “democracy,” I mean not only
                     franchise and constitutional rights, but all opening of institutions and
                     societies to the public at large.</note> there was also a positivity to which
                  they objected that resists the conventional vocabulary for disaster. Critics
                  register the difficulty when they call the postwar in England and Europe a period
                  of “historical chaos” or “historical confusion.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Chandler (432) and Roe (60),
                     respectively. James Sheehan points out that even Metternich describes the
                     period as unsatisfying: “Metternich, the man who presided over and seemed
                     to personify the age of restoration, lamented that he had been born ‘too
                     early or too late.’ Earlier he might simply have enjoyed life, later he
                     could have helped build a new society, but ‘today I must devote myself to
                     propping up rotten buildings.’ A few months later he wrote, ‘My
                     most secret thought is that old Europe is at the beginning of the end. . . .
                     between end and beginning there will be chaos’” (392).</note>
                  Rebecca Comay has argued brilliantly that the German postwar is characterized by
                  trauma in the structural sense that it is organized by a spectral German
                  revolution which is imagined as too early or too late, either having occurred
                  already on a mental level and/or being (always) not yet necessary: “having
                  already been there in theory, Germany could put off until doomsday the grab for
                  practical fulfillment.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Comay
                        (<title level="a">Dead Right</title> 295-375, 377). For a classic and
                     thoughtful version of the “too early” thesis, see Beck
                     (51-61).</note> As many have pointed out in this connection, the idea of a
                  “restoration” doesn’t quite work as a descriptor in the absence
                  of a revolution; other terms for the postwar period avoid describing it at all.
                  Historians of England tend to call it the “aftermath of Waterloo,” and
                  the term “Vormärz” complementarily anchors the time in something that
                  hadn’t happened yet. <note place="foot" resp="editors">There is an
                     element of this negativity in the term “postwar” in general.</note>
                  Afloat in a way that could only be called “transitional” in
                  retrospect, German radicals could feel that they were on open political
                  waters—not in a liberatory, but in an agoraphobic sense, in which it seemed
                  possible that just about anything bad could happen to them. Yet, fundamentally,
                  the disaster is also not “instability”; the “stability”
                  that replaced this instability was the imperial German state. That was even more
                  disastrous from a radical point of view, and can’t seriously be thought of
                  as less “confused,” either, than the “historical
                  confusion” that preceded it. Rather, radicals experienced the Vormärz as a
                  positive present of conservative administrative control, embodied in police states
                  in which even “liberals” opposed classless suffrage. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Blackbourn (100).</note> James Sheehan argues
                  that the first three decades of the nineteenth century “deserve to be
                  thought of as the apogee of the <foreign>Beamtenstaat</foreign>, therefore, not
                  simply because bureaucrats had won decisive victories over their old enemies but
                  also because their new antagonists had not yet begun to take shape” (441).
                  Calling for the termination of the monarchy before the German
                  “Pre-Parliament” in 1848 (and so looking back at the time I’m
                  concerned with), the radical democrat Gustav von Struve began his address with:
                  “A long period of the most profound degradation weighs heavily on
                  Germany.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Gustav von Struve, motion
                     in the German Pre-Parliament, March 31, 1848, in Huber (332-334).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Historians David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley argued in the 1980s that Cold War
                  histories of Europe composed in the West promoted the hindsight perception that as
                  Struve spoke, an even longer period of even profounder degradation lay ahead of
                  him, one that seemed to culminate at Auschwitz. Clearly, “grand
                  narratives” are part of the problem; the very discipline of
                  “history” is part of the problem and part of the nineteenth- and
                  twentieth-century nationalism that followed the aftermath of Waterloo. Since
                  Blackbourn and Eley, historians have approached the German nineteenth century more
                  as a way of life in itself, sometimes discussing how it may have been
                  “liberal” in a different way after all. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See, e.g., Jarausch. Eley’s critical tenor is sometimes
                     missing from the writing of Blackbourn alone. When Eley entertains the notion
                     of a German “revolution from above,” it matters that it isn’t
                     a democratic revolution. Blackbourn, in contrast, can sound more equanimious
                     about a society in which regulation appears as a value just as ethical as that
                     of social justice. My point is not to dictate to German people of the past what
                     would have been good for them, but to try to read the self-described
                     disorientation of dissidents at the time.</note> Although such a discussion
                  avoids problems with the notion of historical failure, it still misses the point.
                  Eley’s point is not just that we should stop being judgmental about the
                  German nineteenth century, but that we should ask <emph>who gains</emph> from our
                  judgments. The twentieth century theory of the development of democracy from
                  “liberalization” gains by blaming German exceptionalism for its
                  “failure” to make it work. Similarly, radicals’ experience is
                  not disastrous because of what it’s not—a revolution or
                  liberalism—and “revolution” and “liberalism” are not
                  real in some way that the early German nineteenth century is unreal. But—and
                  here I may or may not be departing from the anthropological reflexivity that
                  Blackbourn and Eley bring to their study—that does not mean that the Vormärz
                  was really fine. In the most interesting descriptions, it is
                     <emph>positively</emph> awful enough in itself, awful <emph>in</emph> being a
                  way of getting along, and these subjective descriptions also merit our
                  anthropological respect if our reading is to be more than an account only of what
                  works about a society. Going beyond anomaly, disaster here goes in a way beyond
                  disaster. This impression of disorienting open-endedness, more than anything else,
                  disabling any sense of historical exceptionality, particularizes <emph>this</emph>
                  disaster and Hegel’s model for working through it.</p>
                  <p>Hegel is a privileged figure of the new dispensation, I want to suggest, because
                  of his ability to articulate in its positivity the horizonless condition of an
                  antipolitical society that extends from the late Napoleonic era to our own. By
                  managing a description that is immanent to it, he furnishes a predominant model
                  for inhabiting times that are normally and open-endedly opaque. He wins the game
                  by changing it, establishing a new framework for what it means to succeed in which
                  the capacity to undergo transition actively is the highest value. Hegel explains
                  why there is no getting out by way of explaining why there is no need to get out:
                  namely, because the energies of progress themselves are part of what means to be
                  “in.” Achieving this realization requires duration (“staying
                  with” the negative), hence endurance; as a result, he places a peculiar
                  value on being able to “bear” things. Words like
                     <foreign>ertragen</foreign> and <foreign>vertragen</foreign> (endurance,
                  tolerance) crystallize his descriptions of self-transformation, and pressure
                  settles upon them. His use of <foreign>ertragen</foreign> connotes constitutional
                  vigor—being able to withstand hard knocks—but, especially in his
                  letters, also includes a more colloquial sense of being able to stand repulsive
                  things. Transition, and specifically one’s own change in it, is the main
                  thing that it is necessary to “endure.” </p>

                  <p>In the first decade of the nineteenth century, Hegel carried on a long, regular
                  correspondence with his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, the commissioner of
                  educational administration for Bavaria. These letters offer glimpses of how Hegel
                  and Niethammer thought about the interface between political and everyday life. In
                  the late Napoleonic years, liberalization, modernization and democratization were
                  already proving to be unrelated. Hegel and Niethammer are anxious in the midst of
                  liberalization, before Napoleon abdicates in April 1814; and they worry not only
                  about the insecurity of the administration but about the course of liberalization
                  within it. In these years radical possibility is being undermined from within and
                  from without a reformist regime, lending support to Hegel’s sense of
                  opposition internal to concepts. In his correspondence, we can see Hegel trying on
                  various ways of expressing this sense as a psychological and political
                  attitude.</p>
                  <p>Much of Hegel’s and Niethammer’s conversation pertains to the
                  educational system for which they both worked and which was an endless source of
                  aggravation for them both. Briefly, Niethammer was a “neohumanist” who
                  wanted to modernize education while defending it against
                  “utilitarians” who were narrowly interested in professional schools,
                  and he had appointed Hegel rector of a Gymnasium in Nuremburg because he knew he
                  would be a political ally. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Pinkard
                     (268). Hegel’s school was threatened with closure in 1810 as part of a
                     wave of cost-cutting measures (Pinkard 291-292), but it survived and he
                     continued to work there until he received an offer from the university at
                     Heidelberg in 1816 (Pinkard 330-331).</note> Niethammer’s enterprises
                  never ran all that smoothly, and as Napoleon’s downfall began to seem
                  increasingly likely, he interpreted the newly emboldened attacks on his projects
                  that then occurred as evidence of an overwhelming and indeed insuperable pressure
                  from conservative and utilitarian forces (i.e., conservative anti-democrats and
                  modernizing anti-democrats). Although he can seem to be overdoing his rhetoric
                  (though not to me), Niethammer was basically right:
                  democratization—parliamentary or otherwise—was not coming to Germany
                  in spite of all the “liberalization” and “modernization”
                  that had been accomplished under Napoleon. Niethammer’s anticipation of this
                  conclusion sometimes led him to describe his political future in apocalyptic
                  terms. </p>
                  <p>Hegel was intermittently anxious about all this, and trying hard not to be. On the
                  night of January 5, 1814, Hegel dreams that he “was in a large group
                  attending a disputation in which two physiologists . . . discussed the relative
                  merits of apes and pigs.” While the disputants argue about which are more
                  human, apes or pigs, <quote>a loudmouthed, wide-bodied fellow named Pippel
                     [People] . . . kept wanting to bring up still other matters, even juridical
                     matters such as human rights, constitutions, and so forth. But the moderator,
                     who, so to speak, played the role of fate throughout the whole proceeding,
                     treated all matters of this sort as mere irrelevancies, mere packaging. He
                     disallowed them from being seriously discussed, and held firm in his insistence
                     that the issue was merely preference between the two species. But a
                     super-clever man, murmuring in the corner more to himself, then asked the
                     moderator—this seemed to me unrelated—whether he meant that Pippel,
                     should he someday feel warm in his heart and head, would, as is well known,
                     risk the shirt off his back; that aristocrats would put this to their
                     advantage; and that Pippel would thus play the fool in a game—as in fact
                     occurs quite legally in the name of the Devil, and has always occurred from
                     time immemorial. The historian Zschokke then ran up to jump in, shouting that
                     the people of Bern had already received an answer at least verbally from
                     Zurich, but that there were still many other considerations . . . and so forth.
                     At that point I woke up and it seemed difficult to me to have to go to class
                     and lecture on law. </quote>

                  <p>So Hegel dreams he is at a debate that isn’t an honest debate, and that
                  pretends to seek humanity where everyone knows it doesn’t exist, in one of
                  two unattractive and literally nonhuman sides: it is hard <emph>not</emph> to view
                  the dream as struggling with the contemporary foreclosure of alternatives. There
                  was a real Heinrich Zschokke, a liberal historian, philosopher and fiction writer
                  based in Switzerland at the time of the dream; a local administrator during the
                  Napoleonic period, he is remembered as having been as earnestly enthusiastic as he
                  appears here (Butler, Letters 301). The dream treats his earnestness as though it
                  were as much a part of the show as the cynicism of the professional moderator and
                  offstage aristocrats, as though his sincere proceduralism exhibited the kind of
                  irrelevance the moderator has in mind when he calls juridical issues “mere
                  packaging” (<foreign>Emballagen</foreign>, packing matter). As Pippel is a
                  loudmouth, Zschokke is a shouter, and implicitly tiresome; Hegel curtails the
                  content of his messsage with the same weary “u. s. f.”</p>
                  <p>Notice that, although things weren’t going too well, Napoleon is still in
                  Paris on the night of Hegel’s dream. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon acknowledged the need to take personal charge of the
                     military campaign and left Paris on January 25.</note> In fact, Hegel had been
                  feeling caught between apes and pigs the entire time at Nuremberg. As soon as he
                  got there, commiseration about assaults on the educational system (including the
                  chronic, passive assault of underfunding) becomes one of the main motifs of his
                  correspondence with Niethammer. <note place="foot" resp="editors">The other
                     main topic is Hegel’s desire to move on to a university post, and his
                     indefatigible networking to this end.</note> As early as 1810, we find Hegel
                  complaining that “Nobody complains . . . . the object is simply to procure
                  treasure, and those who suffered real distress and injustice are used to the view
                  that everything has gone to the dogs anyway” (Butler, letter 229, April 10,
                  1810); more than any reference to repression, the complaint that no one is
                  complaining registers the collapse of political space. Throughout this time Hegel
                  regularly refers to the Allied forces with dripping irony as “our
                  Liberators”: “if <foreign>par hasard</foreign> there are any liberated
                  individuals to be seen I myself will stand up and watch” (Butler, letter
                  225, December 23, 1813). But the Napoleonic administration has not left enough
                  room for complaint either. Likewise, the moderator’s “insistence that
                  the issue was merely preference” is absurd in light of the lack of
                  distinction and merit among the choices. Only the possibility of an unseen, deeper
                  rationality in his behavior (“<foreign>ob er es denn so
                  meine</foreign>”) furnishes some ballast against the non-events that crowd
                  the dream. </p>
                  <p>The highlight of the dream is the part that Hegel selects for attention by calling
                  it out of place, the “super-clever” remark that attempts to get beyond
                  the immediate debate to the game played “from time immemorial.” The
                  super-clever man’s observation differs from the others: it’s a
                  question, at least rhetorically; it’s murmured by a liminal participant,
                  “more to himself” than to anyone else—which is how Hegel
                  lectured, and how Adorno believes his writing proceeds; <note place="foot" resp="editors">The older Hegel, anyway. Adorno cites the account of H.G. Hotho,
                     who attended Hegel’s Berlin lectures: “Exhausted, morose, he sat
                     there as if collapsed into himself, his head bent down, and while speaking kept
                     turning pages and searching in his long folio notebooks, forward and backward,
                     high and low.” Hotho recalls Hegel’s seeming need to present every
                     thought processively. “Hegel’s writings are more like films of
                     thought than texts,” Adorno muses (“Skoteinos, or How to Read
                     Hegel” 121). Nicholsen adds that for Adorno, Hegel’s language
                     “murmurs and rustles in mimesis of the nonidentical” (xxxi).</note>
                  and it makes an effort to think beyond the scene, to connect pasts and futures,
                  surfaces and depths. It’s tempting to see this curious intervention as the
                  most Hegelian one. The super-clever man asks the moderator whether, in his role as
                  “fate,” he bars “juridical” topics <emph>because</emph> of
                  the likelihood that the outcome would only play into the hands of
                  aristocrats—at least, whether this likely outcome is the true meaning of his
                  intransigence. A kind of realist calculation and foresight is implicit here.
                  Although the dream thus seems to align itself with super-cleverness, however,
                  Hegel’s reported thoughts on waking imply that his own position, or at least
                  his feelings, is not identical with that of the super-clever man within. It seems
                  difficult—literally, it “hits him hard”—that he has to go
                  on with his lectures on law. Now we know that Hegel sees rational law as the only
                  possible means of managing the conflicts of society, and he was soon to take an
                  interest in the particulars of the new constitution, especially with regard to the
                  parameters of franchise. <note place="foot" resp="editors">At the same
                     time, by <title level="m">The Philosophy of Right</title> (1820) the law that
                     matters is any rational law that already exists.</note> Yet in the dream
                  “juridical” matters already seem like mere packaging and fooling
                  around, and as he wakes it seems terrible to have to discuss them in public,
                  perhaps to be expected to reconcile them with the kind of legality (the
                  “natural” law of superior force?) exercised in the Devil’s name.
                  The strain of the debate reflects and forestalls the strain of the coming lecture;
                  the dream temporarily defers the tension and tedium of keeping up appearances,
                  already pressing upon the dreamer from the side of the morning, by voicing a
                  complaint that can’t be voiced during the day.</p>
                  <p>Something is beginning to happen in Hegel’s dream that he opposes
                  philosophically. We might think of this process, as Melanie Klein has taught us to
                  do, as that of splitting “good” and “bad” parts of the
                  self as a way of handling uncomfortably mixed feelings. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See Klein, <title level="m">Love, Guilt, and Reparation and
                        Other Works, 1921–1945</title> and <title level="m">Envy and Gratitude and
                        Other Works, 1946-1963</title>.</note> In fact, Klein is one of the most
                  Hegelian thinkers of the twentieth century: she advocates an integration that
                  ideally does not describe anything as ontologically good or bad, and uses the
                  ideas of goodness and badness only as temporary organizations that must be
                  eventually be brought together in the same space. Klein continually points out
                  that splitting off bad pieces of reality necessarily commits aggressions against
                  the self that produces that reality, which must also become bad in the same moment
                  and therefore become mired in persecution, guilt, and retaliation. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Criticism of Klein’s seeming literalism
                     registers the fact that she always writes as though from the perspective of the
                     analysand, as though good and bad objects were real; it misses the fact that
                     she does this in order to convey that for human beings there is nothing more
                     real, indeed nothing other, than the good and bad objects that appear at the
                     time and in memory. Klein’s writing is not a celebration of
                     self-consciousness, but a demonstration of how embeddedness makes its own world
                     out of itself. She is the patient companion of unglamorous types of
                     consciousness.</note> Klein’s critique of splitting recalls Hegel’s
                  description of the mirror reifications of empiricism and idealism: <quote>Logic
                     shows that the subjective which is to be subjective only, the finite which
                     would be finite only, the infinite which would be infinite only, and so on,
                     have no truth, but contradict themselves, and pass over into their opposites.
                     Hence this transition, and the unity in which the extremes are merged and
                     become factors, each with a merely reflected existence, reveals itself as their
                     truth.</quote>
                     <quote>The understanding, which addresses itself to deal with the Idea, commits a
                     double misunderstanding. It takes first the extremes of the Idea (be they
                     expressed as they will, so long as they are in their unity), not as they are
                     understood when stamped with this concrete unity, but as if they remained
                     abstractions outside of it. It no less mistakes the relation between them, even
                     when it has been expressly stated . . . . But, in the second place, the
                     understanding believes its “reflection”—that the
                     self-identical Idea contains its own negative, or contains
                     contradiction—to be an external reflection which does not lie within the
                     Idea itself. But the reflection is really no peculiar cleverness of the
                     understanding. The idea itself is the dialectic which for ever divides and
                     distinguishes the self-identical from the differentiated, the subjective from
                     the objective, the finite from the infinite, soul from body. Only on these
                     terms is it an eternal creation, eternal vitality, and eternal spirit. But
                     while it thus passes or rather translates itself into the abstract
                     understanding, it for ever remains reason. The Idea is the dialectic which
                     again makes this mass of understanding and diversity understand its finite
                     nature and the pseudo-independence in its productions, and which brings the
                     diversity back to unity.</quote>

                        Einzelnen, dem Subjekte, aussagt, daß das Einzelne ebensosehr nicht

                  <p>The understanding splits objects into polar features as though these features
                  existed independently and “outside” their “unity” in the
                  Idea, which involves “mistak[ing]” their relation “even when it
                  has been expressly stated.” In this first maneuver the understanding strips
                  features from objects and places them “outside” the space of their
                  transformation into one another. Then, even when it does reflect on the
                  co-existence of the contradictions, it believes that this reflection is its own
                  “peculiar[ly] clever” contribution from a space “external”
                  to the Idea and “not within”; that is, we become conscious that the
                  objects include their contradictions, but as though from outside the space
                  ourselves. The “truth” of objects and of the understanding is that of
                  their “transition” within “the unity in which the extremes are
                  merged and become factors.” We can take down the division that creates the
                  outside of the Idea by staying with bad objects through our apprehension of their
                  negativity; by bringing more out of ourselves and them, we see them in the space
                  where they are only “factors,” and in which their transformation and
                  that of the understanding are again possible. Distinction persists, but through a
                  mobile division that continually creates new sub-spaces within an interior that
                  has no exterior. Looked at another way, the project is to contain extremes that
                  pose challenges to an interior that has and <emph>must</emph> have no exterior
                     (<emph>and no external interior</emph>), as the repetition of
                  “within” conveys (extremes are merged “in” the unity, the
                  Idea “contains” its contradiction, etc.).</p>
                  <p>Hegel’s expositions of what it means to bear something (particularly
                  plentiful in the various revisions of the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title>)
                  overwhelmingly associate <foreign>ertragen</foreign> with self-transformation, or
                  to be more precise, with that kind of self-consistency that comes out of
                  self-transformation, and hence with subjectivity itself. His explanations span a
                  tension between the value of flexibility and a kind of residual mass, built up out
                  of former transformations, which is not simply flexible and that allows one to
                  afford flexibility. As I mentioned, Hegel phrases the building up of subjectivity
                  through <foreign>ertragen</foreign> partly as a matter of constitution or
                  “hardiness”; in Part II of the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title>,
                  the <foreign>Naturphilosophie</foreign>, the basic equipment of an animal, by
                  including the capacity for sensation, includes the potential to “tolerate
                  itself as other [<foreign>als Anderes ertragen</foreign>]” so that it
                  “can, with the hardiness [Härte] of individuality, assimilate it and venture
                  into conflict with other individualities” (<title level="m">Philosophy of
                     Nature / Enzyklopädie</title> II §344). The capacity to bear self-difference
                  builds up the “whole mass of adjustments forming the concrete
                  consciousness” (<title level="m">Philosophy of Mind / Enzyklopädie</title>
                  III §408), and “a being which is capable of containing and enduring its own
                  contradiction is a subject [<foreign>Ein solches, das den Widerspruch seiner
                     selbst in sich zu haben und zu ertragen fähig ist, ist das
                  Subjekt</foreign>]” (<title level="m">Philosophy of Nature /
                     Encyclopedia</title> II §359). The pairing “containing and
                  enduring” returns to the idea that we may mistakenly place the
                  contradictions we perceive in objects “outside” ourselves. To be able
                  to contain them by attributing them to ourselves instead is to be able to bear
                  them (and here enduring is bearing as carrying). While “a psychic shock
                  produced by grief and pain” or equally, “sudden excessive joy,”
                  runs the real risk of “the disruption of the organism, death, or
                  insanity,” one who has built up inner resources “is much less exposed
                     [<foreign>ausgesetzt</foreign>] than others to such effects
                     [<foreign>Einwirkungen</foreign>],” and performs better than “the
                  ‘natural’ man who is poor in imaginative and intellectual resources
                  and so is unable to endure the negativity of a sudden violent attack of pain
                     [<foreign>die Negativität eines plötzlich hereinbrechenden gewaltigen Schmerzes
                     zu ertragen</foreign>]” (<title level="m">Philosophy of Mind /
                     Encyclopedia</title> III §401). “Naturally,” Hegel continues, and
                  his point is noncontroversial enough, “those who through a life rich in
                  activity and experience have developed a more independent human nature, are better
                  able to endure [<foreign>besser zu ertragen</foreign>] the <emph>loss of a
                     part</emph> [<foreign>den Verlust eines Teiles</foreign>] of what constitutes
                  their world than those who have grown up in simple circumstances” (<title level="m">Philosophy of Mind / Encyclopedia</title> III §402; my italics). This
                  theory of the building up of subjectivity as the capacity for bearing
                  transformation portrays a “hard,” yet complexly layered self up to the
                  task of exposing itself to the agents of change, thus hinting that part of the
                  self up for change (that part <emph>doing</emph> the exposing and weathering) will
                  not actually be changed. The figure implied—not Hegel’s usual figure
                  for transition, but one that’s apparently compatible with his
                  discourse—is that of a substance weathering erosion. Erosion is a form of
                  transformation, of course; the assimilation of negativity in the form of erosion
                  would mean experiencing oneself as the agent of what would otherwise be “the
                  loss of a part,” and thus feeling that you cannot be simply diminished if
                  you are making cuts to yourself. A different metaphor for transformation
                  wouldn’t require this attitude, rather suggesting that equal quantitites are
                  being exchanged; but this one may be especially useful for dark times’
                  challenge of loss in transition. </p>
                  <p>Throughout, the idea that there is no question for the healthy self of the
                  impossibility of assimilating negativity depends on the idea that a negativity, or
                  “lack,” “is a lack only in so far as the lack's overcoming is
                  equally present in the same thing, and contradiction is, as such, immanent and
                  explicitly present in that thing “[<foreign>Mangel aber ist sie, insofern in

                     of Nature / Encyclopedia</title> II §359). So, things necessarily contain some
                  of their opposite because they exist within the space of unity, and that space
                  matters to us because it is <emph>our</emph> space. By this logic, it is not
                  possible to believe without error in a negativity that comes from an
                  “outside,” since there is no outside of the mediating space <note place="foot" resp="editors">Hegel is reacting here, of course, to
                     Kant’s idea that we must think that there is something outside
                     representation even though we can’t know what it is.</note>: <quote>Pain
                     has therefore not reached mind from the outside as is supposed when it is asked
                     in what manner pain entered into the world. Nor does evil, the negative of
                     absolutely self-existent infinite mind, any more than pain, reach mind from the
                     outside; on the contrary, evil is nothing else than mind which puts its
                     separate individuality before all else. Therefore, even in this its extreme
                     disunity, in this violent detachment of itself from the root of its
                     intrinsically ethical nature, in this complete self-contradiction, mind yet
                     remains identical with itself and therefore free . . . . Thus, for example, the
                     idea of “house” is completely contradictory to my “I”
                     and yet the latter endures it. But mind <emph>endures contradiction
                        because</emph> it knows that it contains no determination that it has not
                     posited itself, and consequently that it cannot in turn sublate. </quote>

                  bearing negativity depends on containing it as self-contradiction: since the mind
                  is able to bear self-contradiction because it knows it has posited the negativity,
                  the way to make something bearable is to bring it into that position. The
                  bearability of contradiction depends on the debatable assumptions that we find
                  more bearable anything that emanates from ourselves, and that the action of one
                  part of the self at the expense of another does not violate self-identity and
                  therefore freedom. In my view, there are fatal logical and psychological problems
                  with these argumentative moves. Once they have been established, however, Hegel
                  can assume that anything that has once been posited can be sublated if we bear
                  with it, living forward and painfully changing the self into one that can bear it
                  better.</p>
                  <p>Returning to Hegel’s correspondence with Niethammer, we can see this therapy
                  for bearing change at work and in contrast to its alternative. While Hegel wishes
                  to locate response to dark times in the capacity to stay with and transform them
                  through self-transformation, Niethammer wants to maintain the consistency of his
                  identity in a way that can be at odds with persisting. In November 1815—a
                  few months after the Congress of Vienna, and again with regard to the ongoing
                  controversies in educational administration—Niethammer writes to Hegel to
                  “mobilize” him, he says. For “just as worms, frogs, and other
                  vermin often follow the rain,” he writes, “so the Weillers <note place="foot" resp="editors">Katejan von Weiller, a Catholic theologian,
                     had co-written a polemic against Hegel and Schelling. See von Weiller and
                     Salat.</note> and their ilk follow the dark day now spreading over the entire
                  civilized world” (Letter 254). <note place="foot" resp="editors">Ernst Bloch quotes this passage to convey how “everything obsolete
                     drifted back into place” in his own generation: “So those who have
                     apparently been restored reenact what the reaction of a century ago auditioned,
                     as Hegel’s friend Niethammer already lamented . . . . They re-enact that
                     Restoration’s recuperation” (<title level="m">The Spirit of
                        Utopia</title> 235). Bloch’s assumption that his generation reenacts a
                     restoration that was already a reaction renders explicit his belief that he
                     belongs to the same era as Niethammer, which is still repeating its favorite
                     plays.</note> As in Hegel’s dream of apes, pigs, and Pippel the previous
                  year, part of the panic is that Niethammer does not seem to be dealing with
                  happenings that are easily classifiable as human. Nonhumanity is of course the
                  usual insult to anything that seems unintelligible, and an inflammatory charge
                  within a polemic; Niethammer’s rhetoric, however, serves to indicate that
                  what has happened is already on the other side of a line for him. They are living
                  with what “follow[s]” after the dark day, and this time is figured as
                  a shift from a natural cycle (a day, a rain) to something totalized (a day that
                  swallowed the world, a time that wouldn’t end). </p>
                  <p>We might ask why Niethammer expects Hegel to feel “mobilize[d]” by a
                  presentation of doom. But Niethammer perceives no contradiction, since for him,
                  existential goals can energize the defense of probably lost causes, and he sees
                  nothing wrong with fighting losing battles. He continues, <quote>they have become
                     so impudent as to declare teachers of philosophy and even mathematics to be not
                     only dispensable but harmful in the gymnasiums . . . . But they must not be
                     allowed to settle accounts with us in silence. And they must not mutilate our
                     Protestant educational establishments on the model of the former schools for
                     monks. Against this I want to defend myself to the last man—who I still
                     hope to be. (Letter 254)</quote> Niethammer takes a half-Kantian approach to
                  the perceived loss of the human environment for effective action. He turns toward
                  a realm of consciousness that is moral—ultimately autonomous if it comes to
                  it—but also expressive; it’s important to know how you feel and let
                  other people know it. They’ll do what they’ll do, but they will have
                  to hear from you while doing it. The faint possibility remains that unexpectedly
                  energetic resistance will prevent the worst of the outcomes worth
                  “defend[ing] . . . to the last man,” but nothing of the self is staked
                  on this chance, for in case of the expected failure it has its Kantianism in
                  reserve. The thought of being the last man, “who I still hope to be,”
                  sustains Niethammer’s activity. It seems to be more realistic to
                  “hope” to be the last man—a strange hope, that assumes the cause
                  is lost—than to succeed; in this way Niethammer is able to replace an
                  unreachable goal with a reachable one that will give him existential satisfaction.
                  The main impetus for resistance is the chance to display commitment to others and
                  oneself.</p>
                  <p>Hegel’s reply will take us to the heart of his psychic strategy: <quote>The
                     essential point is your belief that it will not get so bad we cannot bear it.
                     Your view coincides pretty much with my own belief that we cannot hope for
                     something good enough to merit any particular praise. This colorless, tasteless
                     middle way, which allows nothing to get too bad and nothing too good, for once
                     rules our world.</quote>
                     <quote>[<foreign>Das Wesentliche ist Ihr Glauben, daß es nicht so arg werde, daß

                     (Letter 255, November 23, 1814, trans. modified)</quote> Now, Hegel’s
                  colorlesssness does not really coincide with Niethammer’s “dark
                  day,” and an intermediate state is exactly what Niethammer’s
                  apocalyptic language rejects: Niethammer is saying that he
                     <emph>isn’t</emph> bearing it. Just as we can ask why Hegel should find
                  Niethammer’s appeal inspiring, we can ask why Niethammer should find
                  Hegel’s reply helpful. For Niethammer, being unable to foresee anything good
                  enough to praise is already “so bad we cannot bear it,” and as
                  we’ve seen, he gets sustenance out of his inability to bear it. They
                  actually agree only that their “world” is the realm at issue and that
                  it is “rul[ed]” by the deactivation of “hope for something good
                  enough.” The discrepancy is obvious enough that we should ask why Hegel
                  wants to claim that his belief coincides with Niethammer’s. Why not write
                  instead, “I don’t like it any more than you do, but . . .”? </p>
                  <p>Hegel seems to be trying to present his disagreement with Niethammer as it might
                  appear in the essential unity they must somehow share—a place of
                  conciliation. He has already located something good, so that the badness
                  isn’t “too bad”; the key point is that he subtly divides
                  goodness that’s good enough to praise from<emph> another goodness that
                     merits no praise</emph> but is still there, functioning as a backstop. As with
                  this backup goodness, there is something protective in Hegel’s idea that the
                  “middle way” “<emph>allows</emph> nothing to get too bad and
                  nothing too good [<foreign>welches nichts so arg und nichts so gut werden
                        <emph>läßt</emph>
                     </foreign>]”: this is what I meant in saying that the
                  project is to contain extremes that might threaten, from inside or from outside,
                  the inside that is supposed to have no radical outside or inside. Containing the
                  extremes prophylactically so that it isn’t possible for anything to get too
                  bad or good is not the same as trusting the whole to right itself through
                  unconstrained experience—a kind of psychic free market. To rule the world in
                  this manner, it seems, is also to protect certain parts of the world whose
                  precarious existence is being held out of play. I will come back momentarily to
                  the question of which world Hegel is protecting.</p>
                  <p>Further, the <emph>universal space of mediation is conflated,</emph> here, with
                  the recent disappearance of color and taste from the times: it’s actually
                  impossible to tell which one Hegel is talking about when he describes the
                  “middle way” that “rules our world.” That
                  “our” world is “for once” ruled by colorlessness and
                  tastelessness seems to make it a historical matter; but Hegel’s is the
                  philosophy in which another middle, the middle of transition, always rules the
                  world, and truth is the colorlessness and tastelessness that allows colors and
                  tastes to be translated into one another. Insofar as what Hegel means by
                  “middle way” has already passed through the mediation that merges
                  extremes, or even simply refers to that reflection, there can be no further
                  disagreement, because by disagreeing with Hegel, Niethammer would be disagreeing
                  with the truth of things itself: with reality, in Hegel’s theory of reality.
                  As Hegel presents the debate with Niethammer as though from its end, his prose
                  presents the grayness of the times as inseparable from the standpoint of his own
                  assimilation of it: it seems at the same time to be a challenging external
                  negativity and a phenomenon internal to Hegel’s psychic work. As such, it
                  gives us a glimpse of the therapeutic power of Hegel’s thinking. Hegel
                  returns Niethammer’s utterance to him rinsed of its moralized drama: this
                  thought experiment evokes a world in balance, in which everyone realizes that
                  nothing is ontologically too bad or good and can negotiate differences with
                  feeling, but without hysteria, as Klein too fleetingly envisions.</p>
                  <p>For Hegel, the ability to translate differences corresponds to the state’s
                  redistribution of the energies of individuals from the perspective of its own
                  universality. In the exchange with Niethammer, he tries to do this as though on
                  behalf of universality. As Marcuse points out, the limit of transformability is
                  that “the resulting relation between the individuals on the one hand and the
                  state on the other cannot be the same as that between individuals” (174).
                  Something like this limitation appears in comical miniature in the letters, where
                  Hegel identifies his own position—<emph>acceptance of</emph> the
                  sidelessness, so to speak, of their situation—with the sidelessness of
                  reality <emph>itself</emph> for all, and describes it from the point of view of
                  the place where their positions would already have met. Representing universality,
                  Hegel pulls Niethammer after him into the colorless “middle way” where
                  their agreement is “pretty much” enforced despite their actual
                  continued disagreement (which he possibly is really unable to grasp). Ideally, the
                  mind bears reality without reserve and triumphs to the extent that it dares to
                  expose itself to self-transformation; we see this principle working normatively in
                  Hegel’s personal responses to what otherwise threatens disaster. As
                  we’ve seen, Hegel defines disaster as being unable to shake one’s
                  presentation of a situation as unbearable. What bearing reality means is
                  deconstructible, however, because it’s unclear whether Hegel can bear to
                  bear these presentations without techniques that regulate his exposure.</p>
                  <p>Hegel’s desire to experience his own losses as their agent, then, means to
                  ride transition, maximizing the potential to live anywhere and anyhow in the
                  subject’s infinity. To others, it has seemed to reflect the treachery of the
                  times by articulating the philosophy of an emergent society of adaptive liberal
                  conformity. Hegel’s letter of July 5, 1816, for example, seems a bit suspect
                  to Niethammer in its explanation of how to get through the phenomena of postwar
                  reaction. Hegel depicts world spirit as a “colossus” striding over the
                  world, unable to be halted by human doings: <quote>I adhere to the view that the
                     world spirit has given the world marching orders . . . . no lingering lies or
                     make-believe strokes in the air can achieve anything against it. They can
                     perhaps reach the shoelaces of this colossus, and smear on a bit of boot wax or
                     mud, but they cannot untie the laces. Much less can they remove these shoes of
                     Gods—which according to [Johann Heinrich] Voss’s <title level="m">Mythological Letters</title>, among other sources, have elastic soles or
                     are even themselves seven-league boots—once the colossus pulls them on.
                     Surely the safest thing to do (both externally and internally) is to keep
                     one’s eye fixed on the advancing giant. To edify the entire bustling and
                     eager assemblage, one can even stand there and help smear on the shoe wax that
                     is supposed to bring the giant to a standstill. For one’s own amusement,
                     one can even lend a hand to the enterprise that is being taken so
                     seriously.</quote>

                        (Letter 271; trans. modified)</foreign>]</quote> Hegel repeats some of the
                  material from his 1814 dream: frantic, empty “bustling” in the
                  foreground, a now visible world spirit “advancing,” and a liminal
                  figure standing in Hegel’s apparently less elastic shoes. Hegel wants the
                  vignette to illustrate that awareness of the deep forces that ground the apparent
                  absurdity of the situation—forces kept in mind by the protagonist’s
                  fixed, distant focus—can be played off against the “eager
                  assemblage” in the foreground that would otherwise cause distress.
                  Calibrations of spatial and temporal scale, mental reserve and physical action,
                  map the scene so that it seems manageable and, this time, even enjoyable. (We can
                  see in retrospect that the pigs and apes dream is enjoyable, too.) </p>
                  <p>There is a tension between Hegel’s claim that he keeps his eye on giant
                  forces to keep his mind off the senseless reaction, and the possibility that what
                  seems to be the accidental outcome of the scenario is actually its goal: that
                  conjuring the giant figure, and casting Restoration politics as a non-event in
                  comparison, allows Hegel to continue working in this society. Even though his
                  attention to its work is divided and limited, his participation in the social
                  enterprise to which he objects acknowledges it in a way that Niethammer
                  isn’t up to (as Niethammer’s outrage is something Hegel isn’t up
                  to). The causal arrow is two-way: Hegel’s identification with transition not
                  only enables, but is formed <emph>by</emph> actual contact with the negative,
                  unlike Niethammer’s indignation, which prevents him from making full contact
                  with it. Niethammer fantasizes purity; he will be the last man polluted by vermin.
                  Hegel has participated in “the enterprise that is being taken so
                  seriously,” and demonstrates how to do so. He can stay close, even touch
                  with his hands the active unfreedom that is at least as dangerous as the advancing
                  giant—unlike the beautiful soul who “flees from contact with the
                  actual world [<foreign>flieht es die Berührung der Wirklichkeit</foreign>]”
                     (<title level="m">Phenomenology of Spirit / Phänomenologie des Geistes</title>
                  §685). Participation, even of this divided kind, has its benefits: remaining on
                  the scene, seeing what people are doing, knowing you are able to do it if you
                  want; also being “safe . . . externally and internally,” being amused,
                  and in a certain way remaining incognito. <note place="foot" resp="editors">In a followup, Hegel persisted in recommending the stabilizing benefits of
                     “Schadenfreude,” and Niethammer finally responded with polite
                     objection: “It is possible that the giant you describe advancing with his
                     seven-league boots respects good intentions as little as bad, and that he is
                     right to trample down the work of all equally as something miserable. In any
                     case, it is only by the result that the individual can know whether he is
                     marching with or against him. But since the giant merely strides on, leaving to
                     the individual the task of making, pain or joy over the destiny of individuals
                     is inseparable from hope in the <foreign>pleroma</foreign>. At least to me it

                  <p>Marcuse argues that Hegel’s underlying concern is perpetuating bourgeois
                  civil society, i.e., preserving his quotidian world: “for Hegel, differences
                  in political form between nations did not matter so long as the underlying
                  identity of social and economic relations was uniformly maintained as that of
                  middle-class society” (184). He believes that Hegel’s subordination of
                  civil society to the state is actually undertaken in the name of civil society;
                  civil society does not know how to preserve itself, but the fact that it is worth
                  preserving justifies the state: “state sovereignty was a necessary
                  instrument for preserving middle-class society . . . . the change of form is
                  supposed to save the threatened content” (185-186). That all the conflicts
                  of civil society do not form a kind of subjectivity in itself, suggests that
                  disequilibrium from within threatens the inside that knows no outside,
                  necessitating another, supplementary outside, the state-envelope, to contain the
                  disruption. In this light, being <emph>un</emph>able to bear the absence of
                  anything good enough to praise would be an example of a disturbance that could
                  destroy equilibrium and would mean being willing to let go of society as we know
                  it: for—and this is the point to which I promised to
                  return—middle-class society “as is” is the other good world that
                  is good although no further good is coming, the good world that is good without
                  being praiseworthy. We might also say: the world that is beyond goodness, being
                  less optional and changeable than good. As readers, we can glimpse this stability
                  when Hegel comments to Niethammer that the principle of nothing too good or bad
                  rules “our world,” as though in reference to a world preceding the
                  events that happen within or around it, including even the appearance of the rule
                  of the middling that permeates it. By pursuing Hegel’s attachment to
                  society, Marcuse thus makes sense of his renunciation of theory in <title level="m">The Philosophy of Right</title>: by then “the modern state is
                  the reality” of reason, so “any further application of theory to
                  politics would make theory Utopian” (194). In the vocabulary of the
                  preservation of the (unpraisable) good inside from disruption, further
                  applications of theory would depart from the potentialities that exist within the
                  world “as is” and bring out more of what it is, and pass on to
                  potentialities that don’t exist and can only destroy. In nonpejorative
                  language, these would be utopian potentialities that exist only outside or inside
                  the existing world in a way that does destroy identity, and whose realization
                  would <emph>make it something altogether different.</emph>

                  <p>In the Hegel-Niethammer letters it becomes difficult to tell health from defense;
                  Hegel’s therapy of self-transformation can seem pathologically healthy. In
                  one of the most privileged documents of his interpretation of the restoration,
                  Hegel’s reaction to the “tragic” and “frightful
                  spectacle” is to claim that the future of the German nation was what he was
                  always describing in <title level="m">The Phenomenology of Spirit</title>:
                     <quote>Great events have transpired about us. It is a frightful spectacle to

                     of gravity, presses on like lead, to the same level as itself or even below.
                     The turning point of the whole, the reason why this mass has power
                     and—like the chorus—survives and remains on top, is that the great
                     individual must himself give that mass the right to do what it does, thus
                     precipitating his own fall.</quote>

                  (1822) Hegel develops the idea he sketches here of the restless movement of
                  freedom. Famously, Hegel explains that freedom is expanded and finally exploded by
                  its realization; therefore, it cannot be stopped and must transform. In the
                  present instance, the “self-destructive actuality” of the French
                  Republic “passes out [geht aus]” and then “passes for truth

                  Absolute freedom’s “refreshment” in the thought of the spirit
                  trickles down into the “brown rivulet of coffee [that] already flows from
                  the pot for the likes of us . . . with more taste and perk than ever.” Hegel
                  had been complaining for years about the economic and intellectual straits for
                  people like them, how impoverished in “taste and perk” the offerings
                  were—in fact, “colorless, tasteless” as of November 1814,
                  let’s recall. It isn’t saying much for Hegel to claim that moral
                  spirit will be perkier than what he’s been drinking. <note place="foot" resp="editors">A similar example: “For the time being,

                  connoisseurs speak of “the Lubitsch touch,” and that in spite of
                  Hegel’s published disapprovals of irony. Hegel’s disapproval makes
                  sense in the terms of his own system, since as he writes, irony gets in the way of
                  the exposure to committed relation, and so to self-transformation, which alone can
                  bring spiritual growth as he defines it (<title level="m">Aesthetics</title> 66).
                  Nonetheless, Hegel’s letters are saturated in irony; not a single word
                  escapes. In fact the irony Hegel distances himself from and the one he practices
                  are supposed to be distinct: the irony that shields a certain kind of skeptic
                  and/or romantic from reality, on one hand, and on the other the impersonal
                  “cunning of reason” that is visible <emph>after</emph> a reality, no
                  longer evadable, has been borne, and thus appears smaller against the perspective
                  of world spirit. In his prose, irony is the scar of having made contact with
                  reality, and as such it confirms the mutual translatability of restoration and
                  reformation. The two ironies threaten to merge, however, as soon as realist
                  calculation decides ahead of the game what the outcome must be and therefore which
                  hard reality must be assimilated. In this case, Hegel speaks from the perspective
                  of the aftermath clearly enough even when the “tragic” event is less
                  than three weeks past. Marcuse takes Hegel’s letter of April 10, 1814
                  (Letter 229) to show that even after the Allied forces took Paris he was not ready
                  to concede the war; but the coffee joke implies that he must also have been
                  preparing to concede it for some time.</p>
                  <p>Defense or healing? Prevention of injury, or ready self-transformation? Above we
                  see prophylaxis in Hegel’s implication that, actualization being
                  “self-destructive,” Germans should keep the coffee perking but sip it
                  only in thought. Comay catches the tenor of this move beautifully when she points
                  out that Hegel’s figures for freedom in the <title level="m">Lectures</title> are “confused between a fruit and a torch.” In
                  Hegel’s fear of consuming the objects of desire and of being consumed by
                  their radiance, theories of trauma would read the displaced memory of an injury
                  that has already occurred. I have suggested that Hegel’s good inside that
                  has no radical outside (or, finally, radically inner inside) is protected against
                  too sudden disruption by a procedure that knows how to preclude the too good and
                  the too bad. But for Hegel, there is as usual no final contradiction between the
                  options of pathology and health. </p>
                  <p>As Comay makes clear, in the traumatic structure the revolution is both too early
                  and too late. The healthy self in Hegel is the one that has encountered reality in
                  all its unwelcome violence, has traded part of itself in for new parts now
                  required, and as a result of its transformation can administer experience so that
                  it will not be too bad or good, meaning that future transformations will always be
                  possible in order to salvage the minimally good world as it is (at each time). The
                  world will never be too bad or good because, as indicated by the record of
                  exposure and transformation that builds up the self, there is an
                  “infinite” potential for subjectivity to overcome any of its own
                  unwelcome presentations by changing again and again. Freud brushes against this
                  scenario in <title level="m">Analysis Terminable and Interminable</title> when he
                  asks whether it could be possible for a self to develop “immunity” to
                  future disorders: as though “as though it were possible by means of analysis
                  to attain to a level of absolute psychical normality.” <note place="foot" resp="editors">Freud, <title level="a">Analysis Terminable and
                        Interminable</title> 216-254, 220, 219-220. For Freud too, absolute
                     normality would not mean having no feelings, but rather always knowing how to
                     manage one’s feelings short of disaster. I’ve argued elsewhere that
                     this normative armature of the infinitely resourceful spirit just is the myth
                     of the “subject” (Terada). </note> While Freud imagines that such
                  normality would mean that it was as though “the analyst ha[d] had such a
                  far-reaching influence on the patient that no further change could be expected to
                  take place in him if his analysis were continued” (Freud 219), Hegel follows
                  the complementary possibility that it would consist in an
                     <emph>inexhaustible</emph> stream of changes, each rising to the challenge of a
                  different self-presented negativity; but this would be possible for the same
                  reason that Freud imagines, that one “had succeeded in resolving every one
                  of the patient’s repressions and in filling in all the gaps in his
                  memory” (Freud 220)—liberating all of what Hegel would call the
                  mind’s subjective resources. The ability to process events in real time
                  without remainder would be pathological healthiness and healthy pathology, and
                  Hegel seems close to that. </p>
                  <p>Blackbourn and Eley argue that the hypothesis of a “failed bourgeois
                  revolution” promoted a myth of German exceptionalism, valued positively in
                  the idealist proposal that Germany had had something better than a revolution and
                  negatively in theses of German pathology. For Blackbourn and Eley, German
                  exceptionalism underwrites the assumption of “liberalism as the natural
                  property of a ‘rising’ bourgeoisie” (<title level="m">The
                     Peculiarities of German History</title> 58). The mistake is
                  “compounded,” Eley adds, “by the still riskier equation of
                  ‘liberalism’ and ‘democracy’” (80). <note place="foot" resp="editors">In practice, Eley tends to continue using
                     “liberal” and “democratic” interchangeably: e.g.,
                     “On one hand, there is the question of the conditions under which a
                     bourgeois capitalist society could successfully reproduce itself, or to put it
                     another way, the legal, political, and ideological conditions of existence for
                     a successful German capitalism. Then on the other hand, there is the question
                     of how a more liberal political system might have been achieved. <emph>These
                        are not the same question</emph>” (<title level="m">Peculiarities</title> 148). When “more liberal” is paired with
                     “political” in the text, it effectively means “more
                     democratic,” because Eley uses a tight definition of
                     “democracy” (in which universal franchise is the main element). I
                     understand the philosophical advantages of a narrow definition, but do not want
                     to use that paradigm because I want to allow for the possibility that even
                     liberal political systems are not necessarily democratic.</note> Blackbourn and
                  Eley hypothesize instead a nineteenth-century Germany in which the foreclosure of
                  democracy is a desired feature of a “new social order” (145),
                  straightforwardly in the interests of many involved in its creation. In this
                  scheme, the German bourgeoisie didn’t want more rights as much as they
                  wanted others not to have them. By dispensing with exceptionalism, Blackbourn and
                  Eley show what it’s like to perceive the foreclosure of democracy from the
                  point of view of a rationalized society that does not see anything absent. Kant
                  reflects on nature “as the poets see it,” that is, just as sensuous
                  shapes. What is frightening about Blackbourn and Eley’s vision of society
                  “as the bourgeois see it” is that it is free of defense—just a
                  shifting of factors. (Hegel: “the extremes are merged and become
                  factors” [<title level="m">Logic, Being Part One of the Encyclopedia</title>
                  §214]). This kind of freedom constitutes that liberality that can be found within
                  the police state. Suggesting that the foreclosure of democracy is grounded in
                  defense—in Germans, bourgeois populations, or whomever—is a little
                  like hypothesizing German exceptionalism; perhaps, instead, these groups
                  don’t get so far as to have a need for defense. To grasp this, in turn, is
                  to remove many of the pejorative connotations of “defense.”</p>
                  <p>A subtext of my argument has been that the vocabulary for political activity seems
                  especially inadequate before Marx and before German unification. In 1816, the date
                  of the latest of the letters I’ve considered here, radicals had at their
                  disposal neither a full-blown theory of class, nor a unified German state to
                  affirm or oppose; from a standpoint located after those things, it could seem that
                  they were flying blind, and simply didn’t know yet what they were looking at
                  and therefore what to do. Yet restoration radicals’ disorientation can also
                  seem more revealing, more self-aware, than the nation-based political theory that
                  supplanted it. It has more to say to us than we have to say back to it, especially
                  since, in a complementary way, the vocabulary of the liberal nation-state has come
                  to seem particularly inadequate after globalization. Yet we still speak of
                  “failed” postcolonial and post-Soviet states and of the
                  “failure” of many people to be interested in democracy—of their
                  strange inability to get its point fully, as though democracy was something
                  otherwise readily available, that people want and want other people to have.
                  Instead of encouraging such speech, literature of the early Vormärz discloses a
                  world in which a template for the development of democracy no sooner becomes
                  thinkable than it disappears. </p>
                  <p>Their glimpse of the way their contemporaries see panics some post-Waterloo
                  radicals; Hegel is different, unpanicked, to the extent that he is confident about
                  assimilating and still having an identical self left to assimilate with. At stake
                  in the phenomenology he practices is his ability to absorb and interact with what
                  he sees even as it poisons him to blindness. Together, Hegel’s and
                  Niethammer’s interlocking strategies describe a double bind: the one who
                  can’t bear to dwell in the new reality will be unlikely to understand it,
                  but the one who can bear it has already been changed by the very bearing of it
                  into a participant who may no longer perceive its disadvantages. Hegel confides
                  that focusing on the work of spirit allows him to feel “satisfaction”
                  and “<foreign>Schadenfreude</foreign>” under political pressure, and
                  he recommends it as a therapy for the times (Letter 272). Working on the basis of
                  exactly the same perceptions, romanticism, as Hegel knows, perceives how appealing
                  it may be not to withstand a transition, even if it means feeling the full impact
                  of political catastrophe. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> The very
                     canonical narrative of the hostility between Hegel and romanticism is taken up
                     on one side by Carl Schmitt (see <title level="m">Political
                     Romanticism</title>) and on the other by Georges Bataille (see <title level="a">Letter to X, Lecturer on Hegel . . .</title>). </note> One aspect of this
                  impact, I’ve suggested, is having to give up on the idea of the minimal
                  goodness of the social world. An impasse between “positive” and
                  “negative” politics persists to the present day. Exploring the
                  disorientating indistinction of this time, we can see that the impasse constructed
                  by romantics is not the disaster, but a response to the disaster—a way to
                  begin organizing an otherwise undifferentiated space in which actively undergoing
                  transition provides the only acknowledged value. Correlatively, the romantic
                  conclusion that the capacity to bear what goes by the name of
                  “Waterloo” is a health worse than death is not based on finding
                  Hegel’s system, or European politics, closed as opposed to breathtakingly
                  open. It is based on the perception of a world in which the closed and the open
                  are becoming impossible to tell apart. </p>

                  <p>I begin and end with one of the more extraordinary daydreams from an age of
                  philosophical daydreaming, one of such startling theoretical acceleration that it
                  seems to expand at the speed of the universe. Floating off the rocky seaboard of
                  Norway east of Arendal, Mary Wollstonecraft gazes on the barren shoreline and
                  allows her mind to wander: <quote> The view of this wild coast, as we sailed along
                     it, afforded me a continual subject for meditation. I anticipated the future
                     improvement of the world, and observed how much man still had to do, to obtain
                     of the earth all it could yield. I even carried my speculations so far as to
                     advance a million or two of years to the moment when the earth would perhaps be
                     so perfectly cultivated, and so completely peopled, as to render it necessary
                     to inhabit every spot; yes, these bleak shores. Imagination went still farther,
                     and pictured the state of man when the earth could no longer support him. Where
                     was he to fly to from universal famine? Do not smile: I really became
                     distressed for these fellow creatures, yet unborn. The images fastened on me,
                     and the world appeared a vast prison. I was soon to be in a smaller
                     one—for no other name can I give to Rusoer. It would be difficult to form
                     an idea of the place, if you have never seen one of these rocky coasts. (<title level="m">Letters</title> 102) </quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of course, Wollstonecraft traverses such forbidding terrain as the ostensible
                  business envoy of her increasingly remote lover, Gilbert Imlay, whose
                  “importing” business supplies a suitable pretext for sending
                  Wollstonecraft northward in the summer of 1795. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> As Mary Favret discusses, Imlay was involved in blockade
                     running in violation of the Traitorous Correspondence Bill of 1793, delivering
                     vital goods to revolutionary France through the neutral ports of the north. One
                     of Imlay’s ships carrying valuable French silver and plate (a ship
                     rechristened <title level="m">Maria and Margaretha</title> after Wollstonecraft
                     and her maid) disappeared outside Arendal and was reported sunk. Suspecting a
                     double-cross, Imlay sent Wollstonecraft to Scandinavia as his legal
                     representative in a suit against the ship’s captain. See Favret, 1993:
                     97-8. </note> Recently returned from Paris where she had witnessed the Terror
                  firsthand, a disquieted Wollstonecraft savors the political and picturesque
                  neutrality of Scandinavia: indeed, in the opening letter of <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and
                     Denmark</title> (1796), she writes of her first glimpses of the
                  “sterile” coastline—“Rocks were piled on rocks, forming a
                  suitable bulwark to the ocean”—and notes the stirring of a
                  “spontaneous pleasure which gives credibility to our expectation of
                  happiness.” “I forgot the horrors I had witnessed in France,”
                  she concludes, “which had cast a gloom over all nature” (14). Faced
                  with such vacant and uniformly austere space, Wollstonecraft experiences the
                  “dilating [of]…emotions which were painfully concentrated” (14).</p>
                  <p> However, Wollstonecraft’s shoreline reverie intimates the perils of such
                  affective dilation, especially if unchecked by the modest aims of the historical
                  imagination. Arguably, one could view Wollstonecraft’s future distress as a
                  manifestation of what Jean-François Lyotard has identified as a
                  historico-political enthusiasm, a “modality of the sublime feeling”
                  that arises in Kant’s critique of history: specifically, “[t]his
                  enthusiasm is the <foreign>Begebenheit</foreign> that has been sought for within
                  the historical experience of humanity so as to be able to validate the phrase:
                  ‘Humanity is constantly progressing toward the better’” (29,
                  32). Kant’s sense of <foreign>Begebenheit</foreign> as an event “which
                     <emph>delivers itself</emph> into human history” squares with
                  Wollstonecraft’s hyper-generative vision: each seeks to “indicate a
                  cause such that the occurrence of its effect remains undetermined with regard to
                  time” (Lyotard 26; emphasis mine). <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     As will become clear below, this question of the undetermined time of
                     deliverance troubles post-Paris Wollstonecraft most acutely. Not incidentally,
                     in <title level="a">The Contest of the Faculties</title> Kant reflects on the
                     still unresolved revolution in France (it “may succeed, or it may
                     fail”), and asserts that no matter the historical reckoning, “I
                     maintain that this revolution has aroused in the hearts and desires of all
                     spectators who are not themselves caught up in it a <emph>sympathy</emph> which
                     borders almost on enthusiasm, although the very utterance of this sympathy was
                     fraught with danger” (<title level="a">Contest</title> 182). </note>
                  While this sublime feeling occasions the experience of the idea of humanity in
                  ourselves, it also, according to Lyotard, broaches something akin to dementia,
                  “that is, believing there is a direct presentation when there isn’t
                  any….Enthusiasm, for its sake, sees nothing, or rather sees nothingness and
                  relates it back to the unpresentable” (31-2). However, ultimately
                  Wollstonecraft’s meditation would fall short of Kantian sublimity simply
                  because it converts the end of history into a scene of sentiment; or as Kant
                  writes in the third <title level="m">Critique</title> (§29): “A sympathetic
                  grief that will not admit of consolation, or one referring to imaginary evils to
                  which we deliberately surrender ourselves—being deceived by fancy—as
                  if they were actual, indicates and produces a tender, though weak,
                  soul—which shows a beautiful side and which can be called fanciful, though
                  not enthusiastic” (141). Wollstonecraft would certainly not share
                  Kant’s supposition that the feelings that follow in the wake of such
                  mathematical sublimity dilute its force; <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     “But because there is in our Imagination a striving towards infinite
                     progress, and in our Reason a claim for absolute totality, regarded as a real
                     Idea, therefore this very inadequateness for that Idea in our faculty for
                     estimating the magnitude of things of sense, excites in us the feeling of a
                     supersensible faculty. And it is not the object of sense, but the use which the
                     Judgment naturally makes of certain objects on behalf of this latter feeling,
                     that is absolutely great; and in comparison every other use is small….<emph>the
                        sublime is that, the mere ability to think which, shows a faculty of the
                        mind surpassing every standard of Sense</emph>” (<title level="m">Critique</title> 109-10). </note> for while she seems discomfited by her
                  manufactured “distress” (“Do not smile…”), the very
                  production of a scene of universal suffering out of emptiness seems strangely
                  consistent with Kant’s contention that “it is the state of mind
                  produced by a certain representation with which the reflective Judgment is
                  occupied, and not the Object, that is to be called sublime” (<title level="m">Critique</title> 110).</p>
                  <p>Naturally, one might be tempted to view this abrupt unleashing of
                  Wollstonecraft’s imagination, its wild “peopling” of empty
                  inhospitable space, as an instance of Malthusian geometrical terror, save for the
                  fact that Wollstonecraft’s Scandinavian letters were composed in 1795, full
                  three years before the first edition of <title level="m">An Essay on the Principle
                     of Population</title>. But ever mindful of the failed promise of revolution in
                  France, <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title>
                  demonstrates a restless commitment to thinking the ends of universal history, at
                  times reading more like a work of philosophical anthropology than a travel memoir.
                  Recall, for instance, Wollstonecraft’s counterfactual hypothesis about early
                  human migration: “the first dwelling of man,” she speculates, must
                  have been in the gloomy rusticity of Northern Europe, leading primitive man to
                  migrate south in search of sun “[so] that the different parts of the earth
                  might be peopled,” for how else does one explain the presence of human
                  populations in such merciless terrains than by resorting to the logic of origins
                  (44). In such instances, Wollstonecraft cribs from that most quintessential of
                  enlightenment genres, the conjectural history, to redirect the narrative of
                  stadial development to corroborate her own sense of the native comforts of
                  “this rejected spot” (43), a spot the likes of which she will, in
                  subsequent letters, imaginatively repopulate to death. Wollstonecraft regularly
                  addresses her observations to “the compilers of universal histories”
                  (48) and “writers who have considered the history of man, or of the human
                  mind, on a more enlarged scale” (49), and few texts of the period
                  demonstrate the penetration of proto-anthropological knowledge into forms of
                  everyday perception more than <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short
                     Residence</title>. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> For recent critical
                     reflections on the role that conjectural history plays in the development of
                     the human and social sciences, see Palmeri. </note> Thus, one might be content
                  to understand her population distress as simply an errant impulsion of thought in
                  the direction of a grim anthropological future.</p>
                  <p> Such a reading would certainly harmonize with what Mary Jacobus calls
                  Wollstonecraft’s “sustained inquiry into amatory
                  melancholia”—here dangerously quickened by the power of the
                  imagination to reproduce beyond the means of affective support—leaving us
                  once again “at the common site of transference and maternity” (Jacobus
                  65, 66). However, suffused as it is with both personal loss and political
                  disenchantment, Wollstonecraft’s peculiar melancholia in Scandinavia exceeds
                  the private demands of a wounded ego, and insists upon recognizing a melancholia
                  haunting the world-historical subject. In his <title level="m">Memoirs</title> of
                  his late wife, William Godwin portrays the impact of the French Revolution on
                  Wollstonecraft as one of blunt trauma, for “while it gave a fundamental
                  shock to the human intellect through every region of the globe, [it] did not fail
                  to produce a conspicuous effect in the progress of Mary’s reflections. The
                  prejudices of her early years suffered a vehement concussion” (Godwin 72).
                  This concussed state interrupted the career of a “mind…insensibly advancing
                  towards a vigorous maturity,” breaking Wollstonecraft’s reverence for
                  “establishment” values and sensitizing her to a world of injustice
                  (72). Godwin’s account of <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of
                     Men</title> subsequently highlights his future wife’s oscillation between
                  “burst[s] of indignation” and “temporary fit[s] of torpor and
                  indolence” during the process of composition, her progress and political
                  engagement dependent on the availability of “stimulus” (73). 
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Perhaps befitting for a man who is managing
                     his own grief through feverish writing and editing, Godwin frequently measures
                     Wollstonecraft’s shifting psychological condition by means of her
                     intellectual output. For instance, as her romance with Henry Fuseli is slowly
                     deteriorating, Godwin notes that “she produced nothing, except a few
                     articles in the Analytical Review” over a twelve month period (82).
                  </note> Thus, in December 1792 when Wollstonecraft left for an already tumultuous
                  Paris to experience the revolution firsthand and alone, Godwin notes that she had
                  no timeline for return since “the single purpose she had in view being that
                  of an endeavour to heal her distempered mind” (83). Wollstonecraft’s
                  fame as the author of the <title level="m">Vindications</title> afforded her
                  access into the circles of the Girondin leadership as well as various British
                  expatriate communities in Paris; but whatever sanguinity she possessed about the
                  fate of the revolution quickly eroded with the cruelties of Robespierre, the
                  establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunal, and the renewal of war between France
                  and Britain in February 1793. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Godwin
                     recounts a particular moment along the <foreign>Place de Louis Quinze</foreign>
                     when Wollstonecraft, pregnant with Fanny Imlay, happened upon a public
                     execution, “the blood of the guillotine appear[ing] fresh upon the
                     pavement.” “The emotions of her soul burst forth in indignant
                     exclamations,” Godwin writes, “while a prudent bystander warned her
                     of her danger, and intreated her to hasten and hide her discontents”
                     (89). Godwin notes that the precarious political situation in France—e.g.
                     the rise and cruelties of Robespierre; the execution of Girondin leaders
                     Brissot and Vergniaud (the news of which produced “one of the most
                     intolerable sensations she had ever experienced”),
                     etc.—“contributed to banish tranquility from the first months of
                     her pregnancy” (89). Here and elsewhere Godwin slyly suggests the
                     imprinting of historical trauma onto Wollstonecraft’s pregnancy. </note>
                     <title level="m">An Historical and Moral View of the Origins and Progress of the
                     French Revolution</title> (1794), Wollstonecraft’s determined attempt to
                  rescue the theoretical impetus for revolutionary change from its terrifying
                  actualization, registers the seeming impossibility of revolutionary optimism when
                  its “history” cannot progress much beyond 1789, stopping well short of
                  the Revolution’s most violent turns (Furniss 69). Or, as Wollstonecraft
                  writes in <title level="m">Historical and Moral View</title>, “[o]ne great
                  cause of misery in the present imperfect state of society is, that the
                  imagination, continually tantalized, becomes the inflated wen of the mind,
                  draining off the nourishment from the vital parts” (18).</p>
                  <p> It is this metastasized imagination, incited by the prospect of revolutionary
                  progress and indifferent to the slowness of historico-political time, that
                  concerns me in this essay, for I see it quickening Wollstonecraft’s
                  population terror and producing a form of historical untimeliness that can only be
                  resolved in disaster. By casting Wollstonecraft’s political awakening in
                  terms of a traumatized and volatile sensorium, Godwin cultivates a vision of his
                  subject as “a female Werther,” whose mind “seem[s] almost of too
                  fine a texture to encounter the vicissitudes of human affairs” (88). <note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of course, Wollstonecraft was in some sense
                     “radicalized” well before the Fall of the Bastille, for by the mid
                     1780s she had come under the influence of the Dissenting clergyman Dr. Richard
                     Price and within a few years she was regularly writing and translating for
                     Joseph Johnson’s radical publishing house. See Furniss 59. </note>
                  Melancholia is of course always a debilitating excess of inassimilable knowledge,
                  and none more so than the act of mourning one’s fellow creatures, yet
                  unborn. According to the familiar Freudian paradigm, where mourning can eventually
                  release the lost object back to history, melancholia steadfastly, even
                  pathologically, refuses such closure. But what of melancholia oriented,
                  proleptically, toward the disaster of the future, one held open by an impossible
                  act of mourning? On one hand, mourning what cannot be known is constitutive of
                  melancholia, but both mourning and melancholia are structured around the lost
                  object and its remains, so what if there was no object in the first place, no
                  remains to incite (as one recent, rather sanguine account of mourning put it) the
                  “volatile potentialit[ies] and future militancies” available in loss
                  (Eng and Kazanjian 5)? Can one grieve that which is not only unborn, but “a
                  million or two of years” distant, and thus effectively at the limits of
                  historical imagination? Freud makes clear at the beginning of <title level="a">Mourning and Melancholia</title> that one can mourn not only “the loss
                  of a loved person,” but also “the loss of some abstraction which has
                  taken the place of one, such as fatherland, liberty, an ideal, and so on”
                  (164). The substitutability of one lost object for another, here successively
                  abstracted toward idealization (and beyond), allows for the possibility that the
                  source of the melancholic projection may be unrecoverable. Freud’s
                  “and so on” extends the tropological progression continuously, leaving
                  open-ended the question of what might lie beyond lost ideality.</p>
                  <p> As Judith Butler demonstrates, the inward “turn” of
                  melancholia—whereby the lost object is retained, ungrieved and undeclared as
                  constitutive of the ego—produces “a set of spatializing tropes for
                  psychic life, domiciles of preservation and shelter as well as arenas for struggle
                  and persecution” (171). The psychic topographies that result from this
                  operation are more than simply illustrative figures for interiority; rather, they
                  persist as “textualized symptoms” of what they seek to explain (179).
                  In withdrawing the beloved object from conscious life, Butler argues, the
                  melancholic withdraws “a configuration of the social world as well,”
                  in the process making the ego into a “‘polity’ and conscience
                  one of its ‘major institutions,’ precisely…to annul the losses that
                  [the social] world demands” (181-2). When the lost object is political hope
                  itself, the entire psycho-social manifold becomes politicized to such a degree
                  that even deserted landscape becomes a potential site of revolutionary mourning.
                  In what follows, I want to consider Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Denmark and Norway</title>
                  within the historical imagination of the 1790s and, by extension, within a
                  theorization of romantic history shuttling between the “anticipated…future
                  improvement of the world” and the bleak shores of disaster to come. Haunted
                  by what was to have been the future, Wollstonecraft struggles to reconcile the
                  time of revolutionary politics with what we might call “species time,”
                  resulting in forms of untimeliness that figure as disaster without end.
                  “[D]isaster ruins everything,” writes Maurice Blanchot, “all the
                  while leaving everything intact” (1), a sentiment, I argue, captured in
                  Wollstonecraft’s curious fascination with empty palaces and estates. 
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> I am drawn to Blanchot’s
                     conceptualization of disaster as imminence without a future as a way of
                     understanding Wollstonecraft’s pervasive sense of temporal
                     destabilization. Blanchot writes, “We are on the edge of disaster without
                     being able to situate it in the future: it is rather always already past, and
                     yet we are on the edge or under the threat, all formulations which would imply
                     the future—that which is yet to come—if the disaster were not that
                     which does not come, that which has put a stop to every arrival. To think the
                     disaster (if this is possible, and it is not possible inasmuch as we suspect
                     that the disaster is thought) is to have no longer any future in which to think
                     it” (1). </note>

                  <head>II. Disaster and Deep Time </head>
                  <p>Arguably, Wollstonecraft’s speculations regarding the million-year fate of
                  the human species are part of a general shift in what was historically conceivable
                  in the eighteenth century. The Western understanding of historical time underwent
                  a vertiginous change between 1750 and the early decades of the nineteenth century,
                  as the positing of geological or “deep” time began to erode the
                  hegemony of the six-thousand-year-old Biblical earth, and sacral or prophetical
                  histories were challenged by new models of temporalization structured according to
                  the tempos of scientific inquiry. As Daniel Rosenberg has shown, Buffon’s
                  startling hypothesis that the planet was seventy-five thousand years old
                  understated the French naturalist’s suspicion that the age of the earth
                  should actually be measured in millions of years (46-7). Indeed, Buffon’s
                  eventual theory of the cooling planet—which began as a “mass of
                  incandescent matter in space…condensed into a spinning spheroid, which thereafter
                  had cooled slowly to its present state, and would continue to cool” (Rudwick
                  150)—hypothesizes the most comprehensive “natural history”
                  imaginable, the life of the planet through to its thermodynamic demise at some
                  unavoidable point in the future. This historicization of the earth, and
                  particularly the recognition of a vast geohistory anterior to human civilization
                  effectively burst open the concept of time, making clear that <emph>human</emph>
                  history is but a brief rustle of surface activity in the immensity that is the
                  fate of a planet. Buttressed by enlightenment natural history, historical time
                  became increasingly accumulative, quantitative, and spatialized, but not
                  altogether graspable. By 1785 when James Hutton presented “The System of the
                  Habitable Earth with Regard to its Duration and Stability” to the Royal
                  Society of Edinburgh, the concept of the earth’s dynamic equilibrium was
                  producing an abyssal relationship to time, as the physics of the earth threatened
                  to escape human historical measurement. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     See Rudwick 115-131 for a useful discussion of the threat to the Biblical
                     timescale by enlightenment scientists, and the concomitant stretching of the
                     human imagination in regard to the immensity of time. </note>

                  <p>As the past receded from view, so too did our speculative futures undergo a
                  temporal and conceptual sprawl. A distinctly modern, scientific futurity separated
                  itself from both prophetic thought and eschatological conclusion, even as romantic
                  historicity (to believe Frederic Jameson) acknowledged “the judgment of the
                  future on the present” as a mode of periodization and historical reckoning
                  (26). This decidedly <emph>earthly</emph> judgment to come allows the future to
                  “flash up” into the present as powerfully, and at times as
                  dangerously, as the past is thought to. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     The trope of the past “flashing up” into the present “at a
                     moment of danger” is, of course, from Walter Benjamin’s <title level="a">Theses on the Philosophy of History</title> (255, 256). </note>
                  The question of the open-endedness of time, posed repeatedly as the question of
                  progress in the eighteenth century, encourages a host of new narrative
                  possibilities where prophecy produced only time’s fateful destruction:
                  Rosenberg notes the flourishing of a “<foreign>uchronian</foreign>
                  imagination” in fictions of the 1770s—most famously in the French
                  bestseller, Louis-Sébastien Mercier’s <title level="m">L’An
                     2440</title>—alongside forms of conjectural history that were oriented
                  increasingly toward progressive futures, culminating in the 1790s with the work of
                  Condorcet, Godwin and others (47). As enormous recalibrations of planetary history
                  diminished human presence in the past, futurological thought increasingly posed
                  the question of human ends: indeed, romantic era writers, visionaries,
                  philosophers, and political economists hypothesize the future ontologies of the
                  “human” nearly as fervently, if not as systematically, as the
                  Victorians would worry humankind’s evolutionary past.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps no speculative model captures this revolution in quantitative time as
                  cleanly and chillingly as Malthus working through his geometrical progressions:
                  “In two centuries and a quarter, the population would be to the means of
                  subsistence as 512 to 10: in three centuries as 4096 to 13, and in two thousand
                  years the difference would be almost incalculable” (75). Even before the
                  mathematical abstractions and demographic tables are converted into reproducing
                  bodies in the thrall of instinct, we recognize what Godwin will later call
                  “the germ of multiplication” working in Malthus’ program, its
                  presumption of predictable, mathematized intervals of time rather than
                  Nature’s mysterious sequencing, “whether her series alternately
                  progress or retrograde;—whether they circulate, or decrease, or flow in
                  straight and eternal lines” (1820: 6, 249). But while Malthus certainly
                  devotes more energy to soberly correcting fantasies of human perfectibility and
                  denouncing Poor Law legislation that disincentivizes labor and encourages
                  reproduction, he does recognize something self-regulating in the planet’s
                  history, for while the “law of increase in a geometrical progression is
                  absolutely immense,” <quote> The laws of nature which make food necessary to
                     the life of man, as well as of plants and animals, prevent the continued
                     existence of an excess which cannot be supported, and thus either discourage
                     the production of such an excess, or destroy it in the bud, in such a way as to
                     make it scarcely perceptible to a careless observer. (266) </quote>
                  Extrapolating from his final point, Malthus argues that historical
                  disasters—e.g. war, drought, pandemics, hurricanes, etc.—are but
                  periodic “checks” on exponential growth; or rather, looked at another
                  way, instances of mass destruction are quickly offset and compensated by the
                  steady engines of human reproduction. “The effects of the dreadful plague in
                  London in 1666,” Malthus writes, “were not perceptible fifteen or
                  twenty years afterwards. The traces of the most destructive famines in China and
                  Indostan are by all accounts very soon obliterated” (107). Epidemics in
                  Turkey and Egypt, earthquakes in Lisbon and Lima, volcanic eruptions in Naples and
                  Pompeii all “have but a trifling effect on the average population of any
                  state” (107-8). It is a measure of the scale and abstraction of
                  Malthus’ principle of population that historical events of this magnitude
                  serve merely a regulatory role; moreover, according to the account of history
                  intimated here, such catastrophic events threaten to disappear from the planetary
                  record, their “traces…very soon obliterated.”</p>
                  <p>This shift in the scale of history threatens to attenuate how we measure disaster
                  and mass mortality, and it does so just as the Lisbon earthquake and its
                  philosophical aftermath were curing Voltaire of Leibniz’s theodicy and
                  ushering in the modern event-structure of history. As many have noted after
                  Adorno, Lisbon was to the catastrophe of nature as Auschwitz was to catastrophe of
                  history, and as such it punctuated the end of traditional modes of belief and
                  proved a vital if grim catalyst for modern disenchantment. But a deeper ecological
                  understanding of history modifies the seismic import of any single sublunary
                  event, in part because it can imagine a history that is not measured in
                  demographic impact. One might even begin to argue that despite the dark admonitory
                  vision of exhausted resources and mass starvation, Malthus is hardly a theorist of
                  catastrophe, because there is no exceptional event in his theoretical model, only
                  a mathematical horizon and the inevitability of time and instinct. In fact, the
                  1798 first edition of <title level="m">Essay</title> is remarkably devoid of
                  horror, and hardly the “charnel house” of Hazlitt’s fevered
                  imagination. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Hazlitt writes of
                     subsequent editions of Malthus’ <title level="m">Essay on the Principle
                        of Population</title>, “He triumphs over the calamities and
                     degradation of his fellow-creatures. He lays open all the sores and blotches of
                     humanity with the same calmness and alacrity as a hospital surgeon does those
                     of the diseased body. He turns the world into a charnel house” (101).
                     Both Godwin and Hazlitt take Malthus to considerable task for trying to
                     manipulate and frighten the public about population increase in his subsequent
                     editions. </note> However, touched by what Derrida, writing of Kant, calls the
                  “apocalyptic tone” in philosophy, Malthus imagines the
                     <emph>ongoingness</emph> of catastrophe, its endless arrival, by which I mean
                  not simply gradual resource depletion, nor even the unthinking and uninterrupted
                  disaster unfolding in the plant and animal world (where the power of increase
                  remains largely unimpeded, and an organic, if merciless equilibrium takes hold),
                  but rather a disaster at the heart of the historical human species.</p>
                  <p> Graced with reason, social aspirations, and some measure of bodily discipline,
                  humankind must calibrate the relationship between number of offspring and the
                  provisions necessary to support them, the labor necessary to produce such support,
                  the potential loss of independence, the social consequences of family size, and so
                  on. Noting that despite its current populousness the growth rate in Europe has
                  slowed considerably, Malthus speculates that some measure of “preventative
                  foresight” has historically emerged as a consequence of the experience of
                  existential and social distress. This world historical contestation between
                  unflagging reproductive drive and new forms of demographic reason provides the
                  scaffolding for Malthus’ nascent “theory of mind” at the end of
                  the 1798 <title level="m">Essay</title>, but one senses that it is a contestation
                  without a victor (62). All living creatures experience population pressure, and
                  most of nature allows the world’s essential finitude to cull the species;
                  humankind alone has the capacity to “interrupt” the power of increase
                  in its “career” through reason and sexual discretion (76). But most of
                  the checks to human proliferation are as dismal as the everyday disaster felt by
                  plants and animals, for Malthus lists forms of vice (e.g. prostitution, birth
                  control, infanticide, polyandry) and misery (abstinence) as the most common
                  responses to the need for population control. As Catherine Gallagher reminds us,
                  Malthus was the first to contend that “sexual instinct was at the very core
                  of our human nature…as permanent and intractable as the instinct for
                  self-preservation,” and by making sexual desire a motor of human history,
                  Malthus ensured that any restraint on that desire would produce distress and
                  suffering (Gallagher 159). Put another way, whether checked or unchecked the
                  principle of population would seem to insure privation of some sort. In the final
                  chapters of the <title level="m">Essay</title> we begin to discover explicitly
                  what has been clear all along and what gives the treatise its acknowledged
                  “melancholy hue”: Malthus views being-in-the-world as one extended
                  “state of trial,” life a “constant succession of sentient
                  beings, rising apparently from so many specks of matter, going through a long and
                  sometimes painful process in this world” (62, 201). Or, as Malthus announces
                  with Hobbesian economy, “man as he really is [is] inert, sluggish, and
                  averse from labour, unless compelled by necessity” (205).</p>
                  <p>Malthus’ philosophical pessimism drew the ire of many of his reform-minded
                  contemporaries, but for the author of the <title level="m">Essay on the Principle
                     of Population</title> the unwillingness to intellectually confront “one
                  of the general laws of animated nature”—i.e. “[t]he perpetual
                  tendency in the race of man to increase beyond the means of
                  subsistence”—amounts to “unmanly conduct” (199). Indeed,
                  to chase dreams of species improvement, or worse “perfectibility,”
                  only exacerbates the toll on the already overtaxed human subject, for “we
                  shall not only exhaust our strength in fruitless exertions…but we shall be
                  perpetually crushed by the recoil of this rock of Sisyphus” (199). Every way
                  lies privation and hardship. As a consequence Malthus must insist that
                  “exertion” is what gives form to consciousness, for “[i]f
                  Locke’s ideas be just, and there is great reason to think that it is, evil
                  seems to be necessary to create exertion, and exertion seems evidently necessary
                  to create mind” (204). By adopting a version of sensationalist epistemology
                  that makes struggle and affliction constitutive of mind, Malthus imagines the
                  human subject as something akin to an isolated thermodynamic system asymptotically
                  approaching entropy—or what Malthus repeatedly calls “a general and
                  fatal torpor of the human faculties”—unless roused by persistent
                  calamities of sensation (205).</p>
                  <p>This argument for the necessity of privation and exertion was not uncommon in
                  period accounts of universal history. Kant famously portrays nature as productive
                  of ceaseless and necessary struggle: “Man wishes to live comfortably and
                  pleasantly, but nature intends that he should abandon idleness and inactive
                  self-sufficiency and plunge instead into labour and hardships, so that he may by
                  his own adroitness find means of liberating himself from them in turn”
                     (<title level="a">Idea</title> 45). Meanwhile, isolated in rugged Scandinavia,
                  Wollstonecraft too insists that “[a] degree of exertion, produced by some
                  want, more or less painful, is probably the price we must pay for knowledge”
                  (105). But Malthus alone seems to turn the psychology of strain into a
                  quasi-theology of equilibrium: man’s “sluggish existence” is
                  awakened by “the animating touches of the Divinity,” those
                  “roughnesses and inequality in life which querulous man too frequently makes
                  the subject of his complaint against the God of nature” (202-3).
                  Malthus’ God fashions a human subject weighed down by listlessness and
                  impoverishment, then spurs him to action through relentless and unending want, the
                  “animating touch” of unremitting disaster: <quote> Had population and
                     food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have
                     emerged from the savage state. But supposing the earth once well peopled, an
                     Alexander, a Julius Caesar, a Tamberlane, or a bloody revolution might
                     irrevocably thin the human race, and defeat the great designs of the Creator.
                     The ravages of a contagious disease would be felt for ages; and an earthquake
                     might unpeople a region for ever. The principle, according to which population
                     increases, prevents the vices of mankind, or the accidents of nature, the
                     partial evils arising from general laws, from obstructing the high purpose of
                     the creation….But it is impossible that this law can operate, and produce the
                     effects apparently intended by the Supreme Being, without occasioning partial
                     evil. (206) </quote> Malthus immediately tries to spin this scandalous vision
                  as “favourable to the growth of the mind” because it produces
                  “the universal exertion…[the] infinite variety of situations, and
                  consequently of impressions” that stimulate human consciousness (206). But
                  there seems a strange distortion of aspect ratio here, leading Malthus to
                  ultimately insist that we “consider chiefly the mass of mankind and not
                  individual instances” (207). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> This
                     curious refocalization is perhaps best exemplified in Malthus’ subsequent
                     indictment of perfectibilian fantasies. Complaining of the “fastidious
                     microscopic eye of short-sighted men” looking for perfection, Malthus
                     celebrates the telescopic eye of the realist: “Uniform, undiversified
                     perfection could not possess the same awakening powers. When we endeavour then
                     to contemplate the system of the universe, when we think of the stars as the
                     suns of other systems scattered throughout infinite space, when we reflect that
                     we do not probably see a millionth part of those bright orbs that are beaming
                     light and life to unnumbered worlds, when our minds, unable to grasp the
                     immeasurable conception, sink, lost and confounded, in admiration at the mighty
                     incomprehensible power of the Creator, let us not querulously complain that all
                     climates are not equally genial, that perpetual spring does not reign
                     throughout the year, that all God’s creatures do not possess some
                     advantages, that clouds and tempests sometimes darken the natural world and
                     vice and misery the moral world, and that all the works of creation are not
                     formed with equal perfection” (211-12). </note> By reducing war, famine,
                  plague, and natural disasters to “partial evils”—partial because
                  the “thinning” of the human race is countered by inexorable
                  demographic growth, and vice versa—Malthus not only broaches a scale of
                  historical accounting (and accountability) that threatens to evacuate the moral
                  universe of its groundwork, but he imagines the conditions of a necessary,
                  purposeful, and ever approaching disaster.</p>
                  <p>Malthus is not much interested in this condition of traumatic anticipation. The
                  end of the first edition of <title level="m">Essay</title> is dedicated to the
                  proposition that “Evil exists in the world not to create despair but
                  activity”: where the “uniform, undiversified perfection”
                  imagined by Godwin and Cordorcet would only bring about inaction and regression,
                  the forbidding realism of Malthus attempts to make a virtue of misery, arguing
                  that “[t]he sorrows and distresses of life form another class of
                  excitements, which seem to be necessary, by a particular train of impressions, to
                  soften and humanize the heart” (217, 209). By hewing to a sentimental
                  vocabulary of instructive suffering and by shifting the focus of his treatise from
                  the population dynamics to “theory of mind,” Malthus often fails to
                  differentiate the scale of what goads the mind to activity, such that instances of
                  mass mortality and catastrophic destruction are frequently reduced to the level of
                  “excitations” and experiential “variety.” Natural evil
                  pitilessly contracts the human population, but at least it prompts survivors to
                  further liveliness and improvement. This has important consequences for our
                  thinking of disaster. Despite being introduced as a large-scale planetary
                  modulation that would seem to escape human comprehension, disaster by the end of
                  the 1798 <title level="m">Essay</title> figures as a disturbance of consciousness,
                  a disaster of sensation and feeling that paradoxically moves the species toward
                  life rather than death. The Malthusian disaster is not experienced as
                  inassimilable shock or trauma, but rather it rouses the human subject into a
                  future shaped and bounded by disaster.</p>
                  <p>This untraumatized mass subject benefits from rarely participating in prospective
                  thought, and thus it seems that disaster’s imminence does not manifest
                  itself symptomatically. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Earlier in his
                     treatise Malthus worries that poor relief shelters its recipients within a
                     false sense of financial security, leading to careless decisions about their
                     reproductive lives (e.g. they marry sooner, reproduce more, labor less, starve
                     more). The argument depends on a familiar psychological portrait of the
                     laboring class in the thrall of immediate gratification and lacking moral
                     restraint, a condition that means “[t]heir present wants employ their
                     whole attention, and they seldom think of the future” (98). Conditioned
                     by a life of struggle and penury to a present alert only to the immediate needs
                     of the body, they would be unwilling or unable to save “a part of their
                     high wages [e.g. from relief] for the future support of their families, instead
                     spending it in drunkenness and dissipation” (99). </note> However,
                  Wollstonecraft cannot so blithely dispel the psychological freight of disaster,
                  and finds herself preposterously mourning that which has not occurred (even as she
                  struggles to mourn more recent traumatizing events). Not incidentally,
                  Wollstonecraft shared Malthus’ general commitment to the maintenance of the
                  mass over the sanctity of the individual. Consider this passage from one of the
                  final letters of her northern tour: <quote> Arriving at Sleswick, the residence of
                     Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel, the sight of the soldiers recalled all the
                     unpleasing ideas of German despotism, which imperceptibly vanished as I
                     advanced into the country. I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horrour, these
                     beings training to be sold to slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell into
                     reflections, on an old opinion of mine, that it is the preservation of the
                     species, not of individuals, which appears to be the design of the Deity
                     throughout the whole of nature. Blossoms come forth only to be blighted; fish
                     lay their spawn where it will be devoured: and what a large portion of the
                     human race are born merely to be swept prematurely away. Does not this waste of
                     budding life emphatically assert, that it is not men, but man, whose
                     preservation is so necessary to the completion of the grand plan of the
                     universe? Children peep into existence, suffer, and die; men play like moths
                     about a candle, and sink into the flame: war, and ‘the thousand ills
                     which flesh is heir to,’ mow them down in shoals, whilst the more cruel
                     prejudices of society palsies existence, introducing not less sure, though
                     slower decay. (179-80) </quote> Spurred by the sight of soldiers training
                  “to…be slaughtered,” Wollstonecraft’s mutability ode traverses
                  familiar philosophical ground, yet it does so not to promote an appreciation of
                  life as to lament the austere “design” of the living world, which
                  sloughs off multitudes of individuals through cataclysm in the name of preserving
                  abstract “species.” However, in the next section I want to consider
                  how Wollstonecraft’s brief meditation on species survival might be a product
                  of historically contingent forces that (re)connect this universalist gesture to
                  the political time of the 1790s. The soldiers in training that so discomfit
                  Wollstonecraft represent a historical force <foreign>in potentia</foreign>, one
                  suspended in what Mary Favret recently called the untasked,
                  “time-killing,” meantime of wartime (2010: 68-9). They loom as grim
                  figures of a slaughter to come. </p>

                  <p>Wollstonecraft’s arrival in Prussia and the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel in the
                  late summer of 1795 puts her there during the peace accords that would bring the
                  War of the First Coalition to an end. As is well known, that summer’s peace
                  treaties between revolutionary France and Prussia, Spain and Hesse-Cassel were the
                  impetus for Kant’s most famous meditation on our political futurity, <title level="m">Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch</title> (<foreign>Zum ewigen
                     Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf</foreign>, 1795), a treatise not
                  incidentally which opens by coyly punning on the “perpetual peace”
                  offered by the graveyard. <note place="foot" resp="editors">“‘THE PERPETUAL PEACE.’ A Dutch innkeeper once put this
                     satirical inscription on his signboard, along with the picture of a graveyard.
                     We shall not trouble to ask whether it applies to men in general, or
                     particularly heads of state (who can never have enough of war), or only to the
                     philosophers who blissfully dream of perpetual peace” (93). </note>
                  However, what begins as a seeming bit of cleverness gradually sounds the
                  conceptual limits of Kant’s historico-political method, for every strategic
                  concession or attenuating provision that erodes the integrity of political
                  principle awakens the specter of universal death. For instance, models of
                  international right that safeguard the “right to go to war” are,
                  according to Kant, severely compromised, for “[i]t could be taken to mean
                  that it is perfectly just for men to adopt this attitude to destroy one another,
                  and thus find perpetual peace in the vast grave where all the horrors of violence
                  and those responsible for them would be buried” (105). Beginning with the
                  first of his <title level="a">Preliminary Articles</title> for lasting peace, Kant
                  condemns any diplomatic treatise that merely suspends hostilities between nations,
                  but worries that “secret reservations” among the ruling parties might
                  hold open the possibility of future war, even if such a thought was heretofore
                  unthinkable: “A conclusion of peace nullifies all existing reasons for a
                  future war, even if these are not yet known to the contracting parties, and no
                  matter how acutely and carefully they may later be pieced together out of old
                  documents. It is possible that either party may make a mental reservation with a
                  view of reviving old pretensions in the future. Such reservations will not be
                  mentioned explicitly, since both parties may simply be too exhausted to continue
                  the war, although they may nonetheless possess sufficient ill will to seize the
                  first favorable opportunity of attaining their end” (93-4). Such
                  “Jesuitical casuistry” places political expediency not simply above
                  principle, but above a commitment to perpetuity as a temporal ideal.</p>
                  <p>I call attention to this secret thought of a return to hostility, this
                  “mental reservation” rendered dormant by the fatigue of war but
                  capable of being “pieced together” through juridical-contractual
                  remainders, because it contributes something instructive to our understanding of
                  the historical imagination of future disaster. Like Malthus, Kant presumes the
                  givenness of conflict and strife, and the six Preliminary Articles thus labor to
                  trace the negative conditions without which perpetual peace is—almost
                  literally—unthinkable. Or, put differently, holding open the thought of
                  subsequent war holds open the historical abyss of the mass grave as the limit of
                  politics as such, the “war of extermination, in which both parties and right
                  itself might be simultaneously annihilated,” allowing “perpetual peace
                  only on the vast graveyard of the human race” (96). The semantics of
                  “perpetual peace”—the end of all hostilities, in one form or
                  another—toggles uncomfortably in the space of what must be unthought. For
                  the Kant of the unwritten critique of political reason, the question of
                  prospective or probabilistic thinking represents a watershed moment in the history
                  of reason, albeit one tragically hued. In his 1786 <title level="a">Conjectures on
                     the Beginning of Human History,</title> Kant opens the essay by questioning the
                  wisdom of trying to imaginatively reconstruct human origins (for fear the
                  philosopher becomes a mere novelist), but eventually determines that doing so is
                  “merely…an exercise in which the imagination, supported by reason, may be
                  allowed to indulge as a healthy mental recreation” (221). Assured thus of
                  the wholesomeness of the enterprise, Kant lists “<emph>anticipation of the
                     future</emph>” as a crucial early phase in the evolution of human reason
                  out of the originary world of pure instinct. Transcending the present to court the
                  future signifies as “the most decisive proof of man’s advantage, in
                  that he is able to prepare for remote objectives in keeping with his
                  destiny” (225). However, “visuali[zing] what is yet to come, often in
                  the distant future…is also the most inexhaustible source of cares and worries
                  which an uncertain future evokes, and from which all animals are exempt”; to
                  which Kant adds, <quote> The man who had to provide for himself, his wife, and his
                     future children foresaw the increasing laboriousness of his work; the woman
                     foresaw the hardships to which nature had subjected her sex, as well as those
                     which the more powerful man would inflict upon her. Both foresaw with
                     apprehension, at the end of the life of toil and as yet in the background of
                     the picture, the fate which must befall all animals but which causes them no
                     concern, namely, death; and they seemed to reproach themselves for, and regard
                     as a crime, that use of reason which had brought all these ills upon them.
                     (225) </quote> As a relationship with futurity splits humankind off from their
                  animal brethren—a separation which, in reason’s subsequent final
                  stage, releases man from a nature he now dominates to emerge an end in
                  himself—it also confirms his wretched humanity: for Kant, reason’s
                  inevitable flirtation with the future creates an onto-historical gulf that can
                  never be recrossed. Devastated by what reason has wrought, man views the fateful
                  recognition of the future as a criminal act, an original sin. “In the
                  future,” Kant concludes, “the hardships of life would often arouse in
                  him the wish for a paradise created by his imagination, a paradise where he could
                  dream or idle away his existence in quiet inactivity and everlasting peace. But
                  restless reason, irresistibly driving him on to develop his innate capacities,
                  stands between him and that imagined seat of bliss, and does not allow him to
                  return to the state of rude simplicity from which it had originally extracted
                  him” (226). </p>
                  <p>To think of the future is thus already to think of death: to harbor a commitment
                  to future war is but to enable death’s realization on a mass scale. It
                  follows that Kant’s opposition to standing armies (the third of his
                  Preliminary Articles) derives from his prohibition on the anticipation of future
                  war, for the Hessian brigades such as Wollstonecraft observed linger as the
                  political realization of a not-so-secret intention to war. “[T]he hiring of
                  men to kill or to be killed,” writes Kant, “seems to mean using them
                  as mere machines, and instruments in the hands of someone else (the state), which
                  cannot easily be reconciled with the rights of man in one’s own
                  person” (95). Not coincidentally, in <title level="m">Vindication of the
                     Rights of Woman</title> Wollstonecraft too condemns the maintenance of standing
                  armies as “well disciplined machines,” although she clearly prefers
                  more organic metaphors for the threat to human freedom embodied by such regiments:
                  “A spirit inspired by romantic notions of honour, a kind of morality founded
                  on the fashion of the age, can only be felt by a few officers, whilst the main
                  body must be moved by command, like the waves of the sea; for the strong wind of
                  authority pushes the crowd of subalterns forward, they scarcely know or care why,
                  with headlong fury” (<title level="m">Vindication</title> 132, 123).
                  Wollstonecraft’s remarks concerning German soldiers “sold to
                  slaughter” might now be viewed as a concern for the unthinking movement of
                  history toward its catastrophic future. The instrumentalized soldiers are out of
                  time, in every sense of the phrase: untouched by “romantic notions of
                  honour” or the prevailing morality of the age, they are already among the
                  dead (“they scarcely know or care why”). For both Kant and
                  Wollstonecraft, standing armies function within both species time and political
                  time, materializing the possibility of perpetual war.</p>
                  <p> But there is a question of whether the political future can truly be thought at
                  all. In <title level="m">Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical
                  Time</title>, Reinhardt Koselleck outlines how rational prognosis, inseparable
                  from “the delicate art of political calculation,” gradually supplanted
                  prophecy as the dominant mode of futural thinking in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries. Or as Koselleck puts it, “the constant similitude of
                  eschatological expectation is dissolved by the continued novelty of time running
                  away with itself, and prognostic attempts to contain it” (19). This
                  unbridled future time is characterized by two significant features: <quote>
                     [F]irst, the increasing speed with which it approaches us, and second, its
                     unknown quality. ‘Unknown’ because this accelerated time, i.e. our
                     history, abbreviated the space of experiences, robbed them of their constancy,
                     and continually brought into play new, unknown factors….This self-accelerating
                     temporality robs the present of the possibility of being experienced as the
                     present, and escapes into a future within which the currently unapprehendable
                     present has to be captured by historical philosophy. In other words, in the
                     eighteenth century, the acceleration of time that had previously belonged to
                     eschatology became obligatory for worldly invention, before technology
                     completely opened up a space of experience adequate to this acceleration. (22)
                  </quote> For Koselleck, the French Revolution actualizes the experience of the new
                  future-conditional bedeviled by contingency, chance and ungrounded speculation:
                  even as the revolution required its subjects to participate in the ‘future
                  work’ of imagining freedom, it presented them with a destabilized and
                  finally “unapprehendable” present. One can already sense this temporal
                  unease in the final chapter of <title level="m">An Historical and Moral
                     View</title> when Wollstonecraft’s painstaking chronicle of revolutionary
                  “progress” abruptly stops short with Louis XVI’s removal from
                  Versailles in late 1789, only to narratively retreat into a speculative history of
                  reformist thinking from the “savage state” forward to the rise of the
                  great European metropolis. “This influence is extremely gradual,” she
                  cautions, “it requires a great deal of time,” and ultimately is no
                  match for the velocity of sociopolitical change in a modern city such as Paris,
                  “the vortex of men and things” (495, 493). This final chapter sounds a
                  sly meditation on the forms of political untimeliness that result from uneven
                  development, for Paris, by “accelerating the epocha of the
                  revolution,” has outraced the measured progress of human emancipation,
                  leading to the out-of-joint horrors that Wollstonecraft chooses not to narrate
                  (508). In other words, <title level="m">An Historical and Moral View</title>
                  reaches a historiographical juncture where it cannot, or will not, keep time with
                  its subject matter. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Wollstonecraft
                     suggested that a second volume of <title level="m">An Historical and Moral
                        View</title> would follow, but Godwin notes in a footnote to his <title level="m">Memoirs</title> that “No part of the proposed continuation
                     of this work, has been found among the papers of the author” (85).

                  </p>
                  <p> Wollstonecraft’s implicit temporalization of revolutionary ends recognizes
                  what Koselleck calls the shifting “planes of historicity” that
                  characterize modern historical time: “A consciousness of time and the future
                  begins to develop in the shadows of absolutist politics, first in secret, later
                  openly, sustained by an audacious combination of politics and prophecy….rational
                  prediction and salvational expectation” (<title level="m">Futures</title>
                  21). The period of revolutionary fervor was an instance, engine, and ultimately a
                  casualty of this historical speed-up, as <title level="m">Futures Past</title>
                  notes that a “fixation on an end-state by historical actors” produced
                  but a “futureless future,” the mechanical and mutual supersession of
                  one historical rhythm (revolution) with another (reaction) (23). That said, here
                  and elsewhere Koselleck places inordinate faith in certain forms of historical
                  projection prior to the revolution, returning frequently to a curious example that
                  represents what he calls “the legitimate offspring of historical
                  philosophy”: Diderot’s 1774 forecast of revolution for Sweden, a
                  prediction ultimately realized in France. <note place="foot" resp="editors"> “Under despotism the people, embittered by their lengthy sorrows, will
                     miss no opportunity to reappropriate their rights. But since there is neither
                     goal nor plan, slavery relapses in an instant into anarchy. Within the heart of
                     this general tumult there can be heard but one cry: ‘Freedom!’ But
                     how can this valuable thing be secured? Nobody knows. And soon the people are
                     divided into various factions, eaten up with contradictory interests....After a
                     short while there are only two factions within the state; they distinguish
                     themselves by two names, under which all necessarily have to include
                     themselves: ‘Royalist’ and ‘Antiroyalist.’ This is the
                     moment of violent commotion. The moment of plotting and conspiracy….In this,
                     royalism serves as a subterfuge as much as antiroyalism. Both are masks for
                     ambition and covetousness. The nation now is merely an entity dependent upon a
                     collection of criminals and corrupt persons. In this situation only one man and
                     suitable moment are needed for an entirely unexpected result to emerge. If the
                     moment comes, the man emerges….He speaks nothing. And they say: We are nothing.
                     And he speaks to them: I am the Lord. And they speak as if out of one mouth:
                     You are the Lord. And he says to them: Here are the conditions according to
                     which I am prepared to subject you. And they say: We accept them….What will
                     succeed this revolution? No one knows” (qtd. in <title level="m">Futures
                        Past</title> 24). </note> The scenario laid out by Diderot traces the arc of
                  the revolution to come—from popular resistance to the relapse into anarchy,
                  from the coming of a transcendent national-spiritual leader to world historical
                  uncertainty—only it is introduced as an exploration of the Swedish political
                  constitution. Moreover, the prediction is twice displaced, for in addition to
                  getting the historical actors wrong, it appears in Abbe Raynal’s <title level="m">A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of
                     the Europeans in the East and West Indies</title>, albeit written in
                  Diderot’s hand and, according to Koselleck, “smuggled anonymously (in
                  accordance with Enlightenment tactics) into Raynal’s work on European
                  colonial expansion” (2002: 138). Diderot’s speculation—often
                  quoted in full and hailed as “one of the [Enlightenment’s] greatest
                  predictions, which has remained in the shadows of anonymity and geographical
                  camouflage” (2004: 23)—appears frequently in Koselleck’s
                  discussions of secular prophecy and crisis, primarily as an example of a
                  prognostication that fruitfully melds historical experience and “figures of
                  argumentation…derived from Roman history” and other classical sources (2002:
                  138). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Koselleck quotes the passage in
                     full in both <title level="m">Futures Past</title> (24) and <title level="a">The Unknown Future</title> (137-8), and it appears obliquely in <title level="m">Crisis and Critique</title> in Koselleck’s discussion of
                     Raynal’s colonial history “which foresaw the threatening civil war
                     [as]…at the same time a historico-philosophically disguised invocation of
                     revolution” (183; and passim).</note> Remarkably, Koselleck shows little
                  interest in the bizarre (dis)location of Diderot’s judgment, but a possible
                  transposition of Sweden and France was not lost on Mary Wollstonecraft a few years
                  later.</p>
                  <p> In <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title>,
                  Wollstonecraft evinces a desire to revise her own historical itinerary: while the
                  Scandinavian tour promises to distract from her Parisian shock, she declares that
                  she might “have been less severe in the remarks I have made on the vanity
                  and depravity of the French, had I travelled toward the north before I visited
                  France” (161). <note place="foot" resp="editors"> On the very next
                     page she turns this strategic itinerary into a principle of travel “as
                     the completion of a liberal education”: “the northern states ought
                     to be visited before the more polished parts of Europe,” in order to
                     establish a baseline for acquiring “the knowledge of manners”
                     (162). </note> The purpose for the revision is ostensibly methodological:
                  Wollstonecraft articulates her wish to retroactively replot her course while
                  excusing one of her more forceful detours into feminist critique (“Still
                  harping on the same subject, you will exclaim”), and promising a
                  “return to the straight road of observation” (160). In order to
                  preserve “a dispassionate view” while “trac[ing] the progress of
                  the world’s improvement,” Wollstonecraft believes she would have
                  profited from ascending the presumptive hierarchy of European civility. But the
                  circumstances of this fantasy of transposition also speak to its psychic import:
                  France is personal, the site of a disruptive subjectivity that threatens the
                  straight road of empirical assessment. By rerouting the psychic itinerary,
                  Wollstonecraft wishes to symbolically put the therapeutic before the traumatic,
                  the redress before the wound, creating the restorative anticipation of a disaster
                  to come. However, according to a different transferential logic, the swapping of
                  order also reimagines Sweden as the space of revolutionary earliness.
                  Wollstonecraft seems to intuit and lament this logic almost immediately, as she
                  proceeds to debunk assertions that “a rising people” (i.e.
                  Scandinavian countries) possess more natural virtue than those refined cultures of
                  some standing: “yet where has more virtuous enthusiasm been displayed than
                  during the two last years by the common people of France….I am obliged to
                  recollect the numberless instances which I have either witnessed, or heard well
                  authenticated, to balance the account of horrors” (161).</p>
                  <p> The Sweden that Wollstonecraft describes is hardly on the brink of revolution, or
                  at least not of the kind imagined by Diderot: rather, her opening letter portrays
                  a nation trapped in prehistoric amber, girded round by “huge, dark rocks
                  that looked like the rude materials of creation forming the barrier of unwrought
                  space” (10). Once ashore she encounters “men who remain so near brute
                  creation, as only to exert themselves to find the food necessary to sustain
                  life” and who “have little or no imagination to call forth the
                  curiosity necessary to fructify the faint glimmerings of mind which entitles them
                  to rank as lords of the creation. Had they either, they could not contentedly
                  remain rooted in the clods they indolently cultivate” (10). 
                  <note place="foot" resp="editors"> Not surprisingly, these reflections are
                     immediately contrasted with memories of “the Parisians” and their
                     love of novelty, “a proof of the progress they had made in refinement.
                     Yes; in the art of living” (10). </note> As I’ve argued elsewhere,
                  Wollstonecraft’s navigation of such radically heterogeneous time within
                  modern Europe is guided by a historiographical interest in the migration of
                  populations. Eager to corroborate monogenetic and climatological accounts of human
                  variegation, <title level="m">Letter</title> reintegrates the fate of the species
                  into the longue durée of planetary history, while recognizing that the former
                  is but a minor expression within the latter’s outsized movements. This
                  elongation of time diverts some of the attention away from the immediate political
                  chronologies that structure and overdetermine Wollstonecraft’s
                  contemporaneity, effectively suspending the incursion of the future. For instance,
                  in Letter V she remarks, no doubt with Linnaeus in mind, that “Sweden
                  appeared to me the country in the world most proper to form the botanist and
                  natural historian: every object seemed to remind me of the creation of things, of
                  the first efforts of sportive nature” (40). To view the world with Linnaean
                  eyes is to participate in a recent and critical reorganization of enlightenment
                  historiography, yet Wollstonecraft’s Sweden so obsessively figures the
                  origins of things—at once the source of nature, and the “natural
                  history” that would give it meaning—that one senses a form of history
                  in retreat.</p>
                  <p>But I want to imagine for a moment that Wollstonecraft’s fixation on origins
                  might also be a vision of post-disaster, in the sense that every one of these
                  founding images restages the possibility of renewal for the melancholic. I see
                  this less as a counterpoint to the failure of the progress narrative, and more a
                  constitutive psychic stratagem for its maintenance. “The more I see of the
                  world,” writes Wollstonecraft early in her travels, “the more I am
                  convinced that civilization is a blessing not sufficiently estimated by those who
                  have not traced its progress” (20). While such a tracing “enables us
                  to retain the primitive delicacy of our sensations,” it also reveals the
                  psychic work performed by the imagination: <quote> Without the aid of the
                     imagination all the pleasures of the senses must sink into grossness, unless
                     continual novelty serve as a substitute for the imagination, which being
                     impossible, it was to this weariness, I suppose, that Solomon alluded when he
                     declared that there was nothing new under the sun!—nothing for the common
                     sensations excited by the senses. Yet who will deny that the imagination and
                     understanding have made many, very many discoveries since those days, which
                     only seem harbingers of others still more noble and beneficial. (20) </quote>
                  Wollstonecraft’s reflections anticipate Malthus on the necessity of regular
                  exertion and variety, only here the imagination compensates for what experience
                  cannot deliver (“continual novelty”), presumably by
                  “discovering” anew what is admittedly “impossible.” Of
                  course, the Solomonic pronouncement in Ecclesiastes 1 speaks to the cyclical,
                  repetitive nature of earthly life and the futility that follows from the knowledge
                  of purposeless time: what has been will be again, generations of humankind will be
                  swept away and the earth will abide. But Wollstonecraft cites specifically the
                  “weariness” of Solomon’s recognition—“All things are
                  full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the
                  ear filled with hearing” (1.8)— thus underscoring how this is the
                  melancholic’s verse par excellence: <quote>
                        <hi>16.</hi> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
                     estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in

                        <hi>17.</hi> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
                     folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. <hi>18. </hi>For in
                     much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
                     (Ecclesiastes 1.16-18) </quote> Wollstonecraft in Scandinavia is a distressed
                  historical subject, uncertain less of her place than her <emph>time</emph> in the
                  world, and thus hostage to an existential passivity in the face of imminent
                  historical return. <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     Wollstonecraft’s sense of temporal disenfranchisement appears frequently,
                     and often in relationship to how she understands universal history. For
                     instance, in Letter XIV she remarks on an unfulfilled desire to travel to the
                     rustic northern country of Norway: <quote> You will ask, perhaps, why I wished
                        to go further northward. Why? [N]ot only because the country, from all I can
                        gather, is most romantic, abounding in forests and lakes, and the air pure,
                        but I have heard much of the intelligence of the inhabitants, substantial
                        farmers, who have none of that cunning to contaminate their simplicity….The
                        description I received of them carried me back to the fables of the golden
                        age: independence and virtue; affluence without vice; cultivation of mind,
                        without depravity of heart; with “ever smiling liberty,’ the
                        nymph of the mountain.—I want faith! My imagination hurries me forward
                        to seek asylum in such a retreat from all the disappointments I am
                        threatened with; but reason drags me back, whispering that the world is
                        still the world, and man the same compound of weakness and folly
                        (127-28).</quote> It is no doubt significant that this vision of the golden
                     age is produced not by experience, but by hearsay and a longing to be
                     otherwise: Wollstonecraft’s symptomatic outburst (“I want
                     faith!”) prompts the telltale “hurrying” of her imagination
                     out of herself into a future that is a past. But oddly her imagination propels
                     her “<emph>forward</emph> to seek asylum in such a retreat”
                     (although the description she heard “carried [her] <emph>back</emph>
                     to…the golden age”), while reasons drags her <emph>back</emph> to her
                     contemporary moment. Without making too much of this adverbial confusion, the
                     slippage here begins to measure something of Wollstonecraft’s
                     disorientation in time, even as it captures Kant’s sense above of
                     “restless reason…stand[ing] between [her] and that imagined seat of
                     bliss, and does not allow [her] to return to the state of rude
                     simplicity.” </note> As we will see in the next section, this passivity
                  is constitutive of, even as it is a product of, writing the disaster in a
                  Blanchotian sense.</p>

                  <quote> The disaster, depriving us of that refuge which is the thought of death,
                  dissuading us from the catastrophic or the tragic, dissolving our interest in will
                  and in all internal movement, does not allow us to entertain this question either:
                  what have you done to gain knowledge of the disaster? <lb/> Maurice Blanchot,
                     <title level="m">The Writing of the Disaster</title> (3) </quote>
                  <p>What <emph>has</emph> Mary Wollstonecraft done to gain knowledge of disaster? Let
                  us look at how she understands the aftermath of a devastating event in order to
                  venture an answer. Near the end of her Scandinavian tour, on the highway to
                  Copenhagen, Wollstonecraft observes a vast plain hosting what seems a motley
                  village of tents, and idly wonders whether the “rage for encampments”
                  (i.e. recreational camping) had reached Denmark. Arriving at the capital however,
                  she learns that a massive three-day fire destroyed well over nine hundred
                  buildings in the city, leaving thousands of residents homeless and adrift. Here is
                  her description of entering the ravaged city: <quote> Entering soon after, I
                     passed amongst the dust and rubbish it had left, affrighted by viewing the
                     extent of the devastation; for at least a quarter of the city had been
                     destroyed. There was little in the appearance of fallen bricks and stacks of
                     chimneys to allure the imagination into soothing melancholy reveries; nothing
                     to attract the eye of taste, but much to afflict the benevolent heart. The
                     depredations of time have always something in them to employ the fancy, or lead
                     to musing on subjects which, withdrawing the mind from objects of sense, seem
                     to give it new dignity: but here I was treading on live ashes. The sufferers
                     were still under the pressure of misery occasioned by this dreadful
                     conflagration. I could not take refuge in the thought: <emph>they
                        suffered—but they are no</emph>
                        <emph>more!</emph> a reflection I frequently summon to calm my mind, when
                     sympathy rises to anguish: I therefore desired, the driver to hasten to the
                     hotel recommended to me, that I might avert my eyes, and snap the train of
                     thinking which had sent me into all the corners of the city, in search of
                     houseless heads. (149)</quote> Wollstonecraft’s is a strange and telling
                  kind of equivocation and evasion. Noticeably mystified by the disaster’s
                  presentness—its still-warm organic life, its importunate objects of
                  sense—Wollstonecraft craves the consolations of historical distance and the
                  resulting decathexis that will ensure a tidy aesthetic experience. There is an
                  indignity in the proximity and persistence of suffering: with “nothing to
                  attract the eye of taste,” it is best to “avert [one’s]
                  eyes” altogether. Best to seek refuge from the refugees for fear that the
                  imagination may begin to house the homeless. However, I am struck particularly by
                  what Wollstonecraft reveals to be her customary response to disastrous events
                  (“they suffered—but they are no more!”), its semantic import
                  flickering uncomfortably between relief from suffering in life, or in death. The
                  lingering possibility that Wollstonecraft takes affective “refuge” in
                  mass death haunts the passage. Catastrophe offers a ready-made melancholic
                  withdrawal into the consolations of negation, where the fresh ruins and visibly
                  displaced of Copenhagen press urgently for a response that she is unprepared to
                  deliver.</p>
                  <p>Clearly, Wollstonecraft’s reaction to the Copenhagen fire reveals her
                  psychic discomfort with the immediate past: sympathy now too easily rises to
                  anguish, and anguish requires something catastrophic to be pacified. Catastrophe
                  looms thus as a welcome limit to thought, summoned even to calm the mind: it is
                  strategically <emph>not</emph> experience, but rather a retreat from experience
                  into the non-experience of the other committed to death. Here we find something
                  akin to Blanchot’s insistence that “Consciousness can be catastrophic
                  without ceasing to be consciousness; it…welcomes into itself this
                  overturning” (49). This incorporation of catastrophe into
                  consciousness—paradoxically, to relieve “the pressure of
                  misery”—redoubles the event structure of disaster <emph>as</emph>
                  thought itself. Blanchot’s <title level="m">The Writing of the
                     Disaster</title> may seem an odd interlocutor to summon here, but his
                  intimation that there is no final writing of disaster, only a series of feints,
                  equivocations, and paradoxes that give the event its outside, captures something
                  in Wollstonecraft’s writing of (disastrous) history: ultimately, states
                  Blanchot, “[w]e are passive with respect to the disaster, but the disaster
                  is perhaps passivity, and thus past, always past, even in the past, out of
                  date” (3). Wollstonecraft’s retreat from the prospect of charitable
                  action signals her own version of historico-sympathetic passivity: suggestively,
                  Blanchot writes of the ontological quandaries of “infinite aid” in the
                  aftermath of disaster, an unlimited call that strips each of his or her
                  singularity, causing the charitable agent “to disappear in the infinite
                  movement of service” (21). <note place="foot" resp="editors">
                     Wollstonecraft evinces a steady fear of disappearance and de-subjectification.
                     A few letters before her lament for her “fellow creatures, yet
                     unborn” she is again at sea, literally and figuratively, and indulges a
                     “pleasing forgetfulness.” She observes, “How fallacious! yet,
                     without hope, what is to sustain life, but the fear of annihilation—the
                     only thing of which I have ever felt a dread—I cannot bear to think of
                     being no more—of losing myself—though existence is often but a
                     painful consciousness of misery; nay, it appears to me impossible that I should
                     cease to exist, or that this active, restless spirit, equally alive to joy and
                     sorrow, should only be organized dust—ready to fly abroad the moment the
                     spring snaps, or the spark goes out, which kept it together. Surely something
                     resides in this heart that is not perishable—and life is more than a
                     dream” (76). </note>

                  <p> Copenhagen has become inhospitable not merely for its unhoused citizens, but for
                  the sympathizing outsider unwilling to tread on live ashes. The following morning
                  Wollstonecraft notes that she is already “weary of observing the
                  ravages,” and while admitting that she has encountered the city “in a
                  very disadvantageous light, some of the best streets having been burnt and the
                  whole place thrown into confusion” (149), she grumbles that she “saw
                  nothing to rouse the idea of elegance or grandeur,” save for the Royal
                  Palace (150). But this is not an immaterial exception, for the Palace was itself
                  destroyed by a previous fire “about two years ago” and now stands a
                  handsome, nearly empty, shell of itself. Subsequently, <quote> a great number of
                     the poor, during the late fire, took refuge in its ruins, till they could find
                     some other abode. Beds were thrown on the landing places of the grand
                     stair-case, where whole families crept from the cold, and every little nook is
                     boarded up as a retreat for some poor creatures deprived of their home. At
                     present a roof may be sufficient to shelter them from the night air; but as the
                     season advances, the extent of the calamity will be more severely felt. (150)
                  </quote> I want to linger a moment in the repurposing of these ruins, for not only
                  does the image of the poor taking up tenancy in the royal quarters coyly re-cite
                  the much-debated primal scene of Burke’s <title level="m">Reflections on the
                     Revolution in France</title>, but it does so in the shadow of cyclical
                  devastation. The details of Wollstonecraft’s portrait (e.g. the beds on the
                  grand stair; the occupied “little nooks,” the winter draughts, etc.)
                  suggest that she has not averted her eyes from this scene. This is curious, since
                  these are the same victims of the conflagration that she chose to disregard a day
                  earlier, only now they are lodged in an earlier and more symbolically freighted
                  wreckage. However, this is a distinctly <emph>modern</emph> ruin—built in
                  the 1750s and gutted by flames in February 1794—and as such it flickers as a
                  figure of historical intermittence: liberated from its original context by
                  disaster, the space (a space) has been opened up for imagining a world
                  historically otherwise.</p>
                  <p> These observations regarding the Royal Palace recall attention to how often
                  during her <title level="m">Letters</title> Wollstonecraft tours empty estates,
                  vacancies that require little by way of imagination to seem remainders of a world
                  recently lost. Compare the above with Wollstonecraft’s visit a few days
                  later to the vacant, muséal chambers of the Rosenborg Castle. Wollstonecraft
                  reports feeling “the vacuum left by departed greatness,” only to
                  populate the emptiness with specters: “It seemed a vast tomb, full of
                  shadowy phantoms of those who had played or toiled their hour out….Could they be
                  no more—to whom my imagination thus gave life? Could the thoughts, of which
                  there remained many vestiges, have vanished quite away? And these beings, composed
                  of such noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only melted into the
                  elements to keep in motion the grand mass of life?” (165). Earlier she
                  visits one of “only two…estates of any magnitude in Norway,” now
                  unoccupied and neglected by its absent lord, and productive of “a stupid
                  kind of sadness, to my eye”: “I enter as I would into the tomb of the
                  Capulets, to look at the family pictures that here frown in armour, or smile in
                  ermine. The mildew respects not the lordly robe; and the worm riots unchecked on
                  the cheek of beauty” (84). Walking the arbors of the latter at night,
                  Wollstonecraft finds herself in the thrall of an unusual reverie, for “Not
                  nymphs, but philosophers, seem to inhabit them—ever musing” (85).</p>
                  <p>These are haunted quarters, but they house more than specters of the past. They
                  are spaces of persevering thought (“noble materials of thinking and
                  feeling”); or, for Wollstonecraft, thoughts of perseverance. In a reflection
                  that anticipates her pre-Malthusian population terror, Wollstonecraft remarks how
                  she keeps time with the spectral philosophers of the arboretum: “How often
                  do my feelings produce ideas that remind me of the origin of many poetical
                  fictions. In solitude, the imagination bodies forth its conceptions unrestrained,
                  and stops enraptured to adore the beings of its own creation” (85). The
                  imagination that “bodies forth” and adores its own ghosts possesses
                  the power to remake the world in thought after the thought of its end. Here we
                  find the “principle of population” as an act of sympathetic
                  imagination, a reminder that Wollstonecraft’s imperiled “fellow
                  creatures, yet unborn” merely consolidate the consciousness of the future as
                  so many empathic figures. As Frances Ferguson writes of the rhetoric of nuclear
                  sublimity, “To think the thought of the ‘unborn’ may represent
                  the achievement of the sublime project to find objects of consciousness that
                  definitively cannot exist in the absence of the perceiving subject, but the
                  residual horror of the notion of the ‘unborn’ lies in the way the
                  argument for the existence of generations now living lies in our mere
                  instrumentality” (8). Of course, Wollstonecraft doesn’t shepherd forth
                  the unborn for rhetorical effect, but she does experience the horror, but perhaps
                  also the necessity, of her own instrumentality. In one of the more famous scenes
                  in <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title>,
                  Wollstonecraft visits a Norwegian church and is shown into a “little recess
                  full of coffins” containing nameless and mummified bodies. Horrified at this
                  “treason against humanity,” Wollstonecraft, as usual, recovers only by
                  insisting on the solace of thinking historically: “The contemplation of
                  noble ruins produces a melancholy that exalts the mind.—We take a retrospect
                  of the exertions of man, the fate of empires and their rulers; and marking the
                  grand destruction of ages, it seems the necessary change of time leading to
                  improvement” (71). But the exaltation triggered by recounting “the
                  grand destruction of ages” cannot long keep mortality in abeyance:
                  “Life, what art thou? Where goes this breath? this <emph>I</emph>, so much
                  alive? In what element will it mix, giving or receiving fresh energy?—What
                  will break the enchantment of animation?—For worlds, I would not see a form
                  I loved—embalmed in my heart—thus sacrilegiously handled!” (71).
                  The scene makes clear the distinction between the projective and the
                  preservational, between “this <emph>I</emph>, so much alive” and
                  searching for a sustaining “element,” and the horrid figures of
                  conservation, history as embalmment. It is only the mind alive to thinking beyond
                  disaster that can ensure “the necessary change of time leading to
                  improvement”: just as Wollstonecraft’s visionary distress off the
                  coast of Arendal imagines perfect cultivation and universal famine in the same
                  moving instant, so too does the spectacle of so many dead, so many noble ruins,
                  harbor within it the thought of life. </p>

                  <p>In the letter to M. Talleyrand-Périgord that opens her <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (1792), Wollstonecraft dedicates
                  her volume to the French minister of finance, but in exchange asks that he
                  “maturely weigh” her propositions regarding the rights of woman and
                  national education. She claims to argue as “a disinterested spirit”
                  (“I plead for my sex—not for myself”), and then decorates her
                  point with an image that provides a convenient measure of how her unsettling
                  experience in France would alter her perception: "Independence I have long
                  considered as the grand blessing of life, the basis of every virtue—and
                  independence I will ever secure by contracting my wants, though I were to live on
                  a barren heath" (101). Here, in the still heady days of revolutionary promise,
                  Wollstonecraft’s confidence is troped as self-sufficiency, her impartiality
                  as emotional parsimony. Of course, by summer 1795 her affective life is
                  catastrophically dilated, pried open by so many personal and political
                  disappointments. The empty, inhospitable heath that once served as the expressive
                  limit of her optimism, now looms as the future’s mass grave.</p>
                  <p> Curiously, in Kant’s <title level="m">Perpetual Peace,</title> the famous
                  right to resort and cosmopolitan hospitality is grounded in a rather astonishing
                  bit of spatial literalism: such rights are secured by virtue of humankind’s
                  communal possession of the earth’s surface, and “[s]ince the earth is
                  a globe, they cannot disperse over an infinite area, but must necessarily tolerate
                  one another’s company” (106). Kant acknowledges that there are
                  inhospitable and “uninhabitable parts of the earth’s surface such as
                  oceans and deserts,” but ships and camels (!) allow access to even these
                  “ownerless tracts” (106). It is significant that both Kant and
                  Wollstonecraft are imagining the problem of finite space in 1795, and while
                  Kant’s globe provides the theoretical justification for hospitality toward
                  the stranger, Wollstonecraft—who understands her own travels as those of a
                  stranger—is demonstrably wary of hospitality, those kindnesses “too
                  much praised by travelers as a proof of goodness of heart” (21; see also
                  162). But <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden,
                     Norway and Denmark</title> finally appeals to a more profound form of
                  hospitable relation, one that is open to the arrival of the disaster. For it is
                  only by welcoming that dread future that we can think the future at all.</p>

                  <p>The Prince Regent was a notorious “ruin gazer.” Colonel Hanmer
                  Warrington, the British consul-general in Tripoli, knew this, and in 1816 he
                  persuaded the local governor to allow the Prince Regent to “help
                  himself” to the remains of the Roman imperial city of Leptis Magna in Libya.
                  Despite local opposition and resistance, Warrington arranged for Commander W.H.
                  Smyth to ship many pieces of this ruin to England: twenty-two granite columns,
                  fifteen marble columns, ten capitals, twenty-five pedestals, seven loose slabs,
                  ten pieces of cornice, five inscribed slabs, various sculptural fragments. When
                  the shipment arrived in London it also included the colossal bust of Memnon from
                  the temple of Ramesses at Thebes (the provocation for Percy Shelley’s <title level="a">Ozymandias</title>), which had been collected at Malta. Between
                  August and October 1826, after several years in the British Museum, the ruins from
                  Leptis Magna were transported on gun carriages to Virginia Water, a royal site
                  within Windsor Great Park. There, according to <title level="m">

                     </title> website, between June 1827 and March 1828, they
                  “were arranged by Sir Jeffry Wyatville, George IV’s architect, in the
                  form of a ruined Roman temple,” which came to be called the “Temple of
                  the Gods” or “Temple of Augustus.” </p>
                  <p>Christopher Woodward and Sophie Thomas have given informative accounts of this
                  project through which King George IV entered the annals of princes and aristocrats
                  who created fake ruins out of real ones (Woodward 136-9, Thomas 177-8, 185). It
                  seems that over 600 columns from Leptis Magna had been given to Louis XIV for use
                  in his palaces at Versailles and Paris—so in quantitative terms the Prince
                  Regent’s expropriation was relatively modest by comparison. By the end of
                  the Victorian period, time and the English weather were discovered to have been
                  ruining the fake ruins. Efforts at preservation and restoration were undertaken
                  and have continued intermittently into the present. The final page on <title level="m">

                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with this anecdote from Regency ruin culture as a way of framing the
                  following exploration of contradictory discourses of ruin in a sequence of
                  historically and intertextually connected poems from this decade. My argument
                  particularly attends to ruin’s abiding companion process, restoration. The
                  centuries-long European tradition of gazing at, meditating upon, representing,
                  selling, and buying ancient ruins is persistently accompanied by the compensatory
                  activities of reconstructing, conserving, preserving them. Ruin fosters
                  restoration, which in turn may variously constitute itself as a kind of ruin, even
                  as a form of disaster—and not only in the sense in which Ruskin and Morris
                  denounced the destruction of Britain’s medieval architectural heritage in
                  the effort to “restore” it. “Restoration” means political
                  as well as architectural or aesthetic reconstitution and needs to figure
                  persistently in efforts to rethink the cultural politics of ruin and of ruins.
                  Restoring an artificial ruin so that it continues to look like a ruin is one of
                  many permutations of the ruin/restoration dyad.</p>
                  <p>To this dyad we may add a third term intrinsic to the cultural-political process
                  at issue: survival. Ruins presuppose survival and materialize it; restoration
                  seeks to sustain the survival of ruins, but in doing so imperfectly arrests and
                  undoes both ruin and survival. In a trenchantly comprehensive essay entitled
                     <title level="a">Imperial Debris,</title> Ann Laura Stoler says of Derek
                  Walcott: <quote>Rejecting the pathos of ruins, he opted for a celebration of
                     survival. But his vision was not only romantic. It was full of rage. . . .
                     Melancholy, compassion, and pity nourish imperial sensibilities of destruction
                     and the redemptive satisfaction of chronicling loss. Ruins hold histories but
                     are less than the sum of the sensibilities of people who live in them. Instead
                     we might turn to ruins as epicenters of renewed claims, as history in a
                     spirited voice, as sites that animate new possibilities, bids for entitlement,
                     and unexpected political projects. (Stoler 197)</quote> “Survival”
                  for Stoler means the simultaneous living on of ruins and of people whose lives are
                  defined and constrained but also charged with critical resistance by them. Her
                  remarks make implicit contact with but move in a direction quite distinct from
                  Derrida’s effort to inhabit the unfinished inbetweenness of
                  Romantic—and specifically Shelleyan—survival in <title level="m">The
                     Triumph of Life</title> (<title level="a">Living On: Borderlines,</title>
                  1979). It is at once surprising and confirming for Stoler to say that
                  “[Walcott’s] vision was <emph>not only</emph> romantic [my
                  emphasis],” for this implies that any dichotomizing opposition between
                  “pathos” and “rage,” between “romantic”
                  melancholy and “renewed claims,” belies the way in which one kind of
                  affective relation to ruins can transform itself into another. Ruins survive
                  insofar as people to whom they have meaning invest them, nostalgically or
                  resistingly, with their sense of living on. There is a grotesque
                  difference—but also an occluded relationship—between the Caribbean
                  “sugar estates and abandoned forts” to which Walcott refers and the
                  Prince Regent/George IV’s Leptis Magna folly. England’s ruins, both
                  the fake and the not-so-fake—lived on via the flow of colonial wealth. In
                  1817 Byron managed to sell Newstead Abbey to Thomas Wildman, an old Harrovian and
                  British army officer, for 94,500 pounds. These funds, and the 100,000 pounds
                  Wildman subsequently spent in restoring the Byron family property, were generated
                  by a sugar plantation in Jamaica (Marchand 275-6 and note).</p>
                  <p>The historical crossings between ancient ruin culture and more recent imperial
                  ruination are semantic as well as historical. As Stoler observes,
                  “‘Ruin’ is both the claim about the state of a thing and a
                  process affecting it. . . . To turn to its verbal, active sense is to begin from a
                  location that the noun ruin too easily freezes into stasis, into inert object,
                  passive form. Imperial projects are themselves processes of ongoing ruination,
                  processes that ‘bring ruin upon,’ exerting material and social force
                  in the present” (Stoler 195). Refashioning the Roman imperial ruins of
                  Leptis Magna at Virginia Water, we might say, is enabled by and enables the
                  “ongoing ruination” of British imperial exploitation. </p>
                  <p>Yet critical reflection on this process—even on this very example—can
                  also be part of resisting the ways in which ruin gazing and ruin culture function
                  within ongoing processes of imperial ruination. Some of the poetic texts I will
                  explore here derive their political and aesthetic integrity from such critical
                  reflection; others promote a celebratory enthusiasm, at once aesthetic and
                  political, designed to pre-empt and block a resistant critical understanding of
                  what and how ruins come to be valued. Julia Hell recognizes this constitutive
                  ambivalence in her Introduction to <title level="m">Ruins of Modernity</title>,
                  where she focuses momentarily on “a veritable explosion” of texts
                  deploying the thematics and the rhetoric of ruins to represent “some of
                  romanticism’s core concerns.” These include “the political
                  ramifications of the French revolution, an event in Roman (dis)guise that opened a
                  gap between the modern and premodern worlds; the nature of the modern, its
                  aesthetics, and its philosophies of history; and Rome, both republican and
                  imperial, which constitutes one of the most enduring topoi of the ruin archive,
                  the theme of the rise and decline of empires” (<title level="m">Ruins of
                     Modernity</title>, 2). These Romantic “concerns” figure prominently
                  but ambiguously in the texts that interest me, especially with respect to their
                  articulations of Britain’s role in determining the trajectory of the
                  Napoleonic imperial project at moments unstably situated between triumph and
                  catastrophe, commercial and military pre-eminence and social crisis.</p>
                  <p>Reading this historical process in Regency poetry will mean extending Hell’s
                  naming of “romanticism’s core concerns” to include
                  “England’s ruins” alongside the ruins of Roman and of
                  post-Napoleonic Europe. As Anne Janowitz has argued, native ruins (particularly
                  landscape ruins) performed powerful ideological work in shaping national identity
                  during Britain’s eighteenth-century rise to global prominence, its
                  confrontation with Revolutionary and then with Napoleonic France as rival hegemon,
                  and its post-Waterloo emergence from this confrontation as an imperial power with
                  deep internal contradictions (Janowitz 1-19). England’s ruins and the ruins
                  of ancient imperial cultures speak to each other in Regency poetry. What they say
                  is over-determined and conflicted in ways that produce both conformity and
                  confrontation. </p>
                  <p>Canonical ruin culture transvalues fall, decay, collapse, disaster into sites and
                  objects of positive aesthetic and ideological value: the positive transvaluation
                  subsumes and idealizes the negation of ruin as historical, material reality.
                  Critical ruin discourse enters this realm of aesthetic transvaluation and
                  discloses historical and material circumstances that otherwise remain suppressed
                  and mystified. As Stoler observes, it is Benjamin who establishes the most
                  productive precedent for a critical reading of ruin that begins by inhabiting a
                  “dream-collective,” an ideologically saturated terrain of idealization
                  and mystification. <title level="m">The Arcades Project</title>, Stoler writes,
                  “provides the canonical text for thinking about ruins as ‘petrified
                  life,’ as traces that mark the fragility of power and the forces of
                  destruction” (Stoler 194). In this as in many other respects, Benjamin
                  articulates the crucial interface between what we might broadly call Romantic and
                  post-Romantic forms of modernity. His focus on nineteenth-century Paris
                  constitutes as primary field of ruin the historical and cultural terrain between
                  the Revolution and the beginnings of Romanticism on the one hand, and
                  twentieth-century modernism on the other. In the culminating moment of European
                  capitalism, Benjamin says, “we begin to recognize the monuments of the
                  bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled” (<title level="a">Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century</title> [1935], <title level="m">Arcades Project</title> 13). It is what Stathis Gourgouris calls
                  “Benjamin’s idiosyncratic anti-Romanticism” that gives his
                  commentary on the Romantic century its remarkable suggestiveness and force. When
                  Stoler distinguishes what she sees as her own less tragic line of
                  analysis—“ruins are also sites that condense alternative senses of
                  history”—she mischaracterizes Benjamin’s critical commitment to
                  this very project. His reading of the Paris arcades as structures incorporating
                  the fantasies of a new kind of consumer society evolves via passages from
                  affective participation to dialectical critique, from knowing seduction to
                  historical awakening. “The new, dialectical method of doing history presents
                  itself as the art of experiencing the present as waking world, a world to which
                  that dream we name the past refers in truth. To pass through and carry out what
                  has been in remembering the dream!” (<title level="m">Arcades
                     Project</title> 389). This “method” becomes distinctively
                  productive in constructing as its “dialectical image” the ruined
                  arcade, for it is in its conditions as already ruined that the architecture of
                  capitalist culture most fully discloses its status in the ongoingness of social
                  history. </p>
                  <p> The value of Benjamin’s ruin-reading becomes especially evident in
                  comparison to the more limited neo-Romantic claims of Georg Simmel’s famous
                  1911 essay <title level="a">The Ruin.</title> Simmel revives both the Schillerian
                  and the Hegelian idealist dialectic of “spirit” and
                  “nature,” of human mental agency and a material realm that is at once
                  resistant to and—uniquely, for Simmel, in the art of
                  architecture—complicit in “carrying out the [mind’s] plan, as it
                  were, with its own forces.” This generates Simmel’s celebration of the
                  architectural ruin’s “unique balance . . . between mechanical, inert
                  matter . . . and informing spirituality” (Simmel 259). Simmel’s
                  dialectic remains entirely conceptual and metaphysical; it offers no purchase on
                  ruins as indices or tropes of material history—which is why he insists that
                  the “fascination of the ruin” derives not from “destruction by
                  man” but from an ineluctable “effect of nature.” </p>
                  <p>Benjamin inverts Simmel’s hymn to “that metaphysical calm which
                  attaches to the decay of a material work by virtue of a profound a priori,”
                  tracing instead the ways in which ruins make legible simultaneously natural and
                  social processes. We have much still to learn by rereading Romantic discourses of
                  ruin through the lens of Benjamin’s post-Romantic dialectics. The first
                  arcades in Paris were constructed in anticipation of Napoleon’s return from
                  his Egyptian campaign; by the time the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, some arcades
                  were already beginning to deteriorate as architectural and social spaces.
                  Meditating on arcades and associated urban structures fallen into ruin, Benjamin
                  finds himself returning to that canonical site of ancient natural/social
                  ruination, the ruins of Pompeii (Leslie 108). <title level="m">The Arcades
                     Project</title> points the way to freshly elaborated understandings of how the
                  ruins of ancient empires shaped—and still shape—the political and
                  cultural ruins of the nineteenth century.</p>
                  <p> We need to recognize, however, that eighteenth-century ruin culture had already
                  developed critical as well as melancholic and nostalgic perspectives.
                  Goldsmith’s <title level="a">The Deserted Village</title> is not just a
                  wistful lament for the bygone days of “sweet Auburn”; it also offers a
                  kind of critique of modern commercial, urbanizing existence. Less reactionary ways
                  of deploying a vocabulary of ruins were also available, as Andreas Huyssen has
                  shown in recent work on Piranesi’s distinctive concept of the
                  “authentic ruin,” which enters European culture of the 1740s and 1750s
                  not as the melancholy revival of an originary past but as a critical—and
                  self-critical—imaging of cultural instability (<title level="m">Ruins of
                     Modernity</title>, 22-7). Huyssen’s argument is directly pertinent to my
                  readings of Barbauld and Byron—and also, less directly, of Hemans, whose
                  early poems of ruin and restoration illuminate by contrast the potential within
                  Romantic ruin culture for a poetry of defiant resistance.</p>
                  <p>Anna Barbauld’s <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title> shocked
                  and dismayed Regency readers. Published in early February 1812, some seven months
                  after the Prince of Wales celebrated his promotion to Prince Regent, the poem
                  opens with an attack on a disastrous war from which nobody but the old ruling
                  class could benefit. It goes on to elaborate a future vision of England in
                  ruins—of England as ruins—whose value will derive entirely from their
                  transformation into forms of cultural property and cultural capital. The
                  countervailing forces in the poem—the opening condemnation of the Napoleonic
                  “despot’s sway,” the celebration of Britain’s current
                  though threatened commercial pre-eminence, the extended praise of British artistic
                  and scientific achievement—failed to moderate the outrage of readers and
                  reviewers who (rightly) felt themselves compelled to question British
                  exceptionalism: “Britain, know, / Thou who hast shared the guilt must share
                  the woe./ . . . Ruin, as with an earthquake shock, is here” (45-6, 49). If
                  the present ruins of imperialist war are still distant for Britons not directly
                  engaged in fighting, the future ruins the poem imagines pervade the core of the
                  metropole, as “London’s faded glories rise to view” (157) and
                  “pilgrims” from Canada and the United States “some crumbling
                  turret, mined by time, / The broken stairs with perilous step shall climb”
                  (171-2). </p>
                  <p> Barbauld invests this future England in ruins with a contradictory double
                  valence. On the one hand, the ruins are vestiges of British social and especially
                  commercial decay rooted in imperialist war: <quote>

                  ruin, however, are the seeds of a process of transvaluation that moves in a
                  direction quite different from anything in Volney. England’s loss of
                  economic and political power produces a new kind of cultural wealth that assumes
                  the form of ruin—that preserves the greatness of Locke and Milton, of Fox
                  and Nelson, as a heritage of ruin available only, or most dramatically, to
                  visitors from former North American colonies. Barbauld rejects any prospect of
                  restoration, elaborating instead a form of preservation- and propagation-in-ruin.
                  British national heritage, one might say, will be available only to “Nations
                  beyond the Apalachian hills” (83), to “the ingenuous youth whom Fancy
                  fires / With pictured glories of illustrious sires” (126-7). Perhaps some
                  Briton may “lead his wondering guests” to the ruined sites of former
                  power—but in Barbauld’s vision the value of such sites accrues to the
                  tourists, not to their native guides or, presumably, to those who still own these
                  sites as “real” property.</p>
                  <p> Barbauld reverses the characteristic movement of Benjamin’s ruin-reading:
                  instead of proceeding from affective participation to critical awakening, <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title> begins with critical alarm at the
                  ruins of war and out of this shapes an elegiac future for British culture as ruin.
                  The terms on which British greatness will survive as ruin are additionally
                  articulated through the reversal of an Enlightenment and Romantic master-trope,
                  according to which human history progresses as the diurnal movement of light from
                  east to west. Barbauld deploys the trope conventionally early in the poem:
                  “And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now.” She complicates it, however, by
                  imagining England’s future ruins in the shape of palaces and museums that
                  contain, as did earlier imperial ruins, expropriated representations of this very
                  process. Visitors who view these ruins-within-ruins have political lessons to
                  learn as they acquire the cultural capital of their forbears: <quote>

                  <p>If <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title> was the most reviled major
                  poem of the early Regency, the first two cantos of <title level="m">Childe
                     Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, published just over a month later on 10
                  March 1812, was the most celebrated. Strangely, Byron seems never to have said a
                  word about Barbauld’s poem, perhaps because at that moment, as he wrote to
                  Francis Hodgson on 16 February of that year, “I won’t even read a word
                  of the feminine gender;—it must all be <foreign>propria quae
                     maribus</foreign>” (<title level="m">Byron’s Letters and
                     Journals</title> 2. 163). Yet the movement from England’s ruins to the
                  ruins of Greece and the Ottoman Empire in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>
                  stands in complex and revealing relationship to what the reviewer for the <title level="j">Universal Magazine</title> read as Barbauld’s
                  “tragical” satire (Barbauld 310).</p>
                  <p>Byron’s “Romaunt” opens with a scene of double ruin: Childe
                  Harold’s personal ruin, his “crime” (1.27) or “Sin”
                  (1.37), has introduced “uses vile” into what we are given to accept as
                  the noble ruin of “his father hall,” “a vast and venerable pile,
                  / So old, it seemed only not to fall” (1.55-7). His motivation for leaving
                  “his native land” to “visit scorching climes beyond the
                  sea” (1.51-2) arises from shame—he is ruining the family ruin, we
                  might say—and from a kind of boredom or “satiety” (1.34) that
                  becomes part of what makes his confessed “crime” glamorously
                  alienating. Childe Harold’s departure from England’s ruins, then, is
                  at once obedient and transgressive, and evokes analogous fantasies in the reader.
                  There is no mention here at the outset of an England ruined by war, as in <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title>. Byron’s England is
                  initially an Albion whose ruins are intrinsic to its ancient
                  “heritage” (1.91). Childe Harold’s threat to that heritage is
                  staged in terms that make it fascinatingly ruinous; “crime” and
                  “satiety” become signs of a darkly desirable perversity whose
                  trajectory points forward to the “scorching climes” of an orientalist
                  quest.</p>
                  <p> Between Harold and the ruins, ancient and modern, that he seeks to the east lies
                  the reality of the Peninsular War. “[L]ovely Spain! renown’d, romantic
                  land!” (1.386) is being destroyed, and not only by Napoleon’s armies
                  and a faltering Spanish resistance. “Albion” is now “the fond
                  ally / That fights for all, but ever fights in vain” (1.445-6), lines that
                  recall—and may even echo—Barbauld’s image of a Britain that
                  “Bravely, though vainly, dares to strive with Fate, / And seeks by turns to
                  prop each sinking state” (5-6). Byron’s criticism of British military
                  aims goes further than Barbauld’s, however. Though his original note on
                  stanza 33 praises “The late exploits of Lord Wellington” who
                  “has, indeed, done wonders,” Byron’s stanzas on the Battle of
                  Talavera present a grim vision of the blind futility of war quite close to
                  Barbauld’s. The contending armies “Are met—as if at home they
                  could not die— / To feed the crow on Talavera’s plain, / And fertilize
                  the field that each pretends to gain” (1.447-9). The sequence that follows
                  dissolves all patriotic glory in an apprehension of mutual disaster. Albuera,
                  where the French were defeated on 16 May 1811 by British, Spanish, and Portuguese
                  forces, is a “glorious field of grief,” “A scene where mingling
                  foes should boast and bleed” (1.459, 462). Byron’s resistance to
                  militarized patriotism will be for him, as it is on different terms for Barbauld,
                  deeply connected to their respective interventions into the politics of ruin
                  culture. The meditation at the very end of Canto 1 most immediately registers
                  Byron’s personal grief over the death of John Wingfield, but its movement
                  from “dreams” to “Consciousness awakening to her woes”
                  (1.938, 941) also looks forward to the ruins of Greece.</p>
                  <p> These ruins have already made a preemptive if indirect intrusion into the stanzas
                  on Spain: <quote>

                        </lg> (1.616, 621, 639-43) </quote> This disruption of the travel narrative by
                  a narrative of compositional desire (Byron did not draft the stanzas on Portugal
                  and Spain, which he visited in the summer of 1809, until he arrived in Greece in
                  the late autumn) indicates the supervening force of Greece in ruins for the entire
                  textual performance. At the same time, the opening address to Athena and to Athens
                  in Canto 2 presupposes the ruins of “war and wasting fire” (2.4) that
                  Harold has witnessed on the Iberian Peninsula, and that he now confronts in Greece
                  itself. His response to Athens is historical and political from the outset:
                  “o’er each mouldering tower, / Dim with the mist of years, gray flits
                  the shade of power” (2.17-18). Then gradually, via stanzas of generalized
                  reflection on “yon defenceless urn” (2.20) and “the
                  vanish’d Hero’s lofty mound” (2.37), the Parthenon rises in the
                  shape of a question: “Is that a temple where a God may dwell?”
                  (2.44).</p>
                  <p>Byron’s question opens a space in which the poem’s first major
                  critical excursus on the ruins of empire unfolds. As the narrator displaces Harold
                  and seems to occupy the conventionalized Piranesian position of the reflective
                  ruin connoisseur seated upon “this massy stone, / The marble column’s
                  yet unshaken base” (2.82-3), he quickly makes clear that the British have
                  replaced the Ottomans as the most flagrant “plunderers of yon fane”
                  (2.91). The five stanzas condemning the removal and sale of the Parthenon
                  sculptures to the British government involve a relation between the politics of
                  imperialist war and the politics of culture that differs sharply from
                  Barbauld’s vision. Elgin is the “last, the worst, dull spoiler”
                  (2.94), a “barbaric” aristocrat who has ruined by expropriating
                  “what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared” (2.101). In a note
                  “too long to be placed here” (within the poem’s text), Byron
                  explains that “Lord Elgin [may] boast of having ruined Athens” (<title level="a">Appendix to Canto the Second,</title> Note [A]). French and Italian
                  as well as British interests converge in a “devastation” marked by a
                  grotesque mixture of trivial dilettantism, military coercion, and vast private
                  wealth. At the center of the scene is Giovanni Lusieri, the Neapolitan court
                  painter and cultural middleman whom Elgin hired to supervise the removal:
                  “While he and his patrons confine themselves to tasting medals, appreciating
                  cameos, sketching columns, and cheapening gems, their little absurdities are as
                  harmless as insect or fox-hunting, maiden speechifying, barouche-driving, or any
                  such pastime; but when they carry away three or four shiploads of the most valued
                  and massy relics that time and barbarism have left to the most injured and
                  celebrated of cities, when they destroy, in a vain attempt to tear down, those
                  works which have been the admiration of ages, I know no motive which can excuse,
                  no name which can designate, the perpetrators of this dastardly devastation”
                  (Byron 190-91). Byron follows but goes beyond Gibbon here in extending the
                  discourse of barbarism to the inheritors and exploiters of empire. Elgin’s
                  deal with the Turks for the Parthenon ruins enacts, at the level of cultural
                  property, a degradation of Greek potential for liberty and
                  self-determination—however distant the prospect of realizing this potential
                  may have seemed at the time. Byron goes on to distance himself from the entire
                  sphere of cultural investment and acquisition—“I am not a collector or
                  admirer of collections”—in a gesture with critical implications for
                  the status of cultural politics as it evolves in the later cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>. He also extends his attack on imperialist
                  cultural predation back into its founding moment by linking Elgin to Gaius Verres
                  (120-43 BC), the notoriously corrupt Roman governor of Sicily prosecuted by Cicero
                  for, among other things, devastating the temples and private houses of that
                  province (Miles 19-34).</p>
                  <p>Addressing the full critical scope of Byron’s stanzas on Greece in Canto 2
                  is beyond the reach of my argument here. It would mean tracing the aftermath of
                  the “Elgin Marbles” controversy into its present status in the
                  polemics of books such as James Cuno’s <title level="m">Who Owns Antiquity:
                     Museums and the Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage</title>. It would also mean
                  extending Saree Makdisi’s challenging account of the ways in which
                  “the text of [Byron’s] musings on Hellenistic antiquity is shaped by
                  the context of the Oriental world within which he finds the ruins of ancient
                  Greece” (Makdisi 206). The Albanian sequence later in Canto 2 is especially
                  important in making legible an erotics of ruin that is suppressed in the moment
                  when “Greek love” might have figured into the narrator’s elegiac
                  anger towards the desolation of modern Athens. I defer detailed discussion of
                  these issues, however, in order to sustain a more delimited focus on the critical
                  import of Byronic ruin discourse. It is emphatically a discourse that repudiates
                  “restoration”: <quote>

                        </lg> (2.85-8) </quote> Whatever form Byron’s early philhellenic impulses
                  may take, they will not attach themselves to visions of either antiquarian
                  reparation or political restitution (in the sense of “restoring” a
                  previously existing form of the state). Elgin has seized “relics ne’er
                  to be restored” (2.132) and made them British property; there can be no
                  undoing of this ruin as historical event. The future of Greece’s political
                  and aesthetic renewal will have to be built in the midst of this ruin, through the
                  survival of a hope that, in the words of Shelley’s Demogorgon,
                  “creates, / From its own wreck, the thing it contemplates” (<title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> 4.573-4).</p>
                  <p>For Byron and his Regency contemporaries, Waterloo marked a watershed in the
                  valuing of ruins and the meaning of restoration. Felicia Hemans’s <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</title>, her first
                  significant poetic success, responds to the immediate post-Waterloo moment in
                  terms antithetical to those I have been looking at in Byron and Barbauld. The
                  first edition was published by Byron’s own publisher, John Murray, in May,
                  1816, and it did well enough to justify a second, much-expanded edition later that
                  year—this one identifying Hemans as author. Byron told Murray in September
                  that he found <title level="m">The Restoration</title> “a good
                  poem—very” and intended to take it with him on his anticipated travels
                  through Italy (<title level="m">Byron’s Letters and Journals</title>, 5.
                  108). Whatever may have motivated this judgment, it is surprising: Hemans writes
                  about British patriotism and its relation to the timeless, transcendent claims of
                  art in ways that conflict dramatically with the cultural politics of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>. </p>
                  <p>The first edition of Hemans’s poem opens with a complicated epigraphic
                  sequence. A line from Byron’s <title level="m">The Giaour</title>
                  celebrating the Greek Isles appears on the title-page: “AS IF FOR GODS A
                  DWELLING PLACE.” This is followed by five lines from a famous sonnet by
                  Count Vincenzo da Filicaja (1642-1707) representing Italy as a woman burdened with
                  a “<foreign>Dono infelice di bellezza</foreign>” (“graced / With
                  ill-starred beauty” in Hemans’s own 1818 translation), then by a
                  passage from the Rev. J.C. Eustace’s popular <title level="m">A Classical
                     Tour Through Italy</title> (3rd edition, 1815) in which Napoleon’s
                  project of making Italy part of the French Empire is said to “have rivaled
                  or rather surpassed the rapacity of the Goths and Vandals” (Hemans 31).
                  These gestures set in motion a performance in which an elegiac idealization of
                  Italy’s supreme but tragic artistic heritage, recurrently identified with an
                  aesthetic of “romantic” ruin, coexists with a celebration of
                  “restoration” understood, as Susan Wolfson notes, both as
                  reestablishment of the papacy and aristocracy and as restitution of the works of
                  art which Napoleon’s forces had “liberated” and taken to Paris.
                  Just how the “grandeur” of “decay” that defines Italian
                  artistic culture is to survive its “restoration” arises as a central
                  question in both early versions of the poem.</p>
                  <p>The thematic complex of Italy’s glorious “Desolation” (112) in
                  relation to its splendid restoration (101-4) is linked emphatically in the
                  expanded second edition to a triumphant affirmation of Britain’s heroic
                  military intervention: “Land of the lyre! ‘twas there
                  th’avenging sword / Won the bright treasures to thy fanes restored”
                  (87-8). It is hard to imagine that Byron was responding to such lines as these
                  when he praised Hemans’s poem to Murray. Or that he would have tolerated,
                  much less admired, Hemans’s epically inflected encomium of Wellington: <quote>

                  a mystified British patriotism converges so fluently with the image of Italy as
                  “Land of departed fame!” (1)—as “Proud wreck of
                  vanish’d power” (7)—that the potentially contradictory dimension
                  of this variation on the ruin/restoration dynamic remains submerged, for the most
                  part, beneath the poem’s impassioned affective continuity. </p>
                  <p> For the most part—but not entirely. Twice in the second edition of <title level="a">The Restoration</title> Hemans shifts abruptly against the surge of
                  “romantic” Italophile pathos and into a different discursive register.
                  Turning from Florence and Venice to Rome in her narrative of Italy as a land where
                  “Each ruin tells of Earth’s departed lords” (118), Hemans
                  imagines that “from the sacred ashes of the first, / Might a new Rome in
                  phoenix-grandeur burst” and “With one loud call wake Empire from the
                  tomb” (301-4). In the first edition this call for a restoration of
                  “Empire” is immediately followed by a celebration of the Apollo
                  Belvedere, one of the prize antiquities taken from the Vatican to the Louvre in
                  1800 and “restored,” under the supervision of the sculptor Antonio
                  Canova, in 1815. But in the second edition Hemans finds it necessary to make a
                  sudden correction of perspective: “Vain dream! degraded Rome! thy noon is
                  o’er, / Once lost, thy spirit shall revive no more” (309-10). These
                  lines, which echo Barbauld on London in <title level="a">Eighteen Hundred and
                     Eleven,</title> cut sharply against the poem’s rhetoric of
                  restoration—and so themselves require immediate adjustment to allow a return
                  to Hemans’s main line of argument: “Still, still to thee shall nations
                  bend their way, / Revered in ruin, sovereign in decay!” (317-18). The
                  difficulty here, it would appear, is that for political and ethical as well as
                  aesthetic reasons, Rome needs to remain in ruins; any prospect of a phoenix-like
                  rise from its ashes would compromise its distinctive value as ruin—and also
                  threaten Britain’s ascendancy as Europe’s new imperial champion of
                  restoration. </p>
                  <p> A similar disruption occurs some 150 lines later in the second edition.
                  Hemans’s account of the Vatican Museum’s Laocoön leads into a more
                  encompassing tribute to the “pomp” of <quote>

                  of what Britain has restored. We might say that Hemans found it necessary both to
                  confirm and to confine this ruin, as part of controlling her chosen narrative of
                  restoration.</p>
                  <p>Controlling the broader narrative of ruin/restoration/survival is fundamental to
                  each of the monumental set-pieces in <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works
                     of Art to Italy</title>. Hemans’s master-narrative is clear:
                  Italy’s artistic patrimony was ruined when Napoleon seized it as the spoils
                  of war; Britain has nobly restored that artistic patrimony as part of returning
                  Italy to the control of the Church and the old ruling class. But Italy’s
                  antiquities are encoded with multiple narratives of ruin/restoration/survival, and
                  these narratives often stand in contradictory and ironic relation to each other
                  and to Hemans’s historical present. Napoleon took the Apollo Belvedere from
                  the Vatican—but how did this Roman copy of a fourth-century BC Greek
                  original come to be there in the first place? Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the
                  future Pope Julius II, appropriated it shortly after it was unearthed in 1489; for
                  several years it was part of his private collection and stood in the garden of his
                  titular church, Santi Apostili. Upon his election to the papacy he brought it
                  across town to the Vatican (Brummer 66-81). Critical knowledge of such history
                  complicates the status of all the great monuments commemorated in Hemans’s
                  poem: the Venus de’ Medici in the Uffizi Gallery was exiled from Rome to
                  Florence by Pope Innocent XI in 1667, apparently because it had come to be
                  regarded as dangerously provocative (Haskell and Penny 71-83); the four bronze
                  horses above the main portal of the Basilica of San Marco in Venice were stolen
                  from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade some six centuries before Napoleon
                  stole them for France (Freeman 11-36); the “Belvedere Torso” of
                  Hercules, now believed to be a Roman copy of a second-century BC original,
                  circulated among Roman aristocrats and their artists for more than a century
                  before it entered the Vatican collections under unknown circumstances (Sommalia
                  54-9); the Laocoön itself—probably a first-century BC Roman copy—was
                  found in 1506 near Nero’s Domus Aurea and bought by Julius II, who placed it
                  alongside his celebrated Apollo in the Belvedere Garden of the Vatican (Masson
                  317-19). The story of Napoleonic rapacity reads somewhat differently within these
                  contexts. Furthermore, neither the Belvedere Torso nor the Laocoön was taken to
                  France during the Napoleonic occupation. Their inclusion in Hemans’s
                  promenade of “restored” Italian antiquities illustrates the
                  controlling and at times misleading ideology of her poem’s defining
                  narrative.</p>
                  <p>Byron may have read the first edition of <title level="m">The Restoration of the
                     Works of Art to Italy</title> sometime during the composition of Canto 3 of
                     <title level="m">Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</title>, between April and
                  November 1816. But his explicit compositional response to it was, with one
                  possible exception, delayed. In resuming the poem as part of his self-exile, Byron
                  reprises the constitutive movement from ruins to ruins in Cantos 1 and 2. Harold
                  and the poet-narrator in Canto 3 are more defiantly embittered extensions of their
                  previous textual identities. This is especially true of the latter, who carries
                  within him now the ruins of his own unprecedented literary conquest: he is himself
                  a kind of ruin of empire. The internalizing and reflexive trajectory of the canto
                  sustains, however, a powerful outward-reaching relation to the immediate
                  historical moment. In his exilic travels the autobiographical subject tracks anew
                  the disastrous course of more than two decades of revolutionary struggle across
                  the European continent, pausing to consider its complete disintegration
                  “upon this place of skulls, / The grave of France, the deadly
                  Waterloo” (3.154-5). Here Byron begins to rearticulate an ironic and
                  critical relationship between his own personal disaster and the demise of
                  freedom’s cause. The intermittent turnings to “nature” in Canto
                  3 will ultimately mirror back to him the turbulence and despair by which these
                  gestures are motivated, resulting in rhetorical performances—like the famous
                  lightning storm on Lake Leman—that figure imaginative power in terms that
                  are glamorously self-frustrating, self-withholding (Emerson 363-78). His
                  meditations on Rousseau late in the Canto lead him to declare that “this
                  will not endure, nor be endured!” (3.779). But by the end a defiant
                  endurance, which includes a determined belief in the efficacy of his own writing,
                  is all that remains, along with a parent’s fond hope for a daughter whom he
                  will never see again. </p>
                  <p> Where Byron’s reading of Hemans may have exerted an influence is in the
                  proleptic apostrophe to “Italia” that marks the transition to the
                  concluding stanzas of Canto 3: <quote>

                        </lg> (3.1027-30).</quote> Before he crosses the Alps Byron imagines
                  that—to a degree beyond what even the ruins of Athens had afforded—the
                  “knowledge” he now seeks is to be read from the ruins of
                  “imperial” Rome. This is why, three stanzas earlier, he identifies so
                  forcefully with Gibbon, the “lord of irony” whose “master-spell,
                  / . . . stung his foes to wrath . . . / And doom’d him to the zealot’s
                  ready Hell” (3.1000-2).</p>
                  <p>Byron would undertake his anticipated study of the ruins of Roman imperialism in
                  April and May 1817, six months after he had settled in Venice and a year after his
                  self-exile from Regency society and literary triumph. The fourth canto of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>, unlike the previous three, was not written
                  during the events it narrates; it was begun after Byron returned to the Veneto in
                  the early summer. As he makes clear in the prefatory letter to Hobhouse, he
                  regarded Canto 4 as a “poetical work” in its own right, as “the
                  most thoughtful and comprehensive of my compositions.” Only in critical
                  retrospect, we may assume, did Byron believe he could know what Italy had to teach
                  him. We may also assume, accordingly, that there is nothing perfunctory about the
                  pervasive rhetoric of ruin in this text. The word ruin and its variants appear
                  fifteen times in 1674 lines of verse. The work this rhetoric performs has been
                  extensively and effectively examined in previous critical accounts; what I wish to
                  contribute lays no claim to being exhaustive or comprehensive. My more limited
                  concern is with the function of ruin in connecting two intricately aligned textual
                  trajectories: a self-critically updated re-production of the literary identity
                  called “Byron” in the aftermath of post-Waterloo restoration, and an
                  equally self-critical extension of <title level="m">Childe Harold</title>’s
                  status as travelogue—as a special kind of literary commodity consumed by
                  readers finally able to travel again to the treasured sites of Italian aesthetic
                  achievement and cultural value.</p>
                  <p>In a chapter called <title level="a">The Shaping Spirit of Ruin: <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> IV,</title> Jerome Christensen engages the issues I
                  am emphasizing here with characteristically bold and knowing penetration. For him,
                  ruin in Canto 4 functions symptomatically rather than critically: “Lord
                  Byron monumentalizes himself by Byronizing all monuments,” he writes.
                  “The ruin of Lord Byron’s name (published abroad by scandal and
                  reviews) does not any more than the ruin of Italy mean extinction but
                  allegorization: Byron becomes the name of ruin” (Christensen 191). What this
                  reading minimizes is the pressure of political resistance generated through the
                  dynamic Christensen so commandingly conceptualizes. Byron does indeed represent
                  himself “as both victim and exploiter” of British commercial society
                  and of the imperial expansion that is its analogue. But what Christensen terms the
                  “imperial self-division of Byronism” is more often antagonistic to
                  than complicit with, or merely allegorical of, British imperialism and the
                  poem’s status as cultural commodity. Hence the importance of Peter
                  Manning’s argument in <title level="a">
                        <title level="m">Childe
                        Harold</title> in the Marketplace: From Romaunt to
                  Handbook</title>—that Childe Harold simultaneously invokes and undoes both
                  the ideology of the romance genre and what a contemporary reviewer identified as
                  “the narrative of a modern tourist” (Manning 171). This dynamic is
                  evident, as we have seen, in the anti-war sections of Cantos 1 and 3. But it is
                  most remarkably elaborated in the cultural politics of Canto 4, where Byron
                  performs his now sensational identity as a “ruin amidst ruins” in ways
                  that transform the glamour and pathos of the renegade British aristocrat into a
                  figure who evokes in order to disrupt the apparent triumphs of empire, literary
                  celebrity, and aesthetic monumentalism.</p>
                  <p>Consider the sequence beginning with the stanza on Ariosto (4.361-9), whose fusion
                  of chivalric romance and satire (the epigraph to Canto 4 is from Ariosto’s
                  Satire 3) is fundamental to the latter phase of Byron’s career. The salute
                  to Ariosto is followed, as a note in the first edition indicates, by an adaptation
                  of Byron’s translation of the Filicaja sonnet that Hemans excerpts at the
                  beginning of <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works of Art to
                  Italy</title>. But Byron turns the trope of Italia’s “fatal gift of
                  beauty” (4.371) in a quite different direction. Recalling his youthful
                  reading of Servius Sulpicius’s letter to Cicero on traveling through Greece,
                  Byron alludes to his own sail between Piraeus and Corinth and reads from those
                  unrebuilt ruins anticipations of present imperialist realities: <quote>

                  </p>
                  <p>For Christensen, “Byron’s identification with the ruins of
                  Italy” is such that “the ruins of the modern age are themselves
                  radically discontinuous with ruins in the past” because of their
                  “status as commodities” (Christensen 192). But Byron’s stanza
                  would appear to indicate the opposite: the ruins of the ancient Mediterranean
                  acquire a double meaning as cultural commodities because “all that was / Of
                  then destruction is.” As Janowitz argues, in <title level="m">Childe
                     Harold</title> 4 “the distance between past and present is significantly
                  diminished by a labile self and by the contemporaneity of the history the poet
                  evokes” (Janowitz 41). Byron links what was to what is through a
                  tense-inflected copula not of identity but of survival, of living on in
                  “destruction” and “desolation.” The connection to Benjamin
                  here is striking: “It’s not that what is past casts its light on what
                  is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that
                  wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a
                  constellation” (<title level="m">Arcades Project</title> 462). As Mark
                  Featherstone comments, Benjamin worked “through the excavation of those
                  ruins of the present that might allow for the rediscovery of the horrors of the
                  past qua the return of the historical repressed. . . . the traces of the past were
                  encrypted in the ruins of the present” (Featherstone 313). And so they are
                  for Byron too. Though Benjamin’s focus on the previous century’s
                  relatively recent past-in-ruins differs from Byron’s “all that
                  was” of “imperial Rome,” their respective recognitions of
                  material history’s convergences in constellated representations of present
                  cultural affect and critical resistance put them into reciprocally revealing
                  dialogue. </p>
                  <p>Janowitz argues that in confronting this deep historical survival of ruin from
                  past into the “now” of social existence and of writing, “Byron
                  restores Rome aesthetically . . . In this dialectic of ruin, Byron is . . .
                  authorized to emancipate aesthetic value from its historical order, and fix its
                  form against historical decay.” But the “terrible cost of that
                  emancipation,” she continues, “is the power of poetic monumentality,
                  which is collapsed into those historical wastes which face the speaker”
                  (Janowitz 41). And which face the reader, of course. We may extend
                  Janowitz’s insights along more explicitly Benjaminian lines: the desire for
                  aesthetic restoration and redemption is powerfully inscribed in the language of
                  Canto 4—but even more powerful is Byron’s sense of a continuity of
                  ruin that transmutes monuments regarded as transcendent into critical historical
                  texts of ongoing political significance. No nineteenth-century writer would have
                  assented more knowingly than Byron to Benjamin’s Thesis that “There is
                  no cultural document that is not at the same time a record of barbarism.”
                  Like Gibbon before and Benjamin after him, Byron knew that “barbarism”
                  was and is a condition intrinsic to all class society.</p>
                  <p>From this perspective, we may follow Byron as he enters Rome in Canto 4
                  enunciating, in the spirit of Benjamin’s “at the same time,” a
                  vision of the “Lone mother of dead empires” that simultaneously
                  retraces the steps of melancholy ruinists and insists on a critical awareness that
                  “empire” lives on. His insistence on the limits, even the futility, of
                  both aesthetic and scientific recuperation are self-critical, not self-satisfied:
                  “Chaos of ruins! Who shall trace the void, / O’er the dim fragments
                  cast a lunar light, / And say, ‘here was, or is,’ where all is doubly
                  night?” (4.718-20). There is an element of rueful identification rather than
                  of dismissal in Byron’s vignette of those who are excited when “some
                  false mirage of ruin rises near” (4. 729). What matters is the ascendancy of
                  historicizing self-consciousness over antiquarian connoisseurship. Of the vast
                  “mass of ruins” on the Palatine he asks: “Temples, baths or
                  halls? / Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reap’d / From her research
                  hath been, that these are walls — / Behold the Imperial Mount! ‘tis
                  thus the mighty falls” (4.960-3). As empire survives, ruin survives; it is
                  in this sense that “History, with all her volumes vast, / Hath but one
                  page” (4.968-9).</p>
                  <p>Byron turns our attention towards the revered monuments of ancient empire not to
                  debunk their affective force in the present but to redirect that force towards an
                  awakened sense of how they may be read as commentaries on the
                  present—including the present phenomenon of Byron’s own commodified
                  celebrity. From this angle rereading the most familiar and persistently
                  decontextualized sequence in Canto 4—the eighteen stanzas on the
                  Coliseum—affords fresh opportunities for seeing how Byron performs his
                  identity as a special kind of tourist guide through acts of resistant
                  ruin-reading. Stanza 128 opens the sequence by viewing this monument of Roman
                  monuments in what will become a clichéd ambience: a “wondrous,”
                  “magic” atmosphere of “moonbeams” and
                  “shadows” (see the reference to “lunar light” in 4. 719).
                  But in stanza 130, with its shift from “Time! the beautifier of the
                  dead” to “Time, the avenger!” (4.1162, 1169), Byron enacts a
                  desire for revenge against those who would ruin him and links it to the fate of
                  his writing: “. . . there is that within me which shall tire / Torture and
                  Time, and breathe when I expire; / Something unearthly, which they deem not
                  of” (4.1228-30). It is this affirmation of writing that lives on beyond the
                  life of the writer in the form of ruin that opens the way to his now seeing the
                  Coliseum in the intense light of historical reality—as a theatre of imperial
                  brutality. The “dying gladiator” Byron places before us has its
                  origins in a celebrated work of art in the Capitoline Museum, the second-century
                  BC marble figure not of a gladiator but of a Gaul who fell fighting against King
                  Attalus I of Pergamon in Asia Minor (Sommalia 55-8). But through a process of
                  double transfer—from battlefield to public spectacle, from monumental marble
                  to covertly ekphrastic verbal fiction—Byron compels his readers to see the
                  Coliseum historically, as a site of ideological manipulation and control, as a
                  stadium where enslaved human beings were “Butcher’d to make a Roman
                  holiday” (4.1267). By merging what the “dying gladiator” was and
                  is to his own vindictive impulses—“Shall he expire / And
                  unavenged?” (4.1268-9), Byron turns the culture of tourism his poem inhabits
                  and participates in against itself. When the moon rises over the Coliseum again in
                  stanza 144, it rises with a different kind of “magic,” with the power
                  to “raise the dead” (4.1295). The “Heroes” who haunt this
                  ruin are the victims, not the victors, of empire. This is the grim lesson of the
                  Coliseum for Byron: “Rome and her Ruin past Redemption’s skill, / The
                  World, the same wide den—of thieves, or what you will” (4.1304-5). </p>
                  <p>The cultural logic of ruin/restoration in <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> 4
                  reverses that of <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works of Art to
                     Italy</title>. It shares with Barbauld’s argument in <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title> the conviction that the ruins of empire
                  live on both as idealized cultural property and as sites of critical and
                  potentially liberatory knowledge. Near the end of the letter to Hobhouse that
                  introduces Canto 4, Byron comments on Britain’s post-war triumphalism in
                  terms congruent with if not identical to Barbauld’s wartime vision of a grim
                  future reckoning: “What Italy has gained by the late transfer of nations, it
                  were useless for an Englishman to enquire, till it become ascertained that England
                  has acquired something more than a permanent army and a suspended Habeas Corpus;
                  it is enough for them to look at home. For what they have done abroad, and
                  especially in the South, ‘Verily they will have their reward,’ and at
                  no very distant period” (Byron 124). This understanding of England’s
                  role, now in post- rather than pre-Waterloo transfers of wealth and power, cuts
                  directly against the idealizing patriotism of Hemans’s <title level="m">Restoration</title>—and of its contradictory sequel, <title level="m">Modern Greece and the Elgin Marbles</title>.</p>
                  <p>The contradiction is overt: in the earlier poem Britain is celebrated for
                  “restoring” Italian artistic property expropriated by the French; in
                  the latter, it is Britain’s own expropriation of sculptural ruins from the
                  Parthenon that is cause for culminating celebration.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron makes no mention of this reversal of perspective on

                        and Journals</title> 5. 262-3), probably because he did not know that the
                     anonymous author was Hemans. Ironically—and astonishingly—the

                  striking shift in Britain’s role, however, is an idealized, explicitly
                  “romantic” discourse of ruin-value ideologically tied to myths of
                  ancient Greco-Roman political freedom, and to a belief in Britain as the modern
                  imperial successor to Greek and Roman greatness. It has been argued, initially by
                  Susan Wolfson and then somewhat differently by Francesco Crocco, that the
                  idealizing patriotic emphasis of Hemans’s philhellenism was motivated by her
                  determination to gain credibility for women poets working in poetic genres still
                  dominated by men. The persuasiveness of this view, however, further complicates a
                  poetic agenda devoted to the idea that post-Napoleonic Britain “has[ ] power
                  to be what Athens e’er hath been” (line 990). </p>
                  <p> The “power” Hemans celebrates in <title level="m">Modern
                     Greece</title> involves her redefining “empire” in entirely mental
                  terms. What we see in the vestiges or traces of Greek ruins is “the awful
                  wreck of mind, / That weareth still a glory in decay” (lines 285-6).
                  Antithetically, the conquering power of Ottoman Islam is represented as crudely
                  material and primitive; it derives from “Regions” that are literally
                  and figuratively barren, “to intellect a desert space” (lines 345-7).
                  Greek “ruin” is the result of barbaric Islamic conquest—and of
                  the decay of the Greek “race.” As material phenomenon, however, ruin
                  now becomes the distinctive form of “Mind’s unconquer’d
                  power” (line 390). “Attica” was and is, for Hemans, both
                  “empire” and “little sphere, whose soul-illumined round /
                  Concentrated each sunbeam of the mind” (lines 691-4). The idealizing of
                  “ruin” as mental trace or reflection becomes especially evident as
                  Hemans varies the vocabulary of “form” to include
                  “archetype” (“Bright archetypes of all the grand and
                  fair,” line 834) and “model” (“nations rising to their
                  fame afar, / Still to thy model turn,” line 840; “art hath won a world
                  in models pure as thine,” line 950). An abstracted and purified aesthetic
                  glory is what enables the poem’s ultimate transfer of “power”
                  via the culture of ruins from ancient Greece to modern Britain.</p>
                  <p> If ruin-as-form is the repository of ancient but still readable genius, it is
                  also the place where the life of the mind merges most affectively with organic

                  “secret magic” of Grecian ruins by giving the vestiges of
                  “Mind’s unconquer’d power” (line 390) an additional
                  “romantic” charm. </p>
                  <p> The poem’s concluding celebration of the Elgin Marbles begins by
                  preemptively and defensively linking “those” critical of
                  Britain’s acquisition to the barbaric “conquerors of Minerva’s
                  land”: “Oh! Live there those who view with scornful eyes / All that
                  attests the brightness of thy prime?” (lines 851-2). The link is extended in
                  the following stanza’s claim that “No patriot feeling binds them to
                  the soil” (line 865), where the adjective “patriot” merges Greek
                  and British loyalty. But it is the broader merging of national and universal
                  interests that is decisive. The universalizing agenda in Hemans’s poem is
                  crucially different from Byron’s and Shelley’s internationalism
                  (“We are all Greeks,” <title level="m">Preface to Hellas</title>,
                  Shelley 4431). From Hemans’s perspective the real “Spoilers” are
                  Elgin’s critics, who refuse to recognize that “Thy relics, Athens!
                  borne to other lands, / Claim homage still to thee from every heart” (lines
                  873-4). Hemans offers here a Regency version of the central argument of
                  Cuno’s <title level="m">Who Owns Antiquity?</title>, with its reiterated
                  case on behalf of the “universal museum,” the “museum dedicated
                  to ideas, not ideologies, the museum of international, indeed universal
                  aspirations, and not of nationalist limitations” (Cuno xxxii). Hemans is
                  more forthright than Cuno in acknowledging that, historically, these
                  “universal” institutions just happen to be located in imperialist
                  metropoles. In fact it is Britain’s future role as imperial power that
                  generates the energy of Hemans’s conclusion: <quote>

                  Elgin, Wellington, and other heroic British figures whose money and guns and good
                  taste have made sure that their nation now has “power to be what Athens
                  e’er hath been.” </p>

                     <title level="m">Modern Greece</title> is obviously indebted to Byron. That it
                  concludes with a polemic against Byron’s position on the Parthenon ruins
                  signals both the boldness and the limitations of Hemans’s literary
                  ambitions. It also concludes with an allusion to Barbauld’s <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title>, the shadow of which remains undispelled
                  by the final encomium<note place="foot" resp="editors">The influence of

                     North American visitor to England’s ruins. The emigrant/immigrant status
                     of Barbauld’s returning “pilgrims” may well have influenced
                     Hemans’s stanzas on Greek emigration to Asia and America (stanzas
                     X-XX).</note>: <quote>

                  in its ruins: this is what haunts ruin-gazer as well as ruin-critic. The question
                  that makes all the difference, as Barbauld and Byron differently make evident, is
                  whether or not we awaken from what haunts us in the ruins of empire to what can
                  enable us to transform survival into freedom. </p>

                  calamity.</quote>
                  <p>In an entry in her journals about her brother’s struggles with writing
                     <title level="a">The Pedlar</title>, Dorothy Wordsworth notes: “Wm very
                  ill, employed with the pedlar . . . Disaster pedlar” (96). The evocation
                  here of grievous embodiment in a figure typically defined as one of the hallmarks
                  of Wordsworth’s literary personae gives rise to several perspectives that
                  bear on the persistence of calamity in romantic thought. Dorothy elucidates a
                  figure of and for imminent disaster that seems proper to the act of reading
                  itself: enigmatically foretelling a disaster that Wordsworth in his numerous
                  revisions of the Pedlar narrative had sought to control and shape, her words have
                  the effect of bearing witness to an event she cannot fully know or summon into
                  clarity. Much like Benjamin’s angel who looks back at the debris of history
                  while being drawn forward into a future tense inscribed by the unknowability of
                  the past, the pedlar is hallucinated as the promise of an exemplary persona whose
                  task is impossibly to ameliorate the ruination that emerges in the witnessing or
                  reading of the poem. Yet Dorothy's comment points to the undoing of this scenario,
                  for the pedlar's potentially angelic vocation is disarrayed as he becomes a
                  disaster, a persona that incorporates and transmits the horror of what he sees. </p>
                  <p>Here, text produces a referentiality that seemingly lives beyond it while at the
                  same time seeping outward as an event that is necessarily tied to linguistic
                  deferral.</p>
                  <p>How and why does a text generate this “necessity” of catastrophe? In
                  Paul de Man’s classic essay, <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title>,
                  the poet emerges as the material precipitate of processes of fragmentation,
                  erosion, and drowning in <title level="a">The Triumph of Life</title>, which
                  ineluctably participate in a canonical monumentalization of the poem that cannot
                  be freed from the critique of those processes themselves (de Man). At once on the
                  page and away from the page, the “body” of Shelley is what is
                  different from language <emph>and</emph> posited by linguistic cueing—a
                  phantom excess or catastrophic materiality that is intrinsic to the reading of the
                  poem. Similarly, Dorothy’s reading returns us to the scene of disaster as
                  both the future and present of a condition of reading and interpretation. In this
                  way, the pedlar might very well signal less something wicked this way coming than
                  a conceptual dissonance that implicitly sustains the life-world of romanticism and
                  which cannot be accounted for. </p>
                  <p> This optic suggests that the emergence of the pedlar is partly in line with the
                  form of traumatism Derrida defines as the fear of the yet-to-come, or the
                  possibility of some greater catastrophe ever about to occur despite the sense that
                  it has already taken place. This hope, in turn, is not easily distinguished from
                  Derrida's treatment of the messianic orientation to the to-come, hinting that in
                  his work, as well as in the romanticism it inherits, the promise of a certain
                  futurity is always shadowed by its catastrophic counterpart in a pairing that
                  ruins the very temporalities through which we might attempt to manage disaster and
                  its aftermaths. Accordingly, in the pages that follow, we have sought to think
                  about how romanticism endures or bears with (a term central to Rei Terada’s
                  article) the difficulties of defining <emph>what</emph> constitutes a disaster and
                  what kinds of changes it can provoke in social, political, epistemological, and
                  ethical life. After all, if disaster etymologically suggests a disorientation of
                  place in relation to the stars, this loss of footing is less about a saturation in
                  despair than a recognition of how the attending disappointments,
                  reaction-formations, and imperilling states of disastrous experience might signal
                  a vital rethinking of the untapped powers that lie amidst the ruins. The pedlar
                  can be at once a threat <emph>and</emph> an invitation to stare a bit longer at
                  the valuable consequences that lie in reorganizing ourselves to a catastrophic
                  reality that is not meant to be withstood but rather accepted as our ineluctable
                  present. </p>
                  <p>The possibility of exploring these powers of acceptance is not entirely new to
                  romanticism; indeed, for centuries British subjects had taken for granted the
                  necessity of enduring catastrophic events - plague, famine, flood, drought - as an
                  inherent part of human vulnerability. Yet as the institutions of modern
                  governmentality begin to emerge, such events appear more negotiable than before;
                  the narrator of Daniel Defoe's <title level="m">A Journal of a Plague Year</title>
                  oscillates between reading the plague as a visitation of divine will and a medical
                  condition whose spread could at least be partially prevented through better
                  measures on the part of the London municipal authorities. Catastrophic events, it
                  seems, are in part cosmically given and in part subject to human intervention.
                  Although a similar ambivalence remained in force through the romantic era and well
                  beyond, the increasing confidence of medical practitioners, the growth in
                  population, the shift toward a more secular and humanistic ethos, and the impress
                  of Enlightenment demands for better governance cast new doubt on the necessity of
                  disaster, giving a different tone to the collective response to destructive
                  events. What might have previously been spoken of as an intractable dimension of
                  divine will was now read as a potentially negotiable aspect of human biology or
                  public governance; the recurrence of such events thus pointed either to the need
                  for further enlightenment and reform or to a fault endemic to the public order
                  itself. The fierce political debates that emerged during the famine of the mid
                  1790s, for example, shortly before Wordsworth labored on <title level="m">The
                     Ruined Cottage</title>, debates that often invoked notions of natural law (as
                  in Edmund Burke's <title level="a">Thoughts and Details on Scarcity</title>) or of
                  common right to subsistence from the land (as in John Thelwall's <title level="j">The Tribune</title>), demonstrate how far Britain had moved into a secular,
                  political idiom. </p>
                  <p>Yet the adoption of such an idiom inspired others to extend it, to ponder the
                  systematic recurrence of general distress, leading T. R. Malthus to argue in 1798
                  that the "checks to population" - war, famine, and plague - arise from
                  population's endless pressure to exceed the limits of subsistence. In this view,
                  disaster is a symptom of a certain disorder in the biological preconditions of
                  human life as such, a disorder that he attempts to recuperate as a spur to human
                  labor and ingenuity, in the mode of a secular theodicy, but which nevertheless
                  speaks of a new possibility - that the domain over which medicine, governance, and
                  political economy sought to exert their sway might be shaped by a constitutive
                  contradiction, a non-negotiable incoherence that no administrative effort could
                  finally extirpate, a fault in things that shatters even a secular theodicy. By the
                  end of the eighteenth century, it became conceivable that rather than consisting
                  of singular events, disaster was endemic to the human itself. As a result, while
                  the apparently rational institutions of the modern state promised to remove
                  certain domains - subsistence, reproduction, and public health - from the vagaries
                  of divine will, the persistence of collective distress suggested that those
                  domains were subject to equally intractable forces now rooted not in divine
                  alterity but in natural law.</p>
                  <p>A similar development took place as students of "the history of the earth"
                  gradually articulated the elements of modern geological knowledge: by the late
                  eighteenth century, natural disaster and vast extinction, rather than being
                  exceptional events, were conceived as taking place frequently across the immense
                  reaches of earth's history. Indeed, as Scott Juengel suggests, Malthus may not
                  entirely be a theorist of catastrophe due to his avoidance of the exception in
                  favor of “a mathematical horizon and the inevitability of time and
                  instinct.” This awareness confronted late-eighteenth century people with a
                  systematic catastrophe even less tractable than demographic crisis, less amenable
                  to governmental intervention. If on some level geological crises could be
                  explained with reference to fundamental natural laws, on another they revealed a
                  primal fault in the preconditions of human life, creating another obstacle to the
                  formation of a secular theodicy. Enlightenment investigation, in short, ultimately
                  exposed a fault in the anchoring terms of the secular order itself, in nature and
                  the human. One might almost say that as a result, only at this point was disaster
                  truly disastrous, for only now was it possible to face the prospect of enduring it
                  without recourse and without appeal.</p>
                  <p>Yet even this notion of the non-negotiable disaster found its place within
                  scenarios that in various ways attempted to confirm the ascendancy of governance
                  or of a certain rationality. Malthus himself, for example, sought to learn the
                  lessons of disaster and to modify the policies of the British state accordingly,
                  encouraging it to revise its laws regarding the provision of aid to the poor (as
                  it did in the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834). The implacable laws of nature, in
                  his view, justified the state's adopting only apparently inhumane and draconian
                  policies of its own. The sublation of disaster into public policy created what one
                  might regard, <foreign>contra</foreign> Malthus, as a kind of disastrous state.
                  But others in the period explored rather different strategies. In his analytic of
                  the sublime, Kant suggested that the mind encountering any excessively vast or
                  powerful aspect of nature could overleap that threat and identify with its own
                  capacity to conceive of the infinite, effectively mapping out a strategy whereby
                  the mind could assure itself of its dominance over even the most implacably
                  hostile aspects of nature. Rather than attempting to provide a theological or
                  governmental response to devastation, Kant in fact left empirical devastation in
                  place, superseding it not by imagining any historically actual resolution but by
                  creating a new category of solace, the mind's reassurance of its destination in a
                  zone beyond any empirically available experience. In effect, he created a new
                  secular theodicy, an identification with the mind's transcendence, whereby one
                  could face with equanimity any actually devastating experience by keeping in mind
                  that even it could not fundamentally alter one's supersensible origin and end. The
                  cost of such a strategy, however, is that it located human dignity in a space so
                  remote from actual suffering that it left the latter in place, largely
                  unchallenged, cutting that solace off from the suffering body and embodied mind
                  that needed it most. The attempt to overleap disaster by sublating it into
                  governance or by resorting to the virtual category of the mind's transcendence
                  both failed to dislodge disaster from its newly provocative and difficult position
                  as the obstacle to secular theodicy or to a rationally redemptive historiography,
                  for these strategies either gave disaster even more force or provided an exit
                  strategy from a history where it continued to hold sway.</p>
                  <p>In the wake of these and other developments, Wordsworth's labor on <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> takes on new weight, for a figure who at
                  once bears and embodies the disaster takes the measure of an unyielding negativity
                  without attempting to sublate it into a new mode of governance or a new
                  philosophical category. Under the new conditions of secular knowledge and
                  governance, the capacity to abide <emph>with</emph> and <emph>as</emph> disaster
                  has new and surprising resonances. Although the pedlar does conclude his tale with
                  a consoling meditation, those lines remain embedded in the context of the story of
                  Margaret's suffering and point back to it, remaining vulnerable to a
                  countervailing interpretation of her tale. Indeed, Wordsworth's very difficulty in
                  composing this conclusion, or rather in deciding how to bridge the gap between the
                  affective resonances of suffering and of consolation, led to the perpetual crisis
                  of composing this poem, to William's illness, and eventually to Dorothy's
                  designation of "Disaster pedlar." In effect, Dorothy's gesture of naming the
                  pedlar in this way suggests that how to respond to a disastrous world is itself an
                  ongoing compositional, affective, aesthetic disaster, one that admits of no
                  resolution, that disables, even as it effects, the task of interpretation. In that
                  case, however, the emergence of this figure exceeds its contexts, recasting the
                  various discourses it evokes to undermine the explanatory virtues of historical
                  location per se. This disabling element extends as well to our reading: the poem
                  never makes clear what referential scenario we are to privilege as we comprehend
                  it, on what ontological level we are to locate the disaster it addresses, nor how
                  exactly to conceive of disaster itself. Placed within and against its manifold
                  contexts, <title level="m">The Ruined Cottage</title> thus indicates that
                  romanticism takes as its point of departure these very difficulties. Here and
                  elsewhere, romanticism maps out what we might now recognize as a negative
                  dialectics, one that refuses the stratagems of sublation as long as a certain
                  catastrophic materiality remains in force, and a negative historicity, one that
                  invokes yet refuses historical location. In its hesitations, impasses, and
                  foreclosures, this poem outlines an aesthetics not of failure but of rigorous
                  resistance to a false redemption, indeed to theodicy itself, one that ultimately
                  hopes not to evade what it sees in disaster but to dwell with it, bear with it,
                  and thus to find in this very abiding its own mode of impossible consolation.</p>
                  <p>Our reading of the disastrous pedlar thus suggests that if romanticism has often
                  been defined as a being-in-the-world that coincides with liberal processes of
                  secularization, increased progress, and amelioration, then it would appear that
                  reading romanticism through its capacity to dwell with disaster attends to the
                  ways in which optimistic revelation is split or <emph>displaced</emph> (an
                  etymological improvisation on <foreign>désastre</foreign>—“from
                  the stars”) by the “traumatic kernel,” as Žižek would
                  put it (<title level="m">For They Know Not</title> 102), which influences the
                  romantic projects that continue to make a claim on our contemporary thinking. It
                  is the task of this special issue to approach the problem of reading the romantic
                  varieties of disaster and to engage a host of attending issues. What are the
                  social, historical, and political conditions or possibilities of living amidst
                  devastation? How does one recognize such devastation in the first place, and what
                  are the criteria through which it is posited? What is a crisis, and what kinds of
                  temporal changes does it occasion? What can be philosophically gained or lost by
                  analyzing disaster in its numerous sites, contexts, and instances? Anecdotally,
                  the idea for this issue emerged out of our felt experience of the topicality of
                  disaster in our own post-9/11 “dark times”; and yet, to quickly say
                  that “disaster” is the <foreign>zeitgeist</foreign> of our age evokes
                  an amnesiac, anxious belief (as Timothy Morton argues in his essay) that a
                  holistic world <emph>was</emph> at some point possible and has been recently rent
                  asunder. The nostalgic leitmotif here seems to avoid the more critical
                  intervention made by many romantic texts that disaster has already phenomenally
                  occurred within our social, political, and cultural structures and that
                  perpetually attempting to sift the real from the imagined disasters fails to plumb
                  the depths of what we assume “befalls” us. It also turns away from
                  providing challenging responses and intellectual reorientations to catastrophic
                  events. “A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe
                  and guarantee a longer recession,” said Barack Obama on February 4, 2009,
                  “a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future . . . . That's why I
                  feel such a sense of urgency about the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan."
                  The urgency of the request is underwritten by the sense that impending dissolution
                  is the likely terminus that can be avoided by skirting inaction and
                  passivity—failures to “act now,” in other words, are what turn
                  crisis into catastrophe, but what is missing from Obama’s measurement is the
                  more jarring sense that the crisis has always already been here, and that
                  guarantees for normative restoration and reconstitution are themselves
                  consequences of an inability to develop modes of thought and agency that desist
                  from the “catastrophic imperative” (Hoens et al.) that structures us
                  already.</p>
                  <p>We have purposely left “disaster” open as a complex term in order not
                  to narrow it to any one approach, standard, or form of evaluation. Disaster might
                  very well be interchangeable with other terms such as “catastrophe,”
                  “cataclysm,” “ruin,” “destruction,” or
                  “trauma.” Indeed, trauma studies in particular has had a generative
                  effect on romantic scholarship, especially attempts to think through the
                  relationships between affect and historical consciousness. As critics such as
                  Jerome Christensen and Mary Favret, David L. Clark, and Marc Redfield have taught
                  us, much of what we call romanticism emerged under the stormclouds of eighteenth-
                  and early nineteenth-century warfare - a scene of violence that exceeds any
                  Malthusian calculus of population loss in warfare, famine, or plague, that points
                  to a more fundamental disorientation. According to Favret, the
                  “everyday” life of the romantic literature was itself constituted by a
                  sensitivity to battles far away but always experientially at hand, “a
                  literature saturated by the awareness, conscious or unconscious, of a world lost
                  to war . . . the pained effort to bind what is present and familiar with another
                  reality, absent and destructive” (Favret 158, 159). Favret’s <title level="m">War At a Distance</title> is one powerful response to the sense of
                  unknowable crises that romantic writers shouldered, and we take her scholarship as
                  an impetus for exploring in the following pages <emph>what</emph> forms of change
                  on the Enlightenment landscapes (both hospitable and inhospitable) can be
                  described as disastrous and for what reasons. For Favret, trauma becomes the
                  operative model through which to read how historical knowledge is encrypted within
                  literary form as “unclaimed experience” (to cite Cathy Caruth’s
                  influential book). Like melancholy or paranoia, trauma has become the model par
                  excellence of a romantic historicism embedded by a knowing that it cannot fully
                  grasp. (See Pfau, <title level="m">Romantic Moods</title>.) In this way, traumatic
                  experience is by definition acquired involuntarily by <emph>not</emph> confronting
                  it.</p>
                  <p>But what if the consequences or “experience” of a disaster were less
                  about psychic survival than an unblinking desire to face down the disaster as a
                  challenge to normative structures? As Terada notes, what if the propulsion to
                  overcome disasters overleaps the healing effort and precisely misses their larger
                  point: “Transition, and specifically one’s own change in it, is the
                  main thing that it is necessary to ‘endure.’” Our employment of
                  “disaster” partially signals Badiou’s differentiation (in our
                  epigraph) of the <foreign>désastre</foreign> from the <foreign>des
                     être</foreign>, a differentiation, that is, between a (dis)orientation
                  towards the truth-event and a destructive non-being that nullifies the capacity to
                  respond to the event in the first place. This power to nullify may be registered
                  in part by gestures that, in attempting to respond, encounter the impossibility of
                  doing so; producing figures of potential survival, they discover that such figures
                  instead enable the ruins themselves to survive, personifying how <foreign>ê
                     tre</foreign> has become, and has always been, the face of a more pervasive
                     <foreign>des ê tre</foreign>, a desolation that endures through us even as
                  we endure it. To fully face this radical fault in being, then, may require passing
                  beyond the thought of trauma to conceive of a state that is not interrupted by
                  crisis and does not seek to recover from it - a state that renounces even the
                  redemptive narrative encrypted in the very notion of trauma.</p>
                  <p>If this is so, we might start to think of romanticism and disaster as indelibly
                  linked by virtue of the fact that the conceptual mobility of the latter term has
                  often spelled for critics of all stripes (deconstructive, historicist, formalist)
                  a catachrestic movement of critical ruination that defines a theory of
                  Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment modernity already damaged at its very core.
                  In this way, to think of romanticism disastrously is to begin to question the
                  successes of “modernity.” As Thomas Pfau has shown, romantic modernity
                  is often conceived as a “cosmic miscarriage” (<title level="a">Philosophy of Shipwreck</title> 951) symptomatic of the bureaucratized and
                  professionalized disciplinary conceptions of knowledge through which we have
                  ourselves become at once its bearers and critics. Like Wordsworth’s pedlar
                  who signals for Dorothy a ruin at both the psychic and textual levels, emphases on
                  voluntaristic models of agency are often undercut by an inoperative negativity
                  that they fail to fully erase because their structure is already determined by
                  what Blanchot has called a <foreign>désoeuvrement</foreign> at the heart of
                  their labors. Himself a theorist of disaster, Blanchot will insist that this
                  seemingly untraceable, unapprehendable negation is already there in the
                  constructed surfaces of the world—an impossibility of writing that
                  nevertheless conditions writing always to respond to that excess or non-identity
                  which cannot be represented, felt, or recognized in spite of the fact that we
                  already are inhabitants of disasters that have already occurred: “The
                  disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving everything intact. It does not
                  touch anyone in particular…It is in this way that I am threatened; it is in this
                  way that the disaster threatens in me that which is exterior to me—an other
                  than I who passively become other” (1). </p>
                  <p>As William Keach argues, to attend to the rhetorical, epistemological, political,
                  and social effects of romantic critique is to consider how processes of
                  destruction and reconstitution, ruination and survival, are part and parcel of
                  romanticism’s grappling with this inoperative negativity, or what Tilottama
                  Rajan has called "an unusable negativity" (<title level="a">Mary Shelley's <title level="m">Matilda</title>
                     </title> 44), a negativity that haunts it at every
                  turn. Put in this way, for us "disaster" does not signal a referential event,
                  despite the historical sequence from which it arose, but rather a condition to
                  which that sequence leads, an undoing of certain apparently prior categories:
                  subjectivity, community, “world.” That undoing continues to resonate
                  today in our own registering of contemporary devastation. In a review essay on New
                  Orleans and Hurricane Katrina, Lloyd Pratt has perspicaciously asked, was
                  “the fate overtaking New Orleans an exceptional or an exemplary one? Was
                  this gruesome spectacle of life stripped bare something in excess of the everyday,
                  or did it in fact recapitulate the new shape of American society?” (251).
                  What is at stake in Pratt’s questions is how to positively bear and process,
                  under the most intolerable of circumstances, the magnitude of a disaster that
                  exceeds nominal definitions and whose effects challenge the reparative desires of
                  all social, cultural, political, and psychic structures. Neither example nor
                  exception, “Katrina” refers to an incapacity that inscribes its own
                  name, an incapacity to posit anything identifiably part of our past or present
                  sense of what a disaster might be, and how to respond to it. If anything,
                  “Katrina” signals an event, in Badiou’s sense: the irruption of
                  an utterly new occurrence within a situation to which we have no prior knowledge
                  or anticipation. The disastrous event, then, is neither eschatological nor
                  transcendental: it is a movement of thought that calls upon us to reflect and act
                  upon that which we cannot know but ultimately <emph>must</emph> bear. </p>
                  <p>Insofar as disaster is not a referential event but an undoing of certain
                  categories, it ultimately undermines any attempt to explain it as a dimension of a
                  familiar history or to interpret it within the terms of any received
                  historiography. To be sure, as we have argued above, the thought of disaster
                     <emph>as</emph> this undoing emerges within a certain history, but precisely as
                  a turn upon the discourses it inherits from that history, a turn that ultimately
                  suggests that disaster floats free of any determining moment, or more radically
                  lays bare a certain nontemporal negativity at the heart of modern historicity
                  itself. In that case, the continuing resonances of romanticism's reflections on
                  disaster in the wake of 9/11 and Katrina, as we have suggested above, suggests
                  that what romanticism records is in some sense still contemporary with our own
                  experience, that the sequence of periods and historical transformations coincide
                  with an inoperable negativity that renders each era a further iteration of an
                  unassimilable event. This strange temporality of disaster links romanticism as
                  well with the condition that arises within the debris of Hiroshima and Auschwitz,
                  an affiliation that has been registered variously by Frances Ferguson, Geoffrey
                  Hartman, and Sara Guyer - an affiliation, however, that does not privilege
                  romanticism as the first mode of writing to broach these themes nor post-Holocaust
                  discourse as their most knowing treatment.</p>
                  <p>But as we suggested a moment ago, even this disabling of familiar modes of
                  historical and chronological mapping arises from an anterior ruining of evidence,
                  of the citation of example or exception. An excellent example of such a ruining
                  emerges already in "Mont Blanc," where Shelley meditates on the relationship
                  between ruin, instruction, and exemplarity in a passage we will quote at length,
                  if only to reread in a new key: <quote>

                  taught her young / Ruin? Were these their toys?” Mont Blanc here is posited
                  as an example, but the question of <emph>what</emph> it taught already destroys
                  the possibility of registering the place of that pedagogy in the first place
                  because the contextual “scene” of that instruction has already been
                  forgotten. Teaching ruin is already a process of ruination from which there is no
                  objective outside: the disastrous pedagogy of the mountain suffers from an
                  illusion of exceptionality and a failure of example: “Or did a sea / Of fire
                  envelop once this silent snow? / None can reply—all seems eternal now." This
                  erasure of exemplarity also undoes the respondent's confidence in himself as an
                  example of a responsive subject, whether rendered as his individuality or the
                  coordinates of his orientation to this scene: his spirit vanishes before a force
                  that blows from a space he cannot locate, causing him to blend with a
                  destructiveness that would annihilate him were he to attempt to survive intact.
                  Furthermore, it frays even the privileged categories we might expect to underlie
                  any mere example, for the "bare" world that appears with the erasure of human
                  details is itself "scarred" and "riven," as if being itself sustains an infinite
                  wound. In such passages, romanticism registers a baffled awareness that it cannot
                  teach the lessons of such an encounter, cannot use disaster to found another
                  positive discursive regime, cannot even formulate a new hauntology of <emph>des
                     ê tre</emph>, but can only evoke it through texts that explore the terrain
                  of their own defeat.</p>
                  <p>The four essays in this special issue all concentrate, in different ways, on
                  disastrous conceptualizations of a romantic modernity whose innovative aptitudes
                  are belied by a felt struggle to come to terms with a ruin that refuses to be
                  overcome, a struggle in which the possibility of survival devolves into delayed
                  reaction, resignation, defeat, and critical endurance. Scott Juengel's essay,
                     <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft's Perpetual Disaster</title>, reads those
                  moments in the <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in
                     Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796) in which Wollstonecraft cribs from
                  that quintessential Enlightenment genre, the conjectural history, to imagine
                  future disasters and grieve for losses yet to come. Taking his cue from William
                  Godwin's comment that her prejudices suffered a "vehement concussion" from the
                  events of the French Revolution, Juengel argues that these moments of disastrous
                  affect register a traumatic apprehension she cannot otherwise articulate - not
                  even in her <title level="m">Historical and Moral View of the Origins and Progress
                     of the French Revolution</title> (1794). Devastated by a wounding realization
                  of revolutionary hope, Wollstonecraft is "[h]aunted by what was to have been the
                  future," and weaves "the time of revolutionary politics with what we might call
                  'species time,' resulting in forms of untimeliness that figure as disaster without
                  end." Her sense of this disaster, so threatening to the value of individual lives,
                  is attuned to the discovery of a planetary "deep time" that took place in the
                  decades before and after the 1790s and to the prospect, articulated two years
                  later by Malthus, of an ongoing "disaster of sensation and feeling that
                  paradoxically moves the species toward life rather than death." Moreover, such a
                  speculative leap into the future is defended in Kant's <title level="a">Conjectures on the Beginning of Human History</title> and finds its parallel
                  in his writing on perpetual peace, where he imagines a world free of war —
                  or devastated by a peace that transpires after a war without remainder. Even her
                  apparent turn in the opposite direction, when she imagines that the sparsely
                  populated landscape of Sweden speaks of human origins, may indicate her
                  melancholic reflections on the "possibility of renewal" within the imagined ruins
                  of the future. Yet all these untimely reflections may enable her to avoid
                  confronting the disasters of the present, such as the consequences of the fire
                  that destroyed large portions of Copenhagen just before her arrival there; the
                  thought of disaster, she suggests, would relieve her from the task of treading on
                  "live ashes," on ills not yet reduced to scenes in fancy. Ultimately, Juengel
                  argues, these movements of disastrous thought may all speak of what Reinhardt
                  Koselleck describes as the radical temporalization of revolutionary time, a
                  temporalization to which Wollstonecraft ultimately responds with a generous
                  passivity, with a more-than-Kantian hospitality to disaster itself. Juengel's
                  searching essay provokes us to suggest that if Wollstonecraft exemplifies a
                  traumatic untimeliness characteristic of our modernity, her willingness to remain
                  hospitable to disaster may exemplify with equal force an ethics for the ruins.</p>
                  <p>In his contribution to this collection, William Keach explores a similarly dense
                  affiliation of statements made roughly two decades later, at another moment of
                  great affective intensity. His essay, <title level="a">The Ruins of Empire and the
                     Contradictions of Restoration: Barbauld, Byron, Hemans</title>, explores how
                  Regency ruin culture developed at once as the apogee and the ambivalently
                  repressive (and repressed) symptom of British imperialism, articulating the
                  nuances of “Britain’s role in determining the trajectory of the
                  Napoleonic imperial project at moments unstably situated between triumph and
                  catastrophe, commercial and military pre-eminence and social crisis.”
                  Working through Walter Benjamin's comments on ruination in <title level="m">The
                     Arcades Project</title>, Keach marks out how the difference between a
                  “canonical” and “critical” ruin culture depends on
                  gestures of delayed fascination tempered by an “awakening” that throws
                  the ruin into sudden critical knowledge. For Keach, the ruin is indelibly coupled
                  to restoration, thus producing a double movement of destruction and reconstruction
                  that not only operates separately, but is intrinsic to the ideology of the ruin.
                  As fragment, the ruin figures as a remainder of other cultures newly
                  “acquired” and transmuted into the mournful excesses that haunt their
                  reinstallment in pre- and post-Waterloo Britain. Even more, it either constitutes
                  a celebratory surplus that hints at renovation or offers itself as unyielding
                  matter—the debris of political and social violence. Thus ruins
                  “presuppose survival and materialize it; restoration seeks to sustain the
                  survival of ruins, but in doing so imperfectly arrests and undoes both ruin and
                  survival.” In Byron’s <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                     Pilgrimage</title>, ruin emerges as cultural property that harkens to the
                  catastrophes of European warfare, but it is also a feature of Harold himself who
                  figures for a perverse internalization and enactment of ruination. The diverse
                  rhetorical plays and critiques Byron mounts against Regency life display a
                  powerful critical project: “Byron turns our attention towards the revered
                  monuments of ancient empire not to debunk their affective force <emph>in the
                     present</emph> but to redirect that force towards an awakened sense of how they
                  may be read as commentaries <emph>on the present</emph>.” Similarly,
                  Barbauld’s <title level="m">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</title>, the spoils
                  of British imperialism are evoked as traces of a ceaseless wartime, and rather
                  than gesture proleptically at a future to come that is inscribed by past
                  greatness, Barbauld imagines a waning future that institutionalizes ruins
                     <emph>as</emph> anachronistic remnants, thus shortcircuiting the forward
                  propulsion of post-Waterloo political life. By contrast, in Felicia Hemans’s
                     <title level="m">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</title> — a
                  poem Byron read and admired — the British seizure of Italian artifacts is
                  conceived to be part of a dubiously optimistic political agenda, where the ruin is
                  both “confirmed” and “confined” by Hemans’s
                  narrative linking of destruction, survival, and restoration. As Keach charts the
                  repressed historical materiality that haunts the poem, he notes that “for
                  political and ethical as well as aesthetic reasons, Rome needs to remain in ruins;
                  any prospect of a phoenix-like rise from its ashes would compromise its
                  distinctive value <emph>as</emph> ruin—and also threaten Britain’s
                  ascendancy as Europe’s new imperial champion of restoration.” </p>
                  <p>What follows in the wake of thinking oppositely about ruin, survival, and
                  restoration? How can one think with, rather than against, disaster? Timothy
                  Morton’s <title level="a">Romantic Disaster Ecology: Blake, Shelley,
                     Wordsworth</title> explicitly reflects on romantic models of (ecological)
                  knowing that take disaster as a part of their framework and the consequences of
                  these structural choices. If mainstream ecological thinking is disaster prone in
                  its visions of apocalyptic meltdowns and universal heat-deaths, then, according to
                  Morton, ecology is construed as the perfect consequence (rather than antithesis)
                  of global capitalism which depends upon futural projections of destruction that
                  produce an unworkable state of exception. The critical difference lies precisely
                  in how and why one wants to think through disaster: the traumatic possibility of
                  something yet-to-come postpones a consideration of how our life-worlds are already
                  shaped by catastrophe. In fact, disaster ecology potentially absents the world in
                  favor of expectations of destruction that obviate the real effects of ecological
                  damage that already define us. In the process, they also reify the
                  “environment” as a preserved artifact that is distinctly separate from
                  our own lives. “[I]s there another way to think, without disaster, a
                  non-disastrous thinking, that isn't just postponement?” Turning to Blake,
                  Wordsworth, and Shelley, Morton describes three approaches that variously posit
                  and critically re-imagine <emph>what</emph> ecological thought beyond disaster
                  might be. Indeed, Wordsworth emerges as enabling poetic forms of listening that
                  emerge in tandem with the evocation of catastrophe, and in this sense, Morton
                  suggests that the aesthetic contributes to subjective, epistemological, and social
                  formation in a way that exposes our ecological relationality <emph>through</emph>
                  the disasters that supposedly interrupt thinking, but nevertheless inscribe our
                  sociality through and through.</p>
                  <p>The difficult prospect of thinking disaster in a mode that is not postponement,
                  that takes the measure of something already taking place, raises questions that
                  were of central and abiding interest to Hegel. In her essay, <title level="a">Hegel's Bearings</title>, Rei Terada ponders Hegel's style of "tarrying with
                  the negative," particularly with the narrowing of political possibility in German
                  territories both under Napoleonic liberalization and after Waterloo. In
                  correspondence with his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, who states his wish
                  to persist in fighting a losing cause even - or especially - if he is the "last
                  man" to do so, as if to find sustenance in his inability to bear his dark times.
                  Hegel bears up in another manner, seeking a middle way that "<emph>allows</emph>
                  nothing to get too bad and nothing too good." Rather than trusting himself to a
                  truly open history, Terada argues, Hegel protects the civic life of the middle
                  class, but in doing so he also carries through on a philosophy in which "another
                  middle, the middle of transition, always rules the world." Drawing on a
                  description of a dream Hegel sends to his friend, in which "a certain realist
                  calculation and foresight is implicit," his critique of "the mirror reifications
                  of empiricism and idealism" in the <title level="m">Logic</title>, and his account
                  in the <title level="m">Encyclopedia</title> of how the subject, reading every
                  negativity that comes from outside as actually from inside, can become "a being
                  capable of containing and enduring its own contradiction," Terada shows how Hegel
                  becomes a "privileged figure of the new dispensation," someone capable of enduring
                  "the horizonless condition of an antipolitical society that extends from the late
                  Napoleonic era to our own." By identifying the transitional movement of his
                  philosophy with reality itself, Hegel as a result assimilates the grayness of his
                  times into his own thought. For Hegel, disaster is "being unable to shake one's
                  presentation of a situation as unbearable," yet by proposing that the subject
                  might absorb any eventuality into its mode of endless transition, he constructs a
                  model of pathological health, a subject for which <emph>nothing</emph> would
                  ultimately be a disaster. This impasse, Terada suggests, "persists to the present
                  day." </p>
                  <p>Is it possible that by further reflection we might work our way past this and
                  other impasses to a new possibility? Or is a certain impotence of thought inherent
                  to dwelling in the ruins, much as, for Shelley, disaster erases any lesson we
                  might learn from it? Does the undoing of certain categories (community, world)
                  erase the prospect of a politics for the ruins, or does a critical reading of the
                  ruin - and a hospitality to disaster itself - offer us a glimpse of another mode
                  of collective engagement? Does the attempt to render disaster into discourse
                  reproduce it, making us, like the pedlar, instances of what we would describe? Or
                  might our reflections at least delineate the contours of our untimeliness, opening
                  up the prospect of thinking otherwise? The persistence of these questions
                  challenges our thoughts and expectations as well as our states of belonging,
                  whether it be our age or another. This intense, unblinking openness inspires our
                  contributors, for whom romanticism is at least partially the most pressing
                  instance of multiple confrontations with what Adorno and Horkheimer referred to as
                  the “disaster triumphant” of modernity in the <title level="m">Dialectic of Enlightenment</title> (3), but with the difference that
                  post-eighteenth-century thought is not merely to be defined by a violent
                  attenuation of its commitments, but rather by a brooding, infinitely complex, and
                  aggressive critical aliveness to the ways in which the un-thought of our common
                  life is perpetually shadowed by its failures. That failure, however, spells out
                  occasions to think about what it means to get by, as it were, or live on amidst
                  the mere ruin of things—to perceive, hold on, and not look away—to
                  have faith in the reminder that the disaster has a right or a value in and of
                  itself, and one <emph>must</emph> dwell in it rather than leave it behind.</p>

                  <p>Our world appears to be on the brink of disaster, an appearance that is itself
                  disastrous. The disaster of disaster is that disaster is everywhere, all the time:
                  while on the one hand it appears obvious that disaster should be the exception
                  that proves the rule of a generally non-disastrous world, in actuality no
                  non-disastrous moment arrives. Like a deer in the headlights, thinking is
                  paralyzed by disaster. Whether this is strictly a function of modernity, beginning
                  with the Romantic period, or whether it is a function of disaster as such remains
                  to be seen. But what Naomi Klein accurately, but not thoroughly, calls “the
                  shock doctrine” is the capitalist norm: the state of exception is capitalist
                  reality. For Klein, capitalists fleece the rest of us when they need a whip-round.
                  For Marxism, this is the normal state of affairs, the deep structure of capitalism
                  as such, which must keep on accumulating more money in order to exist. And perhaps
                  it is also the reality of actually existing socialism: to avert the imminent
                  disaster in capitalism, a socialist emergency must be declared. </p>
                  <p>It is possible, argue Žižek and Badiou, that ecology is simply the
                  latest version of capitalist disaster ideology at work. <note place="foot" resp="editors">See for example Žižek, <title level="m">Tragedy</title>; <ref target="http://www.lacan.com/zizecology1.htm">http://www.lacan.com/zizecology1.htm</ref>; <ref target="http://www.lacan.com/Žižekecologyvideo.html">http://www.lacan.com/Žižekecologyvideo.html</ref>.</note> For
                  instance, to ward off what is still seen (weirdly) as an imminent disaster of
                  global warming, it is entirely likely that a green bubble based on derivatives of
                  the existing carbon trading market will eventually eclipse the recent implosion of
                  global capital. (This is weird because science keeps telling us that the
                  disastrous climate change has already occurred and that we are now living in its
                  aftermath.) Nevertheless, truly to think what I call <emph>the ecological
                     thought</emph> (and I believe that there is a thinking that is truthful here)
                  is to recalibrate what we mean by disaster, such that ecological thinking and
                  practice must entail dropping the imminence of disaster, with its resulting states
                  of exception. This thinking would be non-disastrous both in content and in form. </p>
                  <p>Take plutonium for instance: a disaster that has already occurred, and one that
                  will continue for at least 24 100 years. Just how many of those years do we think
                  will be capitalist? Do we seriously imagine that the end of the world is more
                  likely than the end of capitalism? Or consider global warming, the cause of the
                  Sixth Mass Extinction Event (there have been five since the beginning of life on
                  Earth). This is not a disaster waiting to happen. Atmospheric CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi> levels are now well above the safety ceiling of 350 parts per million
                  (ppm). Since Neolithic times, humans have lived under about 275ppm. Current levels
                  are around 387ppm and climbing by about 2ppm annually (350.org). Percy Shelley was
                  already talking about pollution in 1813: “the putrid atmosphere of crowded
                  cities; the exhalations of chemical processes” (Note 17 to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, 1.406–23 (411)). Or take petroleum: the product of whatever
                  disaster wiped out the dinosaurs (Žižek, <title level="m">Defense</title>, 441–442). Thinking of past disasters causes thinking to leak
                  out around the threat of imminent disaster, like water seeping through a badly
                  constructed dam. In the language of fighter pilots, disaster “cones
                  down” our attention to focus on a singularity that is strictly unthinkable. </p>
                  <p>We can visualize a time before and a time after disaster, in which disaster
                  remains as a fundamental category of our visualization. What about thinking beyond
                  disaster, or is thinking forever caught in disaster's shadow? Art imagines
                  post-apocalyptic worlds: Romanticism in particular is full of them, from Byron's
                     <title level="a">Darkness</title> to <title level="m">The Last Man</title>. Is
                  poetry, as Allen Grossman puts it, “the postponement of the end of the
                  world,” and how Romantic is this postponement (Grossman and Halliday 336)?
                  Or is there another way to think, without disaster, a non-disastrous thinking,
                  that isn't just postponement? And is there any Romantic literature that can help
                  us think this way? In this essay, I shall consider three writers who adopt three
                  quite different positions concerning disaster. Percy Shelley, argues the essay, is
                  fundamentally disaster-prone: despite his proclaimed anti-capitalism, and indeed
                  his objective usefulness to progressive and socialist thinking, his poetry even
                  anticipates some of the more recent moves of global capital. I shall argue that
                  Shelley did, to his credit, eventually figure out (at least on the level of
                  artistic form) that his poetic language was trapped in disaster mode. William
                  Blake satirizes the subject position from which disaster becomes visible, in his
                  special mode of ideology critique—part of his larger project of trying to
                  change the attitudes that come bundled with ideas such as disaster. William
                  Wordsworth emerges as a genuine poet of non-disaster, or post-disaster: his poetry
                  is perhaps the only one of the three still capable of performing something like
                  thinking while caught in disaster's headlights. </p>

                  <head>The Disaster of Disaster</head>
                  <p>Strictly speaking, ecology is a discourse of non-disaster. Disaster is literally
                  an unfortunate star (<emph>dis</emph> plus <emph>astron</emph>), an astrological
                  misfortune. This accident is a portent of things to come on Earth: <quote>

                        </lg> (<title level="m">Hamlet</title> 1.1.118) </quote> In order to have
                  disasters such as this, one needs an integrated world in which certain astral
                  phenomena are interpreted according to a stable key. The stars spatter the edges
                  of this world, illuminating it with their obscure but significant tracery,
                  patterned in recognizable constellations that are given rules for conjunction and
                  disjunction. Ecology is the collapse of astrology, and not simply because it
                  belongs to a “secular” era. Ecology abolishes the star-studded dome of
                  the world insofar as ecological science and ecological awareness force upon humans
                  the collapse of any significant background or horizon against which human activity
                  can be placed and measured (Heidegger 39–122; Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 94–101). Astrology turns the stars into significant documents,
                  legible texts. Ecological disasters are precisely not caused by the action of a
                  beyond, for in ecology, there is no beyond, no elsewhere, no “yonder,”
                  however remote. Life forms are made from their environments, including sunshine
                  and chemicals from exploding stars. There is no way rigidly to separate the
                  biosphere and the non-biosphere. If the Earth had no magnetic field, for instance,
                  life forms would be sizzled by solar winds: one good sign of extra-terrestrial
                  life is planets with magnetic fields. As if life, once it gets going, includes all
                  that goes around it and before it: terrestrial oxygen and iron are bi-products of
                  bacterial metabolism, and hills are made of crushed shells and bones.</p>
                  <p>In the technical literature of disaster management, an ecological disaster is
                  precisely an event for which “inside” resources do not suffice to
                  provide a remedy—help from “outside” must be brought in
                  (European Environmental Agency, “disaster”). <note place="foot" resp="editors">The International Disaster Database defines a disaster such that
                     at least one of the following occur: ten or more people are reported killed;
                     one hundred people are reported affected; a state of emergency is declared; a
                     call for international assistance is made.</note> This rather elegantly
                  encapsulates the problem—there remains no “inside,” or
                  everything is “inside” in the sense that there is no longer a beyond,
                  since the beyond is only legible on the horizon of a here and now. </p>
                  <p>We can only conclude, then, that “ecological disaster” is an oxymoron.
                  To what purpose? Paul Virilio predicted a long while ago that environmental
                  threats would allow the state to stage rehearsals for military and industrial
                  displays of power (Virilio). This is not congruent with ecological reality. The
                  trouble with ecological awareness is that it is drastically non-teleological. Life
                  science has demonstrated that life as such has no fixed, rigid origin: this is the
                  lesson of the ironically titled <title level="m">The Origin of Species</title>, in
                  which Darwin successfully undermines every possible biological distinction
                  (species versus species, species versus variant, variant versus monstrosity, and
                  so on) (Darwin, <title level="m">Origin</title>, 34, 94, 100, 109, 131, 133, 141).
                  The rhetoric of disaster is the tropology of an absolute end, a sudden misfortune.
                  How sudden is the half-life of plutonium: what is the span of that disaster? Does
                  it have peaks and troughs? When did the disaster called global warming begin? Is
                  it at all possible to say with a straight face that on a certain date at a certain
                  time, a threshold will have been crossed that guarantees the arrival of
                  apocalyptic catastrophe? </p>
                  <p>There is a rhetoric of catastrophe in which the narrator overleaps apocalypse
                  altogether. It is as if one could watch a video of one's own funeral. Of course,
                  literature enables us to fantasize this all the time: the act of narrating in the
                  first person is just this kind of doubling. But the totality of global ecological
                  disaster, of which one consequence might be human extinction (as in Mary Shelley's
                     <title level="m">The Last Man</title>), means that there is strictly no one
                  around in the future to watch any videos whatsoever. The ghostly presence of
                  ourselves, spectators to a future in which we do not strictly exist, can only be
                  vicarious at best and is often sadistic. Elegies for deaths that have not yet
                  occurred, they mourn for the still living in a way that only repeats the dreaded
                  dualism of subject and object that many environmentalists see as public enemy
                  number one. For the subject who is reading the elegy is different from the subject
                  whose death is being witnessed, even if they have the same name, and are to some
                  extent the same person. Radically different: separated by an ontological firewall,
                  indeed, such that ecological elegy is a form of the Cretan liar paradox (“I
                  am lying”). <note place="foot" resp="editors">For further discussion
                     see Morton, <title level="a">Dark Ecology.</title>
                     </note> Byron's <title level="a">Darkness</title> manages this uncanny doubling by
                  staging disaster as a dream. Shelley's <title level="m">The Last Man</title>
                  imagines a further future in which some people come across the story.
                  Nevertheless, in both cases, part of the pleasure of works such as these is that
                  one can't help thinking for a moment that one is voyeuristically privy to a future
                  in which one does not exist. </p>
                  <p>The ideology and the rhetoric of ecological disaster, then, have nothing to do
                  with actual ecology. They are “environmentalist” in the same sense as
                  some ideas about gender are sexist. That is, they set up the environment as a
                  metaphysical construct on a pedestal, torn down, built up, worshipped, admired as
                  an aesthetic object, and so on. Aesthetic images of the environment are predicated
                  on disaster: we are shown we want to avert it; we are compelled to imagine it
                  vividly. This seems like a truism: recordings of whale sounds and Douglas Adams's
                  book <title level="m">Last Chance to See</title> would not have appeared if
                  human-caused extinction were not on the cards (<ref target="#WC">see Works
                     Cited</ref>). It is always unfortunate when reality coincides with fantasy. The
                  trouble is not so much the quite legitimate wish to preserve species from dying
                  out through human misuse. The problem is in the attitude engendered in the
                  disaster narratives we keep telling ourselves. For at least one of these attitudes
                  happens to provide some strong cement for the maintenance of an oppressive status
                  quo. </p>
                  <p>If we are going to think ecology beyond capitalism, we shall need to think beyond
                  disaster and beyond disaster speak. It would be preferable to refer to ecological
                  difficulty as a “drag,” in both performative and work-related senses.
                  Ecological difficulty will beset us for the long run, perhaps forever (whatever
                  that means). And ecology is profoundly a view that accommodates display,
                  performance, sheer aesthetic illusion (for example in Darwin's theory of sexual
                  selection), and so on (Darwin, <title level="m">Descent</title>). Take the
                  evolutionary notion of “satisficing.” A rabbit is not really a rabbit.
                  It is not that a rabbit by any other name would act as nose-twitchy. All the way
                  down, there is no rabbit, no rabbit flavored DNA. And all the way up: rabbits act
                  like rabbits, and thus pass on their genome. This is called
                  “satisficing,” a form of performativity (Dawkins 156). If a life form
                  does its thing without dying, its descendant can keep whatever it does. The fact
                  that homosexuals exist across a vast array of sexually reproducing life forms, for
                  instance, indicates that evolution has no problem with them. In fact, heterosexual
                  behavior floats on top of a vast ocean of cloning, transgender switching,
                  homosexuality and intersexuality (Roughgarden). A genome could not care less if
                  its vehicle acts like someone else's idea of a rabbit. This includes having
                  mutations that not all rabbits might have. There is no essence called race, or
                  gender, or species—or environment. Thus there is no fixed gender against
                  which “deviations” are measured as disastrous. </p>
                  <p>Ultimately, thinking ecology beyond disaster means thinking ecology without
                  nature; and even thinking ecology without environmentalism. Looked at one way,
                  evolution is a long history of disasters, such as extinction: which is to say,
                  since disaster is everywhere, it is of no cosmic significance. Ecological
                  awareness demands that we care for ourselves and nonhumans on time and space
                  scales far in excess of the usual parameters, even if the parameters are based on
                  modified forms of self interest that include greater numbers under the umbrella of
                  “kith and kin” (Parfit, 355–357, 361, 371–377; Morton, <title level="a">Hyperobjects</title>). It just does not make sense to try and find
                  self-interest-based reasons to care for a “hyperobject” such as
                  plutonium 239, which has a half-life of 24 100 years: what a drag. The kind of
                  excitement demanded by disaster tropology will not serve us well. We need
                  something like Wordsworth with his adverse reaction to the “gross and
                  violent stimulants” of his literary age (Wordsworth, <title level="a">Preface,</title> 746).</p>

                  <head>Percy Shelley</head>
                  <p>Are there archaeological remnants of oxymoronic “disaster ecology” in
                  the British Romantic period? And do these remains contain anything like a
                  critique? Percy Shelley is forever thinking of planetary and solar disaster. He
                  favors the global over the local in a way that would scandalize the typical
                  Romantic ecocritic. For this very reason his writing seems apt for an era of
                  global warming. The poetry performs aesthetically what ecological damage and
                  global positioning technology perform in the real, swallowing horizons and worlds
                  (Morton, <title level="a">Shelley's Green Desert</title>). This disorientation is
                  indeed disastrous, a symptom of a general collapse of local reference points. </p>
                  <p>A few disastrous stars appear as such in Shelley's poetry. <note place="foot" resp="editors">A brief search of ABELL confirms this. </note> Of

                     </note> Yet there are disasters
                  closer to home, having to do with the Sun and Moon, taken as figures for the brute
                  ideological force of geocentric common sense—the cosmology of despotic
                  theism. These fluctuate somewhere between the pathetic fallacy and an earlier,
                  classicist tropology of nature echoing human weal and woe, as when in elegy the

                     </quote> It's standard Shelleyan procedure to work emblematically, to depict
                  revolution according to the operations of celestial mechanisms. In a massive
                  expansion of the classical messenger speech (much of <title level="m">Hellas</title> works this way), the workings of history are played out as
                  astronomical portents. Hassan curses Greece using the hyperbolic language of
                  disaster: “Famine and Pestilence / And Panic” (439–440) will ensue
                  wherever “dews fall, or the angry sun look down / With poisoned light”
                  (438–439). Naturally, this language is framed by the encompassing vision of
                  Enlightenment, of stars beyond sun and moon threatening the heliocentric world of
                  a corrupt God and the dark theodicy of “The tempest of the Omnipotence of
                  God / Which sweeps all things to their appointed doom” (449–450).</p>
                  <p>The classical tropology of the globe was already out of date: some more up to date
                  poetry turned to what I've called the poetics of spice, the capitalist advertising
                  language that weaves together Earth's far flung corners via trade routes and
                  precious commodities (Morton, <title level="m">Spice</title> 39–108). Shelley was
                  well aware of this new menu of poetic devices, and used them frequently and
                  knowingly in allusions to Milton, one of their first great exponents. The poetics
                  of spice is significantly not a poetics of disaster but of continued and
                  undisturbed flow: a fantasy of luxury that airbrushed the ongoing disaster of
                  slavery and colonialism out of the global picture, rather like an Archer Daniels
                  Midland <title level="a">Supermarket to the World</title> advert today. Although
                  knowing this may upset the environmentalist apple cart, the first stirrings of
                  global awareness came from the heart of commercial capitalist fantasy, not from
                  within opposition to capitalism. </p>
                  <p>Shelley, however, needed to think and imagine how it had all gone so wrong. He was
                  deeply aware of how the poetics of spice was tainted by commerce, and often uses
                  it perhaps rather too forcefully to make this very point. Unable to theorize fully
                  how disaster is intrinsic to capitalism (he writes it off as a rapacious,
                  excessive farcical repetition of aristocratic power), Shelley resorted to language
                  that talks about the disturbing of a fundamental balance. In this he shares much
                  with contemporary anti-capitalist writing such as Naomi Klein's. Yet Shelley is
                  perhaps unique for the deadly seriousness with which he articulates the imbalance.
                  This becomes a matter of scientific and philosophical positing, not just
                  rhetorical play. For Shelley, Earth was a perpetual disaster, in the precise
                  astrological sense: a mishap in a planetary body. Earth's axis is bent. This
                  terrestrial disaster was caused by human injustice, including the eating of animal
                  flesh. In the utopian future, the Earth's axis is righted and the planet orbits
                  “straight up” around the sun. Ironically, Shelley's evidence for the
                  disaster, and its solution, is a snapshot of what later became known as
                  continental drift and climate change. Note 10 on two lines of his early poem

                     of obliquity, points. It is exceedingly probable, from many considerations,
                     that this obliquity will gradually diminish, until the equator coincides with
                     the ecliptic: the nights and days will then become equal on the earth
                     throughout the year, and probably the seasons also. There is no great
                     extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the
                     poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect; or that there should be a
                     perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human
                     species. It is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease, and that, in
                     the present state of the climates of the earth, health, in the true and
                     comprehensive sense of the word, is out of the reach of civilized man.
                     Astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress, and that the poles
                     are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic. The strong
                     evidence afforded by the history of mythology, and geological researches, that
                     some event of this nature has taken place already, affords a strong presumption
                     that this progress is not merely an oscillation, as has been surmised by some
                     late astronomers. Bones of animals peculiar to the torrid zone have been found
                     in the north of Siberia, and on the banks of the river Ohio. Plants have been
                     found in the fossil state in the interior of Germany, which demand the present
                     climate of Hindostan for their production. The researches of M. Bailly
                     establish the existence of a people who inhabited a tract in Tartary 49º north
                     latitude, of greater antiquity than either the Indians, the Chinese, or the
                     Chaldeans, from whom these nations derive their sciences and theology. We find,
                     from the testimony of ancient writers, that Britain, Germany, and France were
                     much colder than at present, and that their great rivers were annually frozen
                     over. Astronomy teaches us also that since this period the obliquity of the
                     earth's position has been considerably diminished. (<title level="m">Poems</title>, 1.373–374) </quote> Extraordinarily, then, borrowing from
                  the ideas of Laplace and Cabanis, Shelley holds that a more just human society
                  will literally rebalance Earth's axis. Shelley thus produced countless images we
                  now associate with the photograph <title level="a">Earthrise,</title> the image of
                  a fragile blue Earth from the Moon popularized by Al Gore. Shelley wants
                  desperately to achieve a point of view that is big enough in time and space to
                  account for disaster: as Archimedes' epigraph to <title level="m">Queen
                     Mab</title> puts it, “Give me somewhere to stand and I will move the
                  Earth.” And he means it. He literally means that Earth's axis can be
                  corrected through progressive cultural and political praxis. The trouble is
                  Shelley finds it almost impossible to imagine transformation without disaster: the
                  fortunate disaster of the moving of Earth itself is sure to be tremendous,
                  shuddering life forms, not a peaceful working out of some inner logic. Transitions
                  from disaster to peace resound with the grinding of rhetorical gears. Thus in
                     <title level="m">Laon and Cythna</title> everyone fights everyone else until
                  someone yells for it to stop; immediately following the carnage, the people stage
                  a pacifist, vegetarian festival (Morton, <title level="m">Shelley</title>
                  110–116). This implies that everyone has within them the capacity to hear the
                  compassion and reason within the yelling, and the capacity to turn on a dime to
                  act on these impulses. Yet these capacities are precisely not there: why else
                  would Earth's axis be so kinked? Shelley wants transitions that are precisely
                  un-kinky, but what he gives us is, on the figurative level at least, maximal kink. </p>
                  <p>Earth-righting justice includes proto-feminism, atheism, democracy, some form of
                  non-capitalist economy, and vegetarianism. The sound minds in sound bodies who
                  will enjoy this future state will live in harmony with their world, conceived not
                  as a patchwork of localities, but as a genuine globality, as Book 9 of <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> makes clear: “Oh Happy Earth! Reality of
                  Heaven!” (9.1). Shelley's somewhat future-primitive imagery imagines the
                  future state as a blissful global village in which nonhumans “sport
                  around” human habitations, in a rewriting of Isaiah 11 that strikes us now
                  as rather New Agey (<title level="m">The Daemon of the World</title>, 444). For
                  instance, the following passage strikingly situates the future humans on a
                  republican lawn, level and smooth like the metaphorical level playing field: <quote>

                  Biblical millenarianism and utterly sincere Enlightenment nonviolence and reason
                  produces the almost psychedelic image of the baby feeding the “green and
                  golden basilisk” with its friendly tongue (8.86). It is one of Shelley's
                  many vivid synecdochic sketches for a peaceful world whose every corner looks like
                  this. This is a world without disaster, whose disasters are all past. The happy
                  future people can look up to the sky and know that everything has been set
                  right—not by some <foreign>deus ex machina</foreign>, to be sure, but by
                  their own hands and brains. The world has a center—the human habitation,
                  represented minimally by the “mother's door” (8.84), around which
                  spreads the rest of Earth's inhabitants in what appear to be concentric circles
                  derived from Pope's <title level="m">Essay on Man</title> (3.27, 49–52).
                  Vegetarianism serves as a hook (in Lacanian, a “point de caption”)
                  that links individual impulses to social welfare, and human society to nature,
                  seeming to ground the future in something we can practice right now (3.147–67). </p>
                  <p>Yet while in Pope there is a reactionary knowingness that disaster continues,
                  Shelley truly wants to image a time without disaster, figured as a time of no meat
                  eating (not even for the lions) that we can achieve by not eating meat, among
                  other things. For Shelley, the Garden of Eden is a future state. Human being is
                  and has been a disaster, beginning with the Promethean (technological, that is)
                  disaster of cooking animal food. Thus at the end of <title level="m">Prometheus
                     Unbound</title> the Earth herself is finally able to articulate how disastrous
                  violence is transfigured: </p>

                  <p>The trouble is, how do we get to the future Eden? As argued just above, this would
                  require the very state of mind (the nonviolent, non-disastrous one) that Shelley
                  reckons is unavailable to us in our disastrous present. All right then, try
                  vegetarianism in the mean time. But here the problem repeats itself: in order to
                  become vegetarian, one must be nonviolent (Morton, <title level="m">Shelley</title> 126–169). Vegetarianism also presupposes the mindset it claims
                  to generate. This recursion is evidence of ideology at work. Shelley is in a bind
                  because he cannot think past disaster. How do you convince the unconscious
                  (Demogorgon), which has no sense of time, to behave differently—to imagine
                  things differently? Shelley's progressive political view wants this difference to
                  be possible, but his poetics creates enormous difficulties.</p>
                  <p>What ecological thinking, emerging during his lifetime, opens up, Shelley includes
                  in his work. Yet with another hand, Shelley domesticates the disastrous vision,
                  turning disaster into a singularity through which human history will pass, as the
                  rather grisly introduction to Book 8 shows: “Time! … Render up thy
                  half-devoured babes” (8.3–5). It is hard not to think that at some level,
                  the remarkably anti-capitalist and prescient Shelley is stuck in a capitalist
                  ideological mode, rather like the Enlightenment <foreign>philosophes</foreign> he
                  so admired and whom Marx later criticized for being as fetishistic, in their way,
                  as the “primitive” believers they undermine. </p>
                  <p>Shelley appears trapped in the tropology of disaster, like an insect beating
                  itself against a glass window. Since what appears to be required is a dramatic
                  inner transformation that includes transcending prejudices of all kinds, how is it
                  possible to think the moment of change? Shelley obsesses over how to transition
                  from the time of disaster to the time of no disaster. It is only perhaps at the
                  very end, with <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, that he opts for the
                  judo-like approach of staying with the moment of disaster, inventing a poetics of
                  disaster appropriate to this staying. Yet it isn't quite right to call this
                  incomplete text a judo move. It's more as if Shelley was at last content to see
                  the implications of his poetic imagination through to some conclusions that might
                  be uncomfortable for the kinds of progressive box into which he fitted his
                  politics. For <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is incomplete both as
                  literary text, and in terms of thinking through and beyond the political and
                  philosophical ramifications of disaster. </p>
                  <p>The strange beginning of Shelley's <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
                  elucidated in Paul De Man's essay “Shelley Disfigured,” is a poetics
                  of disaster, literally a dis-astron, since the sun's weirdly sudden rising is the
                  basis for De Man's deconstructive essay. Talk about a “disaster in the
                  sun” as Horatio puts it: <quote>

                     </quote> Here is the “good disaster” of an Enlightenment sunrise, and
                  the gears don't grind—but what acceleration! It is as if Shelley had
                  overheard Wordsworth's paean to the French Revolution, “Bliss was it in that
                  dawn to be alive” (11.4), and teased out the queasy horror—not of
                  executing aristos, but the horror within bliss as such, its automatic, orgasmic
                  otherness. De Man's reading traces the intense play of light in Shelley's poem, as
                  blinding as it is revealing (De Man). This intensity is in part a reflex of what
                  he calls the “brusque” artificiality of the poem's guiding linguistic
                  act, positing. The inversion of the figure and the figured (“Swift as a
                  spirit…the Sun” (1–2)) is one of Shelley's typical uses of what old
                  rhetorical manuals call <foreign>obscurum per obscures</foreign>, describing
                  something in terms of something less clear (Morton, <title level="a">Shelley,
                     Nature and Culture</title>). This device spells disaster, separating the
                  figurative from the signified levels while making the signified moot: poetry
                  achieves escape velocity from pointing to things outside of language, exploding
                  beautifully in successful failure, like fireworks. The first four lines dispense
                  with measurably slow empirical dawns and the depth of poetic tradition about the
                  sun in a stroke (a sunstroke?): “The impossible position is precisely the
                  figure, the trope, metaphor as a violent—and not as a dark—light, a
                  deadly Apollo”—disaster (De Man 117–118). Light starts to become
                  nuclear radiation. It is as if it's beginning to dawn on Shelley that disaster is
                  intrinsic to his poetics. </p>
                  <p>The disruptive, fluid freefall of this poem's <foreign>terza rima</foreign> enacts
                  disaster at a textural level: you can feel it in the disorienting interweaving of
                  negation upon negation. Finally, Shelley appears content to court disaster. The
                  vertiginous way in which visions and dreams appear caught within one another in a
                  non-teleological parody of medieval allegory leaves the narrator trapped within
                  the glass of disaster, against which we saw Shelley's earlier work to be beating
                  itself. For to discover oneself in a dream, only to find that the exit from the
                  dream is another dream, puts in peril the neatly teleological story of disaster
                  transcended or averted. When everything is a disaster, it is not that nothing is a
                  disaster: rather, we enter a world of risk assessment without an exit, and find
                  ourselves unable to shake the monkey of too much consciousness off our backs
                  (Beck).</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, then, there is some truth in the idea that <title level="m">The Triumph
                     of Life</title> is deliberately unfinished—at least this intuition is
                  congruent with some of the conclusions the poem forces upon us. I prefer, however,
                  to think of this poem as radically impossible to finish by Shelley at the time of
                  his death. Where do you go once you've figured out that the future (and the future
                  of your poem) leads you into another ream of disaster? In this sense the
                  unresolved poetic problem is also an unresolved philosophical and political
                  problem. Shelley's palpable boredom with old solutions, however, should not lure
                  us into concluding that he had given up on revolution. Quite the opposite: the
                  unhappiness with fake endings is a reflex of a continued revolutionary
                  project.</p>

                     </quote> At the climax of the poem, Blake is satirizing the attitude that sees the
                  tiger as a terrifying product of a terrifying God, akin to Hegel's beautiful soul,
                  whose own gaze is the evil that it sees in the world at large (Hegel 383–409). The
                  beautiful soul, for whom the world is evil, is a type of environmentalist
                  ideology, which makes <title level="a">The Tyger</title> even more apt for our
                  purposes (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 109–123). The narrator's
                  description of the stars throwing down their spears arrives at the climax of a
                  series of industrial and infernal images of the tiger's physical construction. The
                  description serves as a kind of establishing shot that puts the artificer's
                  handiwork in perspective, a wide-angle lens on the Universe. The narrator wishes
                  to convey the cosmic dismay felt at the arrival of the tiger. </p>
                  <p>The personified stars do not portend evil in this case as true astral
                  “disasters” would—they witness it. Their reaction of horrified
                  pity is in accord with the narrator's objectifying, materialistic gaze—they
                  are the evil they see. Evil thus already haunts the Universe, in the form of an
                  unconscious subjectivity that sees certain phenomena as material embodiments of
                  evil, as if from a great distance. If the stars are angelic titans (Lucifer being
                  the chief among them), then God is the exception, the one that creates an evil
                  universe, much to their dismay. Yet evil has already manifested in the form of an
                  evil gaze. </p>
                  <p>Blake comes close to articulating a theory of disaster that is highly relevant to
                  this essay's proposal that we think beyond disaster. This is unsurprising, since
                  his work is ideology critique through and through, and since the materialism and
                  capitalism that spawn disaster, and disaster thinking, were operational by the
                  time he was writing. Like Hegel, Blake had figured out that ideas come bundled
                  with unconscious attitudes, and he was determined to expose them. The portrayal of
                  the tiger as terrifying misses the uncanny familiarity of the tiger, hinted at in
                  the cuddly toy illumination that accompanies the poem. This missing of the mark
                  resembles the way in which sublime Nature, objectified as wilderness, is set up to
                  loom around, beyond and behind human activity like a distant mountain range. The
                  reified sublimity passes too quickly over the distressing intimacy and
                  “lameness” (to use an appropriate modern adjective) of human and
                  nonhuman interaction. </p>

                  <p>The most ambiguous disaster ecology is found, unsurprisingly, in that master of
                  ambiguity and anticlimax, William Wordsworth. The “dream of the Arab”
                  episode, a spot of time that occurs in the fifth book of <title level="m">The
                     Prelude</title>, is strictly about an apocalyptic flood; and about poetry as
                  the medium, the telephone, down which this telos is heard. Wordsworth's image
                  within the dream of the book as telephonic shell is remarkably phonocentric:
                  intriguingly spiraled and opaque, silent and mysterious, you don't even read it
                  with your eyes, you have to put it to your ear: <quote>

                     </quote> Wordsworth has been said to open an imaginary space in which film
                  technology becomes significant, in his liquid long form poems. Here he appears to
                  do something similar to the telephone. What you hear when you hold it to your ear,
                  like a pre-recorded message from the future, is the sound of the end of the world:
                  who recorded it, this <foreign>phonos</foreign> of the <foreign>telos</foreign>?
                  This sound, heard in the present moment of the beach as a hugely amplified ambient
                  whisper like the sound of soft swirling waters in a seashell turned up high, is
                  profoundly environmental in form as well as in content. The disturbingly evocative
                  voice without a body is a floating sound coming from nowhere: in the term invented
                  by Pierre Schaeffer, the pioneer of musique concrète, it is
                  “acousmatic”—an automated sound that appears to come from no
                  identifiable source (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 41–43).</p>
                  <p>This sound is a “blast,” sound as disaster, somewhere between an
                  explosion and a fanfare on a brass instrument. Like a hi-fi speaker whose volume
                  is dangerously high, the shell might cause pain: a message delivery system so
                  potent that one becomes vividly aware of what Jakobson called the
                  “contact,” the material medium of communication as such (Jakobson).
                  The alarm-like blast wavers disturbingly between speech and noise and music
                  (“harmony”): it is “loud” and “prophetic,”
                  made of “articulate” sounds. Yet the sound is in a language the
                  dreamer does not recognize—thus a language from a beyond, over the horizon,
                  outside, reinforcing the notion that disaster is the outside impinging on an
                  inside; a language that is doubly foreign, yet also a “tongue,” as if
                  the narrator had a tongue in his ear. In the both–and logic of a dream (Freud
                  asserts that the unconscious knows no negation), beautifully modeled in
                  Wordsworth's description of simultaneous unintelligibility and intelligibility,
                  the sound is both noise and meaning, recognized as such even though the words
                  cannot be understood. Three possibilities are superimposed: the sound is
                  inarticulate noise; the sound is articulate, meaningful yet not understood; the
                  sound is meaningful and understood. </p>
                  <p>The telephonic shell is itself an alien technology, and the narrator's account of
                  the Don Quixote-like Arab impressing him with shiny gadgets is reminiscent of
                  first contact narratives. Yet the scene is inverted, as if modern technology (this
                  is after all a highly ambiguous account of books and reading) arrived from another
                  world onto English shores. With its shiny, iPhone-like nacre, the shell impresses,
                  and the narrator perhaps appears to undergo the assumed embarrassment of the
                  indigenous person who does not know what to do with the objects presented to him.
                  Then space and time collapse in apocalyptic fashion, and suddenly the end of the
                  world is “at hand.” One cannot help finding in this passage something
                  that is indeed prophetic about the distance collapsing technologies of the last
                  two centuries. It is particularly strange, this effect, considering that the
                  entire passage is in the context of a meditation on the already existing
                  technology of books. With their world-ending promises of instant presence, modern
                  communication media do indeed resemble material symptoms of a disturbing new
                  metaphysics. Many times ecological criticism has labeled technology as such
                  disastrous, precisely insofar as it is the end of the world as a bounded place of
                  distances and opacities and hidden corners—worlds need horizons, and global
                  warming reduces these horizons to mere abstraction and false immediacy. </p>
                  <p>The immersive sound of the seashore, the quietness here amplified so as to
                  threaten overwhelming (literally, over-whelming) noise, is heard throughout modern
                  new age and environmental music as the sounds of a disaster-stricken planet:
                  disappearing lifeworlds recorded for elegiac evocative pleasure. The innocent
                  seeming hush of an environmental soundscape is thus a threat of imminent
                  destruction: as if the recoding said, “I could be your last chance to hear a
                  world such as this.” In these fragmentary voices of “real world”
                  ambience, global capital and imperial power are audible both in their
                  phantasmagorical energy and penetrating scientific gaze. Such fragile sonic worlds
                  are objects of sadistic pleasure and Schadenfreude, as well as the more obvious
                  marketing of the “oceanic feeling” that constitutes a core of the long
                  history of consumerism (Morton, <title level="m">Ecology</title> 111–112).
                  “World” is strictly a function of modernity, like the idea of the
                  Middle Ages. </p>
                  <p>Like Magritte's <title level="m">
                        <foreign>La condition humaine</foreign>
                     </title>,
                  a painting of a painting of a landscape placed within the landscape it has
                  painted, such that the actual landscape overlaps with it, Wordsworth's narrator
                  hears apocalyptic ambience on the seashore itself. This coincidence of fantasy and
                  reality takes place within a dream whose dreamer is himself situated on a
                  seashore. The dreamer awakens: the ocean is the same; disaster has been framed by
                  the drag of the real. It's a typically Wordsworthian anticlimax, a “spot of
                  time,” a record of weakness, failure and collapse. Wordsworth is enabling
                  thinking to carry on around and through disaster. </p>
                  <p>As failure, it's the exact opposite of Freud's record of the dream of the burning
                  boy, in which the boy signals that the dreamer must wake up and smell the real
                  smoke. Perhaps the role of the dream in Wordsworth's poem is more like Lacan's
                  reinterpretation of Freud: Lacan argues that to spare himself the anxiety of the
                  murderous erotic fantasy, the dreamer awakens to the drag of the actual fire
                  (Lacan 57–60, 68–70). The real disaster would be remaining within the dream and
                  giving vent to one's violent fantasies. This is indeed salutary in an ecological
                  sense. Environmentalism is perhaps nothing but the desire that one's
                  dream—that one inhabits a meaningful and immersive “lifeworld”
                  surrounded by familiar but not uncanny nonhumans—remain undisturbed. The
                  persistence of this dream inhibits directly intervening in the realm of
                  “life on Earth” for the sake of life forms. In this sense, as
                  counter-intuitive as it sounds, environmentalism is hostile to ecology. </p>
