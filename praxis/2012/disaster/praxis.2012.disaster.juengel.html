               </div>
               <p>I begin and end with one of the more extraordinary daydreams from an age of philosophical
                  daydreaming, one of such startling theoretical acceleration that it seems to expand
                  at the speed of the universe. Floating off the rocky seaboard of Norway east of Arendal,
                  Mary Wollstonecraft gazes on the barren shoreline and allows her mind to wander: <span class="quote">‘The view of this wild coast, as we sailed along it, afforded me a continual subject
                     for meditation. I anticipated the future improvement of the world, and observed how
                     much man still had to do, to obtain of the earth all it could yield. I even carried
                     my speculations so far as to advance a million or two of years to the moment when
                     the earth would perhaps be so perfectly cultivated, and so completely peopled, as
                     to render it necessary to inhabit every spot; yes, these bleak shores. Imagination
                     went still farther, and pictured the state of man when the earth could no longer support
                     him. Where was he to fly to from universal famine? Do not smile: I really became distressed
                     for these fellow creatures, yet unborn. The images fastened on me, and the world appeared
                     a vast prison. I was soon to be in a smaller one—for no other name can I give to Rusoer.
                     It would be difficult to form an idea of the place, if you have never seen one of
                     these rocky coasts. (<em>Letters</em> 102)’</span></p>

                  <p>Of course, Wollstonecraft traverses such forbidding terrain as the ostensible business
                     envoy of her increasingly remote lover, Gilbert Imlay, whose “importing” business
                     supplies a suitable pretext for sending Wollstonecraft northward in the summer of
                     1795.

                              Traitorous Correspondence Bill of 1793, delivering vital goods to revolutionary France
                              through the neutral ports of the north. One of Imlay’s ships carrying valuable French
                              silver and plate (a ship rechristened Maria and Margaretha after Wollstonecraft and
                              her maid) disappeared outside Arendal and was reported sunk. Suspecting a double-cross,
                              Imlay sent Wollstonecraft to Scandinavia as his legal representative in a suit against
                              the ship’s captain. See Favret, 1993: 97-8.</span></div>
                     </div> Recently returned from Paris where she had witnessed the Terror firsthand, a disquieted
                     Wollstonecraft savors the political and picturesque neutrality of Scandinavia: indeed,
                     in the opening letter of <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796), she writes of her first glimpses of the “sterile” coastline—“Rocks were piled
                     on rocks, forming a suitable bulwark to the ocean”—and notes the stirring of a “spontaneous
                     pleasure which gives credibility to our expectation of happiness.” “I forgot the horrors
                     I had witnessed in France,” she concludes, “which had cast a gloom over all nature”
                     (14). Faced with such vacant and uniformly austere space, Wollstonecraft experiences
                     the “dilating [of]…emotions which were painfully concentrated” (14).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>However, Wollstonecraft’s shoreline reverie intimates the perils of such affective
                     dilation, especially if unchecked by the modest aims of the historical imagination.
                     Arguably, one could view Wollstonecraft’s future distress as a manifestation of what
                     Jean-François Lyotard has identified as a historico-political enthusiasm, a “modality
                     of the sublime feeling” that arises in Kant’s critique of history: specifically, “[t]his
                     enthusiasm is the <span class="foreign">Begebenheit</span> that has been sought for within the historical experience of humanity so as to be
                     able to validate the phrase: ‘Humanity is constantly progressing toward the better’”
                     (29, 32). Kant’s sense of <span class="foreign">Begebenheit</span> as an event “which <em>delivers itself</em> into human history” squares with Wollstonecraft’s hyper-generative vision: each seeks
                     to “indicate a cause such that the occurrence of its effect remains undetermined with
                     regard to time” (Lyotard 26; emphasis mine).

                              troubles post-Paris Wollstonecraft most acutely. Not incidentally, in 
                              “The Contest of the Faculties”
                              Kant reflects on the still unresolved revolution in France (it “may succeed, or it
                              may fail”), and asserts that no matter the historical reckoning, “I maintain that
                              this revolution has aroused in the hearts and desires of all spectators who are not
                              themselves caught up in it a sympathy which borders almost on enthusiasm, although
                              the very utterance of this sympathy was fraught with danger” (
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> While this sublime feeling occasions the experience of the idea of humanity in ourselves,
                     it also, according to Lyotard, broaches something akin to dementia, “that is, believing
                     there is a direct presentation when there isn’t any….Enthusiasm, for its sake, sees
                     nothing, or rather sees nothingness and relates it back to the unpresentable” (31-2).
                     However, ultimately Wollstonecraft’s meditation would fall short of Kantian sublimity
                     simply because it converts the end of history into a scene of sentiment; or as Kant
                     writes in the third <em>Critique</em> (§29): “A sympathetic grief that will not admit of consolation, or one referring to
                     imaginary evils to which we deliberately surrender ourselves—being deceived by fancy—as
                     if they were actual, indicates and produces a tender, though weak, soul—which shows
                     a beautiful side and which can be called fanciful, though not enthusiastic” (141).
                     Wollstonecraft would certainly not share Kant’s supposition that the feelings that
                     follow in the wake of such mathematical sublimity dilute its force;

                     the very production of a scene of universal suffering out of emptiness seems strangely
                     consistent with Kant’s contention that “it is the state of mind produced by a certain
                     representation with which the reflective Judgment is occupied, and not the Object,
                     that is to be called sublime” (<em>Critique</em> 110).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Naturally, one might be tempted to view this abrupt unleashing of Wollstonecraft’s
                     imagination, its wild “peopling” of empty inhospitable space, as an instance of Malthusian
                     geometrical terror, save for the fact that Wollstonecraft’s Scandinavian letters were
                     composed in 1795, full three years before the first edition of <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. But ever mindful of the failed promise of revolution in France, <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em> demonstrates a restless commitment to thinking the ends of universal history, at times
                     reading more like a work of philosophical anthropology than a travel memoir. Recall,
                     for instance, Wollstonecraft’s counterfactual hypothesis about early human migration:
                     “the first dwelling of man,” she speculates, must have been in the gloomy rusticity
                     of Northern Europe, leading primitive man to migrate south in search of sun “[so]
                     that the different parts of the earth might be peopled,” for how else does one explain
                     the presence of human populations in such merciless terrains than by resorting to
                     the logic of origins (44). In such instances, Wollstonecraft cribs from that most
                     quintessential of enlightenment genres, the conjectural history, to redirect the narrative
                     of stadial development to corroborate her own sense of the native comforts of “this
                     rejected spot” (43), a spot the likes of which she will, in subsequent letters, imaginatively
                     repopulate to death. Wollstonecraft regularly addresses her observations to “the compilers
                     of universal histories” (48) and “writers who have considered the history of man,
                     or of the human mind, on a more enlarged scale” (49), and few texts of the period
                     demonstrate the penetration of proto-anthropological knowledge into forms of everyday
                     perception more than <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em>.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Such a reading would certainly harmonize with what Mary Jacobus calls Wollstonecraft’s
                     “sustained inquiry into amatory melancholia”—here dangerously quickened by the power
                     of the imagination to reproduce beyond the means of affective support—leaving us once
                     again “at the common site of transference and maternity” (Jacobus 65, 66). However,
                     suffused as it is with both personal loss and political disenchantment, Wollstonecraft’s
                     peculiar melancholia in Scandinavia exceeds the private demands of a wounded ego,
                     and insists upon recognizing a melancholia haunting the world-historical subject.
                     In his <em>Memoirs</em> of his late wife, William Godwin portrays the impact of the French Revolution on Wollstonecraft
                     as one of blunt trauma, for “while it gave a fundamental shock to the human intellect
                     through every region of the globe, [it] did not fail to produce a conspicuous effect
                     in the progress of Mary’s reflections. The prejudices of her early years suffered
                     a vehement concussion” (Godwin 72). This concussed state interrupted the career of
                     a “mind…insensibly advancing towards a vigorous maturity,” breaking Wollstonecraft’s
                     reverence for “establishment” values and sensitizing her to a world of injustice (72).
                     Godwin’s account of <em>Vindication of the Rights of Men</em> subsequently highlights his future wife’s oscillation between “burst[s] of indignation”
                     and “temporary fit[s] of torpor and indolence” during the process of composition,
                     her progress and political engagement dependent on the availability of “stimulus”
                     (73).

                              and editing, Godwin frequently measures Wollstonecraft’s shifting psychological condition
                              by means of her intellectual output. For instance, as her romance with Henry Fuseli
                              is slowly deteriorating, Godwin notes that “she produced nothing, except a few articles
                              in the Analytical Review” over a twelve month period (82). </span></div>
                     </div> Thus, in December 1792 when Wollstonecraft left for an already tumultuous Paris to
                     experience the revolution firsthand and alone, Godwin notes that she had no timeline
                     for return since “the single purpose she had in view being that of an endeavour to
                     heal her distempered mind” (83). Wollstonecraft’s fame as the author of the <em>Vindications</em> afforded her access into the circles of the Girondin leadership as well as various
                     British expatriate communities in Paris; but whatever sanguinity she possessed about
                     the fate of the revolution quickly eroded with the cruelties of Robespierre, the establishment
                     of the Revolutionary Tribunal, and the renewal of war between France and Britain in
                     February 1793.

                     revolutionary change from its terrifying actualization, registers the seeming impossibility
                     of revolutionary optimism when its “history” cannot progress much beyond 1789, stopping
                     well short of the Revolution’s most violent turns (Furniss 69). Or, as Wollstonecraft
                     writes in <em>Historical and Moral View</em>, “[o]ne great cause of misery in the present imperfect state of society is, that
                     the imagination, continually tantalized, becomes the inflated wen of the mind, draining
                     off the nourishment from the vital parts” (18).</p>

                  <p>It is this metastasized imagination, incited by the prospect of revolutionary progress
                     and indifferent to the slowness of historico-political time, that concerns me in this
                     essay, for I see it quickening Wollstonecraft’s population terror and producing a
                     form of historical untimeliness that can only be resolved in disaster. By casting
                     Wollstonecraft’s political awakening in terms of a traumatized and volatile sensorium,
                     Godwin cultivates a vision of his subject as “a female Werther,” whose mind “seem[s]
                     almost of too fine a texture to encounter the vicissitudes of human affairs” (88).

                     </div> Melancholia is of course always a debilitating excess of inassimilable knowledge,
                     and none more so than the act of mourning one’s fellow creatures, yet unborn. According
                     to the familiar Freudian paradigm, where mourning can eventually release the lost
                     object back to history, melancholia steadfastly, even pathologically, refuses such
                     closure. But what of melancholia oriented, proleptically, toward the disaster of the
                     future, one held open by an impossible act of mourning? On one hand, mourning what
                     cannot be known is constitutive of melancholia, but both mourning and melancholia
                     are structured around the lost object and its remains, so what if there was no object
                     in the first place, no remains to incite (as one recent, rather sanguine account of
                     mourning put it) the “volatile potentialit[ies] and future militancies” available
                     in loss (Eng and Kazanjian 5)? Can one grieve that which is not only unborn, but “a
                     million or two of years” distant, and thus effectively at the limits of historical
                     imagination? Freud makes clear at the beginning of 
                     “Mourning and Melancholia”
                      that one can mourn not only “the loss of a loved person,” but also “the loss of some
                     abstraction which has taken the place of one, such as fatherland, liberty, an ideal,
                     and so on” (164). The substitutability of one lost object for another, here successively
                     abstracted toward idealization (and beyond), allows for the possibility that the source
                     of the melancholic projection may be unrecoverable. Freud’s “and so on” extends the
                     tropological progression continuously, leaving open-ended the question of what might
                     lie beyond lost ideality.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As Judith Butler demonstrates, the inward “turn” of melancholia—whereby the lost object
                     is retained, ungrieved and undeclared as constitutive of the ego—produces “a set of
                     spatializing tropes for psychic life, domiciles of preservation and shelter as well
                     as arenas for struggle and persecution” (171). The psychic topographies that result
                     from this operation are more than simply illustrative figures for interiority; rather,
                     they persist as “textualized symptoms” of what they seek to explain (179). In withdrawing
                     the beloved object from conscious life, Butler argues, the melancholic withdraws “a
                     configuration of the social world as well,” in the process making the ego into a “‘polity’
                     and conscience one of its ‘major institutions,’ precisely…to annul the losses that
                     [the social] world demands” (181-2). When the lost object is political hope itself,
                     the entire psycho-social manifold becomes politicized to such a degree that even deserted
                     landscape becomes a potential site of revolutionary mourning. In what follows, I want
                     to consider Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Denmark and Norway</em> within the historical imagination of the 1790s and, by extension, within a theorization
                     of romantic history shuttling between the “anticipated…future improvement of the world”
                     and the bleak shores of disaster to come. Haunted by what was to have been the future,
                     Wollstonecraft struggles to reconcile the time of revolutionary politics with what
                     we might call “species time,” resulting in forms of untimeliness that figure as disaster
                     without end. “[D]isaster ruins everything,” writes Maurice Blanchot, “all the while
                     leaving everything intact” (1), a sentiment, I argue, captured in Wollstonecraft’s
                     curious fascination with empty palaces and estates.

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Arguably, Wollstonecraft’s speculations regarding the million-year fate of the human
                     species are part of a general shift in what was historically conceivable in the eighteenth
                     century. The Western understanding of historical time underwent a vertiginous change
                     between 1750 and the early decades of the nineteenth century, as the positing of geological
                     or “deep” time began to erode the hegemony of the six-thousand-year-old Biblical earth,
                     and sacral or prophetical histories were challenged by new models of temporalization
                     structured according to the tempos of scientific inquiry. As Daniel Rosenberg has
                     shown, Buffon’s startling hypothesis that the planet was seventy-five thousand years
                     old understated the French naturalist’s suspicion that the age of the earth should
                     actually be measured in millions of years (46-7). Indeed, Buffon’s eventual theory
                     of the cooling planet—which began as a “mass of incandescent matter in space…condensed
                     into a spinning spheroid, which thereafter had cooled slowly to its present state,
                     and would continue to cool” (Rudwick 150)—hypothesizes the most comprehensive “natural
                     history” imaginable, the life of the planet through to its thermodynamic demise at
                     some unavoidable point in the future. This historicization of the earth, and particularly
                     the recognition of a vast geohistory anterior to human civilization effectively burst
                     open the concept of time, making clear that <em>human</em> history is but a brief rustle of surface activity in the immensity that is the fate
                     of a planet. Buttressed by enlightenment natural history, historical time became increasingly
                     accumulative, quantitative, and spatialized, but not altogether graspable. By 1785
                     when James Hutton presented “The System of the Habitable Earth with Regard to its
                     Duration and Stability” to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the concept of the earth’s
                     dynamic equilibrium was producing an abyssal relationship to time, as the physics
                     of the earth threatened to escape human historical measurement.

                     (to believe Frederic Jameson) acknowledged “the judgment of the future on the present”
                     as a mode of periodization and historical reckoning (26). This decidedly <em>earthly</em> judgment to come allows the future to “flash up” into the present as powerfully, and

                     in the eighteenth century, encourages a host of new narrative possibilities where
                     prophecy produced only time’s fateful destruction: Rosenberg notes the flourishing
                     of a “<span class="foreign">uchronian</span> imagination” in fictions of the 1770s—most famously in the French bestseller, Louis-Sébastien
                     Mercier’s <em>L’An 2440</em>—alongside forms of conjectural history that were oriented increasingly toward progressive
                     futures, culminating in the 1790s with the work of Condorcet, Godwin and others (47).
                     As enormous recalibrations of planetary history diminished human presence in the past,
                     futurological thought increasingly posed the question of human ends: indeed, romantic
                     era writers, visionaries, philosophers, and political economists hypothesize the future
                     ontologies of the “human” nearly as fervently, if not as systematically, as the Victorians
                     would worry humankind’s evolutionary past.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Perhaps no speculative model captures this revolution in quantitative time as cleanly
                  and chillingly as Malthus working through his geometrical progressions: “In two centuries
                  and a quarter, the population would be to the means of subsistence as 512 to 10: in
                  three centuries as 4096 to 13, and in two thousand years the difference would be almost
                  incalculable” (75). Even before the mathematical abstractions and demographic tables
                  are converted into reproducing bodies in the thrall of instinct, we recognize what
                  Godwin will later call “the germ of multiplication” working in Malthus’ program, its
                  presumption of predictable, mathematized intervals of time rather than Nature’s mysterious
                  sequencing, “whether her series alternately progress or retrograde;—whether they circulate,
                  or decrease, or flow in straight and eternal lines” (1820: 6, 249). But while Malthus
                  certainly devotes more energy to soberly correcting fantasies of human perfectibility
                  and denouncing Poor Law legislation that disincentivizes labor and encourages reproduction,
                  he does recognize something self-regulating in the planet’s history, for while the
                  “law of increase in a geometrical progression is absolutely immense,” <span class="quote">‘The laws of nature which make food necessary to the life of man, as well as of plants
                     and animals, prevent the continued existence of an excess which cannot be supported,
                     and thus either discourage the production of such an excess, or destroy it in the
                     bud, in such a way as to make it scarcely perceptible to a careless observer. (266)
                     ’</span> Extrapolating from his final point, Malthus argues that historical disasters—e.g.
                  war, drought, pandemics, hurricanes, etc.—are but periodic “checks” on exponential
                  growth; or rather, looked at another way, instances of mass destruction are quickly
                  offset and compensated by the steady engines of human reproduction. “The effects of
                  the dreadful plague in London in 1666,” Malthus writes, “were not perceptible fifteen
                  or twenty years afterwards. The traces of the most destructive famines in China and
                  Indostan are by all accounts very soon obliterated” (107). Epidemics in Turkey and
                  Egypt, earthquakes in Lisbon and Lima, volcanic eruptions in Naples and Pompeii all
                  “have but a trifling effect on the average population of any state” (107-8). It is
                  a measure of the scale and abstraction of Malthus’ principle of population that historical
                  events of this magnitude serve merely a regulatory role; moreover, according to the
                  account of history intimated here, such catastrophic events threaten to disappear
                  from the planetary record, their “traces…very soon obliterated.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This shift in the scale of history threatens to attenuate how we measure disaster
                     and mass mortality, and it does so just as the Lisbon earthquake and its philosophical
                     aftermath were curing Voltaire of Leibniz’s theodicy and ushering in the modern event-structure
                     of history. As many have noted after Adorno, Lisbon was to the catastrophe of nature
                     as Auschwitz was to catastrophe of history, and as such it punctuated the end of traditional
                     modes of belief and proved a vital if grim catalyst for modern disenchantment. But
                     a deeper ecological understanding of history modifies the seismic import of any single
                     sublunary event, in part because it can imagine a history that is not measured in
                     demographic impact. One might even begin to argue that despite the dark admonitory
                     vision of exhausted resources and mass starvation, Malthus is hardly a theorist of
                     catastrophe, because there is no exceptional event in his theoretical model, only
                     a mathematical horizon and the inevitability of time and instinct. In fact, the 1798
                     first edition of <em>Essay</em> is remarkably devoid of horror, and hardly the “charnel house” of Hazlitt’s fevered
                     imagination.

                              house” (101). Both Godwin and Hazlitt take Malthus to considerable task for trying
                              to manipulate and frighten the public about population increase in his subsequent

                     philosophy, Malthus imagines the <em>ongoingness</em> of catastrophe, its endless arrival, by which I mean not simply gradual resource depletion,
                     nor even the unthinking and uninterrupted disaster unfolding in the plant and animal
                     world (where the power of increase remains largely unimpeded, and an organic, if merciless
                     equilibrium takes hold), but rather a disaster at the heart of the historical human

                  its current populousness the growth rate in Europe has slowed considerably, Malthus

                  historical contestation between unflagging reproductive drive and new forms of demographic
                  reason provides the scaffolding for Malthus’ nascent “theory of mind” at the end of
                  the 1798 <em>Essay</em>, but one senses that it is a contestation without a victor (62). All living creatures
                  experience population pressure, and most of nature allows the world’s essential finitude
                  to cull the species; humankind alone has the capacity to “interrupt” the power of
                  increase in its “career” through reason and sexual discretion (76). But most of the
                  checks to human proliferation are as dismal as the everyday disaster felt by plants
                  and animals, for Malthus lists forms of vice (e.g. prostitution, birth control, infanticide,
                  polyandry) and misery (abstinence) as the most common responses to the need for population
                  control. As Catherine Gallagher reminds us, Malthus was the first to contend that
                  “sexual instinct was at the very core of our human nature…as permanent and intractable
                  as the instinct for self-preservation,” and by making sexual desire a motor of human
                  history, Malthus ensured that any restraint on that desire would produce distress
                  and suffering (Gallagher 159). Put another way, whether checked or unchecked the principle
                  of population would seem to insure privation of some sort. In the final chapters of
                  the <em>Essay</em> we begin to discover explicitly what has been clear all along and what gives the
                  treatise its acknowledged “melancholy hue”: Malthus views being-in-the-world as one
                  extended “state of trial,” life a “constant succession of sentient beings, rising
                  apparently from so many specks of matter, going through a long and sometimes painful
                  process in this world” (62, 201). Or, as Malthus announces with Hobbesian economy,
                  “man as he really is [is] inert, sluggish, and averse from labour, unless compelled
                  by necessity” (205).</p>
               <p>Malthus’ philosophical pessimism drew the ire of many of his reform-minded contemporaries,
                  but for the author of the <em>Essay on the Principle of Population</em> the unwillingness to intellectually confront “one of the general laws of animated
                  nature”—i.e. “[t]he perpetual tendency in the race of man to increase beyond the means
                  of subsistence”—amounts to “unmanly conduct” (199). Indeed, to chase dreams of species
                  improvement, or worse “perfectibility,” only exacerbates the toll on the already overtaxed
                  human subject, for “we shall not only exhaust our strength in fruitless exertions…but
                  we shall be perpetually crushed by the recoil of this rock of Sisyphus” (199). Every
                  way lies privation and hardship. As a consequence Malthus must insist that “exertion”
                  is what gives form to consciousness, for “[i]f Locke’s ideas be just, and there is
                  great reason to think that it is, evil seems to be necessary to create exertion, and
                  exertion seems evidently necessary to create mind” (204). By adopting a version of
                  sensationalist epistemology that makes struggle and affliction constitutive of mind,
                  Malthus imagines the human subject as something akin to an isolated thermodynamic
                  system asymptotically approaching entropy—or what Malthus repeatedly calls “a general
                  and fatal torpor of the human faculties”—unless roused by persistent calamities of
                  sensation (205).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This argument for the necessity of privation and exertion was not uncommon in period
                     accounts of universal history. Kant famously portrays nature as productive of ceaseless
                     and necessary struggle: “Man wishes to live comfortably and pleasantly, but nature
                     intends that he should abandon idleness and inactive self-sufficiency and plunge instead
                     into labour and hardships, so that he may by his own adroitness find means of liberating
                     himself from them in turn” (
                     “Idea”
                      45). Meanwhile, isolated in rugged Scandinavia, Wollstonecraft too insists that “[a]
                     degree of exertion, produced by some want, more or less painful, is probably the price
                     we must pay for knowledge” (105). But Malthus alone seems to turn the psychology of
                     strain into a quasi-theology of equilibrium: man’s “sluggish existence” is awakened
                     by “the animating touches of the Divinity,” those “roughnesses and inequality in life
                     which querulous man too frequently makes the subject of his complaint against the
                     God of nature” (202-3). Malthus’ God fashions a human subject weighed down by listlessness
                     and impoverishment, then spurs him to action through relentless and unending want,
                     the “animating touch” of unremitting disaster: <span class="quote">‘Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might
                        never have emerged from the savage state. But supposing the earth once well peopled,
                        an Alexander, a Julius Caesar, a Tamberlane, or a bloody revolution might irrevocably
                        thin the human race, and defeat the great designs of the Creator. The ravages of a
                        contagious disease would be felt for ages; and an earthquake might unpeople a region
                        for ever. The principle, according to which population increases, prevents the vices
                        of mankind, or the accidents of nature, the partial evils arising from general laws,
                        from obstructing the high purpose of the creation….But it is impossible that this
                        law can operate, and produce the effects apparently intended by the Supreme Being,
                        without occasioning partial evil. (206) ’</span> Malthus immediately tries to spin this scandalous vision as “favourable to the growth
                     of the mind” because it produces “the universal exertion…[the] infinite variety of
                     situations, and consequently of impressions” that stimulate human consciousness (206).
                     But there seems a strange distortion of aspect ratio here, leading Malthus to ultimately
                     insist that we “consider chiefly the mass of mankind and not individual instances”
                     (207).

                              men” looking for perfection, Malthus celebrates the telescopic eye of the realist:

                     </div> By reducing war, famine, plague, and natural disasters to “partial evils”—partial
                     because the “thinning” of the human race is countered by inexorable demographic growth,
                     and vice versa—Malthus not only broaches a scale of historical accounting (and accountability)
                     that threatens to evacuate the moral universe of its groundwork, but he imagines the
                     conditions of a necessary, purposeful, and ever approaching disaster.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Malthus is not much interested in this condition of traumatic anticipation. The end
                  of the first edition of <em>Essay</em> is dedicated to the proposition that “Evil exists in the world not to create despair
                  but activity”: where the “uniform, undiversified perfection” imagined by Godwin and
                  Cordorcet would only bring about inaction and regression, the forbidding realism of
                  Malthus attempts to make a virtue of misery, arguing that “[t]he sorrows and distresses
                  of life form another class of excitements, which seem to be necessary, by a particular
                  train of impressions, to soften and humanize the heart” (217, 209). By hewing to a
                  sentimental vocabulary of instructive suffering and by shifting the focus of his treatise
                  from the population dynamics to “theory of mind,” Malthus often fails to differentiate
                  the scale of what goads the mind to activity, such that instances of mass mortality
                  and catastrophic destruction are frequently reduced to the level of “excitations”
                  and experiential “variety.” Natural evil pitilessly contracts the human population,
                  but at least it prompts survivors to further liveliness and improvement. This has
                  important consequences for our thinking of disaster. Despite being introduced as a
                  large-scale planetary modulation that would seem to escape human comprehension, disaster
                  by the end of the 1798 <em>Essay</em> figures as a disturbance of consciousness, a disaster of sensation and feeling that
                  paradoxically moves the species toward life rather than death. The Malthusian disaster
                  is not experienced as inassimilable shock or trauma, but rather it rouses the human
                  subject into a future shaped and bounded by disaster.</p>

                  <p>This untraumatized mass subject benefits from rarely participating in prospective

                     and finds herself preposterously mourning that which has not occurred (even as she

                     shared Malthus’ general commitment to the maintenance of the mass over the sanctity
                     of the individual. Consider this passage from one of the final letters of her northern
                     tour: <span class="quote">‘Arriving at Sleswick, the residence of Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel, the sight of
                        the soldiers recalled all the unpleasing ideas of German despotism, which imperceptibly
                        vanished as I advanced into the country. I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horrour,
                        these beings training to be sold to slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell into reflections,
                        on an old opinion of mine, that it is the preservation of the species, not of individuals,
                        which appears to be the design of the Deity throughout the whole of nature. Blossoms
                        come forth only to be blighted; fish lay their spawn where it will be devoured: and
                        what a large portion of the human race are born merely to be swept prematurely away.
                        Does not this waste of budding life emphatically assert, that it is not men, but man,
                        whose preservation is so necessary to the completion of the grand plan of the universe?
                        Children peep into existence, suffer, and die; men play like moths about a candle,
                        and sink into the flame: war, and ‘the thousand ills which flesh is heir to,’ mow
                        them down in shoals, whilst the more cruel prejudices of society palsies existence,
                        introducing not less sure, though slower decay. (179-80) ’</span> Spurred by the sight of soldiers training “to…be slaughtered,” Wollstonecraft’s mutability
                     ode traverses familiar philosophical ground, yet it does so not to promote an appreciation
                     of life as to lament the austere “design” of the living world, which sloughs off multitudes
                     of individuals through cataclysm in the name of preserving abstract “species.” However,
                     in the next section I want to consider how Wollstonecraft’s brief meditation on species
                     survival might be a product of historically contingent forces that (re)connect this
                     universalist gesture to the political time of the 1790s. The soldiers in training

                     most famous meditation on our political futurity, <em>Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch</em> (<span class="foreign">Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf</span>, 1795), a treatise not incidentally which opens by coyly punning on the “perpetual

                     </div> However, what begins as a seeming bit of cleverness gradually sounds the conceptual
                     limits of Kant’s historico-political method, for every strategic concession or attenuating
                     provision that erodes the integrity of political principle awakens the specter of
                     universal death. For instance, models of international right that safeguard the “right
                     to go to war” are, according to Kant, severely compromised, for “[i]t could be taken
                     to mean that it is perfectly just for men to adopt this attitude to destroy one another,
                     and thus find perpetual peace in the vast grave where all the horrors of violence
                     and those responsible for them would be buried” (105). Beginning with the first of
                     his 
                     “Preliminary Articles”
                      for lasting peace, Kant condemns any diplomatic treatise that merely suspends hostilities
                     between nations, but worries that “secret reservations” among the ruling parties might
                     hold open the possibility of future war, even if such a thought was heretofore unthinkable:
                     “A conclusion of peace nullifies all existing reasons for a future war, even if these
                     are not yet known to the contracting parties, and no matter how acutely and carefully
                     they may later be pieced together out of old documents. It is possible that either
                     party may make a mental reservation with a view of reviving old pretensions in the
                     future. Such reservations will not be mentioned explicitly, since both parties may
                     simply be too exhausted to continue the war, although they may nonetheless possess
                     sufficient ill will to seize the first favorable opportunity of attaining their end”
                     (93-4). Such “Jesuitical casuistry” places political expediency not simply above principle,
                     but above a commitment to perpetuity as a temporal ideal.</p>
               </div>
               <p>I call attention to this secret thought of a return to hostility, this “mental reservation”
                  rendered dormant by the fatigue of war but capable of being “pieced together” through
                  juridical-contractual remainders, because it contributes something instructive to
                  our understanding of the historical imagination of future disaster. Like Malthus,
                  Kant presumes the givenness of conflict and strife, and the six Preliminary Articles
                  thus labor to trace the negative conditions without which perpetual peace is—almost
                  literally—unthinkable. Or, put differently, holding open the thought of subsequent
                  war holds open the historical abyss of the mass grave as the limit of politics as
                  such, the “war of extermination, in which both parties and right itself might be simultaneously
                  annihilated,” allowing “perpetual peace only on the vast graveyard of the human race”
                  (96). The semantics of “perpetual peace”—the end of all hostilities, in one form or
                  another—toggles uncomfortably in the space of what must be unthought. For the Kant
                  of the unwritten critique of political reason, the question of prospective or probabilistic
                  thinking represents a watershed moment in the history of reason, albeit one tragically
                  hued. In his 1786 
                  “Conjectures on the Beginning of Human History,”
                  Kant opens the essay by questioning the wisdom of trying to imaginatively reconstruct
                  human origins (for fear the philosopher becomes a mere novelist), but eventually determines
                  that doing so is “merely…an exercise in which the imagination, supported by reason,
                  may be allowed to indulge as a healthy mental recreation” (221). Assured thus of the
                  wholesomeness of the enterprise, Kant lists “<em>anticipation of the future</em>” as a crucial early phase in the evolution of human reason out of the originary world
                  of pure instinct. Transcending the present to court the future signifies as “the most
                  decisive proof of man’s advantage, in that he is able to prepare for remote objectives
                  in keeping with his destiny” (225). However, “visuali[zing] what is yet to come, often
                  in the distant future…is also the most inexhaustible source of cares and worries which
                  an uncertain future evokes, and from which all animals are exempt”; to which Kant
                  adds, <span class="quote">‘The man who had to provide for himself, his wife, and his future children foresaw
                     the increasing laboriousness of his work; the woman foresaw the hardships to which
                     nature had subjected her sex, as well as those which the more powerful man would inflict
                     upon her. Both foresaw with apprehension, at the end of the life of toil and as yet
                     in the background of the picture, the fate which must befall all animals but which
                     causes them no concern, namely, death; and they seemed to reproach themselves for,
                     and regard as a crime, that use of reason which had brought all these ills upon them.
                     (225) ’</span> As a relationship with futurity splits humankind off from their animal brethren—a
                  separation which, in reason’s subsequent final stage, releases man from a nature he
                  now dominates to emerge an end in himself—it also confirms his wretched humanity:
                  for Kant, reason’s inevitable flirtation with the future creates an onto-historical
                  gulf that can never be recrossed. Devastated by what reason has wrought, man views
                  the fateful recognition of the future as a criminal act, an original sin. “In the
                  future,” Kant concludes, “the hardships of life would often arouse in him the wish
                  for a paradise created by his imagination, a paradise where he could dream or idle
                  away his existence in quiet inactivity and everlasting peace. But restless reason,
                  irresistibly driving him on to develop his innate capacities, stands between him and
                  that imagined seat of bliss, and does not allow him to return to the state of rude
                  simplicity from which it had originally extracted him” (226).</p>
               <p>To think of the future is thus already to think of death: to harbor a commitment to
                  future war is but to enable death’s realization on a mass scale. It follows that Kant’s
                  opposition to standing armies (the third of his Preliminary Articles) derives from
                  his prohibition on the anticipation of future war, for the Hessian brigades such as
                  Wollstonecraft observed linger as the political realization of a not-so-secret intention
                  to war. “[T]he hiring of men to kill or to be killed,” writes Kant, “seems to mean
                  using them as mere machines, and instruments in the hands of someone else (the state),
                  which cannot easily be reconciled with the rights of man in one’s own person” (95).
                  Not coincidentally, in <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> Wollstonecraft too condemns the maintenance of standing armies as “well disciplined
                  machines,” although she clearly prefers more organic metaphors for the threat to human
                  freedom embodied by such regiments: “A spirit inspired by romantic notions of honour,
                  a kind of morality founded on the fashion of the age, can only be felt by a few officers,
                  whilst the main body must be moved by command, like the waves of the sea; for the
                  strong wind of authority pushes the crowd of subalterns forward, they scarcely know
                  or care why, with headlong fury” (<em>Vindication</em> 132, 123). Wollstonecraft’s remarks concerning German soldiers “sold to slaughter”
                  might now be viewed as a concern for the unthinking movement of history toward its
                  catastrophic future. The instrumentalized soldiers are out of time, in every sense
                  of the phrase: untouched by “romantic notions of honour” or the prevailing morality
                  of the age, they are already among the dead (“they scarcely know or care why”). For
                  both Kant and Wollstonecraft, standing armies function within both species time and
                  political time, materializing the possibility of perpetual war.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But there is a question of whether the political future can truly be thought at all.
                     In <em>Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time</em>, Reinhardt Koselleck outlines how rational prognosis, inseparable from “the delicate
                     art of political calculation,” gradually supplanted prophecy as the dominant mode
                     of futural thinking in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Or as Koselleck puts
                     it, “the constant similitude of eschatological expectation is dissolved by the continued
                     novelty of time running away with itself, and prognostic attempts to contain it” (19).
                     This unbridled future time is characterized by two significant features: <span class="quote">‘[F]irst, the increasing speed with which it approaches us, and second, its unknown
                        quality. ‘Unknown’ because this accelerated time, i.e. our history, abbreviated the
                        space of experiences, robbed them of their constancy, and continually brought into
                        play new, unknown factors….This self-accelerating temporality robs the present of
                        the possibility of being experienced as the present, and escapes into a future within
                        which the currently unapprehendable present has to be captured by historical philosophy.
                        In other words, in the eighteenth century, the acceleration of time that had previously
                        belonged to eschatology became obligatory for worldly invention, before technology
                        completely opened up a space of experience adequate to this acceleration. (22) ’</span> For Koselleck, the French Revolution actualizes the experience of the new future-conditional
                     bedeviled by contingency, chance and ungrounded speculation: even as the revolution
                     required its subjects to participate in the ‘future work’ of imagining freedom, it
                     presented them with a destabilized and finally “unapprehendable” present. One can
                     already sense this temporal unease in the final chapter of <em>An Historical and Moral View</em> when Wollstonecraft’s painstaking chronicle of revolutionary “progress” abruptly stops
                     short with Louis XVI’s removal from Versailles in late 1789, only to narratively retreat
                     into a speculative history of reformist thinking from the “savage state” forward to
                     the rise of the great European metropolis. “This influence is extremely gradual,”
                     she cautions, “it requires a great deal of time,” and ultimately is no match for the
                     velocity of sociopolitical change in a modern city such as Paris, “the vortex of men
                     and things” (495, 493). This final chapter sounds a sly meditation on the forms of
                     political untimeliness that result from uneven development, for Paris, by “accelerating
                     the epocha of the revolution,” has outraced the measured progress of human emancipation,
                     leading to the out-of-joint horrors that Wollstonecraft chooses not to narrate (508).
                     In other words, <em>An Historical and Moral View</em> reaches a historiographical juncture where it cannot, or will not, keep time with
                     its subject matter.

                  <p>Wollstonecraft’s implicit temporalization of revolutionary ends recognizes what Koselleck
                     calls the shifting “planes of historicity” that characterize modern historical time:
                     “A consciousness of time and the future begins to develop in the shadows of absolutist
                     politics, first in secret, later openly, sustained by an audacious combination of
                     politics and prophecy….rational prediction and salvational expectation” (<em>Futures</em> 21). The period of revolutionary fervor was an instance, engine, and ultimately a
                     casualty of this historical speed-up, as <em>Futures Past</em> notes that a “fixation on an end-state by historical actors” produced but a “futureless
                     future,” the mechanical and mutual supersession of one historical rhythm (revolution)
                     with another (reaction) (23). That said, here and elsewhere Koselleck places inordinate
                     faith in certain forms of historical projection prior to the revolution, returning
                     frequently to a curious example that represents what he calls “the legitimate offspring
                     of historical philosophy”: Diderot’s 1774 forecast of revolution for Sweden, a prediction
                     ultimately realized in France.

                     </div> The scenario laid out by Diderot traces the arc of the revolution to come—from popular
                     resistance to the relapse into anarchy, from the coming of a transcendent national-spiritual
                     leader to world historical uncertainty—only it is introduced as an exploration of
                     the Swedish political constitution. Moreover, the prediction is twice displaced, for
                     in addition to getting the historical actors wrong, it appears in Abbe Raynal’s <em>A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans
                        in the East and West Indies</em>, albeit written in Diderot’s hand and, according to Koselleck, “smuggled anonymously

                     expansion” (2002: 138). Diderot’s speculation—often quoted in full and hailed as “one
                     of the [Enlightenment’s] greatest predictions, which has remained in the shadows of
                     anonymity and geographical camouflage” (2004: 23)—appears frequently in Koselleck’s
                     discussions of secular prophecy and crisis, primarily as an example of a prognostication
                     that fruitfully melds historical experience and “figures of argumentation…derived

                  <p>In <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em>, Wollstonecraft evinces a desire to revise her own historical itinerary: while the
                     Scandinavian tour promises to distract from her Parisian shock, she declares that
                     she might “have been less severe in the remarks I have made on the vanity and depravity
                     of the French, had I travelled toward the north before I visited France” (161).

                              “as the completion of a liberal education”: “the northern states ought to be visited
                              before the more polished parts of Europe,” in order to establish a baseline for acquiring
                              “the knowledge of manners” (162). </span></div>
                     </div> The purpose for the revision is ostensibly methodological: Wollstonecraft articulates
                     her wish to retroactively replot her course while excusing one of her more forceful
                     detours into feminist critique (“Still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim”),
                     and promising a “return to the straight road of observation” (160). In order to preserve
                     “a dispassionate view” while “trac[ing] the progress of the world’s improvement,”
                     Wollstonecraft believes she would have profited from ascending the presumptive hierarchy
                     of European civility. But the circumstances of this fantasy of transposition also
                     speak to its psychic import: France is personal, the site of a disruptive subjectivity
                     that threatens the straight road of empirical assessment. By rerouting the psychic
                     itinerary, Wollstonecraft wishes to symbolically put the therapeutic before the traumatic,
                     the redress before the wound, creating the restorative anticipation of a disaster
                     to come. However, according to a different transferential logic, the swapping of order
                     also reimagines Sweden as the space of revolutionary earliness. Wollstonecraft seems
                     to intuit and lament this logic almost immediately, as she proceeds to debunk assertions
                     that “a rising people” (i.e. Scandinavian countries) possess more natural virtue than
                     those refined cultures of some standing: “yet where has more virtuous enthusiasm been
                     displayed than during the two last years by the common people of France….I am obliged
                     to recollect the numberless instances which I have either witnessed, or heard well

                     a nation trapped in prehistoric amber, girded round by “huge, dark rocks that looked
                     like the rude materials of creation forming the barrier of unwrought space” (10).
                     Once ashore she encounters “men who remain so near brute creation, as only to exert
                     themselves to find the food necessary to sustain life” and who “have little or no
                     imagination to call forth the curiosity necessary to fructify the faint glimmerings
                     of mind which entitles them to rank as lords of the creation. Had they either, they

                     </div> As I’ve argued elsewhere, Wollstonecraft’s navigation of such radically heterogeneous
                     time within modern Europe is guided by a historiographical interest in the migration
                     of populations. Eager to corroborate monogenetic and climatological accounts of human
                     variegation, <em>Letter</em> reintegrates the fate of the species into the longue durée of planetary history, while
                     recognizing that the former is but a minor expression within the latter’s outsized
                     movements. This elongation of time diverts some of the attention away from the immediate
                     political chronologies that structure and overdetermine Wollstonecraft’s contemporaneity,
                     effectively suspending the incursion of the future. For instance, in Letter V she
                     remarks, no doubt with Linnaeus in mind, that “Sweden appeared to me the country in
                     the world most proper to form the botanist and natural historian: every object seemed
                     to remind me of the creation of things, of the first efforts of sportive nature” (40).
                     To view the world with Linnaean eyes is to participate in a recent and critical reorganization
                     of enlightenment historiography, yet Wollstonecraft’s Sweden so obsessively figures
                     the origins of things—at once the source of nature, and the “natural history” that
                     would give it meaning—that one senses a form of history in retreat.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But I want to imagine for a moment that Wollstonecraft’s fixation on origins might
                     also be a vision of post-disaster, in the sense that every one of these founding images
                     restages the possibility of renewal for the melancholic. I see this less as a counterpoint
                     to the failure of the progress narrative, and more a constitutive psychic stratagem
                     for its maintenance. “The more I see of the world,” writes Wollstonecraft early in
                     her travels, “the more I am convinced that civilization is a blessing not sufficiently
                     estimated by those who have not traced its progress” (20). While such a tracing “enables
                     us to retain the primitive delicacy of our sensations,” it also reveals the psychic
                     work performed by the imagination: <span class="quote">‘Without the aid of the imagination all the pleasures of the senses must sink into
                        grossness, unless continual novelty serve as a substitute for the imagination, which
                        being impossible, it was to this weariness, I suppose, that Solomon alluded when he
                        declared that there was nothing new under the sun!—nothing for the common sensations
                        excited by the senses. Yet who will deny that the imagination and understanding have
                        made many, very many discoveries since those days, which only seem harbingers of others
                        still more noble and beneficial. (20) ’</span> Wollstonecraft’s reflections anticipate Malthus on the necessity of regular exertion
                     and variety, only here the imagination compensates for what experience cannot deliver
                     (“continual novelty”), presumably by “discovering” anew what is admittedly “impossible.”
                     Of course, the Solomonic pronouncement in Ecclesiastes 1 speaks to the cyclical, repetitive
                     nature of earthly life and the futility that follows from the knowledge of purposeless
                     time: what has been will be again, generations of humankind will be swept away and
                     the earth will abide. But Wollstonecraft cites specifically the “weariness” of Solomon’s
                     recognition—“All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied
                     with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing” (1.8)— thus underscoring how this is
                     the melancholic’s verse par excellence: <span class="quote">‘<span class="hi">16.</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate and have gotten
                        more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart had
                        great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <span class="hi">17.</span> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that
                        this also is vexation of spirit. <span class="hi">18. </span>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
                        (Ecclesiastes 1.16-18)’</span> Wollstonecraft in Scandinavia is a distressed historical subject, uncertain less of
                     her place than her <em>time</em> in the world, and thus hostage to an existential passivity in the face of imminent
                     historical return.

                  you done to gain knowledge of the disaster? <br/> Maurice Blanchot, <em>The Writing of the Disaster</em> (3)</blockquote>
               <p>What <em>has</em> Mary Wollstonecraft done to gain knowledge of disaster? Let us look at how she understands
                  the aftermath of a devastating event in order to venture an answer. Near the end of
                  her Scandinavian tour, on the highway to Copenhagen, Wollstonecraft observes a vast
                  plain hosting what seems a motley village of tents, and idly wonders whether the “rage
                  for encampments” (i.e. recreational camping) had reached Denmark. Arriving at the
                  capital however, she learns that a massive three-day fire destroyed well over nine
                  hundred buildings in the city, leaving thousands of residents homeless and adrift.
                  Here is her description of entering the ravaged city: <span class="quote">‘Entering soon after, I passed amongst the dust and rubbish it had left, affrighted
                     by viewing the extent of the devastation; for at least a quarter of the city had been
                     destroyed. There was little in the appearance of fallen bricks and stacks of chimneys
                     to allure the imagination into soothing melancholy reveries; nothing to attract the
                     eye of taste, but much to afflict the benevolent heart. The depredations of time have
                     always something in them to employ the fancy, or lead to musing on subjects which,
                     withdrawing the mind from objects of sense, seem to give it new dignity: but here
                     I was treading on live ashes. The sufferers were still under the pressure of misery
                     occasioned by this dreadful conflagration. I could not take refuge in the thought:
                     <em>they suffered—but they are no</em> <em>more!</em> a reflection I frequently summon to calm my mind, when sympathy rises to anguish:
                     I therefore desired, the driver to hasten to the hotel recommended to me, that I might
                     avert my eyes, and snap the train of thinking which had sent me into all the corners
                     of the city, in search of houseless heads. (149)’</span> Wollstonecraft’s is a strange and telling kind of equivocation and evasion. Noticeably
                  mystified by the disaster’s presentness—its still-warm organic life, its importunate
                  objects of sense—Wollstonecraft craves the consolations of historical distance and
                  the resulting decathexis that will ensure a tidy aesthetic experience. There is an
                  indignity in the proximity and persistence of suffering: with “nothing to attract
                  the eye of taste,” it is best to “avert [one’s] eyes” altogether. Best to seek refuge
                  from the refugees for fear that the imagination may begin to house the homeless. However,
                  I am struck particularly by what Wollstonecraft reveals to be her customary response
                  to disastrous events (“they suffered—but they are no more!”), its semantic import
                  flickering uncomfortably between relief from suffering in life, or in death. The lingering
                  possibility that Wollstonecraft takes affective “refuge” in mass death haunts the
                  passage. Catastrophe offers a ready-made melancholic withdrawal into the consolations
                  of negation, where the fresh ruins and visibly displaced of Copenhagen press urgently
                  for a response that she is unprepared to deliver.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Clearly, Wollstonecraft’s reaction to the Copenhagen fire reveals her psychic discomfort
                     with the immediate past: sympathy now too easily rises to anguish, and anguish requires
                     something catastrophic to be pacified. Catastrophe looms thus as a welcome limit to
                     thought, summoned even to calm the mind: it is strategically <em>not</em> experience, but rather a retreat from experience into the non-experience of the other
                     committed to death. Here we find something akin to Blanchot’s insistence that “Consciousness
                     can be catastrophic without ceasing to be consciousness; it…welcomes into itself this
                     overturning” (49). This incorporation of catastrophe into consciousness—paradoxically,
                     to relieve “the pressure of misery”—redoubles the event structure of disaster <em>as</em> thought itself. Blanchot’s <em>The Writing of the Disaster</em> may seem an odd interlocutor to summon here, but his intimation that there is no final
                     writing of disaster, only a series of feints, equivocations, and paradoxes that give
                     the event its outside, captures something in Wollstonecraft’s writing of (disastrous)
                     history: ultimately, states Blanchot, “[w]e are passive with respect to the disaster,
                     but the disaster is perhaps passivity, and thus past, always past, even in the past,
                     out of date” (3). Wollstonecraft’s retreat from the prospect of charitable action
                     signals her own version of historico-sympathetic passivity: suggestively, Blanchot
                     writes of the ontological quandaries of “infinite aid” in the aftermath of disaster,
                     an unlimited call that strips each of his or her singularity, causing the charitable
                     agent “to disappear in the infinite movement of service” (21).

               <p>Copenhagen has become inhospitable not merely for its unhoused citizens, but for the
                  sympathizing outsider unwilling to tread on live ashes. The following morning Wollstonecraft
                  notes that she is already “weary of observing the ravages,” and while admitting that
                  she has encountered the city “in a very disadvantageous light, some of the best streets
                  having been burnt and the whole place thrown into confusion” (149), she grumbles that
                  she “saw nothing to rouse the idea of elegance or grandeur,” save for the Royal Palace
                  (150). But this is not an immaterial exception, for the Palace was itself destroyed
                  by a previous fire “about two years ago” and now stands a handsome, nearly empty,
                  shell of itself. Subsequently, <span class="quote">‘a great number of the poor, during the late fire, took refuge in its ruins, till
                     they could find some other abode. Beds were thrown on the landing places of the grand
                     stair-case, where whole families crept from the cold, and every little nook is boarded
                     up as a retreat for some poor creatures deprived of their home. At present a roof
                     may be sufficient to shelter them from the night air; but as the season advances,
                     the extent of the calamity will be more severely felt. (150) ’</span> I want to linger a moment in the repurposing of these ruins, for not only does the
                  image of the poor taking up tenancy in the royal quarters coyly re-cite the much-debated
                  primal scene of Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>, but it does so in the shadow of cyclical devastation. The details of Wollstonecraft’s
                  portrait (e.g. the beds on the grand stair; the occupied “little nooks,” the winter
                  draughts, etc.) suggest that she has not averted her eyes from this scene. This is
                  curious, since these are the same victims of the conflagration that she chose to disregard
                  a day earlier, only now they are lodged in an earlier and more symbolically freighted
                  wreckage. However, this is a distinctly <em>modern</em> ruin—built in the 1750s and gutted by flames in February 1794—and as such it flickers
                  as a figure of historical intermittence: liberated from its original context by disaster,
                  the space (a space) has been opened up for imagining a world historically otherwise.</p>
               <p>These observations regarding the Royal Palace recall attention to how often during
                  her <em>Letters</em> Wollstonecraft tours empty estates, vacancies that require little by way of imagination
                  to seem remainders of a world recently lost. Compare the above with Wollstonecraft’s
                  visit a few days later to the vacant, muséal chambers of the Rosenborg Castle. Wollstonecraft
                  reports feeling “the vacuum left by departed greatness,” only to populate the emptiness
                  with specters: “It seemed a vast tomb, full of shadowy phantoms of those who had played
                  or toiled their hour out….Could they be no more—to whom my imagination thus gave life?
                  Could the thoughts, of which there remained many vestiges, have vanished quite away?
                  And these beings, composed of such noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they
                  only melted into the elements to keep in motion the grand mass of life?” (165). Earlier
                  she visits one of “only two…estates of any magnitude in Norway,” now unoccupied and
                  neglected by its absent lord, and productive of “a stupid kind of sadness, to my eye”:
                  “I enter as I would into the tomb of the Capulets, to look at the family pictures
                  that here frown in armour, or smile in ermine. The mildew respects not the lordly
                  robe; and the worm riots unchecked on the cheek of beauty” (84). Walking the arbors
                  of the latter at night, Wollstonecraft finds herself in the thrall of an unusual reverie,
                  for “Not nymphs, but philosophers, seem to inhabit them—ever musing” (85).</p>
               <p>These are haunted quarters, but they house more than specters of the past. They are
                  spaces of persevering thought (“noble materials of thinking and feeling”); or, for
                  Wollstonecraft, thoughts of perseverance. In a reflection that anticipates her pre-Malthusian
                  population terror, Wollstonecraft remarks how she keeps time with the spectral philosophers
                  of the arboretum: “How often do my feelings produce ideas that remind me of the origin
                  of many poetical fictions. In solitude, the imagination bodies forth its conceptions
                  unrestrained, and stops enraptured to adore the beings of its own creation” (85).
                  The imagination that “bodies forth” and adores its own ghosts possesses the power
                  to remake the world in thought after the thought of its end. Here we find the “principle
                  of population” as an act of sympathetic imagination, a reminder that Wollstonecraft’s
                  imperiled “fellow creatures, yet unborn” merely consolidate the consciousness of the
                  future as so many empathic figures. As Frances Ferguson writes of the rhetoric of
                  nuclear sublimity, “To think the thought of the ‘unborn’ may represent the achievement
                  of the sublime project to find objects of consciousness that definitively cannot exist
                  in the absence of the perceiving subject, but the residual horror of the notion of
                  the ‘unborn’ lies in the way the argument for the existence of generations now living
                  lies in our mere instrumentality” (8). Of course, Wollstonecraft doesn’t shepherd
                  forth the unborn for rhetorical effect, but she does experience the horror, but perhaps
                  also the necessity, of her own instrumentality. In one of the more famous scenes in
                  <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em>, Wollstonecraft visits a Norwegian church and is shown into a “little recess full
                  of coffins” containing nameless and mummified bodies. Horrified at this “treason against
                  humanity,” Wollstonecraft, as usual, recovers only by insisting on the solace of thinking
                  historically: “The contemplation of noble ruins produces a melancholy that exalts
                  the mind.—We take a retrospect of the exertions of man, the fate of empires and their
                  rulers; and marking the grand destruction of ages, it seems the necessary change of
                  time leading to improvement” (71). But the exaltation triggered by recounting “the
                  grand destruction of ages” cannot long keep mortality in abeyance: “Life, what art
                  thou? Where goes this breath? this <em>I</em>, so much alive? In what element will it mix, giving or receiving fresh energy?—What
                  will break the enchantment of animation?—For worlds, I would not see a form I loved—embalmed
                  in my heart—thus sacrilegiously handled!” (71). The scene makes clear the distinction
                  between the projective and the preservational, between “this <em>I</em>, so much alive” and searching for a sustaining “element,” and the horrid figures
                  of conservation, history as embalmment. It is only the mind alive to thinking beyond
                  disaster that can ensure “the necessary change of time leading to improvement”: just
                  as Wollstonecraft’s visionary distress off the coast of Arendal imagines perfect cultivation
                  and universal famine in the same moving instant, so too does the spectacle of so many
                  dead, so many noble ruins, harbor within it the thought of life.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">V. Coda</span></h2>
               <p>In the letter to M. Talleyrand-Périgord that opens her <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (1792), Wollstonecraft dedicates her volume to the French minister of finance, but
                  in exchange asks that he “maturely weigh” her propositions regarding the rights of
                  woman and national education. She claims to argue as “a disinterested spirit” (“I
                  plead for my sex—not for myself”), and then decorates her point with an image that
                  provides a convenient measure of how her unsettling experience in France would alter
                  her perception: "Independence I have long considered as the grand blessing of life,
                  the basis of every virtue—and independence I will ever secure by contracting my wants,
                  though I were to live on a barren heath" (101). Here, in the still heady days of revolutionary
                  promise, Wollstonecraft’s confidence is troped as self-sufficiency, her impartiality
                  as emotional parsimony. Of course, by summer 1795 her affective life is catastrophically
                  dilated, pried open by so many personal and political disappointments. The empty,
                  inhospitable heath that once served as the expressive limit of her optimism, now looms
                  as the future’s mass grave.</p>
               <p>Curiously, in Kant’s <em>Perpetual Peace,</em> the famous right to resort and cosmopolitan hospitality is grounded in a rather astonishing
                  bit of spatial literalism: such rights are secured by virtue of humankind’s communal
                  possession of the earth’s surface, and “[s]ince the earth is a globe, they cannot
                  disperse over an infinite area, but must necessarily tolerate one another’s company”
                  (106). Kant acknowledges that there are inhospitable and “uninhabitable parts of the
                  earth’s surface such as oceans and deserts,” but ships and camels (!) allow access
                  to even these “ownerless tracts” (106). It is significant that both Kant and Wollstonecraft
                  are imagining the problem of finite space in 1795, and while Kant’s globe provides
                  the theoretical justification for hospitality toward the stranger, Wollstonecraft—who
                  understands her own travels as those of a stranger—is demonstrably wary of hospitality,
                  those kindnesses “too much praised by travelers as a proof of goodness of heart” (21;
                  see also 162). But <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em> finally appeals to a more profound form of hospitable relation, one that is open
                  to the arrival of the disaster. For it is only by welcoming that dread future that
                  we can think the future at all.</p>

               may be melancholy to-morrow. Now all my nerves keep time with the melody of nature.
               Ah! let me be happy whilst I can. The tear starts as I think of it. I must fly from
               thought, and find refuge from sorrow in a strong imagination—the only solace for a

               Traitorous Correspondence Bill of 1793, delivering vital goods to revolutionary France
               through the neutral ports of the north. One of Imlay’s ships carrying valuable French
               silver and plate (a ship rechristened <em>Maria and Margaretha</em> after Wollstonecraft and her maid) disappeared outside Arendal and was reported sunk.
               Suspecting a double-cross, Imlay sent Wollstonecraft to Scandinavia as his legal representative
               in a suit against the ship’s captain. See Favret, 1993: 97-8.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">As will become clear below, this question of the undetermined time of deliverance
               troubles post-Paris Wollstonecraft most acutely. Not incidentally, in 
               “The Contest of the Faculties”
               Kant reflects on the still unresolved revolution in France (it “may succeed, or it
               may fail”), and asserts that no matter the historical reckoning, “I maintain that
               this revolution has aroused in the hearts and desires of all spectators who are not
               themselves caught up in it a <em>sympathy</em> which borders almost on enthusiasm, although the very utterance of this sympathy
               was fraught with danger” (
               “Contest”
               182).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">“But because there is in our Imagination a striving towards infinite progress, and
               in our Reason a claim for absolute totality, regarded as a real Idea, therefore this
               very inadequateness for that Idea in our faculty for estimating the magnitude of things
               of sense, excites in us the feeling of a supersensible faculty. And it is not the
               object of sense, but the use which the Judgment naturally makes of certain objects
               on behalf of this latter feeling, that is absolutely great; and in comparison every
               other use is small….<em>the sublime is that, the mere ability to think which, shows a faculty of the mind
                  surpassing every standard of Sense</em>” (<em>Critique</em> 109-10).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">For recent critical reflections on the role that conjectural history plays in the
               development of the human and social sciences, see Palmeri. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">Perhaps befitting for a man who is managing his own grief through feverish writing
               and editing, Godwin frequently measures Wollstonecraft’s shifting psychological condition
               by means of her intellectual output. For instance, as her romance with Henry Fuseli
               is slowly deteriorating, Godwin notes that “she produced nothing, except a few articles
               in the Analytical Review” over a twelve month period (82). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">Godwin recounts a particular moment along the <span class="foreign">Place de Louis Quinze</span> when Wollstonecraft, pregnant with Fanny Imlay, happened upon a public execution,
               “the blood of the guillotine appear[ing] fresh upon the pavement.” “The emotions of
               her soul burst forth in indignant exclamations,” Godwin writes, “while a prudent bystander
               warned her of her danger, and intreated her to hasten and hide her discontents” (89).
               Godwin notes that the precarious political situation in France—e.g. the rise and cruelties
               of Robespierre; the execution of Girondin leaders Brissot and Vergniaud (the news
               of which produced “one of the most intolerable sensations she had ever experienced”),
               etc.—“contributed to banish tranquility from the first months of her pregnancy” (89).
               Here and elsewhere Godwin slyly suggests the imprinting of historical trauma onto
               Wollstonecraft’s pregnancy.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8.. </span><span class="noteBody">Of course, Wollstonecraft was in some sense “radicalized” well before the Fall of
               the Bastille, for by the mid 1780s she had come under the influence of the Dissenting
               clergyman Dr. Richard Price and within a few years she was regularly writing and translating
               for Joseph Johnson’s radical publishing house. See Furniss 59. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">I am drawn to Blanchot’s conceptualization of disaster as imminence without a future
               as a way of understanding Wollstonecraft’s pervasive sense of temporal destabilization.
               Blanchot writes, “We are on the edge of disaster without being able to situate it
               in the future: it is rather always already past, and yet we are on the edge or under
               the threat, all formulations which would imply the future—that which is yet to come—if
               the disaster were not that which does not come, that which has put a stop to every
               arrival. To think the disaster (if this is possible, and it is not possible inasmuch
               as we suspect that the disaster is thought) is to have no longer any future in which
               to think it” (1). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               open all the sores and blotches of humanity with the same calmness and alacrity as

               of perfectibilian fantasies. Complaining of the “fastidious microscopic eye of short-sighted
               men” looking for perfection, Malthus celebrates the telescopic eye of the realist:
               “Uniform, undiversified perfection could not possess the same awakening powers. When
               we endeavour then to contemplate the system of the universe, when we think of the
               stars as the suns of other systems scattered throughout infinite space, when we reflect
               that we do not probably see a millionth part of those bright orbs that are beaming
               light and life to unnumbered worlds, when our minds, unable to grasp the immeasurable
               conception, sink, lost and confounded, in admiration at the mighty incomprehensible
               power of the Creator, let us not querulously complain that all climates are not equally
               genial, that perpetual spring does not reign throughout the year, that all God’s creatures
               do not possess some advantages, that clouds and tempests sometimes darken the natural
               world and vice and misery the moral world, and that all the works of creation are
               not formed with equal perfection” (211-12). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               a false sense of financial security, leading to careless decisions about their reproductive
               lives (e.g. they marry sooner, reproduce more, labor less, starve more). The argument
               depends on a familiar psychological portrait of the laboring class in the thrall of
               immediate gratification and lacking moral restraint, a condition that means “[t]heir
               present wants employ their whole attention, and they seldom think of the future” (98).
               Conditioned by a life of struggle and penury to a present alert only to the immediate
               needs of the body, they would be unwilling or unable to save “a part of their high
               wages [e.g. from relief] for the future support of their families, instead spending

               to reappropriate their rights. But since there is neither goal nor plan, slavery relapses
               in an instant into anarchy. Within the heart of this general tumult there can be heard
               but one cry: ‘Freedom!’ But how can this valuable thing be secured? Nobody knows.
               And soon the people are divided into various factions, eaten up with contradictory
               interests....After a short while there are only two factions within the state; they
               distinguish themselves by two names, under which all necessarily have to include themselves:
               ‘Royalist’ and ‘Antiroyalist.’ This is the moment of violent commotion. The moment
               of plotting and conspiracy….In this, royalism serves as a subterfuge as much as antiroyalism.
               Both are masks for ambition and covetousness. The nation now is merely an entity dependent
               upon a collection of criminals and corrupt persons. In this situation only one man

               in relationship to how she understands universal history. For instance, in Letter
               XIV she remarks on an unfulfilled desire to travel to the rustic northern country
               of Norway: <span class="quote">‘You will ask, perhaps, why I wished to go further northward. Why? [N]ot only because
                  the country, from all I can gather, is most romantic, abounding in forests and lakes,
                  and the air pure, but I have heard much of the intelligence of the inhabitants, substantial
                  farmers, who have none of that cunning to contaminate their simplicity….The description
                  I received of them carried me back to the fables of the golden age: independence and
                  virtue; affluence without vice; cultivation of mind, without depravity of heart; with
                  “ever smiling liberty,’ the nymph of the mountain.—I want faith! My imagination hurries
                  me forward to seek asylum in such a retreat from all the disappointments I am threatened
                  with; but reason drags me back, whispering that the world is still the world, and
                  man the same compound of weakness and folly (127-28).’</span> It is no doubt significant that this vision of the golden age is produced not by
               experience, but by hearsay and a longing to be otherwise: Wollstonecraft’s symptomatic
               outburst (“I want faith!”) prompts the telltale “hurrying” of her imagination out
               of herself into a future that is a past. But oddly her imagination propels her “<em>forward</em> to seek asylum in such a retreat” (although the description she heard “carried [her]
               <em>back</em> to…the golden age”), while reasons drags her <em>back</em> to her contemporary moment. Without making too much of this adverbial confusion,
               the slippage here begins to measure something of Wollstonecraft’s disorientation in
               time, even as it captures Kant’s sense above of “restless reason…stand[ing] between
               [her] and that imagined seat of bliss, and does not allow [her] to return to the state
               of rude simplicity.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               letters before her lament for her “fellow creatures, yet unborn” she is again at sea,
               literally and figuratively, and indulges a “pleasing forgetfulness.” She observes,
               “How fallacious! yet, without hope, what is to sustain life, but the fear of annihilation—the
               only thing of which I have ever felt a dread—I cannot bear to think of being no more—of
               losing myself—though existence is often but a painful consciousness of misery; nay,
               it appears to me impossible that I should cease to exist, or that this active, restless
               spirit, equally alive to joy and sorrow, should only be organized dust—ready to fly
               abroad the moment the spring snaps, or the spark goes out, which kept it together.
               Surely something resides in this heart that is not perishable—and life is more than
               a dream” (76). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
