               <blockquote class="quote">Disaster (<em>OED</em>): Anything that befalls of ruinous or distressing nature; a sudden or great misfortune,
                  mishap, or misadventure; a calamity.</blockquote>
               <p>In an entry in her journals about her brother’s struggles with writing 
                  “The Pedlar”
                  , Dorothy Wordsworth notes: “Wm very ill, employed with the pedlar . . . Disaster
                  pedlar” (96). The evocation here of grievous embodiment in a figure typically defined
                  as one of the hallmarks of Wordsworth’s literary personae gives rise to several perspectives
                  that bear on the persistence of calamity in romantic thought. Dorothy elucidates a
                  figure of and for imminent disaster that seems proper to the act of reading itself:
                  enigmatically foretelling a disaster that Wordsworth in his numerous revisions of
                  the Pedlar narrative had sought to control and shape, her words have the effect of
                  bearing witness to an event she cannot fully know or summon into clarity. Much like
                  Benjamin’s angel who looks back at the debris of history while being drawn forward
                  into a future tense inscribed by the unknowability of the past, the pedlar is hallucinated
                  as the promise of an exemplary persona whose task is impossibly to ameliorate the
                  ruination that emerges in the witnessing or reading of the poem. Yet Dorothy's comment
                  points to the undoing of this scenario, for the pedlar's potentially angelic vocation
                  is disarrayed as he becomes a disaster, a persona that incorporates and transmits
                  the horror of what he sees.</p>
               <p>Here, text produces a referentiality that seemingly lives beyond it while at the same
                  time seeping outward as an event that is necessarily tied to linguistic deferral.</p>
               <p>How and why does a text generate this “necessity” of catastrophe? In Paul de Man’s
                  classic essay, 
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                  , the poet emerges as the material precipitate of processes of fragmentation, erosion,
                  and drowning in 
                  “The Triumph of Life”
                  , which ineluctably participate in a canonical monumentalization of the poem that
                  cannot be freed from the critique of those processes themselves (de Man). At once
                  on the page and away from the page, the “body” of Shelley is what is different from
                  language <em>and</em> posited by linguistic cueing—a phantom excess or catastrophic materiality that is
                  intrinsic to the reading of the poem. Similarly, Dorothy’s reading returns us to the
                  scene of disaster as both the future and present of a condition of reading and interpretation.
                  In this way, the pedlar might very well signal less something wicked this way coming
                  than a conceptual dissonance that implicitly sustains the life-world of romanticism
                  and which cannot be accounted for.</p>
               <p>This optic suggests that the emergence of the pedlar is partly in line with the form
                  of traumatism Derrida defines as the fear of the yet-to-come, or the possibility of
                  some greater catastrophe ever about to occur despite the sense that it has already
                  taken place. This hope, in turn, is not easily distinguished from Derrida's treatment
                  of the messianic orientation to the to-come, hinting that in his work, as well as
                  in the romanticism it inherits, the promise of a certain futurity is always shadowed
                  by its catastrophic counterpart in a pairing that ruins the very temporalities through
                  which we might attempt to manage disaster and its aftermaths. Accordingly, in the
                  pages that follow, we have sought to think about how romanticism endures or bears
                  with (a term central to Rei Terada’s article) the difficulties of defining <em>what</em> constitutes a disaster and what kinds of changes it can provoke in social, political,
                  epistemological, and ethical life. After all, if disaster etymologically suggests
                  a disorientation of place in relation to the stars, this loss of footing is less about
                  a saturation in despair than a recognition of how the attending disappointments, reaction-formations,
                  and imperilling states of disastrous experience might signal a vital rethinking of
                  the untapped powers that lie amidst the ruins. The pedlar can be at once a threat
                  <em>and</em> an invitation to stare a bit longer at the valuable consequences that lie in reorganizing
                  ourselves to a catastrophic reality that is not meant to be withstood but rather accepted
                  as our ineluctable present.</p>
               <p>The possibility of exploring these powers of acceptance is not entirely new to romanticism;
                  indeed, for centuries British subjects had taken for granted the necessity of enduring
                  catastrophic events - plague, famine, flood, drought - as an inherent part of human
                  vulnerability. Yet as the institutions of modern governmentality begin to emerge,
                  such events appear more negotiable than before; the narrator of Daniel Defoe's <em>A Journal of a Plague Year</em> oscillates between reading the plague as a visitation of divine will and a medical
                  condition whose spread could at least be partially prevented through better measures
                  on the part of the London municipal authorities. Catastrophic events, it seems, are
                  in part cosmically given and in part subject to human intervention. Although a similar
                  ambivalence remained in force through the romantic era and well beyond, the increasing
                  confidence of medical practitioners, the growth in population, the shift toward a
                  more secular and humanistic ethos, and the impress of Enlightenment demands for better
                  governance cast new doubt on the necessity of disaster, giving a different tone to
                  the collective response to destructive events. What might have previously been spoken
                  of as an intractable dimension of divine will was now read as a potentially negotiable
                  aspect of human biology or public governance; the recurrence of such events thus pointed
                  either to the need for further enlightenment and reform or to a fault endemic to the
                  public order itself. The fierce political debates that emerged during the famine of
                  the mid 1790s, for example, shortly before Wordsworth labored on <em>The Ruined Cottage</em>, debates that often invoked notions of natural law (as in Edmund Burke's 
                  “Thoughts and Details on Scarcity”
                  ) or of common right to subsistence from the land (as in John Thelwall's <em>The Tribune</em>), demonstrate how far Britain had moved into a secular, political idiom.</p>
               <p>Yet the adoption of such an idiom inspired others to extend it, to ponder the systematic
                  recurrence of general distress, leading T. R. Malthus to argue in 1798 that the "checks
                  to population" - war, famine, and plague - arise from population's endless pressure
                  to exceed the limits of subsistence. In this view, disaster is a symptom of a certain
                  disorder in the biological preconditions of human life as such, a disorder that he
                  attempts to recuperate as a spur to human labor and ingenuity, in the mode of a secular
                  theodicy, but which nevertheless speaks of a new possibility - that the domain over
                  which medicine, governance, and political economy sought to exert their sway might
                  be shaped by a constitutive contradiction, a non-negotiable incoherence that no administrative
                  effort could finally extirpate, a fault in things that shatters even a secular theodicy.
                  By the end of the eighteenth century, it became conceivable that rather than consisting
                  of singular events, disaster was endemic to the human itself. As a result, while the
                  apparently rational institutions of the modern state promised to remove certain domains
                  - subsistence, reproduction, and public health - from the vagaries of divine will,
                  the persistence of collective distress suggested that those domains were subject to
                  equally intractable forces now rooted not in divine alterity but in natural law.</p>
               <p>A similar development took place as students of "the history of the earth" gradually
                  articulated the elements of modern geological knowledge: by the late eighteenth century,
                  natural disaster and vast extinction, rather than being exceptional events, were conceived
                  as taking place frequently across the immense reaches of earth's history. Indeed,
                  as Scott Juengel suggests, Malthus may not entirely be a theorist of catastrophe due
                  to his avoidance of the exception in favor of “a mathematical horizon and the inevitability
                  of time and instinct.” This awareness confronted late-eighteenth century people with
                  a systematic catastrophe even less tractable than demographic crisis, less amenable
                  to governmental intervention. If on some level geological crises could be explained
                  with reference to fundamental natural laws, on another they revealed a primal fault
                  in the preconditions of human life, creating another obstacle to the formation of
                  a secular theodicy. Enlightenment investigation, in short, ultimately exposed a fault
                  in the anchoring terms of the secular order itself, in nature and the human. One might
                  almost say that as a result, only at this point was disaster truly disastrous, for
                  only now was it possible to face the prospect of enduring it without recourse and
                  without appeal.</p>
               <p>Yet even this notion of the non-negotiable disaster found its place within scenarios
                  that in various ways attempted to confirm the ascendancy of governance or of a certain
                  rationality. Malthus himself, for example, sought to learn the lessons of disaster
                  and to modify the policies of the British state accordingly, encouraging it to revise
                  its laws regarding the provision of aid to the poor (as it did in the Poor Law Amendment
                  Act of 1834). The implacable laws of nature, in his view, justified the state's adopting
                  only apparently inhumane and draconian policies of its own. The sublation of disaster
                  into public policy created what one might regard, <span class="foreign">contra</span> Malthus, as a kind of disastrous state. But others in the period explored rather
                  different strategies. In his analytic of the sublime, Kant suggested that the mind
                  encountering any excessively vast or powerful aspect of nature could overleap that
                  threat and identify with its own capacity to conceive of the infinite, effectively
                  mapping out a strategy whereby the mind could assure itself of its dominance over
                  even the most implacably hostile aspects of nature. Rather than attempting to provide
                  a theological or governmental response to devastation, Kant in fact left empirical
                  devastation in place, superseding it not by imagining any historically actual resolution
                  but by creating a new category of solace, the mind's reassurance of its destination
                  in a zone beyond any empirically available experience. In effect, he created a new
                  secular theodicy, an identification with the mind's transcendence, whereby one could
                  face with equanimity any actually devastating experience by keeping in mind that even
                  it could not fundamentally alter one's supersensible origin and end. The cost of such
                  a strategy, however, is that it located human dignity in a space so remote from actual
                  suffering that it left the latter in place, largely unchallenged, cutting that solace
                  off from the suffering body and embodied mind that needed it most. The attempt to
                  overleap disaster by sublating it into governance or by resorting to the virtual category
                  of the mind's transcendence both failed to dislodge disaster from its newly provocative
                  and difficult position as the obstacle to secular theodicy or to a rationally redemptive
                  historiography, for these strategies either gave disaster even more force or provided
                  an exit strategy from a history where it continued to hold sway.</p>
               <p>In the wake of these and other developments, Wordsworth's labor on <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> takes on new weight, for a figure who at once bears and embodies the disaster takes
                  the measure of an unyielding negativity without attempting to sublate it into a new
                  mode of governance or a new philosophical category. Under the new conditions of secular
                  knowledge and governance, the capacity to abide <em>with</em> and <em>as</em> disaster has new and surprising resonances. Although the pedlar does conclude his
                  tale with a consoling meditation, those lines remain embedded in the context of the
                  story of Margaret's suffering and point back to it, remaining vulnerable to a countervailing
                  interpretation of her tale. Indeed, Wordsworth's very difficulty in composing this
                  conclusion, or rather in deciding how to bridge the gap between the affective resonances
                  of suffering and of consolation, led to the perpetual crisis of composing this poem,
                  to William's illness, and eventually to Dorothy's designation of "Disaster pedlar."
                  In effect, Dorothy's gesture of naming the pedlar in this way suggests that how to
                  respond to a disastrous world is itself an ongoing compositional, affective, aesthetic
                  disaster, one that admits of no resolution, that disables, even as it effects, the
                  task of interpretation. In that case, however, the emergence of this figure exceeds
                  its contexts, recasting the various discourses it evokes to undermine the explanatory
                  virtues of historical location per se. This disabling element extends as well to our
                  reading: the poem never makes clear what referential scenario we are to privilege
                  as we comprehend it, on what ontological level we are to locate the disaster it addresses,
                  nor how exactly to conceive of disaster itself. Placed within and against its manifold
                  contexts, <em>The Ruined Cottage</em> thus indicates that romanticism takes as its point of departure these very difficulties.
                  Here and elsewhere, romanticism maps out what we might now recognize as a negative
                  dialectics, one that refuses the stratagems of sublation as long as a certain catastrophic
                  materiality remains in force, and a negative historicity, one that invokes yet refuses
                  historical location. In its hesitations, impasses, and foreclosures, this poem outlines
                  an aesthetics not of failure but of rigorous resistance to a false redemption, indeed
                  to theodicy itself, one that ultimately hopes not to evade what it sees in disaster
                  but to dwell with it, bear with it, and thus to find in this very abiding its own
                  mode of impossible consolation.</p>
               <p>Our reading of the disastrous pedlar thus suggests that if romanticism has often been
                  defined as a being-in-the-world that coincides with liberal processes of secularization,
                  increased progress, and amelioration, then it would appear that reading romanticism
                  through its capacity to dwell with disaster attends to the ways in which optimistic
                  revelation is split or <em>displaced</em> (an etymological improvisation on <span class="foreign">désastre</span>—“from the stars”) by the “traumatic kernel,” as Žižek would put it (<em>For They Know Not</em> 102), which influences the romantic projects that continue to make a claim on our
                  contemporary thinking. It is the task of this special issue to approach the problem
                  of reading the romantic varieties of disaster and to engage a host of attending issues.
                  What are the social, historical, and political conditions or possibilities of living
                  amidst devastation? How does one recognize such devastation in the first place, and
                  what are the criteria through which it is posited? What is a crisis, and what kinds
                  of temporal changes does it occasion? What can be philosophically gained or lost by
                  analyzing disaster in its numerous sites, contexts, and instances? Anecdotally, the
                  idea for this issue emerged out of our felt experience of the topicality of disaster
                  in our own post-9/11 “dark times”; and yet, to quickly say that “disaster” is the
                  <span class="foreign">zeitgeist</span> of our age evokes an amnesiac, anxious belief (as Timothy Morton argues in his essay)
                  that a holistic world <em>was</em> at some point possible and has been recently rent asunder. The nostalgic leitmotif
                  here seems to avoid the more critical intervention made by many romantic texts that
                  disaster has already phenomenally occurred within our social, political, and cultural
                  structures and that perpetually attempting to sift the real from the imagined disasters
                  fails to plumb the depths of what we assume “befalls” us. It also turns away from
                  providing challenging responses and intellectual reorientations to catastrophic events.
                  “A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee
                  a longer recession,” said Barack Obama on February 4, 2009, “a less robust recovery,
                  and a more uncertain future . . . . That's why I feel such a sense of urgency about
                  the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan." The urgency of the request is underwritten
                  by the sense that impending dissolution is the likely terminus that can be avoided
                  by skirting inaction and passivity—failures to “act now,” in other words, are what
                  turn crisis into catastrophe, but what is missing from Obama’s measurement is the
                  more jarring sense that the crisis has always already been here, and that guarantees
                  for normative restoration and reconstitution are themselves consequences of an inability
                  to develop modes of thought and agency that desist from the “catastrophic imperative”
                  (Hoens et al.) that structures us already.</p>
               <p>We have purposely left “disaster” open as a complex term in order not to narrow it
                  to any one approach, standard, or form of evaluation. Disaster might very well be
                  interchangeable with other terms such as “catastrophe,” “cataclysm,” “ruin,” “destruction,”
                  or “trauma.” Indeed, trauma studies in particular has had a generative effect on romantic
                  scholarship, especially attempts to think through the relationships between affect
                  and historical consciousness. As critics such as Jerome Christensen and Mary Favret,
                  David L. Clark, and Marc Redfield have taught us, much of what we call romanticism
                  emerged under the stormclouds of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century warfare
                  - a scene of violence that exceeds any Malthusian calculus of population loss in warfare,
                  famine, or plague, that points to a more fundamental disorientation. According to
                  Favret, the “everyday” life of the romantic literature was itself constituted by a
                  sensitivity to battles far away but always experientially at hand, “a literature saturated
                  by the awareness, conscious or unconscious, of a world lost to war . . . the pained
                  effort to bind what is present and familiar with another reality, absent and destructive”
                  (Favret 158, 159). Favret’s <em>War At a Distance</em> is one powerful response to the sense of unknowable crises that romantic writers
                  shouldered, and we take her scholarship as an impetus for exploring in the following
                  pages <em>what</em> forms of change on the Enlightenment landscapes (both hospitable and inhospitable)
                  can be described as disastrous and for what reasons. For Favret, trauma becomes the
                  operative model through which to read how historical knowledge is encrypted within
                  literary form as “unclaimed experience” (to cite Cathy Caruth’s influential book).
                  Like melancholy or paranoia, trauma has become the model par excellence of a romantic
                  historicism embedded by a knowing that it cannot fully grasp. (See Pfau, <em>Romantic Moods</em>.) In this way, traumatic experience is by definition acquired involuntarily by <em>not</em> confronting it.</p>
               <p>But what if the consequences or “experience” of a disaster were less about psychic
                  survival than an unblinking desire to face down the disaster as a challenge to normative
                  structures? As Terada notes, what if the propulsion to overcome disasters overleaps
                  the healing effort and precisely misses their larger point: “Transition, and specifically
                  one’s own change in it, is the main thing that it is necessary to ‘endure.’” Our employment
                  of “disaster” partially signals Badiou’s differentiation (in our epigraph) of the
                  <span class="foreign">désastre</span> from the <span class="foreign">des être</span>, a differentiation, that is, between a (dis)orientation towards the truth-event and
                  a destructive non-being that nullifies the capacity to respond to the event in the
                  first place. This power to nullify may be registered in part by gestures that, in
                  attempting to respond, encounter the impossibility of doing so; producing figures
                  of potential survival, they discover that such figures instead enable the ruins themselves
                  to survive, personifying how <span class="foreign">ê tre</span> has become, and has always been, the face of a more pervasive <span class="foreign">des ê tre</span>, a desolation that endures through us even as we endure it. To fully face this radical
                  fault in being, then, may require passing beyond the thought of trauma to conceive
                  of a state that is not interrupted by crisis and does not seek to recover from it
                  - a state that renounces even the redemptive narrative encrypted in the very notion
                  of trauma.</p>
               <p>If this is so, we might start to think of romanticism and disaster as indelibly linked
                  by virtue of the fact that the conceptual mobility of the latter term has often spelled
                  for critics of all stripes (deconstructive, historicist, formalist) a catachrestic
                  movement of critical ruination that defines a theory of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment
                  modernity already damaged at its very core. In this way, to think of romanticism disastrously
                  is to begin to question the successes of “modernity.” As Thomas Pfau has shown, romantic
                  modernity is often conceived as a “cosmic miscarriage” (
                  “Philosophy of Shipwreck”
                  951) symptomatic of the bureaucratized and professionalized disciplinary conceptions
                  of knowledge through which we have ourselves become at once its bearers and critics.
                  Like Wordsworth’s pedlar who signals for Dorothy a ruin at both the psychic and textual
                  levels, emphases on voluntaristic models of agency are often undercut by an inoperative
                  negativity that they fail to fully erase because their structure is already determined
                  by what Blanchot has called a <span class="foreign">désoeuvrement</span> at the heart of their labors. Himself a theorist of disaster, Blanchot will insist
                  that this seemingly untraceable, unapprehendable negation is already there in the
                  constructed surfaces of the world—an impossibility of writing that nevertheless conditions
                  writing always to respond to that excess or non-identity which cannot be represented,
                  felt, or recognized in spite of the fact that we already are inhabitants of disasters
                  that have already occurred: “The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving
                  everything intact. It does not touch anyone in particular…It is in this way that I
                  am threatened; it is in this way that the disaster threatens in me that which is exterior
                  to me—an other than I who passively become other” (1).</p>
               <p>As William Keach argues, to attend to the rhetorical, epistemological, political,
                  and social effects of romantic critique is to consider how processes of destruction
                  and reconstitution, ruination and survival, are part and parcel of romanticism’s grappling
                  with this inoperative negativity, or what Tilottama Rajan has called "an unusable
                  negativity" (
                  “Mary Shelley's <em>Matilda</em>”
                  44), a negativity that haunts it at every turn. Put in this way, for us "disaster"
                  does not signal a referential event, despite the historical sequence from which it
                  arose, but rather a condition to which that sequence leads, an undoing of certain
                  apparently prior categories: subjectivity, community, “world.” That undoing continues
                  to resonate today in our own registering of contemporary devastation. In a review
                  essay on New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina, Lloyd Pratt has perspicaciously asked,
                  was “the fate overtaking New Orleans an exceptional or an exemplary one? Was this
                  gruesome spectacle of life stripped bare something in excess of the everyday, or did
                  it in fact recapitulate the new shape of American society?” (251). What is at stake
                  in Pratt’s questions is how to positively bear and process, under the most intolerable
                  of circumstances, the magnitude of a disaster that exceeds nominal definitions and
                  whose effects challenge the reparative desires of all social, cultural, political,
                  and psychic structures. Neither example nor exception, “Katrina” refers to an incapacity
                  that inscribes its own name, an incapacity to posit anything identifiably part of
                  our past or present sense of what a disaster might be, and how to respond to it. If
                  anything, “Katrina” signals an event, in Badiou’s sense: the irruption of an utterly
                  new occurrence within a situation to which we have no prior knowledge or anticipation.
                  The disastrous event, then, is neither eschatological nor transcendental: it is a
                  movement of thought that calls upon us to reflect and act upon that which we cannot
                  know but ultimately <em>must</em> bear.</p>
               <p>Insofar as disaster is not a referential event but an undoing of certain categories,
                  it ultimately undermines any attempt to explain it as a dimension of a familiar history
                  or to interpret it within the terms of any received historiography. To be sure, as
                  we have argued above, the thought of disaster <em>as</em> this undoing emerges within a certain history, but precisely as a turn upon the discourses
                  it inherits from that history, a turn that ultimately suggests that disaster floats
                  free of any determining moment, or more radically lays bare a certain nontemporal
                  negativity at the heart of modern historicity itself. In that case, the continuing
                  resonances of romanticism's reflections on disaster in the wake of 9/11 and Katrina,
                  as we have suggested above, suggests that what romanticism records is in some sense
                  still contemporary with our own experience, that the sequence of periods and historical
                  transformations coincide with an inoperable negativity that renders each era a further
                  iteration of an unassimilable event. This strange temporality of disaster links romanticism
                  as well with the condition that arises within the debris of Hiroshima and Auschwitz,
                  an affiliation that has been registered variously by Frances Ferguson, Geoffrey Hartman,
                  and Sara Guyer - an affiliation, however, that does not privilege romanticism as the
                  first mode of writing to broach these themes nor post-Holocaust discourse as their
                  most knowing treatment.</p>
               <p>But as we suggested a moment ago, even this disabling of familiar modes of historical
                  and chronological mapping arises from an anterior ruining of evidence, of the citation
                  of example or exception. An excellent example of such a ruining emerges already in
                  "Mont Blanc," where Shelley meditates on the relationship between ruin, instruction,
                  and exemplarity in a passage we will quote at length, if only to reread in a new key:

               <p> “Is this the scene / Where the old Earthquake-demon taught her young / Ruin? Were
                  these their toys?” Mont Blanc here is posited as an example, but the question of <em>what</em> it taught already destroys the possibility of registering the place of that pedagogy
                  in the first place because the contextual “scene” of that instruction has already
                  been forgotten. Teaching ruin is already a process of ruination from which there is
                  no objective outside: the disastrous pedagogy of the mountain suffers from an illusion
                  of exceptionality and a failure of example: “Or did a sea / Of fire envelop once this
                  silent snow? / None can reply—all seems eternal now." This erasure of exemplarity
                  also undoes the respondent's confidence in himself as an example of a responsive subject,
                  whether rendered as his individuality or the coordinates of his orientation to this
                  scene: his spirit vanishes before a force that blows from a space he cannot locate,
                  causing him to blend with a destructiveness that would annihilate him were he to attempt
                  to survive intact. Furthermore, it frays even the privileged categories we might expect
                  to underlie any mere example, for the "bare" world that appears with the erasure of
                  human details is itself "scarred" and "riven," as if being itself sustains an infinite
                  wound. In such passages, romanticism registers a baffled awareness that it cannot
                  teach the lessons of such an encounter, cannot use disaster to found another positive
                  discursive regime, cannot even formulate a new hauntology of <em>des ê tre</em>, but can only evoke it through texts that explore the terrain of their own defeat.</p>
               <p>The four essays in this special issue all concentrate, in different ways, on disastrous
                  conceptualizations of a romantic modernity whose innovative aptitudes are belied by
                  a felt struggle to come to terms with a ruin that refuses to be overcome, a struggle
                  in which the possibility of survival devolves into delayed reaction, resignation,
                  defeat, and critical endurance. Scott Juengel's essay, 
                  “Mary Wollstonecraft's Perpetual Disaster”
                  , reads those moments in the <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796) in which Wollstonecraft cribs from that quintessential Enlightenment genre,
                  the conjectural history, to imagine future disasters and grieve for losses yet to
                  come. Taking his cue from William Godwin's comment that her prejudices suffered a
                  "vehement concussion" from the events of the French Revolution, Juengel argues that
                  these moments of disastrous affect register a traumatic apprehension she cannot otherwise
                  articulate - not even in her <em>Historical and Moral View of the Origins and Progress of the French Revolution</em> (1794). Devastated by a wounding realization of revolutionary hope, Wollstonecraft
                  is "[h]aunted by what was to have been the future," and weaves "the time of revolutionary
                  politics with what we might call 'species time,' resulting in forms of untimeliness
                  that figure as disaster without end." Her sense of this disaster, so threatening to
                  the value of individual lives, is attuned to the discovery of a planetary "deep time"
                  that took place in the decades before and after the 1790s and to the prospect, articulated
                  two years later by Malthus, of an ongoing "disaster of sensation and feeling that
                  paradoxically moves the species toward life rather than death." Moreover, such a speculative
                  leap into the future is defended in Kant's 
                  “Conjectures on the Beginning of Human History”
                  and finds its parallel in his writing on perpetual peace, where he imagines a world
                  free of war — or devastated by a peace that transpires after a war without remainder.
                  Even her apparent turn in the opposite direction, when she imagines that the sparsely
                  populated landscape of Sweden speaks of human origins, may indicate her melancholic
                  reflections on the "possibility of renewal" within the imagined ruins of the future.
                  Yet all these untimely reflections may enable her to avoid confronting the disasters
                  of the present, such as the consequences of the fire that destroyed large portions
                  of Copenhagen just before her arrival there; the thought of disaster, she suggests,
                  would relieve her from the task of treading on "live ashes," on ills not yet reduced
                  to scenes in fancy. Ultimately, Juengel argues, these movements of disastrous thought
                  may all speak of what Reinhardt Koselleck describes as the radical temporalization
                  of revolutionary time, a temporalization to which Wollstonecraft ultimately responds
                  with a generous passivity, with a more-than-Kantian hospitality to disaster itself.
                  Juengel's searching essay provokes us to suggest that if Wollstonecraft exemplifies
                  a traumatic untimeliness characteristic of our modernity, her willingness to remain
                  hospitable to disaster may exemplify with equal force an ethics for the ruins.</p>
               <p>In his contribution to this collection, William Keach explores a similarly dense affiliation
                  of statements made roughly two decades later, at another moment of great affective
                  intensity. His essay, 
                  “The Ruins of Empire and the Contradictions of Restoration: Barbauld, Byron, Hemans”
                  , explores how Regency ruin culture developed at once as the apogee and the ambivalently
                  repressive (and repressed) symptom of British imperialism, articulating the nuances
                  of “Britain’s role in determining the trajectory of the Napoleonic imperial project
                  at moments unstably situated between triumph and catastrophe, commercial and military
                  pre-eminence and social crisis.” Working through Walter Benjamin's comments on ruination
                  in <em>The Arcades Project</em>, Keach marks out how the difference between a “canonical” and “critical” ruin culture
                  depends on gestures of delayed fascination tempered by an “awakening” that throws
                  the ruin into sudden critical knowledge. For Keach, the ruin is indelibly coupled
                  to restoration, thus producing a double movement of destruction and reconstruction
                  that not only operates separately, but is intrinsic to the ideology of the ruin. As
                  fragment, the ruin figures as a remainder of other cultures newly “acquired” and transmuted
                  into the mournful excesses that haunt their reinstallment in pre- and post-Waterloo
                  Britain. Even more, it either constitutes a celebratory surplus that hints at renovation
                  or offers itself as unyielding matter—the debris of political and social violence.
                  Thus ruins “presuppose survival and materialize it; restoration seeks to sustain the
                  survival of ruins, but in doing so imperfectly arrests and undoes both ruin and survival.”
                  In Byron’s <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>, ruin emerges as cultural property that harkens to the catastrophes of European warfare,
                  but it is also a feature of Harold himself who figures for a perverse internalization
                  and enactment of ruination. The diverse rhetorical plays and critiques Byron mounts
                  against Regency life display a powerful critical project: “Byron turns our attention
                  towards the revered monuments of ancient empire not to debunk their affective force
                  <em>in the present</em> but to redirect that force towards an awakened sense of how they may be read as commentaries
                  <em>on the present</em>.” Similarly, Barbauld’s <em>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</em>, the spoils of British imperialism are evoked as traces of a ceaseless wartime, and
                  rather than gesture proleptically at a future to come that is inscribed by past greatness,
                  Barbauld imagines a waning future that institutionalizes ruins <em>as</em> anachronistic remnants, thus shortcircuiting the forward propulsion of post-Waterloo
                  political life. By contrast, in Felicia Hemans’s <em>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</em> — a poem Byron read and admired — the British seizure of Italian artifacts is conceived
                  to be part of a dubiously optimistic political agenda, where the ruin is both “confirmed”
                  and “confined” by Hemans’s narrative linking of destruction, survival, and restoration.
                  As Keach charts the repressed historical materiality that haunts the poem, he notes
                  that “for political and ethical as well as aesthetic reasons, Rome needs to remain
                  in ruins; any prospect of a phoenix-like rise from its ashes would compromise its
                  distinctive value <em>as</em> ruin—and also threaten Britain’s ascendancy as Europe’s new imperial champion of
                  restoration.”</p>
               <p>What follows in the wake of thinking oppositely about ruin, survival, and restoration?
                  How can one think with, rather than against, disaster? Timothy Morton’s 
                  “Romantic Disaster Ecology: Blake, Shelley, Wordsworth”
                  explicitly reflects on romantic models of (ecological) knowing that take disaster
                  as a part of their framework and the consequences of these structural choices. If
                  mainstream ecological thinking is disaster prone in its visions of apocalyptic meltdowns
                  and universal heat-deaths, then, according to Morton, ecology is construed as the
                  perfect consequence (rather than antithesis) of global capitalism which depends upon
                  futural projections of destruction that produce an unworkable state of exception.
                  The critical difference lies precisely in how and why one wants to think through disaster:
                  the traumatic possibility of something yet-to-come postpones a consideration of how
                  our life-worlds are already shaped by catastrophe. In fact, disaster ecology potentially
                  absents the world in favor of expectations of destruction that obviate the real effects
                  of ecological damage that already define us. In the process, they also reify the “environment”
                  as a preserved artifact that is distinctly separate from our own lives. “[I]s there
                  another way to think, without disaster, a non-disastrous thinking, that isn't just
                  postponement?” Turning to Blake, Wordsworth, and Shelley, Morton describes three approaches
                  that variously posit and critically re-imagine <em>what</em> ecological thought beyond disaster might be. Indeed, Wordsworth emerges as enabling
                  poetic forms of listening that emerge in tandem with the evocation of catastrophe,
                  and in this sense, Morton suggests that the aesthetic contributes to subjective, epistemological,
                  and social formation in a way that exposes our ecological relationality <em>through</em> the disasters that supposedly interrupt thinking, but nevertheless inscribe our sociality
                  through and through.</p>
               <p>The difficult prospect of thinking disaster in a mode that is not postponement, that
                  takes the measure of something already taking place, raises questions that were of
                  central and abiding interest to Hegel. In her essay, 
                  “Hegel's Bearings”
                  , Rei Terada ponders Hegel's style of "tarrying with the negative," particularly with
                  the narrowing of political possibility in German territories both under Napoleonic
                  liberalization and after Waterloo. In correspondence with his friend Friedrich Immanuel
                  Niethammer, who states his wish to persist in fighting a losing cause even - or especially
                  - if he is the "last man" to do so, as if to find sustenance in his inability to bear
                  his dark times. Hegel bears up in another manner, seeking a middle way that "<em>allows</em> nothing to get too bad and nothing too good." Rather than trusting himself to a truly
                  open history, Terada argues, Hegel protects the civic life of the middle class, but
                  in doing so he also carries through on a philosophy in which "another middle, the
                  middle of transition, always rules the world." Drawing on a description of a dream
                  Hegel sends to his friend, in which "a certain realist calculation and foresight is
                  implicit," his critique of "the mirror reifications of empiricism and idealism" in
                  the <em>Logic</em>, and his account in the <em>Encyclopedia</em> of how the subject, reading every negativity that comes from outside as actually
                  from inside, can become "a being capable of containing and enduring its own contradiction,"
                  Terada shows how Hegel becomes a "privileged figure of the new dispensation," someone
                  capable of enduring "the horizonless condition of an antipolitical society that extends
                  from the late Napoleonic era to our own." By identifying the transitional movement
                  of his philosophy with reality itself, Hegel as a result assimilates the grayness
                  of his times into his own thought. For Hegel, disaster is "being unable to shake one's
                  presentation of a situation as unbearable," yet by proposing that the subject might
                  absorb any eventuality into its mode of endless transition, he constructs a model
                  of pathological health, a subject for which <em>nothing</em> would ultimately be a disaster. This impasse, Terada suggests, "persists to the present
                  day."</p>
               <p>Is it possible that by further reflection we might work our way past this and other
                  impasses to a new possibility? Or is a certain impotence of thought inherent to dwelling
                  in the ruins, much as, for Shelley, disaster erases any lesson we might learn from
                  it? Does the undoing of certain categories (community, world) erase the prospect of
                  a politics for the ruins, or does a critical reading of the ruin - and a hospitality
                  to disaster itself - offer us a glimpse of another mode of collective engagement?
                  Does the attempt to render disaster into discourse reproduce it, making us, like the
                  pedlar, instances of what we would describe? Or might our reflections at least delineate
                  the contours of our untimeliness, opening up the prospect of thinking otherwise? The
                  persistence of these questions challenges our thoughts and expectations as well as
                  our states of belonging, whether it be our age or another. This intense, unblinking
                  openness inspires our contributors, for whom romanticism is at least partially the
                  most pressing instance of multiple confrontations with what Adorno and Horkheimer
                  referred to as the “disaster triumphant” of modernity in the <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> (3), but with the difference that post-eighteenth-century thought is not merely to
                  be defined by a violent attenuation of its commitments, but rather by a brooding,
                  infinitely complex, and aggressive critical aliveness to the ways in which the un-thought
                  of our common life is perpetually shadowed by its failures. That failure, however,
                  spells out occasions to think about what it means to get by, as it were, or live on
                  amidst the mere ruin of things—to perceive, hold on, and not look away—to have faith
                  in the reminder that the disaster has a right or a value in and of itself, and one
                  <em>must</em> dwell in it rather than leave it behind.</p>
