                  <p>If anyone meets the challenge of “dark times” in the German nineteenth century, it
                     would seem to be Hegel. Hegel’s account of how the mind/spirit tarries—literally,
                     “stays with”—the negative in attentive observation and recollection until it “turns
                     it into being” [“<span class="foreign">in das Sein umkehrt</span>”] (<em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em> 19) amounts to a theory of psychic working through: how to introject objects, open
                     the self to novelty, and render the present into the past. As Rebecca Comay and Katrin
                     Pahl have shown,

                     </div> Hegel’s philosophy is at once a psychology and a theory of history. Taken as a whole,
                     it is also, famously, one predominant story that nineteenth century Europe tells to
                     itself, the story of the gathering of revolution and restoration into a single process
                     crowned by the modern European state. Acknowledging that the transitions on which
                     individual and psychic history depend are painful, Hegel models how to tolerate the
                     pain.</p>

                     </div> —Hegel was engaged in demonstrating to himself and others how <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em> would fare in the years following the battle of Jena. As Hegel’s letters show, he
                     is concerned in this “middle period” with the formalization and extension of his philosophy

                              to human sciences conceived along disciplinary lines, the Science of Logic plausibly
                              contributed to Hegel’s securing his first professorship at Heidelberg in 1816. Thomas
                              Pfau observes the “palpably bureaucratic” prose and structure of the work: “the interiority
                              of the Hegelian subject must submit to an intricate disciplinary scheme, here set
                              forth in a bureaucratic prose that assigns each psychological state its own cat…</span></div>
                     </div> —its not being downhill from there—and he thinks this issue, in turn, through his
                     ability to live his own theory in the “dark times.” Crucially, Hegel makes establishing
                     the reception of the <em>Phenomenology</em> into the same project as the psychic management of the restoration. He generates the
                     effect that his previous philosophy is correct by interpreting it himself, highlighting
                     what (in retrospect) it is already prepared to allow for; as Derrida points out, Hegelian
                     spirit “in advance interiorizes all content” (22a) and as Adorno points out, that
                     “advance” is also secured after the fact (<em>History and Freedom</em> 51). In self-interpretation, Hegel coordinates the future anterior with metalepsis
                     in order to place his thought at their crossing, where a dynamic transition in the
                     present would logically be. So if Hegel’s “middle period” is especially interesting,
                     that’s also because generating a transition through self-interpretation is what all
                     of the work is about anyway. Self-interpretation is its content and its procedure:
                     “the subject of Hegelian thought only <em>is</em> insofar as it is engaged in the process of interpreting itself,” as Jan Mieszkowski
                     phrases it.

                              Derrida “reveal[s] language to be a dynamic whose finite resources are not unfailingly
                              devoted to its own self-determination” (¶ 42).</span></div>
                     </div> Hegel’s techniques for arranging that his philosophy is not left on the battlefield
                     at Waterloo are therefore necessarily the same techniques he uses to introject and
                     transform postwar phenomena that otherwise threaten catastrophe. Incorporating the
                     restoration through his philosophy both reinforces the philosophy and averts devastation.</p>

                              Metternich describes the period as unsatisfying: “Metternich, the man who presided
                              over and seemed to personify the age of restoration, lamented that he had been born
                              ‘too early or too late.’ Earlier he might simply have enjoyed life, later he could
                              have helped build a new society, but ‘today I must devote myself to propping up rotten
                              buildings.’ A few months later he wrote, ‘My most secret thought is that old Europe
                              is at the beginning of the end. . . . between end and beginning there will be chaos’”
                              (392).</span></div>
                     </div> Rebecca Comay has argued brilliantly that the German postwar is characterized by trauma
                     in the structural sense that it is organized by a spectral German revolution which
                     is imagined as too early or too late, either having occurred already on a mental level
                     and/or being (always) not yet necessary: “having already been there in theory, Germany
                     could put off until doomsday the grab for practical fulfillment.”

                     </div> As many have pointed out in this connection, the idea of a “restoration” doesn’t quite
                     work as a descriptor in the absence of a revolution; other terms for the postwar period
                     avoid describing it at all. Historians of England tend to call it the “aftermath of
                     Waterloo,” and the term “Vormärz” complementarily anchors the time in something that
                     hadn’t happened yet.

                     could feel that they were on open political waters—not in a liberatory, but in an
                     agoraphobic sense, in which it seemed possible that just about anything bad could
                     happen to them. Yet, fundamentally, the disaster is also not “instability”; the “stability”
                     that replaced this instability was the imperial German state. That was even more disastrous
                     from a radical point of view, and can’t seriously be thought of as less “confused,”
                     either, than the “historical confusion” that preceded it. Rather, radicals experienced
                     the Vormärz as a positive present of conservative administrative control, embodied
                     in police states in which even “liberals” opposed classless suffrage.

                     in 1848 (and so looking back at the time I’m concerned with), the radical democrat
                     Gustav von Struve began his address with: “A long period of the most profound degradation

                  <p>Historians David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley argued in the 1980s that Cold War histories
                     of Europe composed in the West promoted the hindsight perception that as Struve spoke,
                     an even longer period of even profounder degradation lay ahead of him, one that seemed
                     to culminate at Auschwitz. Clearly, “grand narratives” are part of the problem; the
                     very discipline of “history” is part of the problem and part of the nineteenth- and
                     twentieth-century nationalism that followed the aftermath of Waterloo. Since Blackbourn
                     and Eley, historians have approached the German nineteenth century more as a way of
                     life in itself, sometimes discussing how it may have been “liberal” in a different
                     way after all.

                              Blackbourn alone. When Eley entertains the notion of a German “revolution from above,”
                              it matters that it isn’t a democratic revolution. Blackbourn, in contrast, can sound
                              more equanimious about a society in which regulation appears as a value just as ethical
                              as that of social justice. My point is not to dictate to German people of the past
                              what would have been good for them, but to try to read the self-described disorientation
                              of dissidents at the time.</span></div>
                     </div> Although such a discussion avoids problems with the notion of historical failure,
                     it still misses the point. Eley’s point is not just that we should stop being judgmental
                     about the German nineteenth century, but that we should ask <em>who gains</em> from our judgments. The twentieth century theory of the development of democracy from
                     “liberalization” gains by blaming German exceptionalism for its “failure” to make
                     it work. Similarly, radicals’ experience is not disastrous because of what it’s not—a
                     revolution or liberalism—and “revolution” and “liberalism” are not real in some way
                     that the early German nineteenth century is unreal. But—and here I may or may not
                     be departing from the anthropological reflexivity that Blackbourn and Eley bring to
                     their study—that does not mean that the Vormärz was really fine. In the most interesting
                     descriptions, it is <em>positively</em> awful enough in itself, awful <em>in</em> being a way of getting along, and these subjective descriptions also merit our anthropological
                     respect if our reading is to be more than an account only of what works about a society.
                     Going beyond anomaly, disaster here goes in a way beyond disaster. This impression
                     of disorienting open-endedness, more than anything else, disabling any sense of historical
                     exceptionality, particularizes <em>this</em> disaster and Hegel’s model for working through it.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Hegel is a privileged figure of the new dispensation, I want to suggest, because of
                  his ability to articulate in its positivity the horizonless condition of an antipolitical
                  society that extends from the late Napoleonic era to our own. By managing a description
                  that is immanent to it, he furnishes a predominant model for inhabiting times that
                  are normally and open-endedly opaque. He wins the game by changing it, establishing
                  a new framework for what it means to succeed in which the capacity to undergo transition
                  actively is the highest value. Hegel explains why there is no getting out by way of
                  explaining why there is no need to get out: namely, because the energies of progress
                  themselves are part of what means to be “in.” Achieving this realization requires
                  duration (“staying with” the negative), hence endurance; as a result, he places a
                  peculiar value on being able to “bear” things. Words like <span class="foreign">ertragen</span> and <span class="foreign">vertragen</span> (endurance, tolerance) crystallize his descriptions of self-transformation, and pressure
                  settles upon them. His use of <span class="foreign">ertragen</span> connotes constitutional vigor—being able to withstand hard knocks—but, especially
                  in his letters, also includes a more colloquial sense of being able to stand repulsive
                  things. Transition, and specifically one’s own change in it, is the main thing that
                  it is necessary to “endure.”</p>

               <h2><span class="head">***</span></h2>
               <p>In the first decade of the nineteenth century, Hegel carried on a long, regular correspondence
                  with his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, the commissioner of educational administration
                  for Bavaria. These letters offer glimpses of how Hegel and Niethammer thought about
                  the interface between political and everyday life. In the late Napoleonic years, liberalization,
                  modernization and democratization were already proving to be unrelated. Hegel and
                  Niethammer are anxious in the midst of liberalization, before Napoleon abdicates in
                  April 1814; and they worry not only about the insecurity of the administration but
                  about the course of liberalization within it. In these years radical possibility is
                  being undermined from within and from without a reformist regime, lending support
                  to Hegel’s sense of opposition internal to concepts. In his correspondence, we can
                  see Hegel trying on various ways of expressing this sense as a psychological and political
                  attitude.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Much of Hegel’s and Niethammer’s conversation pertains to the educational system for
                     which they both worked and which was an endless source of aggravation for them both.
                     Briefly, Niethammer was a “neohumanist” who wanted to modernize education while defending
                     it against “utilitarians” who were narrowly interested in professional schools, and
                     he had appointed Hegel rector of a Gymnasium in Nuremburg because he knew he would
                     be a political ally.

                              wave of cost-cutting measures (Pinkard 291-292), but it survived and he continued
                              to work there until he received an offer from the university at Heidelberg in 1816
                              (Pinkard 330-331).</span></div>
                     </div> Niethammer’s enterprises never ran all that smoothly, and as Napoleon’s downfall began
                     to seem increasingly likely, he interpreted the newly emboldened attacks on his projects
                     that then occurred as evidence of an overwhelming and indeed insuperable pressure
                     from conservative and utilitarian forces (i.e., conservative anti-democrats and modernizing
                     anti-democrats). Although he can seem to be overdoing his rhetoric (though not to
                     me), Niethammer was basically right: democratization—parliamentary or otherwise—was
                     not coming to Germany in spite of all the “liberalization” and “modernization” that
                     had been accomplished under Napoleon. Niethammer’s anticipation of this conclusion
                     sometimes led him to describe his political future in apocalyptic terms.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Hegel was intermittently anxious about all this, and trying hard not to be. On the
                  night of January 5, 1814, Hegel dreams that he “was in a large group attending a disputation
                  in which two physiologists . . . discussed the relative merits of apes and pigs.”
                  While the disputants argue about which are more human, apes or pigs, <span class="quote">‘a loudmouthed, wide-bodied fellow named Pippel [People] . . . kept wanting to bring
                     up still other matters, even juridical matters such as human rights, constitutions,
                     and so forth. But the moderator, who, so to speak, played the role of fate throughout
                     the whole proceeding, treated all matters of this sort as mere irrelevancies, mere
                     packaging. He disallowed them from being seriously discussed, and held firm in his
                     insistence that the issue was merely preference between the two species. But a super-clever
                     man, murmuring in the corner more to himself, then asked the moderator—this seemed
                     to me unrelated—whether he meant that Pippel, should he someday feel warm in his heart
                     and head, would, as is well known, risk the shirt off his back; that aristocrats would
                     put this to their advantage; and that Pippel would thus play the fool in a game—as
                     in fact occurs quite legally in the name of the Devil, and has always occurred from
                     time immemorial. The historian Zschokke then ran up to jump in, shouting that the
                     people of Bern had already received an answer at least verbally from Zurich, but that
                     there were still many other considerations . . . and so forth. At that point I woke
                     up and it seemed difficult to me to have to go to class and lecture on law. ’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">einen großmauligen, breitleibigen Patron namens Pippel . . . . wollte immer auch noch

                        behandelte alles dergleichen als Emballagen und Allotria, ließ sie nicht ernstlich

               <p>So Hegel dreams he is at a debate that isn’t an honest debate, and that pretends to
                  seek humanity where everyone knows it doesn’t exist, in one of two unattractive and
                  literally nonhuman sides: it is hard <em>not</em> to view the dream as struggling with the contemporary foreclosure of alternatives.
                  There was a real Heinrich Zschokke, a liberal historian, philosopher and fiction writer
                  based in Switzerland at the time of the dream; a local administrator during the Napoleonic
                  period, he is remembered as having been as earnestly enthusiastic as he appears here
                  (Butler, Letters 301). The dream treats his earnestness as though it were as much
                  a part of the show as the cynicism of the professional moderator and offstage aristocrats,
                  as though his sincere proceduralism exhibited the kind of irrelevance the moderator
                  has in mind when he calls juridical issues “mere packaging” (<span class="foreign">Emballagen</span>, packing matter). As Pippel is a loudmouth, Zschokke is a shouter, and implicitly
                  tiresome; Hegel curtails the content of his messsage with the same weary “u. s. f.”</p>

                     As soon as he got there, commiseration about assaults on the educational system (including
                     the chronic, passive assault of underfunding) becomes one of the main motifs of his

                     </div> As early as 1810, we find Hegel complaining that “Nobody complains . . . . the object
                     is simply to procure treasure, and those who suffered real distress and injustice
                     are used to the view that everything has gone to the dogs anyway” (Butler, letter
                     229, April 10, 1810); more than any reference to repression, the complaint that no
                     one is complaining registers the collapse of political space. Throughout this time
                     Hegel regularly refers to the Allied forces with dripping irony as “our Liberators”:
                     “if <span class="foreign">par hasard</span> there are any liberated individuals to be seen I myself will stand up and watch” (Butler,
                     letter 225, December 23, 1813). But the Napoleonic administration has not left enough
                     room for complaint either. Likewise, the moderator’s “insistence that the issue was
                     merely preference” is absurd in light of the lack of distinction and merit among the
                     choices. Only the possibility of an unseen, deeper rationality in his behavior (“<span class="foreign">ob er es denn so meine</span>”) furnishes some ballast against the non-events that crowd the dream.</p>

                     debate to the game played “from time immemorial.” The super-clever man’s observation
                     differs from the others: it’s a question, at least rhetorically; it’s murmured by
                     a liminal participant, “more to himself” than to anyone else—which is how Hegel lectured,
                     and how Adorno believes his writing proceeds;

                              Berlin lectures: “Exhausted, morose, he sat there as if collapsed into himself, his
                              head bent down, and while speaking kept turning pages and searching in his long folio
                              notebooks, forward and backward, high and low.” Hotho recalls Hegel’s seeming need
                              to present every thought processively. “Hegel’s writings are more like films of thought
                              than texts,” Adorno muses (“Skoteinos, or How to Read Hegel” 121). Nicholsen adds
                              that for Adorno, Hegel’s language “murmurs and rustles in mimesis of the nonidentical”

                     and depths. It’s tempting to see this curious intervention as the most Hegelian one.
                     The super-clever man asks the moderator whether, in his role as “fate,” he bars “juridical”
                     topics <em>because</em> of the likelihood that the outcome would only play into the hands of aristocrats—at
                     least, whether this likely outcome is the true meaning of his intransigence. A kind
                     of realist calculation and foresight is implicit here. Although the dream thus seems
                     to align itself with super-cleverness, however, Hegel’s reported thoughts on waking
                     imply that his own position, or at least his feelings, is not identical with that
                     of the super-clever man within. It seems difficult—literally, it “hits him hard”—that
                     he has to go on with his lectures on law. Now we know that Hegel sees rational law
                     as the only possible means of managing the conflicts of society, and he was soon to
                     take an interest in the particulars of the new constitution, especially with regard
                     to the parameters of franchise.

                     the strain of the coming lecture; the dream temporarily defers the tension and tedium
                     of keeping up appearances, already pressing upon the dreamer from the side of the

                     out that splitting off bad pieces of reality necessarily commits aggressions against
                     the self that produces that reality, which must also become bad in the same moment

                        but contradict themselves, and pass over into their opposites. Hence this transition,
                        and the unity in which the extremes are merged and become factors, each with a merely
                        reflected existence, reveals itself as their truth.’</span> <span class="quote">‘The understanding, which addresses itself to deal with the Idea, commits a double
                        misunderstanding. It takes first the extremes of the Idea (be they expressed as they
                        will, so long as they are in their unity), not as they are understood when stamped
                        with this concrete unity, but as if they remained abstractions outside of it. It no
                        less mistakes the relation between them, even when it has been expressly stated .
                        . . . But, in the second place, the understanding believes its “reflection”—that the
                        self-identical Idea contains its own negative, or contains contradiction—to be an
                        external reflection which does not lie within the Idea itself. But the reflection
                        is really no peculiar cleverness of the understanding. The idea itself is the dialectic
                        which for ever divides and distinguishes the self-identical from the differentiated,
                        the subjective from the objective, the finite from the infinite, soul from body. Only
                        on these terms is it an eternal creation, eternal vitality, and eternal spirit. But
                        while it thus passes or rather translates itself into the abstract understanding,
                        it for ever remains reason. The Idea is the dialectic which again makes this mass
                        of understanding and diversity understand its finite nature and the pseudo-independence

               <p>The understanding splits objects into polar features as though these features existed
                  independently and “outside” their “unity” in the Idea, which involves “mistak[ing]”
                  their relation “even when it has been expressly stated.” In this first maneuver the
                  understanding strips features from objects and places them “outside” the space of
                  their transformation into one another. Then, even when it does reflect on the co-existence
                  of the contradictions, it believes that this reflection is its own “peculiar[ly] clever”
                  contribution from a space “external” to the Idea and “not within”; that is, we become
                  conscious that the objects include their contradictions, but as though from outside
                  the space ourselves. The “truth” of objects and of the understanding is that of their
                  “transition” within “the unity in which the extremes are merged and become factors.”
                  We can take down the division that creates the outside of the Idea by staying with
                  bad objects through our apprehension of their negativity; by bringing more out of
                  ourselves and them, we see them in the space where they are only “factors,” and in
                  which their transformation and that of the understanding are again possible. Distinction
                  persists, but through a mobile division that continually creates new sub-spaces within
                  an interior that has no exterior. Looked at another way, the project is to contain
                  extremes that pose challenges to an interior that has and <em>must</em> have no exterior (<em>and no external interior</em>), as the repetition of “within” conveys (extremes are merged “in” the unity, the
                  Idea “contains” its contradiction, etc.).</p>
               <p>Hegel’s expositions of what it means to bear something (particularly plentiful in
                  the various revisions of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>) overwhelmingly associate <span class="foreign">ertragen</span> with self-transformation, or to be more precise, with that kind of self-consistency
                  that comes out of self-transformation, and hence with subjectivity itself. His explanations
                  span a tension between the value of flexibility and a kind of residual mass, built
                  up out of former transformations, which is not simply flexible and that allows one
                  to afford flexibility. As I mentioned, Hegel phrases the building up of subjectivity
                  through <span class="foreign">ertragen</span> partly as a matter of constitution or “hardiness”; in Part II of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, the <span class="foreign">Naturphilosophie</span>, the basic equipment of an animal, by including the capacity for sensation, includes
                  the potential to “tolerate itself as other [<span class="foreign">als Anderes ertragen</span>]” so that it “can, with the hardiness [Härte] of individuality, assimilate it and
                  venture into conflict with other individualities” (<em>Philosophy of Nature / Enzyklopädie</em> II §344). The capacity to bear self-difference builds up the “whole mass of adjustments
                  forming the concrete consciousness” (<em>Philosophy of Mind / Enzyklopädie</em> III §408), and “a being which is capable of containing and enduring its own contradiction
                  is a subject [<span class="foreign">Ein solches, das den Widerspruch seiner selbst in sich zu haben und zu ertragen fähig
                     ist, ist das Subjekt</span>]” (<em>Philosophy of Nature / Encyclopedia</em> II §359). The pairing “containing and enduring” returns to the idea that we may mistakenly
                  place the contradictions we perceive in objects “outside” ourselves. To be able to
                  contain them by attributing them to ourselves instead is to be able to bear them (and
                  here enduring is bearing as carrying). While “a psychic shock produced by grief and
                  pain” or equally, “sudden excessive joy,” runs the real risk of “the disruption of
                  the organism, death, or insanity,” one who has built up inner resources “is much less
                  exposed [<span class="foreign">ausgesetzt</span>] than others to such effects [<span class="foreign">Einwirkungen</span>],” and performs better than “the ‘natural’ man who is poor in imaginative and intellectual
                  resources and so is unable to endure the negativity of a sudden violent attack of
                  pain [<span class="foreign">die Negativität eines plötzlich hereinbrechenden gewaltigen Schmerzes zu ertragen</span>]” (<em>Philosophy of Mind / Encyclopedia</em> III §401). “Naturally,” Hegel continues, and his point is noncontroversial enough,
                  “those who through a life rich in activity and experience have developed a more independent
                  human nature, are better able to endure [<span class="foreign">besser zu ertragen</span>] the <em>loss of a part</em> [<span class="foreign">den Verlust eines Teiles</span>] of what constitutes their world than those who have grown up in simple circumstances”
                  (<em>Philosophy of Mind / Encyclopedia</em> III §402; my italics). This theory of the building up of subjectivity as the capacity
                  for bearing transformation portrays a “hard,” yet complexly layered self up to the
                  task of exposing itself to the agents of change, thus hinting that part of the self
                  up for change (that part <em>doing</em> the exposing and weathering) will not actually be changed. The figure implied—not
                  Hegel’s usual figure for transition, but one that’s apparently compatible with his
                  discourse—is that of a substance weathering erosion. Erosion is a form of transformation,
                  of course; the assimilation of negativity in the form of erosion would mean experiencing
                  oneself as the agent of what would otherwise be “the loss of a part,” and thus feeling
                  that you cannot be simply diminished if you are making cuts to yourself. A different
                  metaphor for transformation wouldn’t require this attitude, rather suggesting that
                  equal quantitites are being exchanged; but this one may be especially useful for dark
                  times’ challenge of loss in transition.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Throughout, the idea that there is no question for the healthy self of the impossibility
                     of assimilating negativity depends on the idea that a negativity, or “lack,” “is a
                     lack only in so far as the lack's overcoming is equally present in the same thing,
                     and contradiction is, as such, immanent and explicitly present in that thing “[<span class="foreign">Mangel aber ist sie, insofern in einem ebenso das Darüberhinaussein vorhanden, der
                        Widerspruch als solcher immanent und in ihm gesetzt ist</span>]” (<em>Philosophy of Nature / Encyclopedia</em> II §359). So, things necessarily contain some of their opposite because they exist
                     within the space of unity, and that space matters to us because it is <em>our</em> space. By this logic, it is not possible to believe without error in a negativity
                     that comes from an “outside,” since there is no outside of the mediating space

                     the way to make something bearable is to bring it into that position. The bearability
                     of contradiction depends on the debatable assumptions that we find more bearable anything
                     that emanates from ourselves, and that the action of one part of the self at the expense
                     of another does not violate self-identity and therefore freedom. In my view, there
                     are fatal logical and psychological problems with these argumentative moves. Once
                     they have been established, however, Hegel can assume that anything that has once
                     been posited can be sublated if we bear with it, living forward and painfully changing
                     the self into one that can bear it better.</p>

                     and an inflammatory charge within a polemic; Niethammer’s rhetoric, however, serves
                     to indicate that what has happened is already on the other side of a line for him.

                  from you while doing it. The faint possibility remains that unexpectedly energetic
                  resistance will prevent the worst of the outcomes worth “defend[ing] . . . to the
                  last man,” but nothing of the self is staked on this chance, for in case of the expected
                  failure it has its Kantianism in reserve. The thought of being the last man, “who
                  I still hope to be,” sustains Niethammer’s activity. It seems to be more realistic
                  to “hope” to be the last man—a strange hope, that assumes the cause is lost—than to
                  succeed; in this way Niethammer is able to replace an unreachable goal with a reachable
                  one that will give him existential satisfaction. The main impetus for resistance is
                  the chance to display commitment to others and oneself.</p>
               <p>Hegel’s reply will take us to the heart of his psychic strategy: <span class="quote">‘The essential point is your belief that it will not get so bad we cannot bear it.
                     Your view coincides pretty much with my own belief that we cannot hope for something
                     good enough to merit any particular praise. This colorless, tasteless middle way,
                     which allows nothing to get too bad and nothing too good, for once rules our world.’</span> </p>
               <blockquote class="quote">[<span class="foreign">Das Wesentliche ist Ihr Glauben, daß es nicht so arg werde, daß wir’s nicht könnten

               <p> Now, Hegel’s colorlesssness does not really coincide with Niethammer’s “dark day,”
                  and an intermediate state is exactly what Niethammer’s apocalyptic language rejects:
                  Niethammer is saying that he <em>isn’t</em> bearing it. Just as we can ask why Hegel should find Niethammer’s appeal inspiring,
                  we can ask why Niethammer should find Hegel’s reply helpful. For Niethammer, being
                  unable to foresee anything good enough to praise is already “so bad we cannot bear
                  it,” and as we’ve seen, he gets sustenance out of his inability to bear it. They actually
                  agree only that their “world” is the realm at issue and that it is “rul[ed]” by the
                  deactivation of “hope for something good enough.” The discrepancy is obvious enough
                  that we should ask why Hegel wants to claim that his belief coincides with Niethammer’s.
                  Why not write instead, “I don’t like it any more than you do, but . . .”?</p>
               <p>Hegel seems to be trying to present his disagreement with Niethammer as it might appear
                  in the essential unity they must somehow share—a place of conciliation. He has already
                  located something good, so that the badness isn’t “too bad”; the key point is that
                  he subtly divides goodness that’s good enough to praise from<em>another goodness that merits no praise</em> but is still there, functioning as a backstop. As with this backup goodness, there
                  is something protective in Hegel’s idea that the “middle way” “<em>allows</em> nothing to get too bad and nothing too good [<span class="foreign">welches nichts so arg und nichts so gut werden <em>läßt</em></span>]”: this is what I meant in saying that the project is to contain extremes that might
                  threaten, from inside or from outside, the inside that is supposed to have no radical
                  outside or inside. Containing the extremes prophylactically so that it isn’t possible
                  for anything to get too bad or good is not the same as trusting the whole to right
                  itself through unconstrained experience—a kind of psychic free market. To rule the
                  world in this manner, it seems, is also to protect certain parts of the world whose
                  precarious existence is being held out of play. I will come back momentarily to the
                  question of which world Hegel is protecting.</p>
               <p>Further, the <em>universal space of mediation is conflated,</em> here, with the recent disappearance of color and taste from the times: it’s actually
                  impossible to tell which one Hegel is talking about when he describes the “middle
                  way” that “rules our world.” That “our” world is “for once” ruled by colorlessness
                  and tastelessness seems to make it a historical matter; but Hegel’s is the philosophy
                  in which another middle, the middle of transition, always rules the world, and truth
                  is the colorlessness and tastelessness that allows colors and tastes to be translated
                  into one another. Insofar as what Hegel means by “middle way” has already passed through
                  the mediation that merges extremes, or even simply refers to that reflection, there
                  can be no further disagreement, because by disagreeing with Hegel, Niethammer would
                  be disagreeing with the truth of things itself: with reality, in Hegel’s theory of
                  reality. As Hegel presents the debate with Niethammer as though from its end, his
                  prose presents the grayness of the times as inseparable from the standpoint of his
                  own assimilation of it: it seems at the same time to be a challenging external negativity
                  and a phenomenon internal to Hegel’s psychic work. As such, it gives us a glimpse
                  of the therapeutic power of Hegel’s thinking. Hegel returns Niethammer’s utterance
                  to him rinsed of its moralized drama: this thought experiment evokes a world in balance,
                  in which everyone realizes that nothing is ontologically too bad or good and can negotiate
                  differences with feeling, but without hysteria, as Klein too fleetingly envisions.</p>
               <p>For Hegel, the ability to translate differences corresponds to the state’s redistribution
                  of the energies of individuals from the perspective of its own universality. In the
                  exchange with Niethammer, he tries to do this as though on behalf of universality.
                  As Marcuse points out, the limit of transformability is that “the resulting relation
                  between the individuals on the one hand and the state on the other cannot be the same
                  as that between individuals” (174). Something like this limitation appears in comical
                  miniature in the letters, where Hegel identifies his own position—<em>acceptance of</em> the sidelessness, so to speak, of their situation—with the sidelessness of reality
                  <em>itself</em> for all, and describes it from the point of view of the place where their positions
                  would already have met. Representing universality, Hegel pulls Niethammer after him
                  into the colorless “middle way” where their agreement is “pretty much” enforced despite
                  their actual continued disagreement (which he possibly is really unable to grasp).
                  Ideally, the mind bears reality without reserve and triumphs to the extent that it
                  dares to expose itself to self-transformation; we see this principle working normatively
                  in Hegel’s personal responses to what otherwise threatens disaster. As we’ve seen,
                  Hegel defines disaster as being unable to shake one’s presentation of a situation
                  as unbearable. What bearing reality means is deconstructible, however, because it’s
                  unclear whether Hegel can bear to bear these presentations without techniques that
                  regulate his exposure.</p>
               <p>Hegel’s desire to experience his own losses as their agent, then, means to ride transition,
                  maximizing the potential to live anywhere and anyhow in the subject’s infinity. To
                  others, it has seemed to reflect the treachery of the times by articulating the philosophy
                  of an emergent society of adaptive liberal conformity. Hegel’s letter of July 5, 1816,
                  for example, seems a bit suspect to Niethammer in its explanation of how to get through
                  the phenomena of postwar reaction. Hegel depicts world spirit as a “colossus” striding
                  over the world, unable to be halted by human doings: <span class="quote">‘I adhere to the view that the world spirit has given the world marching orders .
                     . . . no lingering lies or make-believe strokes in the air can achieve anything against
                     it. They can perhaps reach the shoelaces of this colossus, and smear on a bit of boot
                     wax or mud, but they cannot untie the laces. Much less can they remove these shoes
                     of Gods—which according to [Johann Heinrich] Voss’s <em>Mythological Letters</em>, among other sources, have elastic soles or are even themselves seven-league boots—once
                     the colossus pulls them on. Surely the safest thing to do (both externally and internally)
                     is to keep one’s eye fixed on the advancing giant. To edify the entire bustling and
                     eager assemblage, one can even stand there and help smear on the shoe wax that is
                     supposed to bring the giant to a standstill. For one’s own amusement, one can even
                     lend a hand to the enterprise that is being taken so seriously.’</span> <span class="quote">‘[<span class="foreign">Ich halte mich daran, dass Weltgeist der Zeit das Kommandowort zu avancieren gegeben.

                  in the foreground, a now visible world spirit “advancing,” and a liminal figure standing
                  in Hegel’s apparently less elastic shoes. Hegel wants the vignette to illustrate that
                  awareness of the deep forces that ground the apparent absurdity of the situation—forces
                  kept in mind by the protagonist’s fixed, distant focus—can be played off against the
                  “eager assemblage” in the foreground that would otherwise cause distress. Calibrations
                  of spatial and temporal scale, mental reserve and physical action, map the scene so
                  that it seems manageable and, this time, even enjoyable. (We can see in retrospect
                  that the pigs and apes dream is enjoyable, too.)</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>There is a tension between Hegel’s claim that he keeps his eye on giant forces to
                     keep his mind off the senseless reaction, and the possibility that what seems to be
                     the accidental outcome of the scenario is actually its goal: that conjuring the giant
                     figure, and casting Restoration politics as a non-event in comparison, allows Hegel
                     to continue working in this society. Even though his attention to its work is divided
                     and limited, his participation in the social enterprise to which he objects acknowledges
                     it in a way that Niethammer isn’t up to (as Niethammer’s outrage is something Hegel
                     isn’t up to). The causal arrow is two-way: Hegel’s identification with transition
                     not only enables, but is formed <em>by</em> actual contact with the negative, unlike Niethammer’s indignation, which prevents
                     him from making full contact with it. Niethammer fantasizes purity; he will be the
                     last man polluted by vermin. Hegel has participated in “the enterprise that is being
                     taken so seriously,” and demonstrates how to do so. He can stay close, even touch
                     with his hands the active unfreedom that is at least as dangerous as the advancing
                     giant—unlike the beautiful soul who “flees from contact with the actual world [<span class="foreign">flieht es die Berührung der Wirklichkeit</span>]” (<em>Phenomenology of Spirit / Phänomenologie des Geistes</em> §685). Participation, even of this divided kind, has its benefits: remaining on the
                     scene, seeing what people are doing, knowing you are able to do it if you want; also
                     being “safe . . . externally and internally,” being amused, and in a certain way remaining
                     incognito.

               <p>Marcuse argues that Hegel’s underlying concern is perpetuating bourgeois civil society,
                  i.e., preserving his quotidian world: “for Hegel, differences in political form between
                  nations did not matter so long as the underlying identity of social and economic relations
                  was uniformly maintained as that of middle-class society” (184). He believes that
                  Hegel’s subordination of civil society to the state is actually undertaken in the
                  name of civil society; civil society does not know how to preserve itself, but the
                  fact that it is worth preserving justifies the state: “state sovereignty was a necessary
                  instrument for preserving middle-class society . . . . the change of form is supposed
                  to save the threatened content” (185-186). That all the conflicts of civil society
                  do not form a kind of subjectivity in itself, suggests that disequilibrium from within
                  threatens the inside that knows no outside, necessitating another, supplementary outside,
                  the state-envelope, to contain the disruption. In this light, being <em>un</em>able to bear the absence of anything good enough to praise would be an example of
                  a disturbance that could destroy equilibrium and would mean being willing to let go
                  of society as we know it: for—and this is the point to which I promised to return—middle-class
                  society “as is” is the other good world that is good although no further good is coming,
                  the good world that is good without being praiseworthy. We might also say: the world
                  that is beyond goodness, being less optional and changeable than good. As readers,
                  we can glimpse this stability when Hegel comments to Niethammer that the principle
                  of nothing too good or bad rules “our world,” as though in reference to a world preceding
                  the events that happen within or around it, including even the appearance of the rule
                  of the middling that permeates it. By pursuing Hegel’s attachment to society, Marcuse
                  thus makes sense of his renunciation of theory in <em>The Philosophy of Right</em>: by then “the modern state is the reality” of reason, so “any further application
                  of theory to politics would make theory Utopian” (194). In the vocabulary of the preservation
                  of the (unpraisable) good inside from disruption, further applications of theory would
                  depart from the potentialities that exist within the world “as is” and bring out more
                  of what it is, and pass on to potentialities that don’t exist and can only destroy.
                  In nonpejorative language, these would be utopian potentialities that exist only outside
                  or inside the existing world in a way that does destroy identity, and whose realization
                  would <em>make it something altogether different.</em></p>

                     to the “tragic” and “frightful spectacle” is to claim that the future of the German

                     explain why Hegel writes so ironically of “streams of blessings” from the tragic events <em>comparable to the ability of middle-class educators to buy coffee.</em> Absolute freedom’s “refreshment” in the thought of the spirit trickles down into the
                     “brown rivulet of coffee [that] already flows from the pot for the likes of us . .
                     . with more taste and perk than ever.” Hegel had been complaining for years about
                     the economic and intellectual straits for people like them, how impoverished in “taste
                     and perk” the offerings were—in fact, “colorless, tasteless” as of November 1814,
                     let’s recall. It isn’t saying much for Hegel to claim that moral spirit will be perkier
                     than what he’s been drinking.

               <p>April 29 seems soon after the end of an era to compare the great things flowing from
                  its cataclysm to decent coffee: from what state of mind can this be written? The nearly
                  unreadable tone of such a passage gets to be recognized as Hegel’s signature, “Hegelian
                  irony,” almost in the way that film connoisseurs speak of “the Lubitsch touch,” and
                  that in spite of Hegel’s published disapprovals of irony. Hegel’s disapproval makes
                  sense in the terms of his own system, since as he writes, irony gets in the way of
                  the exposure to committed relation, and so to self-transformation, which alone can
                  bring spiritual growth as he defines it (<em>Aesthetics</em> 66). Nonetheless, Hegel’s letters are saturated in irony; not a single word escapes.
                  In fact the irony Hegel distances himself from and the one he practices are supposed
                  to be distinct: the irony that shields a certain kind of skeptic and/or romantic from
                  reality, on one hand, and on the other the impersonal “cunning of reason” that is
                  visible <em>after</em> a reality, no longer evadable, has been borne, and thus appears smaller against the
                  perspective of world spirit. In his prose, irony is the scar of having made contact
                  with reality, and as such it confirms the mutual translatability of restoration and
                  reformation. The two ironies threaten to merge, however, as soon as realist calculation
                  decides ahead of the game what the outcome must be and therefore which hard reality
                  must be assimilated. In this case, Hegel speaks from the perspective of the aftermath
                  clearly enough even when the “tragic” event is less than three weeks past. Marcuse
                  takes Hegel’s letter of April 10, 1814 (Letter 229) to show that even after the Allied
                  forces took Paris he was not ready to concede the war; but the coffee joke implies
                  that he must also have been preparing to concede it for some time.</p>
               <p>Defense or healing? Prevention of injury, or ready self-transformation? Above we see
                  prophylaxis in Hegel’s implication that, actualization being “self-destructive,” Germans
                  should keep the coffee perking but sip it only in thought. Comay catches the tenor
                  of this move beautifully when she points out that Hegel’s figures for freedom in the
                  <em>Lectures</em> are “confused between a fruit and a torch.” In Hegel’s fear of consuming the objects
                  of desire and of being consumed by their radiance, theories of trauma would read the
                  displaced memory of an injury that has already occurred. I have suggested that Hegel’s
                  good inside that has no radical outside (or, finally, radically inner inside) is protected
                  against too sudden disruption by a procedure that knows how to preclude the too good
                  and the too bad. But for Hegel, there is as usual no final contradiction between the
                  options of pathology and health.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As Comay makes clear, in the traumatic structure the revolution is both too early
                     and too late. The healthy self in Hegel is the one that has encountered reality in
                     all its unwelcome violence, has traded part of itself in for new parts now required,
                     and as a result of its transformation can administer experience so that it will not
                     be too bad or good, meaning that future transformations will always be possible in
                     order to salvage the minimally good world as it is (at each time). The world will
                     never be too bad or good because, as indicated by the record of exposure and transformation
                     that builds up the self, there is an “infinite” potential for subjectivity to overcome
                     any of its own unwelcome presentations by changing again and again. Freud brushes
                     against this scenario in <em>Analysis Terminable and Interminable</em> when he asks whether it could be possible for a self to develop “immunity” to future
                     disorders: as though “as though it were possible by means of analysis to attain to
                     a level of absolute psychical normality.”

                              216-254, 220, 219-220. For Freud too, absolute normality would not mean having no
                              feelings, but rather always knowing how to manage one’s feelings short of disaster.
                              I’ve argued elsewhere that this normative armature of the infinitely resourceful spirit
                              just is the myth of the “subject” (Terada).</span></div>
                     </div> While Freud imagines that such normality would mean that it was as though “the analyst

                     be expected to take place in him if his analysis were continued” (Freud 219), Hegel
                     follows the complementary possibility that it would consist in an <em>inexhaustible</em> stream of changes, each rising to the challenge of a different self-presented negativity;
                     but this would be possible for the same reason that Freud imagines, that one “had
                     succeeded in resolving every one of the patient’s repressions and in filling in all
                     the gaps in his memory” (Freud 220)—liberating all of what Hegel would call the mind’s
                     subjective resources. The ability to process events in real time without remainder
                     would be pathological healthiness and healthy pathology, and Hegel seems close to
                     that.</p>

                     had had something better than a revolution and negatively in theses of German pathology.
                     For Blackbourn and Eley, German exceptionalism underwrites the assumption of “liberalism
                     as the natural property of a ‘rising’ bourgeoisie” (<em>The Peculiarities of German History</em> 58). The mistake is “compounded,” Eley adds, “by the still riskier equation of ‘liberalism’
                     and ‘democracy’” (80).

                              e.g., “On one hand, there is the question of the conditions under which a bourgeois
                              capitalist society could successfully reproduce itself, or to put it another way,
                              the legal, political, and ideological conditions of existence for a successful German

                              system might have been achieved. These are not the same question” (Peculiarities 148).
                              When “more liberal” is paired with “political” in the text, it effectively means “mor…</span></div>
                     </div> Blackbourn and Eley hypothesize instead a nineteenth-century Germany in which the
                     foreclosure of democracy is a desired feature of a “new social order” (145), straightforwardly
                     in the interests of many involved in its creation. In this scheme, the German bourgeoisie
                     didn’t want more rights as much as they wanted others not to have them. By dispensing
                     with exceptionalism, Blackbourn and Eley show what it’s like to perceive the foreclosure
                     of democracy from the point of view of a rationalized society that does not see anything
                     absent. Kant reflects on nature “as the poets see it,” that is, just as sensuous shapes.
                     What is frightening about Blackbourn and Eley’s vision of society “as the bourgeois
                     see it” is that it is free of defense—just a shifting of factors. (Hegel: “the extremes
                     are merged and become factors” [<em>Logic, Being Part One of the Encyclopedia</em> §214]). This kind of freedom constitutes that liberality that can be found within
                     the police state. Suggesting that the foreclosure of democracy is grounded in defense—in
                     Germans, bourgeois populations, or whomever—is a little like hypothesizing German
                     exceptionalism; perhaps, instead, these groups don’t get so far as to have a need
                     for defense. To grasp this, in turn, is to remove many of the pejorative connotations
                     of “defense.”</p>

               <p>A subtext of my argument has been that the vocabulary for political activity seems
                  especially inadequate before Marx and before German unification. In 1816, the date
                  of the latest of the letters I’ve considered here, radicals had at their disposal
                  neither a full-blown theory of class, nor a unified German state to affirm or oppose;
                  from a standpoint located after those things, it could seem that they were flying
                  blind, and simply didn’t know yet what they were looking at and therefore what to
                  do. Yet restoration radicals’ disorientation can also seem more revealing, more self-aware,
                  than the nation-based political theory that supplanted it. It has more to say to us
                  than we have to say back to it, especially since, in a complementary way, the vocabulary
                  of the liberal nation-state has come to seem particularly inadequate after globalization.
                  Yet we still speak of “failed” postcolonial and post-Soviet states and of the “failure”
                  of many people to be interested in democracy—of their strange inability to get its
                  point fully, as though democracy was something otherwise readily available, that people
                  want and want other people to have. Instead of encouraging such speech, literature
                  of the early Vormärz discloses a world in which a template for the development of
                  democracy no sooner becomes thinkable than it disappears. </p>

                  <p>Their glimpse of the way their contemporaries see panics some post-Waterloo radicals;
                     Hegel is different, unpanicked, to the extent that he is confident about assimilating
                     and still having an identical self left to assimilate with. At stake in the phenomenology
                     he practices is his ability to absorb and interact with what he sees even as it poisons
                     him to blindness. Together, Hegel’s and Niethammer’s interlocking strategies describe
                     a double bind: the one who can’t bear to dwell in the new reality will be unlikely
                     to understand it, but the one who can bear it has already been changed by the very
                     bearing of it into a participant who may no longer perceive its disadvantages. Hegel
                     confides that focusing on the work of spirit allows him to feel “satisfaction” and
                     “<span class="foreign">Schadenfreude</span>” under political pressure, and he recommends it as a therapy for the times (Letter
                     272). Working on the basis of exactly the same perceptions, romanticism, as Hegel
                     knows, perceives how appealing it may be not to withstand a transition, even if it
                     means feeling the full impact of political catastrophe.

                     </div> One aspect of this impact, I’ve suggested, is having to give up on the idea of the
                     minimal goodness of the social world. An impasse between “positive” and “negative”
                     politics persists to the present day. Exploring the disorientating indistinction of
                     this time, we can see that the impasse constructed by romantics is not the disaster,
                     but a response to the disaster—a way to begin organizing an otherwise undifferentiated
                     space in which actively undergoing transition provides the only acknowledged value.
                     Correlatively, the romantic conclusion that the capacity to bear what goes by the
                     name of “Waterloo” is a health worse than death is not based on finding Hegel’s system,
                     or European politics, closed as opposed to breathtakingly open. It is based on the
                     perception of a world in which the closed and the open are becoming impossible to
