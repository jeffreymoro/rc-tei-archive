             <p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton—the first woman nominated by a major party to run for the office of the U.S. 
                 presidency—tried and failed to take control of the memes circulating around her political identity. 
                 Alt-right social media posts, tweets, and news articles literally pictured her as a <ref 
                     target="https://i.imgflip.com/16zdj7.jpg">devil</ref>, a <ref 
                     target="https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/agenda/walking-dead-hillary-clinton-zombie-candidate">zombie</ref>, 
                 or in <ref target="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/88/5c/79885c807cf82a337f545f20f46f4dd9.jpg">
                     prison</ref>. In this ultraconservative media stream, Hillary was hardly presidential material. She 
                 was, rather, an establishment politician from hell who was heading to jail for her supposed crimes—that 
                 is, if she didn’t die first from the health problems that her campaign was desperately hiding from 
                 the public.</p>
             <p>In response, Clinton and her supporters tried to take “the high road.” They produced some signature 
                 memes of the campaign, which underscored her qualifications for the presidency (see <ref 
                     target="http://textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr.com/">Texts from Hillary</ref>), her solidarity 
                 with girls, women, and minorities (through the <ref 
                     target="https://fsmedia.imgix.net/ed/21/75/4d/90a5/4ba2/931a/422695503190/this-collage-is-a-popular-image-on-various-pantsuit-nation-facebook-groups.jpeg">
                     Pantsuit Nation</ref> secret Facebook group), and her hopeful, progressive vision of social 
                 justice for all (such as “<ref 
                     target="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/669/ChlZGdOW0AAFhUD.jpg">I’m with Her</ref>” 
                 or “H→”) 
                 (Thrift). They also strove to subvert the misogynist language streaming forth from Trump and his 
                 followers (Martin). By appropriating a Trumpian term of hate like 
                 “<ref target="https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-12-22/7dba1be0-c870-11e6-864a-5359b2af823c_nw.gif">Nasty 
                     Woman</ref>,” encircling the insult in a red heart, and wearing the new logo on T-shirts 
                 for social media selfies, they put a positive yet defiant spin on one of the opposition’s malicious 
                 memes, transforming it into a code word for the cause to elect the first American woman president 
                 (Petrarca; Hess).</p>
             <p>We all know who won this “meme warfare” (Boyd; Haddow). Former U.S. senator and secretary of state 
                 Clinton’s typically upbeat, liberal, and cosmopolitan message was trumped by the consistently negative, 
                 nationalistic, overtly white-male-supremacist campaigning of her rival, a man without political 
                 experience. A few days before Donald J. Trump won the White House without a majority of the popular 
                 vote (and to the surprise of most of the media, the political establishment, and the profession of 
                 political science), the British journalist Douglas Haddow remarked: “memes are ruining democracy” and 
                 have “poisoned the U.S. election” through their “mass replication” (Haddow).</p>
             <p>Haddow’s then ominous, now prescient remark about the spread of politically poisonous memes raises some 
                 theoretical questions. What is a meme? What does it mean for a meme to be poisonous? How and why do 
                 memes replicate on a mass scale? To address these and other questions provoked by the unexpected 
                 outcome of Clinton’s loss to Trump, this essay clarifies the meaning of the meme and its roles in 
                 representing women in politics since the time of Mary Wollstonecraft. As scholars of British Romantic 
                 and Victorian literature know well, Mary<note place="foot" resp="editors">I use Wollstonecraft’s first 
                     name <emph>occasionally</emph> to underscore the similarity of her public and political reception 
                     to Hillary’s. For women—especially those who are women’s rights advocates—first-name recognition 
                     can be good or bad, because it does not always connote respect, and can often reduce the woman to 
                     stereotypes associated with her gender.</note>—much like Hillary more than two centuries after 
                 her—has been the subject of many portraits in the public sphere. These portraits—good, bad, and 
                 ugly—have shaped the trajectory of feminist politics worldwide (Kaplan 246–70).</p>
             <p>Elsewhere I have argued that Wollstonecraft was the first woman to become an international feminist 
                 meme—or a highly visible, malleable, and cross-national symbol of the women’s movement—due to the 
                 transatlantic marking of the major centennials of her life, work, and death in the 1890s (Botting, 
                 Carey, and Wilkerson 13–38; Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft, Mill</title> 204–48). Even from 
                 the 1790s onward, she has been a widely recognized and controversial symbol for women’s rights, 
                 wielded by both critics and adherents alike, across languages, cultures, and nations. Like Hillary, 
                 Mary has done better internationally than in her often-hostile homeland in terms of her public 
                 reception (Botting, “Making” 273–95; Botting, “Wollstonecraft in Europe” 503–27). The study of the 
                 evolution of the Wollstonecraft meme in several of its symbolic iterations—both negative and 
                 positive—yields some important lessons for future feminist interventions in the risky and virulent 
                 politics of meme warfare. As Clinton’s defeat indicates, there is an urgent need for 
                 twenty-first-century feminists of all stripes to strategize the successful manipulation of the meme for 
                 their political ends. Now that the internet meme has become one of the most vital and volatile conveyors 
                 of ideas in contemporary politics, feminists must learn from their past (including their past mistakes) 
                 to tap the full power of the meme as a strategic asset, not a liability, for their common causes.</p></div>
             <div type="section"><head>What Is a (Feminist) Meme?</head></div>
                <div type="section">
             <p>Before we understand the historical development of the meme and its relationship to feminism and other 
                 forms of politics, we need to define what a meme is (Botting, “Why Memes Matter”). Memes are a staple 
                 of contemporary popular culture, but most people would be hard-pressed to define what exactly they are. 
                 Simply put, memes are broadly identifiable yet variously replicated symbols of ideas. In the twenty-first 
                 century, most people associate the meme with social media, in which a photo or picture is posted, 
                 circulated, annotated with a brief quote or slogan, then recirculated and reedited into new iterations of 
                 the original meme.</p>
              <p>Within contemporary feminism, one famous recent example of such an internet meme is <title level="a"><ref 
                  target="http://feministryangosling.tumblr.com/">Feminist Ryan Gosling</ref>,</title> a series of images 
                  of the “sensitive” male actor emblazoned with woman-friendly invitations such as “Hey girl, keep your 
                  laws off my body, but keep your hands on it.” As this example suggests, internet memes can be vehicles 
                  for irony and wry discontent with the status quo. They can also be more straightforward means of conveying 
                  information, supporting causes, and spreading awareness. “Feminist Ryan Gosling” aims to achieve the 
                  latter goals by educating people about basic feminist ideas in a funny and memorable way. While directed 
                  at an imaginary female audience, these feminist memes are not only for women. A recent study has shown 
                  that men are more likely to support feminist ideas after viewing the original “Feminist Ryan Gosling” 
                  memes. Danielle Henderson, a graduate student in gender studies, began to create the memes in 2011 in 
                  order to make some of the fundamental points of feminist theory more accessible and understandable to 
                  broader audience (Henderson).</p>
              <p>Richard Dawkins invented the term <emph>meme</emph> to describe the nonteleological, evolutionary cultural 
                  process by which social symbols are formed, cross-fertilized, and reproduced in new and diverse 
                  iterations of an original (or “genetic”) idea (Dawkins 192, 322). Richard Rorty argued in turn that 
                  “memes are things like turns of speech, terms of aesthetic or moral praise, political slogans, proverbs, 
                  musical phrases, stereotypical icons, and the like” (Rorty 22). Upholding the political relevance of 
                  Dawkins’s concept for a pragmatic conception of feminism, Rorty explained that “different batches of . . . 
                  memes are carried by different human social groups, and so the triumph of one such group amounts to the 
                  triumph of those . . . memes” (Rorty 22). In this light, feminist memes can be understood as dominant 
                  clusters of public symbols that influence and embody the political ideas of the movement for women’s 
                  liberation from conditions of patriarchal oppression.</p>
              <p>At first glance, memes may look like irrational or nonrational replications of stereotypes, as Colin 
                  McGinn recently argued. On this reading, memes are merely a series of reductive symbols produced by a 
                  random network of people. As such, memes lack substance or the capability to convey any truth: as mere 
                  stereotypes, they can only perpetuate stereotypes and untruths, such as racist (or also, on McGinn’s 
                  reading, religious) ideas. McGinn contrasts memes with “themes,” such as well-known refrains from 
                  classical music or other products of what he (rather exclusively) defines as human rationality, such as 
                  scientific concepts or theories.</p>
              <p>Contra McGinn, I contend that the history of feminism suggests precisely the opposite about the relevance 
                  of the meme for philosophy and politics. Despite their seemingly superficial treatment of ideas, memes 
                  have proven to be powerful means for the public exchange of and critical engagement with complex 
                  feminist theories. The global popularity of “Feminist Ryan Gosling” alone suggests that, even in their 
                  less academic and political forms, memes can play an important role in the public representation of 
                  challenging, rapidly changing, and often abstruse ideas about gender, sex, and sexuality. <title 
                      level="a"><ref 
                          target="http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/02/We-Can-Do-It-Rosie-the-Riveter-Wallpaper-2-AB.jpeg">Rosie 
                          the Riveter</ref></title> is 
                  another example of a meme that has had incredible staying power and cross-cultural appeal for 
                  feminism despite its specific genesis in U.S. propaganda during the Second World War.</p>
              <p>Contemporary artist Barbara Kruger’s work from the 1980s—especially a poster developed for a pro-choice 
                  rally in Washington, D.C.—is another watershed for the emergence of the modern feminist meme. In <title 
                      level="a"><ref target="http://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger/untitled-your-body-battleground">Untitled</ref>
                  </title> (1989), Kruger bisected a photo of a female model’s face, depicting 
                  one side as the negative image of 
                  the other. She sliced the bright-red slogan “Your body is a battleground” through the center of the 
                  picture. Through the cutting of the woman’s face into opposing halves, the striking reversals of color 
                  (black/white, red/monochrome), and the superimposition of text that can be read in different ways, 
                  Kruger created a multilayered political statement. “Untitled” at once exposes the divisiveness of 
                  abortion politics, the media’s harmful distortion of women’s self-images, the objectification of 
                  women’s bodies for men’s sexual and reproductive ends, and even the ironies of the feminist movement 
                  to “reclaim” or “defend” women’s bodily autonomy from domination under antiabortion policies. Kruger’s 
                  innovative combination of iconic imagery and ironic slogans in her artwork has since become a model 
                  for memes of all kinds, but perhaps especially the feminist memes shared on the pathways of the 
                  internet.</p>
              <p>In his book <title level="m">Media Virus</title> (1994), Douglas Rushkoff developed an interpretive 
                  framework for understanding the virulent spread of memes through modern media. He conceptualized memes 
                  as a kind of “ideological code” that spread, like a virus, through media networks (Rushkoff 9–10). Memes 
                  attached themselves to whichever hosts proved hospitable for the reproduction and spread of their views, 
                  whether in belief, action, voice, print, or art. Rushkoff concluded that memes “infiltrate the way we 
                  do business, educate ourselves, interact with each other—even the way we perceive ‘reality’” (9–10).</p>
              <p>Ruskoff’s theory of meme replication as akin to viral transmission influenced activist Andrew Boyd, 
                  who coined the term <emph>meme warfare</emph> in 2002. Boyd argued that memes had become the most 
                  significant political weapons in “the matrix of hearts and minds and media” that was “a vast theatre 
                  of viral warfare” (Boyd). Like other political movements, feminism has found its way into this vast 
                  twenty-first-century theatre of art and war, a virtual and digital battleground of signs and symbols. 
                  In order to navigate its own path through that battleground, feminism must pay heed to its 
                  past—especially the global reception of one of its founders—as a guide for successful political 
                  action in the present and future.</p></div>
              <div type="section"><head>Wollstonecraft as Mother of the Feminist Meme</head></div>
              <div type="section">
              <p>Long before <title level="a">Feminist Ryan Gosling,</title> <title level="a">Your Body is a 
                  Battleground,</title> and <title level="a">Rosie the Riveter,</title> feminists 
                  across eras and cultures have made use of the meme for thoughtful and deliberate political purposes. 
                  Mary Wollstonecraft was exceptional in this regard for two reasons. First, it is widely known that 
                  she became a kind of putty in the hands of her patriarchal critics, especially after her untimely 
                  death from a childbirth infection in 1797. Her husband William Godwin’s well-meaning posthumous 
                  tribute, <title level="m">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (1798), 
                  shared too much information with the conservative British public about Wollstonecraft’s experiences 
                  with love outside of the institution of patriarchal marriage. English anti-Jacobin (anti–French 
                  Revolution) writers such as Richard Polwhele and John Corry seized the opportunity to recast 
                  Wollstonecraft in the image of their own critique of early feminist ideas, upholding her as the fallen 
                  woman in an oft-told morality tale detailing the inevitably tragic consequences of the permissive sexual 
                  behavior of the radicals of the Revolutionary era (Botting, <title level="a">Wollstonecraft in 
                      Europe,</title> 503–27).</p>
              <p>In 1798, John Chapman created a stipple engraving of <title level="a"><ref 
                  target="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw41811/Mary-Wollstonecraft">Mrs. 
                  Godwin</ref></title>—preserved by the 
                  National Portrait Gallery, London—which built upon these anti-Jacobin stereotypes of Wollstonecraft. 
                  Chapman altered Wollstonecraft’s 1797 portrait by John Opie so that she looked masculine in her facial 
                  features, and donned a hat typically worn by male supporters of the French Revolution, thus signaling to 
                  the public that her feminist ideas were a threat to womanhood itself. While these antifeminist morality 
                  tales instigated a negative trend in the reception of Wollstonecraft, especially in Britain during the 
                  Napoleonic era, they also made her even more famous worldwide.</p>
              <p>With the international spread of newspapers and other journalistic media in the nineteenth century, 
                  Wollstonecraft became <emph>the</emph> household name for what she stood for—women’s rights (Botting, 
                  <title level="a">Making</title> 273–95). Whether loved or hated, she was a highly visible symbol of 
                  nascent feminist ideas of love, marriage, liberty, and citizenship, especially in continental Europe and 
                  the Americas during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Botting, <title level="a">Making</title> 
                  273–95; Botting, <title level="a">Wollstonecraft in Europe</title> 503–27; Botting and Matthews, <title 
                      level="a">Overthrowing</title> 64–83). By 1915, <title level="j"><ref 
                          target="https://www.nytimes.com/1915/07/11/archives/woman-suffrage-campaign-in-books-an-annotated-list-of-the-leading.html">The 
                          New York Times</ref></title> could claim in a headline that the “Woman Suffrage Campaign” began with a 
                          book by “Mary Wollstonecraft More Than a Century Ago,” and append to the article an overtly 
                          feminized portrait-meme based upon the 1797 painting by John Opie.</p>
              <p>Less discussed is a second political and literary trend that Wollstonecraft herself instigated with her 
                  first, quasi-autobiographical novel, <title level="m">Mary, a Fiction</title> (1788). A decade before 
                  the British anti-Jacobin critics turned her into a symbol of the dangerous assertion of women’s rights, 
                  Wollstonecraft made herself into a feminist meme by sharing in the public sphere a series of powerful 
                  arguments and vivid stories about her experiences and observations of women’s oppression on the basis 
                  of their sex. Between the publication of <title level="m">Mary</title> and her last, unfinished novel 
                  <title level="m">Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman</title> (1798), she self-reflectively fashioned (and 
                  refashioned) her public personae through the creation of literary personae who were composites of herself 
                  and other women in her life. She became we. Mary in her different incarnations was at once a woman 
                  philosopher who argued for equal rights for the sexes, a melancholic yet heroic survivor of a bad romance,
                  and an “everywoman” who had suffered oppression due to sexual discrimination. From her autobiographically 
                  inflected novels to her published letters to her political treatises, Wollstonecraft’s various 
                  self-images led to countless public reimaginings of the meaning of her life and writings for the 
                  evolution of feminism itself.</p>
              <p>One of the unsung, yet strikingly successful, political strategies of first-wave feminists was to reclaim 
                  and repurpose negative memes of Wollstonecraft for the sake of fostering the authority, public appeal, and 
                  internal solidarity of their women’s movements. A veritable pantheon of first-wave feminist writers—Hannah 
                  Mather Crocker, Flora Tristan, Lucretia Mott, Margaret Fuller, George Eliot, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan 
                  B. Anthony, Olive Schreiner, Bertha Pappenheim, Elvira López, Ruth Benedict, Emma Goldman, Carrie Chapman 
                  Catt, and Virginia Woolf—looked back to Wollstonecraft’s life and ideas as an inspiration for their own 
                  pathbreaking storytelling and argumentation concerning the political urgency of the growing cause of the 
                  rights of women worldwide. Immortalizing in literature Wollstonecraft’s staying power as a feminist meme, 
                  Woolf wrote in 1929: “She is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace her 
                  influence even now among the living” (176).</p></div>
              <div type="section"><head>The Feminist Meme after Mary: Hillary, Malala, Emma, and Back Again</head></div>
              <div type="section">
              <p>Back in the twenty-first century, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai, and Emma Watson are among the recent 
                  iconic counterparts to Wollstonecraft, the mother of modern feminist memes. Hillary has taken a long 
                  journey of public refashioning of herself. Her career has been a case study in cultivating political 
                  personae, beginning in the 1970s when the star graduate of Yale Law School chose to support her husband’s 
                  aspirations for the presidency rather than immediately pursue political office, and extending into the 
                  2000s when she used her years as a U.S. senator and U.S. secretary of state to define her global political 
                  identity as the first competitive female candidate for the U.S. presidency (Clinton i). While there have 
                  been many negative iterations of the Hillary meme—often making the lame suggestion she is actually a man 
                  in drag, much like Horace Walpole derided Wollstonecraft as a “hyena in petticoats”—these insults have in 
                  fact fueled her visibility as a significant political actor on the national and international stage 
                  (Walpole 337–38).</p>
              <p>Critical responses to misogynistic Hillary memes have also trained two generations of feminists in the art 
                  of public defense of their favored political candidates. This is true on the national as well as 
                  international level. In 2015, Malala undercut the misogynistic meme of Hillary (or any woman) as 
                  unqualified to serve in the highest political offices of the world: “Even in America, even in America, 
                  people are waiting for a woman president” (qtd. in Porges). Malala’s own shifting self-narratives have 
                  likewise made her, arguably, among the most influential international feminist memes (and meme-makers) 
                  today. The youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize—awarded for her death-defying advocacy of the 
                  education of girls against the wishes of the Taliban—Malala now owns the internet when it comes to one 
                  of Hillary’s signature slogans, “Women’s rights are human rights.” This political slogan is 
                  philosophically rooted in the watershed arguments of Wollstonecraft’s 1792 book, <title level="m">A 
                      Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> (Botting, <title level="m">Wollstonecraft, Mill</title> 
                  1–17). Hillary’s signature meme and Malala’s iteration of it therefore reproduce a venerable tradition 
                  of feminist argumentation dating to the French Revolutionary period.</p>
              <p>Interviewed in 2015 by Emma Watson, U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador, Malala helped to define feminism—a 
                  controversial word in her Islamic culture that she had carefully avoided in her previous speeches and 
                  writings—in a way that would appeal to the broadest possible audience. As she simply and clearly put it: 
                  “Feminism is another word for equality” (qtd. in Vagianos). This slogan has since appeared under the 
                  image of Yousafzai with Watson, and circulated in various mimetic forms on the internet—producing yet 
                  another testament to the power of memes (and their makers) to thoughtfully and rationally engage, and 
                  thereby advance, the ideas of feminism worldwide (Vagianos). The <ref 
                      target="https://images.app.goo.gl/DPWLdysDHNPXe4wYA">2016 Hillary presidential campaign</ref> 
                  made a meme of this interview, with the 
                  text “I really think America needs a woman president” superimposed on the GIF of Emma and Malala 
                  conversing. Though on one level arguably parasitic, such a strategic appropriation of the Malala-Emma 
                  GIF demonstrates the ways that feminist memes—like memes more broadly—grow and spread through symbolic 
                  cross-pollination.</p>
              <p>During her 2016 campaign for the presidency, Hillary embraced this tradition of making women (including 
                  herself) into positive memes for the sake of advancing women’s rights. In response to waves of 
                  misogynist attacks from the Trump campaign, Team Hillary—both her official and her grassroots 
                  campaigners—gave her public image a series of upbeat, appealing, good-humored makeovers. A working 
                  woman who once looked down on baking cookies became a <ref 
                      target="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/70/8c/69/708c695f8786af87703c1a7c2eaf8e82.jpg">maternal 
                      executive</ref>. 
                  The lying yet loyal First Lady became a strongly patriotic yet fiercely private world leader. She rose 
                  from the ashes of the scandals of Lewinsky, Benghazi, and “emailgate” to assume the pop-feminist 
                  incarnation of “<ref target="https://images.app.goo.gl/bKMmWy8WUvwuXdes7">Notorious HRC.</ref>” Even as 
                  many wished her to go to prison for her cache of top-secret emails, a growing number saw her “notorious” 
                  history as an asset in the dark and dangerous realms of presidential and international politics. Neither 
                  a devil nor a witch, she became in these memes a powerful stateswoman poised to do what it took to 
                  protect her nation from threats both domestic and international. Called a “progressive hawk,” she was 
                  represented as prepared to take down tyrants through special ops, beat a would-be dictator in a 
                  high-stakes presidential election, and make hard yet sober choices to defend her country’s security 
                  and other political interests on the global political stage (Cassidy). Almost every negative or mocking 
                  image of Hillary was turned upside down and transformed to advance her campaign for the presidency.</p>
              <p>Was it all for naught? However creative, funny, and smart they may have been, the feminist memes made for 
                  Hillary’s 2016 campaign did not succeed in shattering that last glass ceiling for women in world 
                  politics: the U.S. presidency. In a conservative postmortem on the election results, Mark Lilla 
                  gleefully surmised that Hillary’s defeat marked the end of “identity politics,” including feminism: no 
                  longer could liberals assume that diffuse and abstract ideas such as “diversity” could successfully 
                  unite people around concrete and viable candidates, platforms, and policies (Lilla).</p>
              <p>While nicely acerbic, Lilla’s critique of liberalism and feminism is (ironically, for an intellectual 
                  historian) conveniently shortsighted. If he took the long view—all the way back to the time of the 
                  French Revolution and its aftermath—he’d see that other feminists, such as Wollstonecraft and many of 
                  her followers, had suffered grave defeats and yet rose from the ashes, phoenix-like, in new, even more 
                  politically salient forms. Against this background, the 2016 U.S. presidential election marked not the 
                  end of feminism but the need for its rebirth in new political media.</p>
              <p>Those new political forms include the ever-malleable, though still potent, feminist meme. If there is 
                  any lesson that Wollstonecraft and her many memes teach twenty-first-century feminisms, it’s the power 
                  of rebirthing and reshaping old ideas through new words, images, and media. Applying ourselves to this 
                  historic feminist task, especially in the wake of defeat, is the only path toward a new, hopefully 
                  successful, form of democratic politics that puts the protection of the rights of all people at its 
                  core. Sound familiar? It should. For readers of Wollstonecraft, the path forward for twenty-first-century 
                  feminisms will feel like an uncanny return to some of the guiding principles of <title level="m">A 
                      Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, which have been reinvigorated by the many mimetic 
                  iterations of the book and author in the centuries since.</p>
