               “The Radicalism of Queenship”
               calls attention to Mary Wollstonecraft’s engagement with exceptional historical women,
               focusing especially on her comments on royal women such as Queen Caroline Matilda
               of Denmark and Norway. In highlighting how Wollstonecraft found it useful to think
               with royal women, the paper suggests the importance of placing Wollstonecraft—and
               feminism more broadly—within many different and often complimentary philosophical
               approaches and traditions. The paper then charts the role that queens and other elite
               women have played in the emergence and articulation of western feminisms, focusing
               especially on developments in Britain.</p>

               <h1><span class="head">The Radicalism of Queenship: Mary Wollstonecraft and Alternative Sources of the Rights

            </header><br/><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
               <p>It is well known that Mary Wollstonecraft had little patience for history, and especially
                  for histories of exceptional or “worthy” women. “I have been led to imagine,” she
                  wrote in her 1792 <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, “that the few extraordinary women who have rushed in eccentric directions out of
                  the orbit prescribed to their sex, were male spirited, confined by mistake in a female
                  frame” (68). Wollstonecraft seems to have held elite women in particular contempt,
                  and condemned court culture for the “wretchedness” that “flow[s] from hereditary honours,
                  riches, and monarchy” and the “dispensations of providence” (19). For Wollstonecraft,
                  we have thus been led to believe, the key to women’s emancipation lay primarily in
                  their claims to natural rights as human beings, that is, those inalienable rights
                  that transcended culture, nation, and biology.</p>
               <p>But a closer reading of the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>—along with some of Wollstonecraft’s other seminal texts—suggests that history, and
                  specifically the history of royal women, may not have been as anathema to Wollstonecraft
                  as we might think. The very impetus for writing the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, after all, turned in part on a debate regarding the Salic Law, the law passed in
                  fifteenth-century France barring women from the throne. Wollstonecraft was allegedly
                  infuriated when her colleague Thomas Christie—a fellow radical and editor of the <em>Analytical Review</em>—defended the French National Assembly’s decision <em>not</em> to tamper with the Old Regime laws governing royal succession, on the grounds that
                  the Salic Law reflected the “natural” sexual and social order (Bruder 109–10). As
                  Christie explained in his <em>Letters on the Revolution in France, and on the New Constitution</em>, published in 1791, “The ancient Salic Law, which excludes females from succeeding
                  to the throne, was considered by the Assembly as a fundamental and wise regulation
                  of the monarchy, which merited to be solemnly renewed, and permanently established.”
                  It was in preserving the Salic Law, he added, that the French had demonstrated most
                  clearly “that they knew where to draw the line, and so to honour the sex as not to
                  injure their <em>real</em> happiness, or endanger the welfare of society.” This was a far cry from the state
                  of Britain, where women were allowed “to rule over men”—an “unnatural and shocking”
                  development that marked the “reversal of the laws of Nature” (217–18). Such misogynistic
                  claims, Helen Bruder notes, served as further grist for Wollstonecraft’s feminist
                  mill, and helped motivate her to write the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, published the following year (110).</p>
               <p>What is more, the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> itself, though clearly written in certain respects against the past, is peppered
                  with references to “history.” And the “history” that Wollstonecraft invokes is often
                  a productive one for women, with lessons both for the “fair sex” and for those men
                  who write about women. Yes, the “history of woman” often amounts to little more than
                  a depressing tale of women as either “slave” or “despot”—“situations [that] equally
                  retard the progress of reason” (115). But the “history of all nations” also offers
                  up instructive tales regarding women’s inability to be “confined to merely domestic
                  pursuits” (402). It is perhaps for this reason that she recommends history as a component
                  of girls’ educations. In particular, she urges girls to acquaint themselves with “heroic
                  characters” from the past as a necessary corrective to romantic fiction (431).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In her <em>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</em>, published four years later in 1796, Wollstonecraft further explores these didactic
                     dimensions of history, especially as they apply to the formation of women’s character.
                     She dwells, for instance, on the example provided by the British-born Queen Caroline
                     Matilda of Denmark and Norway (1751–1775), consort of King Christian VII (and sister
                     of King George III).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For more on Wollstonecraft’s strategic discussion of Queen Matilda, see Bahar 126.</span></div>
                     </div> Though a flawed figure—she had an affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee, her Privy
                     Counsellor—Caroline Matilda nevertheless gains Wollstonecraft’s respect for her public
                     spiritedness and charity work, her sensible parenting practices, and even her impatience
                     with custom. She wished, Wollstonecraft writes, “to do immediately what can only be
                     done by time” (204). Thus while Wollstonecraft ultimately sees Caroline Matilda as
                     a tragic character—she died very young, from scarlet fever, after enduring the dissolution
                     of her marriage, the execution of her lover, and her exile to Germany—Wollstonecraft
                     also finds in Caroline Matilda’s life an inspiring story of female fortitude and grit.
                     Because of her birth and rank, Caroline Matilda had been able to live her life differently
                     from the majority of women (even if in ways still highly constrained by her sex).
                     Women such as Caroline Matilda therefore offered clues as to what might be possible
                     for all women, if given greater latitude and access.</p>

               <p>Why does Wollstonecraft’s engagement with figures like Queen Caroline Matilda matter?
                  I take up these considerations because my own current research, published as <em>The Right to Rule and the Rights of Women: Queen Victoria and the Women’s Movement</em>, charts how women’s rights activists leveraged Queen Victoria—and the tradition of
                  female rule in Britain more generally—to make arguments for female emancipation over
                  the course of the nineteenth century. I am deeply interested in the ways in which
                  Britain’s history of female royal leadership (and what paradoxically might be construed
                  as the egalitarian dimensions of certain royal institutions and practices) impacted
                  the development of feminist consciousness. Already in the late seventeenth century,
                  John Locke was speculating in his <em>First Treatise on Government</em> on the uses of queens regnant in challenging the patriarchal vision contained in
                  the Book of Genesis. “Will any one say,” Locke wondered, “that either of our queens,
                  Mary or Elizabeth, had they married any of their subjects, had been by this text [i.e.,
                  Genesis] put into a political subjection to him? or that he should thereby have had
                  monarchical rule over her? God, in this text, gives not, that I see, any authority
                  to Adam over Eve, or to men over their wives, but only foretels [<span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</span>] what should be the woman’s lot . . . ” (32–33).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These themes would be further developed by the writers Sarah Egerton, Catherine Trotter,
                     Mary, Lady Chudleigh, and Mary Astell during the reign of Queen Anne.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> As Astell explained in the third edition of her <em>Some Reflections Upon Marriage</em>, published in 1706, Queen Anne’s rule forced a reappraisal of patriarchy: “If by
                     the Natural Superiority of their Sex, they mean that every Man is by Nature superior
                     to every Woman . . . it would be a Sin in any Woman to have Dominion over any Man,
                     and the greatest Queen ought not to command but to obey her Footman, because no Municipal
                     Laws can supersede or change the Law of Nature; so that if the Dominion of the Men
                     be such, the Salique Law, as unjust as English Men have ever thought it, ought to
                     take place over all the Earth, and the most glorious Reigns . . . were wicked Violations
                     of the Law of Nature!” (3–4). Several others would adopt similar strategies in the
                     decades that followed, including the jurist Henry Homes (Lord Kames), Bluestockings
                     Hester Thrale Piozzi and Elizabeth Montagu, and the radical playwright Thomas Holcroft.</p>
               </div>
               <p>By the late eighteenth century, in fact, such strategies were commonplace in feminist
                  circles. Even without a female sovereign currently on the throne, a number of British
                  radicals culled the past, and especially the royal past, in order to stretch Enlightenment
                  thinking on the function, value, and capabilities of women. As I discovered in writing
                  my first book on <em>Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism</em>, late-Enlightenment “male feminists” frequently invoked the principle of royal succession,
                  and women’s prominent positions within the court more generally, in fashioning arguments
                  in favor of “women’s rights.” According to the Scottish Physician William Alexander,
                  there was a grave injustice in the fact that women could rule, but were forbidden
                  from performing any lesser civil or political functions. “In Britain,” he wrote in
                  his <em>History of Women</em> (1779), “we allow a woman to sway our scepter, but by law and custom we debar her
                  from every other government but that of her own family, as if there were not a public
                  employment between that of superintending the kingdom, and the affairs of her own
                  kitchen, which could be managed by the genius and capacity of woman” (2:439).</p>
               <p>Other male reformers eager to inject a more egalitarian strain into British politics
                  routinely underscored this same point. Richard Dinmore and Thomas Starling Norgate,
                  both Norwich-based radical reformers well known for their feminist sympathies, stressed
                  that “women’s rights” were firmly in keeping with Britain’s constitutional history,
                  as reflected in the nation’s royal succession policies. As Dinmore explained in his
                  <em>Brief Account of the Moral and Political Acts of the Kings and Queens of England</em> (1793), “The want of this right [women’s right to vote] is peculiarly absurd in this
                  kingdom, where a woman may reign, though not vote for a member of Parliament” (178–79).
                  To flesh out their arguments, Dinmore and Norgate drew attention to the fact that
                  those queens who had actually served the nation had been largely capable, and in some
                  cases even highly adept at carrying out their demanding functions. In this regard,
                  Queen Elizabeth I especially became something of a lodestar. For Dinmore, Elizabeth
                  “may fairly be considered the best monarch that ever sat on the English throne.” “Indeed,”
                  Dinmore continues, “the character of this Queen convinces us of the injustice that
                  has hitherto been done to the Rights of Women” (178). In Norgate’s similar assessment,
                  relayed in his “Observations on the Reign and Character of Queen Elizabeth,” Elizabeth
                  I was a “great and splendid” leader, who demonstrated by her very example that women
                  should be accorded more power at all levels of society and government (142–43).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Nor was it just the men who took up such arguments. The writers Mary Robinson and
                     Mary Hays, two of Wollstonecraft’s closest female interlocutors, also adopted comparable
                     strategies. As the historian Mary Spongberg has suggested, the royal female life held
                     immense value for Robinson and Hays, who drew “on the lives of royal women in distinctly
                     feminist ways, critiquing the patriarchal strictures that shaped their lives and the
                     absence of feminine influence in the recounting of history” (74).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                              (3)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Spongberg 74 for further elaboration: “In developing this form of women’s history,
                              such writers challenged masculinist generic conventions to carve out a uniquely feminine
                              historical space in which to understand the condition of all women.”</span></div>
                     </div> We see such tendencies firmly on display in these women’s writing. Robinson—former
                     mistress to the Prince of Wales (the future King George IV)—used Elizabeth I to measure
                     the female sex’s inner if often thwarted potential. “Judge,” she commanded her readers
                     in her <em>Letter to the Women of England</em> (1799), “whether England ever boasted a more wise or more fortunate sovereign: one,
                     more revered in council; more obeyed in power; or more successful in enterprize. And
                     yet Elizabeth was but a woman!” (29).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In her <em>Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</em> (1798), Hays also explored this theme: “Let it not be said that crowned heads are
                  too much out of the common road, to be brought forward for examples; for as they are
                  neither more nor less than men and women, they come quite within our sphere” (36).
                  Given that queens were <em>only</em> women, Hays explained, it was well worth considering their achievements. They deserved
                  a central place in any inquiry into, and argument in favor of women’s improved treatment.
                  Over twenty years later, Hays would offer more sober reflections on this point in
                  her <em>Memoirs of Queens</em> (1821)—especially in her striking meditation on Queen Caroline, the estranged wife
                  of George IV. On becoming King in 1820, George IV had tried to obtain a divorce from
                  Caroline on the grounds of adultery, much to the chagrin of his angry subjects. Recounting
                  the trial of Queen Caroline, and the public’s impassioned response, Hays suggested
                  that the occasion had emboldened women to rise up in “common cause against the despotism
                  and tyranny of man.” To “<em>equity</em> not gallantry,” she observed, “do [women] now prefer their claim” (127). According
                  to Hays, then, Queen Caroline’s public humiliations had inspired women to speak up
                  in defense of their own rights and prerogatives. In this way, even royal women’s misfortunes
                  could be used to salutary effect.</p>
               <p>Once Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, these kinds of arguments only accelerated.
                  On the one hand, nineteenth-century activists were deeply interested in Victoria as
                  a woman, and used her to demonstrate that the female sex had the capacity to reason,
                  to grapple with politics, and even to balance their professional and familial obligations.
                  Here, after all, was a woman who—by necessity—was pursuing joint commitments in the
                  private and public sphere. As the leading suffragist campaigner Millicent Garrett
                  Fawcett explained in her <em>Life of Her Majesty Queen Victoria</em>, published to coincide with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria had proven
                  definitively that women could combine work and family. “Politics and political responsibilities
                  of the greatest kind have not unsexed her,” she observed in a chapter entitled “The
                  Warp and Woof of Home and Politics” (225). By extension, activists were also quick
                  to call attention to any unfair treatment that they perceived the Queen to be receiving,
                  or to expose what they construed as sexism. A reporter for the London <em>Daily News</em>, for example, took to task those “political misogynists” who insisted that “all the
                  credit usually given to female Sovereigns belongs to their male advisers, and that
                  all the mischief done under the reigns of men may be attributed to the feminine influences
                  which surrounded them” (<em>Daily News</em> 5).</p>
               <p>On the other hand, though, Victorian women’s rights campaigners were interested in
                  promoting the simple fact that their nation now had a female head of state. Victoria’s
                  status alone gave them plenty of ammunition. As feminist advocates frequently noted,
                  echoing their seventeenth- and eighteenth-century predecessors, was it not extremely
                  paradoxical that women were permitted to rule in Britain while their female subjects,
                  up until the last quarter of the nineteenth century at least, were denied most of
                  the rights and privileges accorded to men? “Every wife except a queen regnant,” Linda
                  Colley reminds us, “was under the legal authority of her husband, and so was her movable
                  property”—and this dispossession persisted until the passage of the Married Women’s
                  Property Acts in 1870 and 1882 (238). On the political front, the disjuncture was
                  even more striking. Even at the close of Victoria’s rule, in 1901, British women still
                  lacked the parliamentary franchise—a right that men had secured through the successive
                  Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884, but that women would only be granted in 1918,
                  with the passage of the Representation of the People Act (and even then, the law only
                  applied to women over the age of 30).</p>
               <p>Leading nineteenth-century women’s rights campaigners frequently seized on this paradox
                  and tried to exploit it for various reasons: to demonstrate their loyalty to the Queen,
                  to celebrate (and sometimes even inflate) Victoria’s political prerogatives, and to
                  call attention to the national tradition of including women in the royal line of succession.
                  All of these became prominent features of Victorian campaigning, especially in regard
                  to the question of the female franchise. “But if those,” the leading feminist spokesperson
                  Harriet Taylor wrote in the <em>Westminster Review</em> in 1851, “who assert that the ‘proper sphere’ for women is the domestic, mean by
                  this that they have not shown themselves qualified for any other, the assertion evinces
                  great ignorance of life and of history.” “Women,” she added, “have shown fitness for
                  the highest social functions, exactly in proportion as they have been admitted to
                  them. By a curious anomaly, though ineligible to even the lowest office of state,
                  they are in some countries admitted to the highest of all, the regal . . . Concerning
                  the fitness, then, of women for politics, there can be no question. . . .” (297).</p>

               <p>As Wollstonecraft’s comments in the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> and <em>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> suggest, she too was susceptible to this line of thinking, even if hers was a more
                  muted strain than that of many of her peers. Her probing comments about Queen Caroline
                  Matilda, her endorsements of “history” and “heroic characters,” and even her dismay
                  at Thomas Christie’s comments in regards to the French Revolutionaries’ preservation
                  of the Salic Law—all of these impulses suggest that Wollstonecraft too saw in the
                  history of monarchy some of the raw material out of which to vindicate her sex. Inasmuch
                  as Wollstonecraft has come to serve as a placeholder for or signifier of modern western
                  feminist commitments, then, I see three key reasons why we should be more attuned
                  to these aspects of her work, with significance both for our understanding of Wollstonecraft
                  herself and for the broader feminist conversation in which she was, and indeed remains,
                  a central participant.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>First, being attentive to these dimensions of Wollstonecraft’s thinking alerts us
                     to the range of traditions in which Wollstonecraft was working—and to the range of
                     traditions which have informed western feminism more generally. To appreciate the
                     historical bent of some of Wollstonecraft’s thinking is to recognize, as scholars
                     have increasingly tried to stress, that Wollstonecraft, like so many of her peers
                     and followers, was never operating exclusively within the framework of natural rights
                     or what we might describe as Enlightenment liberalism. Rather, “modern” feminism emerged
                     from eclectic origins, and developed by drawing on insights and inspirations from
                     a range of sources. It was, and continues to be, animated by many different logics—sometimes
                     even contradictory ones. Wollstonecraft drew on natural rights philosophy, yes. But
                     she also drew on constitutional theory, English history, the “woman worthy” tradition,
                     and the theology of Rational Dissent. The goal here, then, is not to downplay the
                     significance of natural rights in the evolution of feminism, but rather to see it
                     as one of many currents. Feminism is not, and never has been, a linear development.

                  </p>
               </div>
               <p>This brings me to my second point. A greater attention to Wollstonecraft’s historical
                  interests, especially in regard to the history of royal women, does more than simply
                  illuminate the range of forces shaping early feminist conversations. When read alongside
                  the treatises penned by her peers and successors, Wollstonecraft’s engagement with
                  the past also suggests that history, and particularly royal history, seems to have
                  exercised a strong pull in women’s rights deliberations—and in the broader construction
                  of what Barbara Taylor has described as the “feminist imagination.” It is not, then,
                  just that queens and princesses figured in early feminist conversations. Rather, it
                  is that they figured prominently and persistently. These royal women, moreover, were
                  typically culled from a specifically British past, though women from other cultures
                  and traditions were also referenced on occasion (especially in those works situated
                  at the nexus of feminist argument and female biography—consider, for example, Mary
                  Hays’s <em>Female Biography; or Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and
                     Countries</em>, published in 1803).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The national dimensions of this story are especially worthy of consideration. For
                     the feminism that emerged in Britain, in fits and starts during the seventeenth century
                     and then in a more fully fleshed-out form from the late eighteenth century, was built
                     on very particular and often quite hopeful readings of the nation’s past. National
                     traditions and customs, especially as pertaining to the tradition of female royal
                     leadership, played a key role in the development of British feminism. We need to bear
                     this national context in mind, as it reminds us that feminism cannot always be easily
                     exported—grafted, as it were, onto other societies. Rather, we need to recognize the
                     ways in which women’s rights conversations, even in their most nascent stages, were
                     often informed by a keen sense of national pride, and even of patriotism. However
                     instrumental or manufactured their gestures may have been, women’s rights advocates
                     were eager to fashion a “useable history,” drawing on their nation’s past, in order
                     to legitimate their egalitarian vision. In fact, feminism took root in Britain in
                     part because it appealed to a shared cultural and political inheritance. In short,
                     Queens Elizabeth I, Anne, and Victoria mattered—as Queen Elizabeth II does today.
                     While this is not to suggest that feminisms cannot circulate and combine beyond national
                     borders, it is to appreciate that such arguments often resonate best when they can
                     appeal to the local and specific as well as to the universal and the general.

                  <p>My third and final point relates to early feminists’ fascination with female sovereigns
                     and other members of the royal family, and with what this fascination might tell us
                     about the continuing—and often misunderstood—appeal of the monarchy. In this respect,
                     this point has the most direct connection to our present moment. In contemporary feminist
                     circles, I have found that royal watching is often dismissed as a mindless or trivial
                     practice. And the study of elites, royals especially, continues to receive little
                     attention from scholars of women and gender—especially from those studying the modern
                     period (the period following the Glorious Revolution of 1688). “Studies of British
                     womanhood,” observes Clarissa Campbell Orr in <em>Queenship in Britain</em>, “have, with valuable exceptions . . . tended to focus on women of middling or lower
                     social rank; aside from the attention given to Caroline of Brunswick, feminist historians
                     have yet to revisit the royal family and are only just starting on the aristocracy”
                     (7).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Orr notes, however, that “much is to be gained for women’s history and feminist history
                              by looking at women at the social apex, including their roles, representations and
                              symbolic importance for other men and women . . . They could influence taste, fashion,
                              social customs and moral values” (7).</span></div>
                     </div> This distancing and denigration extends to what we often describe as “girlie-girl
                     culture,” with its emphasis on Disneyfied versions of princesses and queens. As the
                     cultural critic Peggy Orenstein observes in her influential book <em>Cinderella Ate My Daughter</em>, marketers have found increasingly successful ways to ply their pink princess products
                     to their youngest consumers. In the process, she argues, they communicate insidious
                     messages about female dependence, desire, and beauty.</p>
               </div>
               <p>On this score, even the contemporary British royal family comes in for scrutiny. For
                  the historian Charles Beem, Queen Elizabeth II offers little by way of feminist inspiration
                  or example. “Elizabeth II,” he writes, “has never been inclined to erase the gendered
                  distinctions between her male and female household officers. Like all her predecessors
                  as female kings, Elizabeth II is an honorary male, with no apparent interest in furthering
                  feminist goals of gender equality for her female subjects” (177–78). And the author
                  Hilary Mantel provided a particularly scathing assessment of monarchy in the pages
                  of the <em>London Review of Books</em> (2013), where she described the Duchess of Cambridge as “becoming a jointed doll
                  on which certain rags are hung,” a woman who allowed herself to be crafted into someone
                  whose “only point and purpose” was “to give birth.”</p>
               <p>To be sure, critics like Orenstein, Beem, and Mantel make some astute points. There
                  is nothing inherently empowering about studying, citing, emulating, or being a queen
                  or princess. In truth, the British royal family has often been used to promote conservative,
                  even retrograde, gender roles and ideals. (A survey of antisuffragist posters and
                  flyers from the Edwardian period, with their enthusiastic references to Queen Victoria
                  and her belief in the “mad, wicked folly” of women’s rights, quickly confirms this.)
                  And many of the biographies of royal women churned out each year often do more to
                  reinforce than to undermine patriarchal values and assumptions. Female members of
                  the royal family, too, have at times played a complicit role in this process—despite
                  the egalitarian dimensions of their institution. By the same token, there is also
                  a troubling fixation on particular moments in the female life cycle—especially marriage—in
                  the gendered royal fantasies sold to young girls by companies such as Disney.</p>
               <p>Yet, when placed within the much longer tradition of feminist activism, such practices
                  take on more complex meanings. Though occupying positions that were indeed “beyond
                  the reach of most women,” royal women performed and, I would argue, continue to perform,
                  a vital function in the elaboration of British and western feminisms (Cowman 17).
                  This is especially true of (though not limited to) queens regnant. As I have indicated
                  here, queens regnant provided an early legal framework for demanding women’s right
                  to vote, as well as their right to own property and to receive an education more on
                  par with men’s. What is more, they offered examples of real women in the public sphere—women
                  leading the state, engaging in the political process, heading the Church of England
                  and the military, participating in charitable activities, and (in the case of Anne,
                  Victoria, and Elizabeth II) balancing their weighty responsibilities with the needs
                  of their husbands and children. This all while conducting their private lives in the
                  public eye and confronting their own fair share of misogyny and mistreatment along
                  the way. Little wonder that queens regnant, and royal women more generally, opened
                  up a space for women to write their own histories. For as Gina Luria Walker, Mary
                  Spongberg, Benjamin Dabby, and Karen O’Brien have suggested, royal women’s very visibility
                  emboldened women to write their pasts as part of a national story—a story that was
                  in part celebratory, and in part attuned to continuing imbalances and inequities.</p>
               <p>These associations, I would argue, continued to exert a hold well into the twentieth
                  and twenty-first centuries, even as the monarchy itself has adopted a much more strictly
                  ceremonial position. How else to explain the fact that Helena Normanton, the first
                  practicing female barrister in Britain, devoted so much of her writing for popular
                  periodicals during the 1920s and 30s to discussion of the history of queens and the
                  liberating precedent established with Britain’s rejection of the Salic Law? Indeed,
                  as Normanton insisted in the pages of <em>Good Housekeeping</em>, in reflecting on her own trail-blazing career, Queen Victoria had “helped women
                  . . . by her own professional achievements as a ruler” (74).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>And how else to explain the fact that some women expressed similar stirrings watching
                     “Princess Elizabeth” grow up during the 1930s and 40s, relishing the prospect of Elizabeth
                     one day assuming a role that would in some ways necessarily disrupt male-female relations?
                     We see tantalizing evidence of this phenomenon borne out in women’s and girls’ euphoric
                     responses to Elizabeth once she ascended the throne in 1952—a euphoria to which Mass
                     Observation data collected at the time bears ample witness. For the young Margaret
                     Thatcher, just recently married and keen to enter politics, the symbolism of Queen
                     Elizabeth II’s accession was charged indeed. “Women can—<em>and must</em>—play a leading part in the creation of a glorious Elizabethan era,” Thatcher wrote
                     in an article titled “Wake Up, Women,” which appeared in the <em>Sunday Graphic</em> shortly after Elizabeth’s succession.

                              “A young Queen, the loveliest ever to reign over us, now occupies the highest position
                              in the land. If as many earnestly pray, the accession of Elizabeth II can help to
                              remove the last shreds of prejudice against women aspiring to the highest places,
                              then a new era for women will indeed be at hand. We owe it to the Queen—and to the
                              memory of a father who set her such a wonderful example throughout his life—to play
                              our part with increasing enterprises in the years ahead. I hope we shall see more
                              and more women…</span></div>
                     </div> A similar headiness was on display in 1950s America. One female analyst accounted
                     for women’s interest in Elizabeth by noting that “Philip takes orders from Elizabeth
                     . . . What wife doesn’t secretly wish she had the same authority?” As another American
                     analyst put it, this was the first time “that the women of America have found a heroine
                     who makes them feel superior to men” (qtd. in Prochaska 166). To be sure, these responses
                     may have stemmed from some degree of (perhaps willful) misreading of Elizabeth II’s
                     limited constitutional role in the modern British state. Nonetheless, they demonstrate
                     the persistence of queenship as a radical construct.</p>

               <p>The bond that Princess Diana formed with women during the 1980s and 90s—both in life
                  and death—also points to the continuing subversive uses of the British monarchy. As
                  with Queen Caroline’s subjects in the early nineteenth century, Diana’s followers
                  also included those who saw in their Princess a means of airing larger grievances
                  about women’s status, the sexual double standard, and the cruelties and disappointments
                  of marriage. Diana herself did quite a bit to promote this image, especially in the
                  last years of her life. What is more, she took great pains to debunk the princess
                  fantasy and demonstrate that there is no such thing as “happily ever after.” The “after”
                  might not even include marriage. As she explained during her tell-all 1995 television
                  interview, “You know, people think that at the end of the day, a man is the only answer.
                  Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me” (qtd. in Lyall). It may well be that
                  some young girls today have this message in mind when they don their princess attire.
                  To play the part of queen or princess might allow girls not just to daydream about
                  love, beauty, and marriage, but also to imagine themselves in positions of authority—ruling,
                  deciding, leading. Even Disney seems to have cottoned onto this possibility (or at
                  least recognized that a focus on girls’ empowerment might also move products). Tellingly,
                  the company recently launched a global “Dream Big, Princess” campaign. Its message:
                  “For every girl who dreams big, there’s a Princess to show her it’s possible.”</p>
               <p>In this context, it is not that surprising that the actress and women’s rights activist
                  Emma Watson—a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador who helped to launch the HeForShe campaign
                  in 2014—opted to play Belle in the recent live-action remake of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. Such interpretations are only gaining greater prominence now that the outspoken
                  feminist Meghan Markle has joined the royal family. Since becoming the Duchess of
                  Sussex, Markle has been very public in her campaigning to end “period poverty” and
                  expand the global reach of feminism. She has also made clear that her husband and
                  son will be involved in this mission. As the duchess explained recently, “It’s impossible
                  for me to sit back and not do anything.”</p>
               <p>These are some initial thoughts on the subject. But they point to the ways in which
                  our contemporary fascination with the monarchy—and especially with female royalty—might
                  be filtered through a feminist lens. This lens only provides a sharper focus, moreover,
                  when we take into consideration the broader sweep of women’s and gender history. For
                  the monarchy has long informed feminist arguments and practices, and helped to nurture
                  alternative, more egalitarian, and at times quite subversive understandings of women’s
                  role in the nation. Indeed, as I have tried to show here, even Mary Wollstonecraft—that
                  iconic though often misunderstood “mother of feminism”—found that queens could be
                  quite helpful to think with. For all of her emphasis on women’s natural rights, Wollstonecraft
                  recognized that culture, and specifically her own culture, also had its uses.</p>

               by looking at women at the social apex, including their roles, representations and
               symbolic importance for other men and women . . . They could influence taste, fashion,

               “A young Queen, the loveliest ever to reign over us, now occupies the highest position
               in the land. If as many earnestly pray, the accession of Elizabeth II can help to
               remove the last shreds of prejudice against women aspiring to the highest places,
               then a new era for women will indeed be at hand. We owe it to the Queen—and to the
               memory of a father who set her such a wonderful example throughout his life—to play
               our part with increasing enterprises in the years ahead. I hope we shall see more
               and more women combining marriage and a career. Prejudice against this dual role is
               not confined to men. Far too often, I regret to say it comes from our own sex.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
