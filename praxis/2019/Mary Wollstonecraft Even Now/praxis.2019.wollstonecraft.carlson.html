               “Care: For Wollstonecraft”
               situates the feminist legacy of Wollstonecraft’s life works in contemporary discourses
               and practices of care in order to foreground the still-radical implications of her
               concepts of mothering, women’s writing, and passional activism. Fictional works frame
               her critiques of marriage within the broad context of care, both for impoverished
               communities and against the social institutions that diminish especially women’s capacities
               to care. Nonfictional and fictional works posit the linkage between women’s writing
               and good mothering as the chief vehicle of psychosocial reform, one that, in textualizing
               the biological and personalizing the sociopolitical, greatly expands notions of what
               a mother is and what good-enough mothering entails. At the same time, the essay argues
               that caring for Wollstonecraft involves confronting the severe hazards that this linkage
               created for Wollstonecraft and her progeny as a way of underscoring both why care
               is neither a safe topic nor a safe practice and why Wollstonecraft’s feminism is not
               as heteronormative or bourgeois as frequently is alleged.</p>

               <p>To call Mary Wollstonecraft the mother of Western liberal feminism is hardly a radical
                  claim, but it pinpoints the question of Wollstonecraft’s feminist legacy. In specifying
                  her pioneering role in articulating and promoting the rights of women, the claim is
                  hardly unusual in applauding her radical achievements. After all, she was the first
                  to define woman as a being with thinking powers, to expose the processes of socialization
                  as designed to impede the progress of women, to protest the reduction of women’s virtue
                  to chastity and feminine modesty, and to delineate the damage done to society as well
                  as to individual men, women, and children by sustaining the culture’s irrational views
                  on womanhood. On the other hand, a growing number of readers have come to construe
                  the assumptions and philosophical traditions that undergird the claim as at best liberal—i.e.,
                  individualist, heteronormative, white, and bourgeois. In this view, what is hardly
                  radical about claiming Wollstonecraft as the mother of Western liberal feminism is
                  that her notions of “woman,” “mother,” “rights,” and “revolution in female manners”
                  are impediments more than spurs to social justice work. Her writings have fallen off
                  of most feminist syllabi unless they appear in the section that is historical, meaning
                  also antiquated.</p>
               <p>It is true that Wollstonecraft’s emphases on equality, autonomy, and the non-particularity
                  of women’s bodies do not accord well with the intersectional and embodied tenets underlying
                  contemporary feminist theories and movements like #blacklivesmatter and trans* advocacy
                  and practices. The gender system that she inherited and revised remains binary; and
                  while her vindications of woman are sensitive to class and, occasionally, to racial
                  dynamics, by and large the sensibilities that they foreground are white and middle-class.
                  And while there is validity in contextualizing her efforts and assessing her limits
                  as largely reflective of the times in which she wrote, vindicators of Wollstonecraft
                  should not rest satisfied with such qualifications. The revolutionary ethos with which
                  she wrestled included massive agitations by enslaved persons in the West Indies that
                  enlisted African concepts and practices in their freedom struggles (Robinson 9–29,
                  71–101). Though Wollstonecraft died before an independent Haiti was achieved, that
                  revolutionary movement and set of conditions were part of her times, and it is simply
                  true that her writings are not deeply informed by them or informative about them.</p>
               <p>I wish to explore this dimension of her legacy in a somewhat indirect fashion by situating
                  Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre within the branch of contemporary feminism that I deem closest
                  to her enterprise: the care movement, especially its theoretical articulation in the
                  ethics of care. Already I hear horselaughs over the validity of the comparison, not
                  to mention its relevance to evaluating Wollstonecraft’s ongoing relevance to radical
                  politics. For one thing, theorists of care, such as Fabienne Brugère, Virginia Held,
                  Nel Noddings, and Joan Tronto, claim as their foremothers feminists who stress the
                  differences between women and men, such as Carol Gilligan, Nancy Chodorow, and Luce
                  Irigaray, not egalitarian feminists such as Wollstonecraft, who sought to affirm women’s
                  similarity to men because both are reasoning creatures. For another, many of Wollstonecraft’s
                  most astute and admiring critics characterize her personality as uncaring, censorious,
                  prone to sounding the depths of her own needs more than those of others. We get somewhere
                  in addressing the first concern by invoking William Godwin’s distinction between the
                  “moral,” or expressed position, of a work and its “tendency,” which evolves over time
                  and in accordance with the changing circumstances and vocabularies of its readerships
                  (Godwin 139). In fact, one could say that the history of Wollstonecraft scholarship
                  epitomizes this tendency, since scholars often interpret her significance in relation
                  to their own desires regarding feminism, making the history of scholarship on Wollstonecraft
                  into a minihistorical survey of waves of feminist thought. Some decry the factual
                  distortions that result from the impulse, but I view the interpenetration as faithful
                  to her methodology and one of the chief registers of her impact (Ayers 1–14). Moreover,
                  her practice of active revision models the tendency. The striking changes that mark
                  her textual output, covering a period of less than ten years but featuring major cognitive
                  and affective upheavals, suggest that she views revision as a literary as well as
                  societal imperative and that she stays responsive to her changing experiences of both.
                  In my view, no writer in her liberal-radical cohort is less defensive about exposing
                  the errancy of her thought and examining the contradictions between what she writes
                  and what she feels as is Wollstonecraft. Nor do any of them risk more than she in
                  doing so.</p>
               <p>The status of Wollstonecraft’s care as it affects evaluations of her personality is
                  connected to the question of her legacy in more direct, though contradictory, ways.
                  I will be arguing that her conceptions of care are deeply linked to her notions and
                  experiences of mothering, a point that not only courts the accusation that her writings
                  are bourgeois and heteronormative but also invites the strongest censure of her character
                  as uncaring and self-absorbed. I venture into this minefield because to me it is part
                  of what caring for her legacy entails. Because her “mothering” is never simply biological,
                  is always connected to writing and to valuing literature as a means to entwine the
                  psychological with the sociopolitical in its reformation of individuals, Wollstonecraft’s
                  care is an early exemplum of what theorists and practitioners of care still are seeking
                  to achieve: a fundamental restructuring of the values that undergird the organization,
                  activities, and rewards of care. At the same time, taking seriously the depth of her
                  ambivalence toward care as expressed in and made apparent by her writings exposes
                  why care remains so difficult to give, take, or endorse as a radical sociopolitical
                  endeavor.</p>

               <p>Theorists of care foreground the radical interdependence of human life, not just at
                  birth or as a condition of human neoteny. They thus perceive the autonomy of the individual
                  as at best only partially achieved and, even when so, as never gained or maintained
                  independently (Held, <em>Ethics</em> 9–29). They value the activities and customary givers of care and argue that extending
                  this valuation necessitates a fundamental rethinking of what constitutes the “good
                  life” and thus a fundamental reorganization of societal structures and priorities
                  to gain it. Philosophically, an ethics of care rejects not only individualism but
                  also the institutional organizations that support individualist premises. Theorists
                  prioritize “care” over “justice” because they deem the abstractions of the latter
                  insufficiently attentive to the local, embodied, relational, and preferential aspects
                  of caregiving. This orientation makes theorists and practitioners feminist, whether
                  or not they call themselves feminists, because another primary concern is to gain
                  respect and compensation for the persons on whom care activities generally fall and
                  long have fallen: poor, disenfranchised, non-white, and immigrant women (Boris and
                  Klein 19–39, 123–48). Because the dominant view long has been that those who need
                  care are “babies” and those who give it are second-class citizens (if that), care
                  tends not to be taken seriously or viewed as of vital interest. Even today, for all
                  our voiced concern over precarity, bare life, embodied mentation, and globalization,
                  neither public policy discussions nor theoretical inquiries in the humanities tend
                  to foreground care or perceive their humanitarian concerns as addressed productively
                  by an ethics of care.</p>
               <p>This relative lack of enthusiasm for care has a lot to do with ongoing antipathy to
                  women and resistance to the fact that we all need care, at times desperately. Some
                  proponents have offered other terms, such as “the ethics of love” or “relational ethics,”
                  in hopes of diminishing the sentimentalism that many hear in “care.” Others find “ethics”
                  too stuffy for the improvisational life practices that care inspires. This is why
                  I find Aranye Fradenburg’s contention that care “is always, in some sense, care of
                  the wild” such a productive disruption of customary aversions to care <em>and</em> of existing theories of care (Fradenburg 70). Her accounts of the evolution of care
                  as well as of its usual activities—so many of which touch on the skin, the membrane
                  that both demarcates and mediates a creature’s inner and outer worlds—highlight both
                  the dangers of viewing care as domesticating and the denials of environmental, racial,
                  and psychic realities that are required in order to espouse such a view. Her accounts
                  also underscore the meaningful and meaning-making nature of care activities, their
                  often artful expressivity. Step one in overcoming resistance to care, Fradenburg argues,
                  is to recognize that “care is neither a safe topic nor a safe practice. Care is difficult,
                  both to accept and to give” not only because it exhausts “our reserves of narcissism”
                  but also because it is “one of the primary modes by which the bodies and minds of
                  creatures shape and re-shape one another” (70). Step two is acknowledging the evolving
                  histories of care as generating “various rhetorics (chemical, electrical, gestural,
                  alphabetic)” through which organisms “cross boundaries and foster relationality” (72).</p>
               <p>The life writings of Wollstonecraft exemplify the theoretical tenets of care and the
                  wildness that care confronts, soothes, and provokes both consciously and unconsciously.
                  Her coordination of the relations among woman, human, reason, justice, and care employs
                  more of an Enlightenment ethos and vocabulary than contemporary care theorists use,
                  but neither her conclusions nor her methodological processes are as far from theirs
                  as her emphasis on “rights” and “woman” might suggest. The enlightened aspects of
                  her tenets stem from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the first Western philosopher to posit
                  “human” as interdependent, not autonomous, and its rationality evoked by and in need
                  of pity and care (Brugère, 
                  “Justice”
                  ). Rousseau also is the first Western philosopher to conceive of confession and fiction
                  as major vehicles of philosophy’s coming to consciousness about the complexity of
                  human cognition. Both of these contributions explain why Wollstonecraft is “half in
                  love” with Rousseau for admitting into philosophy the vulnerability and frequently
                  pitiful nature of male rationality (Wardle 145). The remaining half mobilizes its
                  outrage over Rousseau’s sanctioned mistreatments of “woman” into devising a new philosophy,
                  narrative, and psychosocial history of female experiences, the deliberateness of which
                  effort, it bears repeating, is unprecedented, including her new-philosophical project
                  of displaying through “an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who
                  has thinking powers” (Advertisement to <em>Mary</em> 5). But Wollstonecraft’s care also anticipates Fradenburg’s attention to the wildness
                  and antidomesticating impulses inherent in caring that showcases its significance
                  as a “life-and-death matter” (Fradenburg 68).</p>
               <p>Wollstonecraft’s efforts to foreground “woman” as having thinking powers underlie
                  all of her works and employ several methodological tenets that are care-centric because
                  they are interdependent. Her fictional writings verge upon philosophy in that they
                  feature females in the process of thinking, characterize a Mary or a Maria in order
                  to focalize the “wrongs of woman” and gain sympathy for them, and work to demonstrate
                  that the social institutions that frame and allegedly support the affective lives
                  of individuals actually repress whatever capacity for creativity they possess—intentionally
                  so, in the case of women. This is why Wollstonecraft foregrounds marriage as the most
                  despotic social institution affecting women, calls for a revolution in female manners,
                  and prioritizes altering the mentality of middle-class women, since that group of
                  women is being trained from birth to consider their prospects as identical with marriageability.
                  But what is less often recognized is how Wollstonecraft’s antimarriage polemic, especially
                  as depicted in her fictional and semiautobiographical writings, is situated in an
                  explicit discussion of care, and not simply of the emancipated female protagonist.
                  Texts link the melancholic sensibility of their love-thwarted, <em>because</em> married, protagonists to caregiving activities that in turn make visible the class-intersecting,
                  though also class-benighted, aspects of Wollstonecraft’s evolving depictions of “woman.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Both <em>Mary: A Fiction</em> (1788) and <em>The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria</em> (1798) embed their protagonists’ one-on-one caregiving activities within a broader
                     survey of societal care organizations and the protagonists’ engagement with them.
                     Both texts also circuit their observations on societal and domestic care through protagonists
                     whose early development is described as significantly lacking, especially in care
                     from their mothers, a lack that shapes each of their sensibilities and its dual orientation
                     toward melancholy and care. Mary’s capacity and desire to care for her beloved Ann,
                     weakened at a young age by consumption, which entails their traveling from England
                     to the warmer climate of Portugal and Mary’s attending her there until she dies, literally
                     is framed by her involvement in caring for various impoverished families. Melancholy
                     rambles take a young Mary to the “huts of a few poor fishermen, who supported their
                     numerous children by their precarious labour,” in whose company she “frequently rested,
                     and denied herself every childish gratification, in order to relieve the necessities
                     of the inhabitants” (<em>Mary</em> 15).

                     </div> After Ann dies and before she redirects her care-tending to a second husband substitute
                     (Henry), Mary “relieved the poor” in the villages around London, procuring lodging
                     and domestic necessities for a “poor woman” she had met on the voyage back to England
                     and providing “every comfort” for a family of seven that included hiring a “poor neighbor”
                     to “nurse the woman, and take care of the children” (<em>Mary</em> 56). Holding aside for now the class politics evinced in these depersonalizing and
                     self-oriented acts of philanthropy, they are depicted as moving her beyond her constitutional
                     melancholy and restoring her to life. “In these pursuits,” Mary “learned the luxury
                     of doing good,” acquiring “a sparkle” in “eyes” which, without their moistening by
                     “the sweet tears of benevolence,” lacked luster (<em>Mary</em> 15–16). “Is any sensual gratification to be compared to that of feeling the eyes moistened
                     after having comforted the unfortunate?” (<em>Mary</em> 59).

                     </div> In <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>, Maria’s ability to care-tend her infant daughter is thwarted by her confinement
                     in a madhouse after she attempts to escape from a brutish marriage, where she is guarded
                     by Jemima. But this failure of interpersonal care motivates the text’s sweeping analysis
                     of the wrongs done to women by societal institutions designed to minimize their care,
                     a class-inflected account occasioned by combining Jemima’s and Maria’s life stories,
                     each of which enumerates differing psychic, relational, and societal consequences
                     of treating females as bodies to be given in marriage or given out to domestic and
                     sexual service, often an apt depiction of what bourgeois marriages entail.</p>
               </div>
               <p>On one level, this emphasis on the interplay between societal and interpersonal operations
                  of care is how the antimarriage plot works to mitigate doubts regarding these women’s
                  virtue. The independence of mind evidenced in the ability of all three female protagonists
                  to brook social convention requires ongoing protection, which staying bastilled in
                  a brutish marriage or occupation nullifies. Put a different way, the fellow-feeling
                  of Mary and between Maria and Jemima—even granting Mary’s and Maria’s patronizing
                  attitudes toward “the poor”—is shown to be invigorated through their ability to give
                  care, a point intended to demonstrate the immorality of marriage bonds and the civic-mindedness
                  of free-thinking women. On another level, emphasis on the interplay introduces Wollstonecraft’s
                  two pioneering and still radical contributions to an ethics of care: highlighting
                  literature as the arena that interweaves the social and psychological, and depicting
                  women’s writing as a form and act of mothering. For the chief difference between these
                  two works of fiction, positioned as they are on opposing sides and affective evaluations
                  of her <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (1792), is that Mary’s caregiving activities are directed toward adults, whereas
                  Maria’s are directed toward an infant whose fate is improved by Jemima’s taking care
                  of Maria, a change that is activated by the narrations of each of their life stories.</p>
               <p>Thwarted in physically nursing her daughter and “uncertain whether I shall ever have
                  an opportunity of instructing you,” Maria “addresses” her life story to her baby daughter
                  as a form of sustenance “meant rather to exercise than influence your mind” (<em>Wrongs</em> 123). This effort not only reverses one of the causes of the neglectful mothering
                  that Mary and Maria experience. It also is penned by a mother both “labouring under
                  a portion of the misery, which the constitution of society seems to have entailed
                  on all her kind” and daring to “break through all restraint to provide for your happiness”
                  by “voluntarily brav[ing] censure herself, to ward off sorrow from your bosom” (<em>Wrongs</em> 123). This means that good mothering for Wollstonecraft is a matter of narrative
                  as much as of biology and is inseparable from women being willing to admit, value,
                  reflect on, and convey their sometimes rapturous and oftentimes sorrowful experiences
                  to current and future minds in the making. It also means that good mothering is a
                  rarity and that working to make it less so necessitates appealing directly to the
                  class of women whose consignment to domesticity is hampering their care and their
                  desire to give or take care.</p>
               <p>Connecting writing to mothering and to the futures bodied forth in each undergirds
                  all of Wollstonecraft’s projects and falls roughly into two phases. The first phase
                  (1787–1792) stages a staggered, more piecemeal relation among “woman,” motherhood,
                  and female reader-writers, suggesting that informing women effectively is a precondition
                  to better mothering and that both necessitate not only women reading but also finding
                  or composing for themselves better reading material. The earliest texts portray books
                  as better mothers than existing biological mothers (<em>The Female Reader</em> and <em>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</em>), feature a surrogate mother who ultimately inscribes her wise counsel in a book
                  (<em>Original Stories from Real Life</em>), and depict a woman literally coming to (not) know her mind through the activity
                  of writing down, and thereby discovering, her feelings (<em>Mary: A Fiction</em>; Carlson 221–32). Though treating the two largely as separate topics, <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> connects mothering to writing in a critical fashion, ascribing middle-class women’s
                  lack of interest and competence in either arena to their preoccupation with men and
                  male standards or values. In the second phase (1794–1797), the spheres are integrated
                  in the case of middle-class white women. The female persona through whom the demand
                  for women’s rights gets expressed is a biological mother and a writer, though not
                  depicted as a published author (the I of <em>A Short Residence</em>, Maria in <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>). In this, they conceive a future of better possibilities by working simultaneously
                  on the prime agents of futurity—the rising generation, new ways of thinking—and by
                  depicting reform of the one as interconnected with reform of the other. This interconnection,
                  as she argues in <em>A Vindication</em>, is key to producing better home lives and a more informed citizenry. Infant minds
                  stand a better chance of expanding if they are engaged by attentive, less self-absorbed
                  and male-preoccupied mothers, who themselves will be more open to having their selves
                  reformed when holding, and feeling held by, a text that regards them, and an infant
                  that will come to regard them, as thoughtful persons and as deserving of care.</p>
               <p>Wollstonecraft’s linkage of mothering and women writing was a brilliant strategy to
                  defuse readers’ alarm by tying together the most conservative and forward-looking
                  roles then being assigned to “woman.” By the second <em>Vindication</em>, the strategy is a more or less conscious approach to the paradox of decrying the
                  power that its primary readership wields and must mobilize if legal and political
                  change is to occur. The linkage also makes two useful interventions in contemporary
                  discussions of care. It underscores the importance of the arts in fostering the curative
                  and quotidian aspects of care and of finding adequate language to describe and defang
                  the isolating nature of pain. While gaining ground, this branch of care practice and
                  theory remains undercultivated. It also mediates an internal debate over whether serious
                  care reform begins best on the homefront or with the social and economic institutions
                  that foster indifference to care and its conventional agents at home. The latter proponents
                  construe economic realities as trickling through, if not flooding, every other relational
                  structure and perceive the familial realm as still awash in gender asymmetries (Sevenhuijsen,
                  Tronto, and Williams). The former contend that the elimination of social impediments
                  is necessary but insufficient because the capacity to care is acquired, not inborn,
                  and acquired primarily through the dynamics of infant-(m)other attachment (Hollway).
                  Wollstonecraft’s texts show that, for care to flourish, both societal institutions
                  and psychic investments therein need to be restructured in tandem and that treating
                  society and psyche or public and private as separate spheres exacerbates the problem;
                  this is arguably why she does not confine social critique to nonfiction and psychological
                  or interpersonal analysis to fiction. Her twinned and generically hybrid approach
                  is also why Wollstonecraft’s concern with mothering is not as conservative or heteronormative
                  as is sometimes alleged. For her, mothering is heterotextual, passional, chosen, and
                  deployed “rather to exercise than influence” young minds (<em>Wrongs</em> 123).</p>
               <p>Her mothering also is the most unsettling aspect of her biography and legacy. By way
                  of context, it is fair to say that mothering was the first role assigned to her as
                  a child and that the prematurity of her assumption of the role affected her priorities
                  from then on, including her need to be assured of her priority in the minds of male
                  lovers. The eldest daughter of differently neglectful parents, by age ten she had
                  major responsibility for the care of her five younger siblings as her mother’s physical
                  and mental health deteriorated and as her elder brother employed himself elsewise.
                  Sisters Eliza and Everina affirmed repeatedly her responsibility for them, as they
                  turned to Wollstonecraft, even as adults, for assistance in money, employment, and
                  venting and as all three turned on each other over perceived inadequacies of care.
                  One of the most sobering examples of Wollstonecraft’s sisterly mothering concerns
                  her efforts to rescue Eliza from her husband Meredith Bishop’s household after Eliza
                  had given birth to a daughter and fallen into a serious depression. Initiated out
                  of alarm over Eliza’s derangement and vague hints that Bishop was abusive, Wollstonecraft’s
                  plan succeeded in separating Eliza not only from Bishop, with whom she was never reconciled
                  and whose plausibility as a husband seems not in particular doubt, but also from baby
                  Mary, who died several months later. Then there is the dark history of Wollstonecraft’s
                  mothering of Fanny, in which her attempts at suicide twice threatened to leave Fanny
                  parentless while still a baby, so consumed was Wollstonecraft by her passion for Gilbert
                  Imlay. Though rescued from both attempts, Wollstonecraft left no indication that rescue
                  was a secret hope or design (Williams 222–23). A suicide note indicates that, in the
                  event of an intervention, she wanted not to be resuscitated, even if death meant leaving
                  Fanny motherless, though probably also in the able care of her nursemaid, Marguerite
                  Fournée.</p>
               <p>There is no getting around this limit in Wollstonecraftian care. Nor is my emphasis
                  on her fusion of mothering and writing meant to be compensatory or exculpatory. The
                  “mothering” effected by her writing has disagreeable elements too, including self-absorption,
                  self-righteousness, a know-it-all spirit, and little patience with other people’s
                  unwillingness to suffer patiently. All of this makes the tragic outcomes of her writing-mothering,
                  especially in Fanny’s life, very hard to bear. My sense of the gains in taking Wollstonecraft’s
                  care seriously result from acknowledging the risks that she took by detailing resistances
                  to caregiving that women like her experience, especially after she had gone on record
                  castigating patriarchal minimizations of it. The frankness with which she explores
                  her antipathy to the sacrifices attendant in caring is inspiring, as is her willingness
                  to revise her views on “woman” in light of accumulated experiences of the conflicts
                  within and between her various roles as feminist single mother writer activist. Amidst
                  recurrent bouts of passion and depression, she never stopped attempting to redesign
                  her future and that of rising generations by registering the hazards and co-implications
                  of those experiences.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Such redesigning affects how the female protagonists in later texts construe the special
                     hazards of mothering. While the writing voices of <em>A Short Residence</em> and <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em> are more confident than in earlier texts—less strident or unsympathetic, more experimental—they
                     now voice a “dread” over the future to which increased options for females consign
                     their daughters. The narrator of <em>A Short Residence</em> dreads that, by cultivating her daughter’s “sensibility” and “delicacy of sentiment,”
                     she is “sharpen[ing] the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard—I dread
                     to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit”
                     (<em>Short Residence</em> 84). Similarly, Maria “lamented” that “her child” was “a daughter, and anticipated
                     the aggravated ills of life that her sex rendered almost inevitable” (<em>Wrongs</em> 85). It is as if the acquisition of confidence in writing allows female protagonists
                     to feel the full weight of male indifference to their flourishing and to find this
                     indifference unbearable—whether the culprit is patriarchy or Imlay. As regards the
                     “hapless fate” that this enjoins upon daughters, her protagonists question what constitutes
                     maternal care if facilitating the aspirations of children almost certainly means heightening
                     their suffering or shortening their lives. One thinks here of “the talk” that Black
                     parents in the U.S. today are forced to have with their children.

               <p>Toni Morrison’s <em>Beloved</em> is the most nuanced treatment of a maternal love so fierce that the act of killing
                  one’s child is preferable to delivering her over to a fate worse than death. Comparison
                  to Morrison exposes Wollstonecraft’s narrative limitations as regards artistry, range
                  of topics, knowledge of and expressed sympathy for certain types of characters, but
                  it also highlights her willingness to confront moral complexity in her fiction. As
                  relates to Fanny, the comparison embodies the opposite challenge of discerning maternal
                  love in the act of killing oneself and thereby leaving parentless a one-year-old baby
                  girl, especially considering Fanny’s eventual suicide on the anniversary of her mother’s
                  death at the age of 22. I share Janet Todd’s impatience over the tendency to read
                  Fanny as consigned to this fate, as if she was destined to commit suicide rather than
                  worn down to it from being so used and disregarded by all of her variously overbearing
                  family members (Todd, <em>Death</em> xiii–xiv). Still, it puzzles me why Todd expresses such skepticism over Wollstonecraft’s
                  revolutionary character, even if Wollstonecraft’s heroines are preachy, her correspondence
                  “prickly,” and her postures “alternately” needy and full of “lofty independence” (Todd,
                  <em>Life</em> 15). Todd’s biography enumerates the range of mothering activities that Wollstonecraft
                  assumed as sibling, schoolteacher, governess, and writer, but regards her career turn
                  to writing as primarily an opportunistic rather than idealistic or even pragmatic
                  attempt to use her observations of bad mothering across the classes in order to improve
                  it. Since “she was always telling people what to do, how to read and respond, how
                  to raise their children and improve themselves,” why not try writing? (<em>Life</em> 75). Todd’s tendency to depict the glass as half empty extends to Wollstonecraft’s
                  expressions of emptiness. Stating that depression and other mental disturbances run
                  deep in the Wollstonecraft family, Todd underscores a “cultural component in their
                  malady,” the “high esteem in which the middle classes held melancholy” (<em>Life</em> 75). True enough. But Todd’s accounts construe the cultural dimension almost solely
                  as a license for personal histrionics by characterizing Wollstonecraft’s expressions
                  of anguish as postures, self-dramatizations, and appeals for male attention and attentiveness.</p>
               <p>I raise this not to endorse reparative over paranoid readings, both approaches being
                  fundamental to critical care, as Wollstonecraft’s writings attest (Sedgwick). My point
                  is that her writings relate issues of care to social justice work by demonstrating
                  how deeply one’s genetic and familial origins shape everything that follows, that
                  such origins are shaped by socioeconomic and cultural factors, and that, if existence
                  is to become bearable for subjects whose originating conditions are designed to keep
                  them subordinated, then they generally have to assume the burden of changing these
                  conditions because no one else will take up the project. Whatever else one says about
                  her upbringing, Wollstonecraft was put upon from early on, witnessed forms of injustice
                  from within the family, and viewed her writing career as the only means to an independence
                  that could do something to change the dependence that informed and continued to deform
                  the minds, brains, and bodies of women seeking to experience something like freedom.
                  Plus, she knew that attaining financial independence was crucial to sharing her resources
                  with those close at hand or far off in the future. Wollstonecraftian sensibilities
                  can sound hopelessly bourgeois if we ascribe them to an isolated “self” rather than
                  to experienced discordances between that self and the world, and if we deem despair
                  over being isolated or a longing to captivate as distinctively middle-class. Starting
                  with early letters to girlhood friends and continuing throughout her published writings
                  and private correspondence, Wollstonecraft’s writings struggle to coordinate interconnection
                  and isolation, attachment and detachment, independence and codependence, needing to
                  be recognized and refusing to conform. She does not frame those struggles as an investigation
                  or an ethics of care, but we could name them as such now.</p>
               <p>If we did, several re-estimations of her life writings and legacy might follow. I
                  have suggested that her efforts to twine writing and mothering join together what
                  are generally differentiated disciplinary approaches—sociological versus psychological—to
                  the reform, in this case, of care institutions, understood as primarily societal or
                  familial. Hers unite the two realms through a new-philosophical enlistment of the
                  intercourse between texts and lives and the conviction that her kinds of text function
                  as surrogate mothers to the adult and infant persons whom they are in the process
                  of remaking. Moreover, she casts the “heroine” of her texts as a representative, not
                  an individual, in order to showcase how cultural recognition of women with thinking
                  powers effects, and should affect, changing social policies on education, marriage,
                  and property laws as well as better caretaking of infants, children, men, and themselves.
                  In terms of their content and style, Wollstonecraft’s writings are more sociological
                  than psychological in their renditions of female psychology. They thematize the difficulties
                  of interpersonal dynamics more than they depict them as co-created or co-creative,
                  whether between partnered adults or mothers and infants. The infant whose existence
                  is portrayed as motivating Maria’s narration of her life story is wholly absent except
                  to her mind; to a large degree so is Fanny in <em>A Short Residence</em>, whose embodied presence is most movingly described when Wollstonecraft is away from
                  her on business, some say because she temporarily feels freed of that presence (Gordon
                  316).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In these later works Wollstonecraft’s depictions of mother-infant interactions are
                     perhaps best described as co-created but not yet co-creative for either party.

                              and Medicine, University of California, Santa Barbara, September 2018.</span></div>
                     </div> Radical for her times, the depiction is a still-valid point from which to conduct
                     contemporary revisions of care. We have a much richer knowledge base and vocabulary
                     than did Wollstonecraft for remarking the mutual interplay between infants and (m)others,
                     the intensity of the gratifications on each side, and the necessity for each party
                     to turn away from the other so as to avoid impingement by or upon the mother. But
                     this has not taken us very far in reorienting policies or practices of care. Fradenburg
                     suggests how hospital and hospice care might enlist the tactile and sound-soothing
                     practices of infant care when treating all patients, recalling the emergence of language
                     out of grooming activities and the self-soothing benefits of both (74–77). If we viewed
                     Wollstonecraft’s life writings in the context of feminist care rather than of enlightenment
                     justice, we might not need so many reminders that care is “neither a safe topic nor
                     a safe practice” because it is “one of the primary modes by which the bodies and minds
                     of creatures shape and reshape one another” (Fradenburg 70). Wollstonecraft’s writings
                     fear more often than they celebrate this coinvolvement, but this seems largely because
                     the asymmetries felt so stark to her and the upholders of them so unapologetic.</p>
               </div>
               <p>The wildness of Wollstonecraft’s care is epitomized by what is truly unprecedented
                  in the composition of <em>The Wrongs of Woman; or Maria</em>: writing to a baby daughter who would have been abandoned if the author had succeeded
                  at drowning and promulgating writing as the best means for preparing a daughter for
                  eventualities for which she can never adequately be prepared. For all its limitations,
                  <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em> is a stunningly brave text in addressing maternal abandonment, including Maria’s
                  possible suicide attempt, and having that mother actually envision the consequences
                  of it on her baby girl. “To think that [her infant] was blotted out of existence was
                  agony, when the imagination had been long employed to expand her faculties; yet to
                  suppose her turned adrift on an unknown sea, was scarcely less afflicting” (<em>Wrongs</em> 85–86). Yes, Wollstonecraft depicts the fictional mother as primarily the victim,
                  not the agent, of the separation that so anguishes her. And yes, meanwhile she sends
                  the memoirs to a male inmate whose marginal notations in Rousseau’s <em>Heloïse</em> have shown him to be a promising partner to her body and mind. But these limitations
                  do not erase the complexity of the experiences that Maria records in order to exercise
                  her daughter’s mind, and they show that extending female <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jouissance</span> is a part of good mothering. Nor does she leave textual caretaking of Fanny at this.
                  Composition of <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em> occurs alongside <em>Lessons</em>, a reading primer composed for Fanny at the imagined advent of the arrival of a new
                  sibling. <em>Lessons</em> depicts reading as a relational act that helps a young creature interpret her environs
                  by learning to name, adjust to, and readjust them.</p>
               <p>To my mind, then, wanting to understand all that care signifies in Wollstonecraft’s
                  oeuvre is what caring for her legacy enjoins. It accepts that her care generally is
                  not congenial, even when it is sentimentalized, and is usually suffused with a metaphysical
                  and psychological darkness that occasions destructiveness and anxiety. Hers is a wildness
                  whose approach-avoid impulses are more polarized than proximal, more reactive than
                  worked through. But, unlike her contemporary writing peers, her treatment of this
                  is remarkably straightforward—in fact, her writing sounds desperate to get a better
                  handle on the intensity of the pulls she experiences in both directions. Her writings
                  also acknowledge that societal ambivalence toward caretaking and caregivers deepens
                  personal ambivalences toward care in those charged with doing carework but also that
                  redressing the former does not guarantee altering the latter. In fact, those resistances
                  are generally the least susceptible to change.</p>
               <p>One way that feminist pedagogues might take care of Wollstonecraft’s legacy is to
                  devise syllabi that are less linear in their construal of waves and less delineated
                  in their concepts of womanhood. Though Wollstonecraft’s writings are not intersectional
                  in the contemporary sense, that aims to expose how the experiences of Black women,
                  owing to their multiple marginalization, are invisible to systems grounded in a logic
                  of discrete categories, their depiction of mothering as an interaction between biology
                  and textuality models a still-vital method for disrupting categories of identity altogether
                  (Crenshaw). Such a course might feature care units that are topically intersectional,
                  such as grouping <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> with Marilynne Robinson’s <em>Housekeeping</em>, Patricia William’s <em>An Alchemy of Race and Rights</em>, and Eileen Boris and Jennifer Klein’s <em>Caring in America</em>. Or <em>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark</em> with Gayle Rubin’s 
                  “Traffic in Women,”
                  Aranye Fradenburg’s 
                  “Care of the Wild,”
                  Alexis Pauline Gumbs and Julia Roxanne Wallace’s 
                  “Something Else to Be: Generations of Black Queer Brilliance and the Mobile Homecoming
                  Experiential Archive.”
                  Or <em>Wrongs of Woman; or Maria</em> with Buchi Emecheta’s <em>Joys of Motherhood</em>, Lee Edelman’s <em>No Future</em>, Toni Morrison’s <em>God Help the Child</em>. It might pair her correspondence and Godwin’s <em>Memoir of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> with contemporary memoirs such as Vivian Gornick’s <em>Fierce Attachments</em>, Alice Walker’s <em>The Chicken Chronicles: Sitting with the Angels Who Have Returned with My Memories</em>, Andrea Dworkin’s <em>Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant</em>, Cherríe Moraga’s <em>Native Country of the Heart</em>. It might even put her thinking on care in conversation with university studies and
                  its efforts to make higher education more equitable, less corporatized, more radically
                  liberal, also by changing the material conditions of teaching and scholarship. As
                  survey data guiding my university’s discussion of improving campus child care opportunities
                  indicate, far fewer male than female faculty perceive the availability of child care
                  to be a “very serious” problem affecting their work life, and most white female faculty
                  view it as a faculty-first issue until or even after they are reminded about staff
                  and graduate student needs. It is regrettable that the institution established to
                  foster minds in their complex interactions with brains, bodies, and environs remains
                  so myopic in its imaginings of interdependence, especially when push comes to shove
                  under racial capital. I think too that, for all her identification with men, Wollstonecraft
                  identified with their having resources and wished to extend that privilege to herself
                  and others. She was not afraid to make waves or to speak truth, including nonsense,
                  to powerful men, and she was used to the experience of not feeling supported or being
                  supported. I would want her in faculty meetings.</p>
               <p>For persons whose starting points are inauspicious, who perceive the arts as relational
                  and potentially transformational, who are committed to learning from an experience
                  not held to be singular, and who both entertain and suspend the question of whether
                  it is texts or persons that make living more bearable or more insufferable, the life
                  writings of Mary Wollstonecraft have a lot to say. My sense is that their greatest
                  potential lies in the portrayal of the evolving relationship between Maria and Jemima
                  that was cut short by her death. Taught to perceive and treat each other as enemies
                  because of the hostilities that class hierarchy breeds in both parties, Maria and
                  Jemima are able to come together through an evolving complex of circumstances that
                  <em>Wrongs of Woman</em> seeks to generalize and propagate. They are shown first to be thrown together by
                  circumstances that they do not control and that are outside of any individual’s control,
                  whose alteration requires a joining of forces. They join forces through separate experiences
                  of gender subordination and a shared concern for a future embodied in a baby and a
                  memoir over whose fate they have differentiated investments. They come to discover
                  this common ground in their shared “fondness of reading” and through narrating their
                  life stories to each other (<em>Wrongs</em> 114).</p>
               <p>Attention to Jemima’s cultivated sensibility marks significant progress from <em>Mary: A Fiction</em>, where Mary’s involvement with the nameless “poor” expresses her benevolence but
                  is unconcerned with discerning theirs, except to note their ingratitude. But Maria’s
                  “often-repeated question” why Jemima’s “sentiments and language were superior” to
                  her “station’” prompts new objections in the implied exceptionalism of Jemima’s having
                  a “refined” sensibility, its alignment of class position with particular kinds of
                  sentiment, and the presumed desirability of bourgeois refinement (<em>Wrongs</em> 113). It would be unwise to dismiss the still-patronizing attitude evident in Wollstonecraft’s
                  depictions of this developing relationship and, thereby, to resist asking why the
                  heightening of imagination celebrated in British Romanticism so often becomes a classist
                  and racialized affront. But neither should we disregard two caveats offered in this
                  depiction. For what is arguably exceptional is not Jemima’s rich mind but the fact
                  that her “master” noticed and entered into dialogue with it, even requesting her opinion
                  and feedback on his writings before submitting them to print (admittedly, so that
                  he could “profit by the criticism of unsophisticated feeling”) (<em>Wrongs</em> 114). Too, the relationship that Maria and Jemima begin to form, though lopsided,
                  is co-created in the process of each opening her heart to the other.</p>
               <p>My interest in having intersectional feminists find reason to care for Wollstonecraft
                  clearly says more about my desires than theirs or even hers. The investment has everything
                  to do with the complex of my relational, intellectual, and professional histories
                  that have positioned me to read her works more carefully than I have read most other
                  writers. This would not be the first time that I have been guilty of poor object choice.
                  But I hope that the desire is Wollstonecraftian in its attempts to lay bare various
                  challenges to her legacy and address them in ways that reveal to subsequent readers
                  what else needs to be taken down or more fully taken up. Caring for Wollstonecraft
                  involves seeking to move on from wherever one starts up. We could start by hearing
                  some different things in the mother of Western liberal feminism.</p>
