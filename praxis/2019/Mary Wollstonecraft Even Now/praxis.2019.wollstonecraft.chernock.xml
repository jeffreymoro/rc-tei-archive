                    engagement with exceptional historical women, focusing especially on her comments on royal women such as Queen 
                    Caroline Matilda of Denmark and Norway. In highlighting how Wollstonecraft found it useful to think with royal 
                    women, the paper suggests the importance of placing Wollstonecraft—and feminism more broadly—within many 
                    different and often complimentary philosophical approaches and traditions. The paper then charts the role that 
                    queens and other elite women have played in the emergence and articulation of western feminisms, focusing 
                    especially on developments in Britain.</p>

             <p>It is well known that Mary Wollstonecraft had little patience for history, and especially for histories of exceptional 
                or “worthy” women. “I have been led to imagine,” she wrote in her 1792 <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of 
                    Woman</title>, “that the few extraordinary women who have rushed in eccentric directions out of the orbit prescribed 
                to their sex, were male spirited, confined by mistake in a female frame” (68). Wollstonecraft seems to have held elite 
                women in particular contempt, and condemned court culture for the “wretchedness” that “flow[s] from hereditary honours, 
                riches, and monarchy” and the “dispensations of providence” (19). For Wollstonecraft, we have thus been led to believe, 
                the key to women’s emancipation lay primarily in their claims to natural rights as human beings, that is, those 
                inalienable rights that transcended culture, nation, and biology.</p>
             <p>But a closer reading of the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>—along with some of 
                Wollstonecraft’s other seminal texts—suggests that history, and specifically the history of royal women, may not have 
                been as anathema to Wollstonecraft as we might think. The very impetus for writing the <title level="m">Vindication of 
                   the Rights of Woman</title>, after all, turned in part on a debate regarding the Salic Law, the law passed in 
                fifteenth-century France barring women from the throne. Wollstonecraft was allegedly infuriated when her colleague 
                Thomas Christie—a fellow radical and editor of the <title level="j">Analytical Review</title>—defended the French 
                National Assembly’s decision <emph>not</emph> to tamper with the Old Regime laws governing royal succession, on the 
                grounds that the Salic Law reflected the “natural” sexual and social order (Bruder 109–10). As Christie explained in 
                his <title level="m">Letters on the Revolution in France, and on the New Constitution</title>, published in 1791, 
                “The ancient Salic Law, which excludes females from succeeding to the throne, was considered by the Assembly as a 
                fundamental and wise regulation of the monarchy, which merited to be solemnly renewed, and permanently established.” It 
                was in preserving the Salic Law, he added, that the French had demonstrated most clearly “that they knew where to draw 
                the line, and so to honour the sex as not to injure their <emph>real</emph> happiness, or endanger the welfare of 
                society.” This was a far cry from the state of Britain, where women were allowed “to rule over men”—an “unnatural and 
                shocking” development that marked the “reversal of the laws of Nature” (217–18). Such misogynistic claims, Helen Bruder 
                notes, served as further grist for Wollstonecraft’s feminist mill, and helped motivate her to write the 
                <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, published the following year (110).</p>
             <p>What is more, the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> itself, though clearly written in certain 
                respects against the past, is peppered with references to “history.” And the “history” that Wollstonecraft invokes is 
                often a productive one for women, with lessons both for the “fair sex” and for those men who write about women. Yes, 
                the “history of woman” often amounts to little more than a depressing tale of women as either “slave” or 
                “despot”—“situations [that] equally retard the progress of reason” (115). But the “history of all nations” also offers 
                up instructive tales regarding women’s inability to be “confined to merely domestic pursuits” (402). It is perhaps for 
                this reason that she recommends history as a component of girls’ educations. In particular, she urges girls to acquaint 
                themselves with “heroic characters” from the past as a necessary corrective to romantic fiction (431).</p>
             <p>In her <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark</title>, published four 
                years later in 1796, Wollstonecraft further explores these didactic dimensions of history, especially as they apply to 
                the formation of women’s character. She dwells, for instance, on the example provided by the British-born Queen 
                Caroline Matilda of Denmark and Norway (1751–1775), consort of King Christian VII (and sister of King 
                George III).<note place="foot" resp="editors">For more on Wollstonecraft’s strategic discussion of Queen Matilda, see 
                    Bahar 126.</note> Though a flawed figure—she had an affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee, her Privy 
                Counsellor—Caroline Matilda nevertheless gains Wollstonecraft’s respect for her public spiritedness and charity work, 
                her sensible parenting practices, and even her impatience with custom. She wished, Wollstonecraft writes, “to do 
                immediately what can only be done by time” (204). Thus while Wollstonecraft ultimately sees Caroline Matilda as a tragic 
                character—she died very young, from scarlet fever, after enduring the dissolution of her marriage, the execution of her 
                lover, and her exile to Germany—Wollstonecraft also finds in Caroline Matilda’s life an inspiring story of female 
                fortitude and grit. Because of her birth and rank, Caroline Matilda had been able to live her life differently from the 
                majority of women (even if in ways still highly constrained by her sex). Women such as Caroline Matilda therefore offered 
                clues as to what might be possible for all women, if given greater latitude and access.</p></div>
             <div type="section"><head>*</head></div><div type="section">
             <p>Why does Wollstonecraft’s engagement with figures like Queen Caroline Matilda matter? I take up these considerations 
                because my own current research, published as <title level="m">The Right to Rule and the Rights of Women: Queen Victoria 
                     and the Women’s Movement</title>, charts how women’s rights activists leveraged Queen Victoria—and the tradition of 
                female rule in Britain more generally—to make arguments for female emancipation over the course of the nineteenth century. 
                I am deeply interested in the ways in which Britain’s history of female royal leadership (and what paradoxically might be 
                construed as the egalitarian dimensions of certain royal institutions and practices) impacted the development of feminist 
                consciousness. Already in the late seventeenth century, John Locke was speculating in his <title level="m">First Treatise 
                    on Government</title> on the uses of queens regnant in challenging the patriarchal vision contained in the Book of 
                Genesis. “Will any one say,” Locke wondered, “that either of our queens, Mary or Elizabeth, had they married any of their 
                subjects, had been by this text [i.e., Genesis] put into a political subjection to him? or that he should thereby have 
                had monarchical rule over her? God, in this text, gives not, that I see, any authority to Adam over Eve, or to men over 
                their wives, but only foretels [<foreign xml:lang="la">sic</foreign>] what should be the woman’s lot . . . ” (32–33).</p>
             <p>These themes would be further developed by the writers Sarah Egerton, Catherine Trotter, Mary, Lady Chudleigh, and Mary 
                Astell during the reign of Queen Anne.<note place="foot" resp="editors">On female poets and Queen Anne, see 
                    Orr 40.</note> As Astell explained in the third edition of her <title level="m">Some Reflections Upon 
                    Marriage</title>, published in 1706, Queen Anne’s rule forced a reappraisal of patriarchy: “If by the Natural 
                Superiority of their Sex, they mean that every Man is by Nature superior to every Woman . . . it would be a Sin in any 
                Woman to have Dominion over any Man, and the greatest Queen ought not to command but to obey her Footman, because no 
                Municipal Laws can supersede or change the Law of Nature; so that if the Dominion of the Men be such, the Salique Law, 
                as unjust as English Men have ever thought it, ought to take place over all the Earth, and the most glorious 
                Reigns . . . were wicked Violations of the Law of Nature!” (3–4). Several others would adopt similar strategies in the 
                decades that followed, including the jurist Henry Homes (Lord Kames), Bluestockings Hester Thrale Piozzi and Elizabeth 
                Montagu, and the radical playwright Thomas Holcroft.</p>
             <p>By the late eighteenth century, in fact, such strategies were commonplace in feminist circles. Even without a female 
                sovereign currently on the throne, a number of British radicals culled the past, and especially the royal past, in 
                order to stretch Enlightenment thinking on the function, value, and capabilities of women. As I discovered in writing 
                my first book on <title level="m">Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism</title>, late-Enlightenment “male 
                feminists” frequently invoked the principle of royal succession, and women’s prominent positions within the court more 
                generally, in fashioning arguments in favor of “women’s rights.” According to the Scottish Physician William Alexander, 
                there was a grave injustice in the fact that women could rule, but were forbidden from performing any lesser civil or 
                political functions. “In Britain,” he wrote in his <title level="m">History of Women</title> (1779), “we allow a woman 
                to sway our scepter, but by law and custom we debar her from every other government but that of her own family, as if 
                there were not a public employment between that of superintending the kingdom, and the affairs of her own kitchen, 
                which could be managed by the genius and capacity of woman” (2:439).</p>
             <p>Other male reformers eager to inject a more egalitarian strain into British politics routinely underscored this same 
                point. Richard Dinmore and Thomas Starling Norgate, both Norwich-based radical reformers well known for their feminist 
                sympathies, stressed that “women’s rights” were firmly in keeping with Britain’s constitutional history, as reflected 
                in the nation’s royal succession policies. As Dinmore explained in his <title level="m">Brief Account of the Moral and 
                    Political Acts of the Kings and Queens of England</title> (1793), “The want of this right [women’s right to vote] 
                is peculiarly absurd in this kingdom, where a woman may reign, though not vote for a member of Parliament” (178–79). 
                To flesh out their arguments, Dinmore and Norgate drew attention to the fact that those queens who had actually served 
                the nation had been largely capable, and in some cases even highly adept at carrying out their demanding functions. In 
                this regard, Queen Elizabeth I especially became something of a lodestar. For Dinmore, Elizabeth “may fairly be 
                considered the best monarch that ever sat on the English throne.” “Indeed,” Dinmore continues, “the character of this 
                Queen convinces us of the injustice that has hitherto been done to the Rights of Women” (178). In Norgate’s similar 
                assessment, relayed in his “Observations on the Reign and Character of Queen Elizabeth,” Elizabeth I was a “great and 
                splendid” leader, who demonstrated by her very example that women should be accorded more power at all levels of society 
                and government (142–43).</p>
             <p>Nor was it just the men who took up such arguments. The writers Mary Robinson and Mary Hays, two of Wollstonecraft’s 
                closest female interlocutors, also adopted comparable strategies. As the historian Mary Spongberg has suggested, the 
                royal female life held immense value for Robinson and Hays, who drew “on the lives of royal women in distinctly feminist 
                ways, critiquing the patriarchal strictures that shaped their lives and the absence of feminine influence in the 
                recounting of history” (74).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Spongberg 74 for further elaboration: “In developing 
                    this form of women’s history, such writers challenged masculinist generic conventions to carve out a uniquely 
                    feminine historical space in which to understand the condition of all women.”</note> We see such tendencies firmly 
                on display in these women’s writing. Robinson—former mistress to the Prince of Wales (the future King George IV)—used 
                Elizabeth I to measure the female sex’s inner if often thwarted potential. “Judge,” she commanded her readers in 
                her <title level="m">Letter to the Women of England</title> (1799), “whether England ever boasted a more wise or more 
                fortunate sovereign: one, more revered in council; more obeyed in power; or more successful in enterprize. And yet 
                Elizabeth was but a woman!” (29).</p>
             <p>In her <title level="m">Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of Women</title> (1798), Hays also explored this 
                theme: “Let it not be said that crowned heads are too much out of the common road, to be brought forward for examples; 
                for as they are neither more nor less than men and women, they come quite within our sphere” (36). Given that queens 
                were <emph>only</emph> women, Hays explained, it was well worth considering their achievements. They deserved a central 
                place in any inquiry into, and argument in favor of women’s improved treatment. Over twenty years later, Hays would 
                offer more sober reflections on this point in her <title level="m">Memoirs of Queens</title> (1821)—especially in her 
                striking meditation on Queen Caroline, the estranged wife of George IV. On becoming King in 1820, George IV had tried 
                to obtain a divorce from Caroline on the grounds of adultery, much to the chagrin of his angry subjects. Recounting the 
                trial of Queen Caroline, and the public’s impassioned response, Hays suggested that the occasion had emboldened women 
                to rise up in “common cause against the despotism and tyranny of man.” To “<emph>equity</emph> not gallantry,” she 
                observed, “do [women] now prefer their claim” (127). According to Hays, then, Queen Caroline’s public humiliations had 
                inspired women to speak up in defense of their own rights and prerogatives. In this way, even royal women’s misfortunes 
                could be used to salutary effect.</p>
             <p>Once Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, these kinds of arguments only accelerated. On the one hand, 
                nineteenth-century activists were deeply interested in Victoria as a woman, and used her to demonstrate that the female 
                sex had the capacity to reason, to grapple with politics, and even to balance their professional and familial 
                obligations. Here, after all, was a woman who—by necessity—was pursuing joint commitments in the private and public 
                sphere. As the leading suffragist campaigner Millicent Garrett Fawcett explained in her <title level="m">Life of Her 
                    Majesty Queen Victoria</title>, published to coincide with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria had proven 
                definitively that women could combine work and family. “Politics and political responsibilities of the greatest kind 
                have not unsexed her,” she observed in a chapter entitled “The Warp and Woof of Home and Politics” (225). By extension, 
                activists were also quick to call attention to any unfair treatment that they perceived the Queen to be receiving, or to 
                expose what they construed as sexism. A reporter for the London <title level="j">Daily News</title>, for example, took 
                to task those “political misogynists” who insisted that “all the credit usually given to female Sovereigns belongs to 
                their male advisers, and that all the mischief done under the reigns of men may be attributed to the feminine influences 
                which surrounded them” (<title level="j">Daily News</title> 5).</p>
             <p>On the other hand, though, Victorian women’s rights campaigners were interested in promoting the simple fact that their 
                nation now had a female head of state. Victoria’s status alone gave them plenty of ammunition. As feminist advocates 
                frequently noted, echoing their seventeenth- and eighteenth-century predecessors, was it not extremely paradoxical that 
                women were permitted to rule in Britain while their female subjects, up until the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
                at least, were denied most of the rights and privileges accorded to men? “Every wife except a queen regnant,” Linda 
                Colley reminds us, “was under the legal authority of her husband, and so was her movable property”—and this dispossession 
                persisted until the passage of the Married Women’s Property Acts in 1870 and 1882 (238). On the political front, the 
                disjuncture was even more striking. Even at the close of Victoria’s rule, in 1901, British women still lacked the 
                parliamentary franchise—a right that men had secured through the successive Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884, but that 
                women would only be granted in 1918, with the passage of the Representation of the People Act (and even then, the law 
                only applied to women over the age of 30).</p>
             <p>Leading nineteenth-century women’s rights campaigners frequently seized on this paradox and tried to exploit it for 
                various reasons: to demonstrate their loyalty to the Queen, to celebrate (and sometimes even inflate) Victoria’s political 
                prerogatives, and to call attention to the national tradition of including women in the royal line of succession. All of 
                these became prominent features of Victorian campaigning, especially in regard to the question of the female franchise. 
                “But if those,” the leading feminist spokesperson Harriet Taylor wrote in the <title level="j">Westminster Review</title> 
                in 1851, “who assert that the ‘proper sphere’ for women is the domestic, mean by this that they have not shown themselves 
                qualified for any other, the assertion evinces great ignorance of life and of history.” “Women,” she added, “have shown 
                fitness for the highest social functions, exactly in proportion as they have been admitted to them. By a curious anomaly, 
                though ineligible to even the lowest office of state, they are in some countries admitted to the highest of all, the 
                regal . . . Concerning the fitness, then, of women for politics, there can be no question. . . .” (297).</p></div>

             <p>As Wollstonecraft’s comments in the <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                and <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> suggest, she too 
                was susceptible to this line of thinking, even if hers was a more muted strain than that of many of her peers. Her probing 
                comments about Queen Caroline Matilda, her endorsements of “history” and “heroic characters,” and even her dismay at 
                Thomas Christie’s comments in regards to the French Revolutionaries’ preservation of the Salic Law—all of these impulses 
                suggest that Wollstonecraft too saw in the history of monarchy some of the raw material out of which to vindicate her sex. 
                Inasmuch as Wollstonecraft has come to serve as a placeholder for or signifier of modern western feminist commitments, 
                then, I see three key reasons why we should be more attuned to these aspects of her work, with significance both for our 
                understanding of Wollstonecraft herself and for the broader feminist conversation in which she was, and indeed remains, 
                a central participant.</p>
             <p>First, being attentive to these dimensions of Wollstonecraft’s thinking alerts us to the range of traditions in which 
                 Wollstonecraft was working—and to the range of traditions which have informed western feminism more generally. To 
                 appreciate the historical bent of some of Wollstonecraft’s thinking is to recognize, as scholars have increasingly tried 
                 to stress, that Wollstonecraft, like so many of her peers and followers, was never operating exclusively within the 
                 framework of natural rights or what we might describe as Enlightenment liberalism. Rather, “modern” feminism emerged 
                 from eclectic origins, and developed by drawing on insights and inspirations from a range of sources. It was, and 
                 continues to be, animated by many different logics—sometimes even contradictory ones. Wollstonecraft drew on natural 
                 rights philosophy, yes. But she also drew on constitutional theory, English history, the “woman worthy” tradition, and 
                 the theology of Rational Dissent. The goal here, then, is not to downplay the significance of natural rights in the 
                 evolution of feminism, but rather to see it as one of many currents. Feminism is not, and never has been, a linear 
                 development.<note place="foot" resp="editors">This is one of the points that I develop in my book. See Chernock, 
                     <title level="m">Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism</title>.</note></p> 
              <p>This brings me to my second point. 
                 A greater attention to Wollstonecraft’s historical interests, especially in regard to the history of royal women, 
                 does more than simply illuminate the range of forces shaping early feminist conversations. When read alongside the 
                 treatises penned by her peers and successors, Wollstonecraft’s engagement with the past also suggests that history, 
                 and particularly royal history, seems to have exercised a strong pull in women’s rights deliberations—and in the 
                 broader construction of what Barbara Taylor has described as the “feminist imagination.” It is not, then, just that 
                 queens and princesses figured in early feminist conversations. Rather, it is that they figured prominently and 
                 persistently. These royal women, moreover, were typically culled from a specifically British past, though women 
                 from other cultures and traditions were also referenced on occasion (especially in those works situated at the nexus 
                 of feminist argument and female biography—consider, for example, Mary Hays’s <title level="m">Female Biography; or 
                     Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries</title>, published in 1803).</p>
              <p>The national dimensions of this story are especially worthy of consideration. For the feminism that emerged in 
                 Britain, in fits and starts during the seventeenth century and then in a more fully fleshed-out form from the late 
                 eighteenth century, was built on very particular and often quite hopeful readings of the nation’s past. National 
                 traditions and customs, especially as pertaining to the tradition of female royal leadership, played a key role in 
                 the development of British feminism. We need to bear this national context in mind, as it reminds us that feminism 
                 cannot always be easily exported—grafted, as it were, onto other societies. Rather, we need to recognize the ways in 
                 which women’s rights conversations, even in their most nascent stages, were often informed by a keen sense of national 
                 pride, and even of patriotism. However instrumental or manufactured their gestures may have been, women’s rights 
                 advocates were eager to fashion a “useable history,” drawing on their nation’s past, in order to legitimate their 
                 egalitarian vision. In fact, feminism took root in Britain in part because it appealed to a shared cultural and 
                 political inheritance. In short, Queens Elizabeth I, Anne, and Victoria mattered—as Queen Elizabeth II does today. 
                 While this is not to suggest that feminisms cannot circulate and combine beyond national borders, it is to appreciate 
                 that such arguments often resonate best when they can appeal to the local and specific as well as to the universal 
                 and the general.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Chernock, <title level="a">Gender and the Politics of 
                     Exceptionalism</title> for a further elaboration of this argument.</note></p> 
              <p>My third and final point relates to 
                 early feminists’ fascination with female sovereigns and other members of the royal family, and with what this 
                 fascination might tell us about the continuing—and often misunderstood—appeal of the monarchy. In this respect, 
                 this point has the most direct connection to our present moment. In contemporary feminist circles, I have found 
                 that royal watching is often dismissed as a mindless or trivial practice. And the study of elites, royals especially, 
                 continues to receive little attention from scholars of women and gender—especially from those studying the modern 
                 period (the period following the Glorious Revolution of 1688). “Studies of British womanhood,” observes Clarissa 
                 Campbell Orr in <title level="m">Queenship in Britain</title>, “have, with valuable exceptions . . . tended to focus 
                 on women of middling or lower social rank; aside from the attention given to Caroline of Brunswick, feminist 
                 historians have yet to revisit the royal family and are only just starting on the aristocracy” (7).<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">Orr notes, however, that “much is to be gained for women’s history and feminist history by 
                     looking at women at the social apex, including their roles, representations and symbolic importance for other 
                     men and women . . . They could influence taste, fashion, social customs and moral values” (7).</note> This 
                 distancing and denigration extends to what we often describe as “girlie-girl culture,” with its emphasis on 
                 Disneyfied versions of princesses and queens. As the cultural critic Peggy Orenstein observes in her influential 
                 book <title level="m">Cinderella Ate My Daughter</title>, marketers have found increasingly successful ways to ply 
                 their pink princess products to their youngest consumers. In the process, she argues, they communicate insidious 
                 messages about female dependence, desire, and beauty.</p>
              <p>On this score, even the contemporary British royal family comes in for scrutiny. For the historian Charles Beem, 
                 Queen Elizabeth II offers little by way of feminist inspiration or example. “Elizabeth II,” he writes, “has never 
                 been inclined to erase the gendered distinctions between her male and female household officers. Like all her 
                 predecessors as female kings, Elizabeth II is an honorary male, with no apparent interest in furthering feminist 
                 goals of gender equality for her female subjects” (177–78). And the author Hilary Mantel provided a particularly 
                 scathing assessment of monarchy in the pages of the <title level="j">London Review of Books</title> (2013), where 
                 she described the Duchess of Cambridge as “becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung,” a woman who 
                 allowed herself to be crafted into someone whose “only point and purpose” was “to give birth.”</p>
              <p>To be sure, critics like Orenstein, Beem, and Mantel make some astute points. There is nothing inherently empowering 
                 about studying, citing, emulating, or being a queen or princess. In truth, the British royal family has often been 
                 used to promote conservative, even retrograde, gender roles and ideals. (A survey of antisuffragist posters and flyers 
                 from the Edwardian period, with their enthusiastic references to Queen Victoria and her belief in the “mad, wicked 
                 folly” of women’s rights, quickly confirms this.) And many of the biographies of royal women churned out each year 
                 often do more to reinforce than to undermine patriarchal values and assumptions. Female members of the royal family, 
                 too, have at times played a complicit role in this process—despite the egalitarian dimensions of their institution. 
                 By the same token, there is also a troubling fixation on particular moments in the female life cycle—especially 
                 marriage—in the gendered royal fantasies sold to young girls by companies such as Disney.</p>
              <p>Yet, when placed within the much longer tradition of feminist activism, such practices take on more complex meanings. 
                 Though occupying positions that were indeed “beyond the reach of most women,” royal women performed and, I would 
                 argue, continue to perform, a vital function in the elaboration of British and western feminisms (Cowman 17). This 
                 is especially true of (though not limited to) queens regnant. As I have indicated here, queens regnant provided an 
                 early legal framework for demanding women’s right to vote, as well as their right to own property and to receive an 
                 education more on par with men’s. What is more, they offered examples of real women in the public sphere—women 
                 leading the state, engaging in the political process, heading the Church of England and the military, participating 
                 in charitable activities, and (in the case of Anne, Victoria, and Elizabeth II) balancing their weighty 
                 responsibilities with the needs of their husbands and children. This all while conducting their private lives in the 
                 public eye and confronting their own fair share of misogyny and mistreatment along the way. Little wonder that queens 
                 regnant, and royal women more generally, opened up a space for women to write their own histories. For as Gina Luria 
                 Walker, Mary Spongberg, Benjamin Dabby, and Karen O’Brien have suggested, royal women’s very visibility emboldened 
                 women to write their pasts as part of a national story—a story that was in part celebratory, and in part attuned to 
                 continuing imbalances and inequities.</p>
              <p>These associations, I would argue, continued to exert a hold well into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, 
                 even as the monarchy itself has adopted a much more strictly ceremonial position. How else to explain the fact that 
                 Helena Normanton, the first practicing female barrister in Britain, devoted so much of her writing for popular 
                 periodicals during the 1920s and 30s to discussion of the history of queens and the liberating precedent established 
                 with Britain’s rejection of the Salic Law? Indeed, as Normanton insisted in the pages of <title level="j">Good 
                     Housekeeping</title>, in reflecting on her own trail-blazing career, Queen Victoria had “helped women . . . by 
                 her own professional achievements as a ruler” (74).</p>
              <p>And how else to explain the fact that some women expressed similar stirrings watching “Princess Elizabeth” grow up 
                 during the 1930s and 40s, relishing the prospect of Elizabeth one day assuming a role that would in some ways 
                 necessarily disrupt male-female relations? We see tantalizing evidence of this phenomenon borne out in women’s and 
                 girls’ euphoric responses to Elizabeth once she ascended the throne in 1952—a euphoria to which Mass Observation data 
                 collected at the time bears ample witness. For the young Margaret Thatcher, just recently married and keen to enter 
                 politics, the symbolism of Queen Elizabeth II’s accession was charged indeed. “Women can—<emph>and must</emph>—play 
                 a leading part in the creation of a glorious Elizabethan era,” Thatcher wrote in an article titled “Wake Up, Women,” 
                 which appeared in the <title level="j">Sunday Graphic</title> shortly after Elizabeth’s succession.<note place="foot" 
                     resp="editors">As Thatcher notes in her opening paragraph, echoing Victorian suffragists’ arguments, “A young 
                     Queen, the loveliest ever to reign over us, now occupies the highest position in the land. If as many earnestly 
                     pray, the accession of Elizabeth II can help to remove the last shreds of prejudice against women aspiring to 
                     the highest places, then a new era for women will indeed be at hand. We owe it to the Queen—and to the memory 
                     of a father who set her such a wonderful example throughout his life—to play our part with increasing 
                     enterprises in the years ahead. I hope we shall see more and more women combining marriage and a career. 
                     Prejudice against this dual role is not confined to men. Far too often, I regret to say it comes from our own 
                     sex.”</note> A similar headiness was on display in 1950s America. One female analyst accounted for women’s 
                 interest in Elizabeth by noting that “Philip takes orders from Elizabeth . . . What wife doesn’t secretly wish she 
                 had the same authority?” As another American analyst put it, this was the first time “that the women of America have 
                 found a heroine who makes them feel superior to men” (qtd. in Prochaska 166). To be sure, these responses may have 
                 stemmed from some degree of (perhaps willful) misreading of Elizabeth II’s limited constitutional role in the modern 
                 British state. Nonetheless, they demonstrate the persistence of queenship as a radical construct.</p>
              <p>The bond that Princess Diana formed with women during the 1980s and 90s—both in life and death—also points to the 
                 continuing subversive uses of the British monarchy. As with Queen Caroline’s subjects in the early nineteenth 
                 century, Diana’s followers also included those who saw in their Princess a means of airing larger grievances about 
                 women’s status, the sexual double standard, and the cruelties and disappointments of marriage. Diana herself did 
                 quite a bit to promote this image, especially in the last years of her life. What is more, she took great pains to 
                 debunk the princess fantasy and demonstrate that there is no such thing as “happily ever after.” The “after” might 
                 not even include marriage. As she explained during her tell-all 1995 television interview, “You know, people think 
                 that at the end of the day, a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me” (qtd. in Lyall). 
                 It may well be that some young girls today have this message in mind when they don their princess attire. To play 
                 the part of queen or princess might allow girls not just to daydream about love, beauty, and marriage, but also to 
                 imagine themselves in positions of authority—ruling, deciding, leading. Even Disney seems to have cottoned onto this 
                 possibility (or at least recognized that a focus on girls’ empowerment might also move products). Tellingly, the 
                 company recently launched a global “Dream Big, Princess” campaign. Its message: “For every girl who dreams big, 
                 there’s a Princess to show her it’s possible.”</p>
              <p>In this context, it is not that surprising that the actress and women’s rights activist Emma Watson—a UN Women 
                 Goodwill Ambassador who helped to launch the HeForShe campaign in 2014—opted to play Belle in the recent live-action 
                 remake of <title level="m">Beauty and the Beast</title>. Such interpretations are only gaining greater prominence 
                 now that the outspoken feminist Meghan Markle has joined the royal family. Since becoming the Duchess of Sussex, 
                 Markle has been very public in her campaigning to end “period poverty” and expand the global reach of feminism. She 
                 has also made clear that her husband and son will be involved in this mission. As the duchess explained recently, 
                 “It’s impossible for me to sit back and not do anything.”</p>
              <p>These are some initial thoughts on the subject. But they point to the ways in which our contemporary fascination 
                 with the monarchy—and especially with female royalty—might be filtered through a feminist lens. This lens only 
                 provides a sharper focus, moreover, when we take into consideration the broader sweep of women’s and gender history. 
                 For the monarchy has long informed feminist arguments and practices, and helped to nurture alternative, more 
                 egalitarian, and at times quite subversive understandings of women’s role in the nation. Indeed, as I have tried

                 queens could be quite helpful to think with. For all of her emphasis on women’s natural rights, Wollstonecraft 
                 recognized that culture, and specifically her own culture, also had its uses.</p>
