                <p rend="noCount">This essay takes up the longstanding association between Wollstonecraft, feminism, and 
                joylessness via feminist critic Sara Ahmed’s ironic appropriation of the term “feminist killjoy.” I argue 
                that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim to being a killjoy can be traced to the mid-twentieth century, when two 
                American ego psychologists, obsessed with what they called Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality,” seized on 
                her personal biography with a determined vengeance in their book <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost 
                    Sex</title> (1947), and forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft and the annihilation 
                of joy.</p>

            <div type="section">
                <p>Few would disagree that, by most standards, Mary Wollstonecraft is key to Western feminism’s scene of 
                    origin, with all the weighty burdens and responsibilities—and only some of the romance—that goes along 
                    with being the origin of anything. Some might also suggest that Wollstonecraft is the original “feminist 
                    killjoy,” a term recently popularized by feminist scholar and activist Sara Ahmed. Ahmed’s ongoing blog, 
                    <title level="j">feministkilljoys</title>, is subtitled “killing joy as a world making project.” Her wry 
                    and ironic appropriation conjures the specter of Wollstonecraft, the world-making feminist who has long 
                    had the dubious privilege of being associated with an emotional register that swings from one form of 
                    joy-killing affect to another (anger, resentment, jealousy, suicidal despair, murderous rage). I would 
                    argue, furthermore, that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim to being a feminist killjoy can be traced to the 
                    mid-twentieth century, when two American ego psychologists seized on her personal biography with a 
                    determined vengeance and forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft, feminism, and 
                    joylessness. Marynia F. Farnham and Ferdinand Lundberg’s <title level="m">Modern Woman: The Lost 
                        Sex</title>, published in 1947, was an instant bestseller. Written and published in the hothouse 
                    of American postwar anxieties about the need to redomesticate women, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    provided the pseudoscientific justification necessary for the argument that women must return to the 
                    home to fulfill their logical, natural role as mothers and domestic managers. Now remembered mainly 
                    for its central part in shaping postwar conceptions of normative family life, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> was crucial in popularizing the idea that feminism, in thrall to modernity, was 
                    world-destroying, and that Wollstonecraft, <emph>the</emph> “modern woman,” was largely responsible for 
                    this sad state of affairs. <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> performs what Janet Todd has called, 
                    with great understatement, “an extraordinary retrospective psychoanalysis” of Wollstonecraft (728). 
                    With good reason, feminist commentators on Wollstonecraft have in the main refused to grant further 
                    authority to “a hostile team of Freudian epigones,” in the words of Margaret George, author of one of 
                    the earliest second-wave feminist biographies of Wollstonecraft (11).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Janet 
                        Todd’s passing reference to <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> in her essay “The Biographies 
                    of Mary Wollstonecraft” first alerted me to the book. Mari Jo Buhle’s <title level="m">Feminism and Its 
                    Discontents</title> treats <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s analysis of Wollstonecraft in the 
                        context of twentieth-century American ego psychology. Otherwise, little has been written about 
                        <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s bizarre attack on Wollstonecraft.</note> But the reluctance 
                    to engage with <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s cartoonish depiction of Wollstonecraft has not, 
                    I would argue, been without its costs. A fuller reading of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s 
                    “analysis” goes a long way towards clarifying the source of some of the intensely negative affect that 
                    has long surrounded both Wollstonecraft and feminism. As seeming exemplars of the mid-twentieth-century 
                    social scientific establishment and its celebratory modernity—Farnham was a psychiatrist and Lundberg 
                    was a journalist and sociologist—the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> were strangely 
                    passionate in their fierce defense of tradition. For <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, 
                    Wollstonecraft personifies the “killjoy” whose world-destroying modernity annihilates everything in 
                    its path and must be stopped.</p></div>

            <div type="section">
                <p>“Mary Wollstonecraft’s life reads like a psychiatric case history,” Farnham and Lundberg begin, 
                    speculating that had “psychoanalysis existed in 1792,” <quote>and had a psychoanalyst (Freud, let us 
                        fancy) been reviewing <title level="m">A Vindication</title> for one of the journals of the day, 
                        he would have been able to come at once to many certain conclusions about the unknown author. . . . 
                        As he read, our imaginary psychoanalyst of 1792 would not too slowly have come to the conclusion that 
                        the author was afflicted with a severe case of “penis-envy,” a term the founder of psychoanalysis 
                        coined to describe the attitude of those women who envy and constantly measure themselves against men, 
                        consciously or unconsciously. They can, so they fantasy, do anything a man can do. . . .The shadow of 
                        the phallus lay darkly, threateningly, over every move [Wollstonecraft] made, as it lay over the minds 
                        of the latter-day feminists. (149)</quote> Analyzing Wollstonecraft according to the terms of an 
                    unrelenting Freudianism that saw “penis-envy” as the structuring force driving her neurotically fueled 
                    feminism, Farnham and Lundberg proceeded with breathtaking confidence to an extended interpretation of 
                    her early life that firmly located the constitutively perverse origins of modern feminism in the fact that 
                    Wollstonecraft’s <quote>childhood had been fearfully tragic and had left her with a twisted personality. 
                        The reader must not lose sight of this fact, because it is to this book that feminism <emph>as an 
                            ideology</emph> is directly traceable. <title level="m">A Vindication</title> was reprinted many 
                        times during the nineteenth century, and many eulogistic biographies and biographical sketches of the 
                        author appeared. There was hardly a feminist who did not, at some time, pay tribute to <title 
                            level="m">A Vindication</title>, and credit it with being the source and fountainhead of 
                        feminist beliefs. The book and its author have been apostrophized again and again. (151)</quote> One 
                    of the first things to note about the above passage is that the precise referent of “this book” is not 
                    immediately apparent. Upon rereading, it does in fact become clear that the authors are referring to 
                    Wollstonecraft’s 1792 <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>, but on an initial 
                    scan, it seems almost as though Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality” is in fact the “book” to which 
                    “feminism <emph>as an ideology</emph> is traceable.” That sense is reinforced a few pages later, when 
                    the reader is told that “Mary Wollstonecraft was an extreme neurotic of a compulsive type,” and that 
                    apparently, “out of her illness arose the ideology of feminism” (159). The relationship between 
                    Wollstonecraft and feminism that emerges here is one of part to whole: feminism is not a widespread 
                    social movement born of the experiences of millions of women, but rather an illness that can be traced 
                    to the “twisted” mind of one woman.</p>
                <p>This referential ambiguity, the suggestion that Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality” is the “book” to 
                    which feminism owes its very existence, is not without precedent. William Godwin’s 1798 biography of 
                    Wollstonecraft, written and published only months after she died, is entitled <title level="m">Memoirs 
                        of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>. Yoking the author and her work, and 
                    substituting, moreover, the text for which she is most famous for the woman herself, Godwin’s title 
                    stands as the first in a long line of conflations of Wollstonecraft’s life narrative with the 
                    quintessential example of her life’s work. When <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                        Woman</title> was published in a new edition in 1844—the first since the 1790s—it included large 
                    sections of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title> in the preface, beginning the tradition of 
                    reading <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> through the scandal-inflected lens 
                    of Wollstonecraft’s life, a lens through which the work was primarily read for generations. <title 
                        level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s insistence on an equivalence between the “book and its author,” 
                    both of which purportedly “have been apostrophized again and again,” only added to the sense that 
                    Wollstonecraft and her best-known book were easily substituted, one for the other, and substituted, 
                    finally, in the mode of apostrophe. That is to say, the dead and absent author and the inanimate book 
                    were both addressed by the living, and both were made present or animate—anthropomorphized, even—by the 
                    apostrophic address. That Wollstonecraft was hardly apostrophized until at least the end of the 
                    nineteenth century proved to be no obstacle to the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, who 
                    hyperbolically (and counterfactually) declared that she was apostrophized “again and again,” and whose 
                    own voices were as a result thrown at times in the very manner of apostrophe.<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">See Barbara Johnson’s “Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion” for a discussion of the 
                        figure of apostrophe. “The absent, dead, or inanimate entity addressed,” Johnson writes, “is thereby 
                        made present, animate, and anthropomorphic. Apostrophe is a form of ventriloquism through which the 
                        speaker throws voice, life, and human form into the addressee, turning its silence into mute 
                        responsiveness” (30).</note> Ventriloquists after a fashion, Farnham and Lundberg occasionally put 
                    words in Wollstonecraft’s mouth, as we will see, or mocked her by speaking in her voice, thus 
                    unexpectedly producing the very effects of the apostrophic praise that they attributed to others.</p>
                <p>While Farnham and Lundberg seemed to be thin on the details of <title level="m">A Vindication of the 
                    Rights of Woman</title>, regularly misrepresenting its argument, they had amply absorbed, by contrast, 
                    its famously withering tone. Roundly criticized for her acerbic air, Wollstonecraft was no stranger to 
                    bombast, and was prone to an ostentatious style that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    themselves inadvertently flattered through mimicry, offering, for example, this declamatory summary of 
                    her central argument: “The all-powerful, all-evil male had contrived for long ages to enslave and 
                    degrade the delicate, weak, all-good female. Only now was she to be liberated—by Mary Wollstonecraft!” 
                    (145). The extravagance of this mock-heroic invocation of Wollstonecraft might seem merely to underscore 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s unambiguous contempt for its subject, but I suggest that this 
                    figuration in fact revived rather than settled the ongoing question of Wollstonecraft and heroism. The 
                    figure of Wollstonecraft as feminist heroine and martyr framed the sympathetic treatments of her life 
                    starting in the late nineteenth century, with biographers such Elizabeth Robins Pennell arguing in 1885, 
                    for example, that “few women have worked so faithfully for the cause of humanity as Mary Wollstonecraft 
                    Godwin, and few have been the object of such censure. She devoted herself to the relief of her suffering 
                    fellow-beings with the ardour of a Saint Vincent de Paul, and in return she was considered by them a moral 
                    scourge of God” (1). <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s caricature of Wollstonecraft as chivalric 
                    protector, striving bravely to liberate women everywhere from male oppression, did less than its authors 
                    may have liked to undermine the stubborn association between Wollstonecraft and heroism: their mockery 
                    provoked second-wave feminists to defend her virtue and celebrate their feminist foremother as just the 
                    hero that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> accused her of considering herself. The 
                    problem that they inadvertently perpetuated becomes clear, however, when we remember the inconvenient 
                    fact that, as Barbara Taylor has quipped, Wollstonecraft was “never keen on heroines” (252).<note place="foot"

                    </note> Aiming, we might surmise, to expose with their mock tribute any lingering or latent arrogance in 
                    Wollstonecraft, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> worked instead to reinforce in the minds 
                    of subsequent generations of readers an association of Wollstonecraft with heroism that Wollstonecraft 
                    herself would have readily critiqued, and that <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> 
                    offered little ground to support.</p>
                <p>The authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> built their case against Wollstonecraft not only on an 
                    imprecise reading of <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, but equally on a rather hyperbolic, not to say 
                    inaccurate, sense of Wollstonecraft’s reception in the nineteenth century. Most feminist literary 
                    historians agree that the publication of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title> inadvertently rendered 
                    his late wife’s name anathema in polite company for almost a century because of its candid discussion of 
                    details related to Wollstonecraft’s suicide attempts, illegitimate child, and torrid love affairs. As 
                    Barbara Caine observes, “Wollstonecraft was not so much unknown to mid-Victorian feminists,” as she was 
                    “carefully and consciously avoided, especially in their published and public work” (262). Describing 
                    Wollstonecraft as “one of the dark secrets of Victorian feminism, haunting it as a shadowy and 
                    disreputable presence,” Caine notes that it wasn’t until the 1880s that “Wollstonecraft was finally 
                    rehabilitated and acknowledged as the founding figure in modern feminism” (263).<note place="foot"

                    in a new edition in 1844. After this new printing, the book languished again until the 1890s, when new 
                    editions by Pennell and Millicent Garrett Fawcett were published. As for biographical treatments of its 
                    author, it wasn’t until Pennell’s 1885 publication of the <title level="m">Life of Mary Wollstonecraft 
                        Godwin</title> that Wollstonecraft’s life was again the subject of an individual biography, almost

                        resp="editors">Wollstonecraft was in the main similarly left out of the otherwise ubiquitous Victorian 
                        publishing phenomenon of collective biographies of women, which were volumes of women’s lives organized 
                        according to an endless array of rubrics: women writers, pious women, royal women, elite and learned 
                        women, history’s “great women,” and so on. See Alison Booth’s <title level="m">How to Make It as a

                        of late-twentieth-century women’s studies” (3). The ironic juxtaposition of Wollstonecraft’s dislike 
                        of the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, with her “heroic” place in origin stories of 
                        women’s studies suggests that our literary histories of the discipline of women’s studies are still 
                        incomplete, and that a fuller treatment of the history of women’s studies, one that takes into account 
                        literary and generic studies such as Booth’s, is yet to come.</note> Drawing heavily on Charles Kegan 
                    Paul’s biographical sketch in his edition of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters to Imlay</title> 
                    (1879), Pennell’s biography was, as we just saw, part of an earnest late-Victorian effort to restore 
                    Wollstonecraft’s sullied reputation, and to that end it trained its sights on the deeply sentimental image 
                    of Wollstonecraft as virtuous mother (Caine 269–72). All of which is to say, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> in some measure produced an impression that it otherwise claimed merely to record: 
                    namely, that a eulogistic aura surrounded Wollstonecraft through the nineteenth century. In the absence 
                    of any actual evidence that would substantiate that Wollstonecraft was continuously celebrated from the 
                    moment of her death, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> obfuscated with rhetoric what it was unable to 
                    confirm with fact. With its anxious repetitions, overstatements, and mock tributes—“reprinted many times,” 
                    “many eulogistic biographies,” “apostrophized again and again”—<title level="m">Modern Woman</title> risked 
                    being mistaken at moments for the very praise it roundly censured (151).</p>
                <p>Compared to Wollstonecraft’s contemporary Hannah More, for instance, who was the subject of countless 
                    biographical treatments throughout the nineteenth century—and, as epitomized by Anne Stott’s biography, 
                    <title level="m">Hannah More: The First Victorian</title>, was beatified by Victorian writers—discussions of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s life among the generations that followed her were scant and few. In contrast to 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s assertion that during the nineteenth century there “was hardly a 
                    feminist who did not, at some time, pay tribute to <title level="m">A Vindication</title>, and credit it with 
                    being the source and fountainhead of feminist beliefs,” the historical record would suggest that very few in 
                    fact even dared to acknowledge an influence (151). Harriet Martineau was famously no fan of Wollstonecraft’s, 
                    raising her predecessor as a topic of discussion in her <title level="m">Autobiography</title>, as Caine 
                    argues, “only to dismiss her” (265). According to Caine, Martineau “took pains to deny that she had been 
                    influenced by Wollstonecraft,” and had no patience with Wollstonecraft’s unregulated emotional life. Martineau 
                    referred to Wollstonecraft in rather patronizing terms as “a poor victim of passion, with no control over her 
                    own peace, and no calmness or content except when the needs of her individual nature were satisfied” 
                    (400).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See also Barbara Taylor’s discussion of Martineau and Wollstonecraft

                    part, George Eliot was more sympathetic than Martineau, but similarly distanced herself. Observing in an essay 
                    on Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller that there existed “in some quarters a vague prejudice against the 
                    <title level="m">Rights of Woman</title> as in some way or other a reprehensible book,” Eliot asserted that 
                    “readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, 
                    and withal rather heavy,” and cited its weighty content as “the true reason, perhaps, that no edition has been 
                    published since 1796, and that it is rather now scarce” (201).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Caine notes 
                        that Eliot “appears not to know about the edition of Wollstonecraft published in the 1840s” 
                        (267).</note> Seemingly perplexed that readers conflated Wollstonecraft’s life with her work, Eliot raised 
                    the possibility that Wollstonecraft’s work went unread in the nineteenth century precisely because it was 
                    continually mistaken for her life. In the nineteenth century, few read the book because most conflated it with 
                    the supposed immorality of the life. The history of the reading of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of 
                        Woman</title> would thus have to include a history of its not having been read, or its having been

                <p>By now it should be apparent that <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was marked by a pervasive sense of 
                    historical anachronism, one that was most noticeable and of greatest consequence when it came to the question 
                    of domesticity. If a primary goal of the book was to convince women to leave the workforce and to return to 
                    the home, then it is not surprising that the terrain of domesticity was a particularly charged one, and that 
                    this produced some intriguing distortions. Consider the following discussion from <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> about men, women, work, and family:<quote>Mary Wollstonecraft, in her <title 
                            level="m">Vindication</title>, approvingly echoed Francis Bacon’s sentiments about wife and children 
                            being hostages to fortune. Commenting on Bacon’s wholly erroneous statement, “Certainly the best works, 
                            and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men,” Mary said, 
                            “I say the same of the women.” Women, said Mary, had allowed men to weaken their bodies and cramp their 
                            minds, and by such “sinister methods” had been persuaded “to stay at home, and fulfill the duties of a 
                            mother and mistress of a family.” (162)</quote>Sounding more like a second-wave feminist on the horizon 
                    of things to come—someone such as Betty Friedan—than a late eighteenth-century critic of prevailing female 
                    manners and education, Wollstonecraft and her words are decontextualized here to a degree that borders on 
                    preposterous, and that raises once again the specter of the thrown voice. Her comments about Bacon actually 
                    occurred in the context of a much broader discussion of how male writers of conduct books had not prepared 
                    women effectively for the work of raising children and managing a family by proffering instead “arguments 
                    dictated by gross appetite” that “weaken [women’s] bodies and cramp their minds” (133). According to 
                    Wollstonecraft, feeble-minded and coquettish women did not make good mothers, and the advice literature 
                    addressed to women had for too long been dominated by male proponents of female servility in all things. 
                    Contra <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, Wollstonecraft’s argument was not that women had been duped into 
                    being mothers when they could or should instead have been unencumbered geniuses. Indeed, her primary concern 
                    throughout <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was that women had been trained to 
                    focus less on being prudent mothers and more on being alluring wives. “To be a good mother,” Wollstonecraft 
                    argued, <quote>a woman must have sense, and that independence of mind which few 
                        women possess who are taught to depend entirely on their husbands. . . . I now only mean to insist, that 
                        unless the understanding of woman be enlarged, and her character rendered more firm, by being allowed to 
                        govern her own conduct, she will never have sufficient sense or command of temper to manage her children 
                        properly. (222)</quote>Arguably the very architect of what would come to be one version of bourgeois 
                    motherhood in the Victorian era, Wollstonecraft, far from luring women away from the home and from their full 
                    and inevitable existence as mothers, was instead quite possibly the inventor of at least one version of the 
                    traditional domesticity that the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> were so deeply anxious to 
                    recover.</p>
                <p>Such historical irony extends to <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s discussion of the “program of 
                    feminism” supposedly laid out in Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication</title>:<quote>In its main 
                        portions, <title level="m">A Vindication</title> argued for an education for women the same as that which 
                        men were receiving in the many schools, particularly technical schools, now springing up. Along with equal 
                        education, Mary said, women would also enjoy an equal moral standard, equal political rights, equal laws, 
                        equal work opportunities, equal pay and equal participation in the trades and professions. <title 
                            level="m">A Vindication</title>, in short, laid out the entire program of feminism, and unrealized 
                        parts of the program (such as equal pay for equal work) are still being sought by feminists. (146)</quote>
                    Most readers of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> would have been 
                    surprised to learn that there was anything resembling a “program” within its pages. The criticisms generally 
                    leveled at the book were that it was by turns digressive, disorganized, discontinuous, and full of 
                    perambulations. Not surprisingly, Wollstonecraft had nothing to say about equal pay for equal work, or even 
                    much to say about women and work, period. The misapprehension that Wollstonecraft’s feminism was one that 
                    yearned to emancipate women from the strictures of domesticity has been longstanding in feminist history and 
                    has produced peculiar anachronisms. Such an argument might seem to be supported by a text like Wollstonecraft’s 
                    <title level="m">The Wrongs of Woman</title>, which is devoted to the idea that domesticity oppresses women. 
                    In that novel, marriage is figured as that which has “bastilled” the central character, Maria, “for life,” a 
                    focus which has been taken as one more in a long line of feminist denunciations of domesticity as nothing more 
                    than an alibi for female incarceration by men. This seeming contradiction can be resolved, however, if we 
                    consider that Wollstonecraft is working with what we might call a stadial theory of domesticity, with a novel 
                    such as <title level="m">Wrongs</title> figuring an earlier, “barbaric” stage of domestic life, and the later 
                    chapters of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> sketching a hopeful future for women 
                    in the form of companionate marriage and bourgeois domesticity. Conferring upon women a quasi-professional 
                    status as mothers and household managers, modern bourgeois domesticity can thus be understood by 
                    Wollstonecraft as a space of liberation for women. That is, far from promoting women’s turn away from 
                    marriage, home, and motherhood, Wollstonecraft was arguably the architect of one version of the very 
                    “traditional” domesticity whose disavowal is constitutive of feminist historiography as such. This is a view 
                    that was lost, however, as Wollstonecraft’s vision of female influence in the home passed through a postwar 
                    feminism organized in large part by the drive to rescue women from domesticity, not launch them headlong 
                    towards it.</p>
                <p>The most powerful example of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s blinkered view is by far its discussion of 
                    Wollstonecraft and “equality,” a term that bears enormous freight for Farnham and Lundberg’s text, and one 
                    whose origin in feminist thought the authors attempted to lay at the foot of Wollstonecraft’s <title 
                        level="m">Vindication</title>. Seemingly unconcerned that <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights 
                        of Woman</title> invoked the term “equality” and its cognates a scant number of times over the course of 
                    hundreds of pages, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> forged ahead in their determination 
                    to hold Wollstonecraft responsible for what they perceived as the scourge of feminism. “The central and 
                    guiding idea of the book as a whole,” they argue, is “centered around the magic word ‘equality’—a fetish of 
                    the feminist movement ever since. The word is just as evocative emotionally to feminists today as it was to 
                    Mary Wollstonecraft” (147). The problem, however, is that the word “equality” had none of the talismanic force 
                    for Wollstonecraft that it did for the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>. In a strange act of 
                    projection, the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> attribute to Wollstonecraft the magical 
                    thinking about equality that they themselves embody. <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s archaic fear of 
                    feminism is captured in the text’s anxiety about the potential for an abstract idea to come to life, and for 
                    Wollstonecraft, the personification of feminism, to speak from beyond the grave.</p>
                <p><title level="m">Modern Woman</title> reproduced the longstanding tendency to confuse Wollstonecraft and her 
                    book, the person and the thing. But <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s “analysis” of Wollstonecraft is 
                    even more remarkable for, among other things, the degree to which the authors display a restless anxiety about 
                    the animating agency of their own writing about Wollstonecraft. The authors of <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> give feminism a disfigured face, Wollstonecraft’s face, and then tremble at what they have 
                    created. This is all the more striking when we think about what is—inevitably—missing from <title level="m">A 
                        Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>: a robust discussion of legal personhood and women’s political 
                    agency. Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> was published in 1792, 
                    soon after which discussions of the rights of women all but disappeared until late in the nineteenth 
                    century.<note place="foot" resp="editors">I argue elsewhere that the “rights of woman” gave way in the

                        collective biographies of women, or the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, became the 
                        primary way of measuring the progress of women. See Murray, <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft and 
                            Modernity.</title></note> Nineteenth-century Britain was dominated not by debates about women’s legal 
                    personhood but, rather, in the wake of Godwin’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, by furtive whisperings 
                    about Wollstonecraft’s personal life, culminating in <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s triumphant 
                    revelation of her “twisted personality.” Heather Keenleyside has argued that across the “modern disciplines,” 
                    such as “sociology and ethnology” but also “political economy, law, and psychoanalysis,” “writers turn to 
                    personification to establish their own modernity, repeatedly defining this modernity against a primitive 
                    confusion of persons and things” (447). One would think that as representatives of the social scientific 
                    establishment in postwar America, with its burgeoning inquiry into the study of personality, the authors of 
                    <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> would be firmly on the side of the moderns. But in an ironic reversal, 
                    it is the social scientists here who are premodern, producing the modernity of Wollstonecraft—and feminism—as 
                    an effect of their own “primitive” fear.</p>
                <p>In a further, awkward attempt to pathologize feminism, to insist on its very origin in one woman’s “twisted 
                    personality,” the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> linked it to the violent dramas of the 
                    Wollstonecraft family: <quote>Mary had a real grievance, but it was against her parents; the same was true 
                        of later feminists. These parents had been the agents of a vicious society (as exemplified by the 
                        childhood household) vis-à-vis the growing child. To Mary, all men were oppressors of women. All women 
                        were long-suffering, all the cards in the deck were stacked against them. . . . All men had always, 
                        without exception, beaten women black and blue, humiliated them, as her father had done to her and her 
                        mother. And all women had, like her mother, accepted such humiliation without a whimper. . . . In 
                        retaliation Mary wanted women to turn on men and injure them. The worst humiliation she could think of 
                        for them, however, the crowning ignominy, was to make them acknowledge the “equality” of women, their 
                        identity with men. (159–60) </quote>The intensity of the psychic and affective drama in this passage is 
                    almost stupefying. In short order, we are presented with Wollstonecraft’s supposed resentment towards her 
                    parents, her resentment towards all men, and her subsequent desire to humiliate them by forcing them to 
                    acknowledge women’s equality with men. Superimposed on this Oedipal scene we also have a version of the 
                    revenge of the psychoanalysts: a potent brew of projection, ressentiment, and misogyny. If we throw into 
                    the mix what Susan Gubar calls Wollstonecraft’s own brand of “feminist misogyny,” then the analysts become 
                    ever more deeply entangled with their analysand (453). As Mari Jo Buhle observes, <title level="m">Modern 
                        Woman</title> “appeared as the first popular application of selected—and bowdlerized—tenets of ego 
                    psychology to a refutation of feminism” (176). <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was an exemplary site 
                    in which the punitive ego psychology of postwar American Freudian psychoanalysis revealed most chillingly 
                    its fundamental hostility to feminism.</p>
                <p>It is clearly not difficult to find fault with <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>. Since its initial 
                    publication it has been controversial, with opinions varying wildly even as it climbed the best-seller list. 
                    The anthropologist Margaret Mead was keenly alert to peculiarities of voice and tone, and observed in a 1947 
                    review in the <title level="j">New York Times</title> that <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> was written 
                    “in assorted styles and moods, which suggest that the book had not two authors but four or five, or that it 
                    was written over a long period of time during which the mood of each changed markedly.” She went on to note 
                    that “perhaps most puzzling of all are the sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on the feminist movement,” 
                    with a good portion of those sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on Wollstonecraft (BR18). Mead’s comments 
                    are suggestive in indicating that, even at the moment of its publication, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> 
                    was understood as the product of a highly erratic—even “twisted”—voice, one that shifted, morphed, and was 
                    projected, or, in the idiom of apostrophe, thrown. Reading <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, one senses 
                    the instability of that voice, and the uncertainty about where it is coming from. At times patronizing, 
                    clinical, and detached, and at others possessed by an unrestrained contempt for its subject that feels 
                    impossibly personal, <title level="m">Modern Woman</title> constitutes an attack on Wollstonecraft that is 
                    so total and complete, as if to suggest that without Wollstonecraft and her “twisted personality,” the world 
                    would have been spared the scourge of feminism entirely.</p>
                <p>What emerges from these inconsistencies is <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s massive overinflation of 
                    Wollstonecraft’s power: it fetishizes her by turning her into a totemic figure far more dangerous than she in 
                    fact was. “Only deeply disturbed women,” they write, “disturbed by the nature of their childhood upbringing in 
                    the shattered home and the constricted circumstances they encountered in adult life,” could have “drawn what 
                    they supposed was pure wisdom from <title level="m">A Vindication</title>” (161). The authors of <title 
                        level="m">Modern Woman</title> feared the affective contagion that would spread if women read 
                    Wollstonecraft’s work, and wanted to ensure that no woman—let alone the “deeply disturbed”—derived “wisdom” 
                    from Wollstonecraft’s writing. As they put it: “Mary Wollstonecraft hated men. . . . Hers was hatred of 
                    creatures she greatly admired and feared” (145). One wonders, finally, about the degree to which the same 
                    sentiment is true of the authors of <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>, with respect to the subject of 
                    their “analysis.”</p></div>

                <p>The sheer vitriol contained in <title level="m">Modern Woman</title>’s screed about Wollstonecraft still 
                    has the power to shock, not only because of the bewildering intensity of its affect, but also because in 
                    the twenty-first century it is, quite simply, difficult to imagine Wollstonecraft as threatening. Far easier 
                    is to imagine her simply as irrelevant, or perhaps complicit with a blinkered view of progressive modernity, 
                    especially as second-wave celebrations of feminism’s founding mother gave way to third-wave critiques of

                    Wollstonecraft’s name has little of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">frisson</foreign> it used to carry. The 
                    uttering of her name produces—as it did in the nineteenth century—neither fear, nor muted silence, nor 
                    secret desire. Long subsumed to a feminist historiography organized along generational lines of inheritance 
                    and succession, Wollstonecraft’s name conjures for many the feeling reserved for an aging and distant female 
                    relative.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Jennifer Henderson’s “Can the Third Wave Speak?” for a 
                        discussion of the generational and maternal metaphor that organizes waves of feminism.</note> To cast 
                    an eye over the writing—popular, academic—of feminists in the twenty-first century is to find Wollstonecraft 
                    nowhere, and not because her name is only spoken in hushed tones and anxious whispers. It seems not to be 
                    spoken much at all.</p>
                <p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that because Wollstonecraft’s name isn’t on the tip of every feminist’s 
                    tongue today that she somehow doesn’t matter. The very title of Ahmed’s recent book, <title level="m">Living 
                        a Feminist Life</title> (2017), which she wrote while working on her blog, 
                    <title level="j">feministkilljoys</title>, reveals close affinities—perhaps not immediately apparent—with 
                    Wollstonecraft.<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> is the first 
                        book that Ahmed has published since resigning from her position as a tenured professor at Goldsmiths in 
                        London, a post she left in 2016 in protest over that institution’s handling of sexual harassment cases 
                        brought by students against members of Goldsmiths’ academic staff.</note> <title level="m">A Vindication 
                            of the Rights of Woman</title> is a critique of male-authored conduct books 
                    for women even as it is itself a conduct book, after a fashion. The same might be said, in some measure, about 
                    Ahmed’s <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title>. Ahmed’s effort to distinguish her book from something 
                    like prescriptive feminism is apparent on the first page: “Living a feminist life does not mean adopting a set 
                    of ideals or norms of conduct,” Ahmed insists, “although it might mean asking ethical questions about how to 
                    live better in an unjust and unequal world” (1). Ahmed continues:<quote>It is worth noting from the outset that 
                        the idea that feminism is about how to live, about a way of thinking how to live, has often been understood 
                        as part of feminist history, as dated, associated with the moralizing or even policing stance of what might 
                        be called or might have been called, usually dismissively, cultural feminism. (1)</quote>Ahmed clearly does 
                    not understand herself to be writing a feminist conduct book, yet an anxiety about prescriptive norms haunts 
                    the book, starting with the title. Given the “feminist history” to which she refers, it is difficult not to hear 
                    “How to Live a Feminist Life” even as one reads <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title>. The effort to 
                    place prescriptive feminism safely in the past, as “part of feminist history, as dated,” is belied by the 
                    stuttering over tense that happens when Ahmed gets to “the moralizing or even policing stance of <emph>what 
                        might be called or might have been called</emph>, usually dismissively, cultural feminism” (emphasis 
                    added). The charge of moralizing or policing is one that Ahmed herself has felt: “I have heard that judgment,” 
                    she writes; “it has fallen on my own shoulders” (2).</p>
                <p>This tripping or stumbling over tense is not surprising when we think about the persistence of the logic of 
                    progressive modernity that informs feminist historiography. Each successive wave of feminism understands itself 
                    as having absorbed the lessons, mistakes, and hard-won knowledge of the previous wave. But what Ahmed registers 
                    at the start of her book is the degree to which arguments about feminism and moral authority are alive and well: 
                    the feminist killjoy lives. Feminism in the twenty-first century is still in some measure about a right and a 
                    wrong way to live a feminist life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Roxane Gay’s bestselling 2014 book 
                        <title level="m">Bad Feminist</title>. Gay takes as axiomatic that feminism is morally prescriptive, and 
                        thus her book perpetuates the logic by which younger women disavow the ostensibly prim, constraining 
                        morality of previous “waves” of feminism.</note> To be a killjoy, moreover, is in some sense to 
                    <emph>be</emph> an affect, to <emph>be</emph> the murderer of joy, to <emph>be</emph> joylessness. Ahmed writes 
                    about moving through the world as a feminist killjoy and about the way it feels to be the one to make others 
                    uncomfortable, to bring to a halt otherwise congenial conversation and sociability:<quote>Sometimes we keep 
                        laughing out of fear of causing a breakage. We might, in other words, decide not to become a killjoy in 
                        certain moments, because the costs would be too high: we would break what we need to hold on to, a 
                        relationship that we care about, a person we love, a world we cannot let go of. (171)</quote>
                    <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> bears all the marks of the autobiographical, autoethnographic, 
                    and experiential writing that has come to characterize feminist writing of the third wave and beyond. But it 
                    also bears the marks of the writing of Wollstonecraft, whose <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short 
                        Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796) might well have been entitled <title level="m">Living 
                            a Feminist Life</title>. Part travel narrative, part ethnographic record, part lover’s litany and 
                    personal memoir, <title level="m">A Short Residence</title> constitutes an early example of feminist writing 
                    that seizes on the importance, for world-making, of a canny and shrewd sense of the affective culture that makes 
                    and unmakes our public lives and private pain. There is a cruel irony in the fact that the feminist 
                    historiography we have long credited Wollstonecraft with inventing has impoverished our very ability to read 
                    her. When we reduce her to a cartoonish worshipper of progress, we are no longer able to recognize the restless 
                    and affective ambivalence that she possessed not simply toward the past, but also the present and the 
                    future.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Scott J. Juengel’s <title level="a">Mary Wollstonecraft’s 
                        Perpetual Disaster.</title></note> Wollstonecraft’s work is perhaps the best evidence we have, finally, 
                    that we need a different tense and a different temporality—the future anterior, perhaps—even to begin to read 
                    it. Ahmed’s <title level="m">Living a Feminist Life</title> is not a sign that feminism has moved on from 
                    Wollstonecraft. It is a sign, rather, that we are only now approaching the limit beyond which we might 
                    begin.</p></div>
