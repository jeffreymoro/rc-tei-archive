            <p class="noCount">This essay takes up the longstanding association between Wollstonecraft, feminism,
               and joylessness via feminist critic Sara Ahmed’s ironic appropriation of the term
               “feminist killjoy.” I argue that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim to being a killjoy
               can be traced to the mid-twentieth century, when two American ego psychologists, obsessed
               with what they called Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality,” seized on her personal
               biography with a determined vengeance in their book <em>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</em> (1947), and forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft and the annihilation
               of joy.</p>

                  <p>Few would disagree that, by most standards, Mary Wollstonecraft is key to Western
                     feminism’s scene of origin, with all the weighty burdens and responsibilities—and
                     only some of the romance—that goes along with being the origin of anything. Some might
                     also suggest that Wollstonecraft is the original “feminist killjoy,” a term recently
                     popularized by feminist scholar and activist Sara Ahmed. Ahmed’s ongoing blog, <em>feministkilljoys</em>, is subtitled “killing joy as a world making project.” Her wry and ironic appropriation
                     conjures the specter of Wollstonecraft, the world-making feminist who has long had
                     the dubious privilege of being associated with an emotional register that swings from
                     one form of joy-killing affect to another (anger, resentment, jealousy, suicidal despair,
                     murderous rage). I would argue, furthermore, that Wollstonecraft’s specific claim
                     to being a feminist killjoy can be traced to the mid-twentieth century, when two American
                     ego psychologists seized on her personal biography with a determined vengeance and
                     forged the still unbreakable link between Wollstonecraft, feminism, and joylessness.
                     Marynia F. Farnham and Ferdinand Lundberg’s <em>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</em>, published in 1947, was an instant bestseller. Written and published in the hothouse
                     of American postwar anxieties about the need to redomesticate women, <em>Modern Woman</em> provided the pseudoscientific justification necessary for the argument that women
                     must return to the home to fulfill their logical, natural role as mothers and domestic
                     managers. Now remembered mainly for its central part in shaping postwar conceptions
                     of normative family life, <em>Modern Woman</em> was crucial in popularizing the idea that feminism, in thrall to modernity, was world-destroying,
                     and that Wollstonecraft, <em>the</em> “modern woman,” was largely responsible for this sad state of affairs. <em>Modern Woman</em> performs what Janet Todd has called, with great understatement, “an extraordinary
                     retrospective psychoanalysis” of Wollstonecraft (728). With good reason, feminist
                     commentators on Wollstonecraft have in the main refused to grant further authority
                     to “a hostile team of Freudian epigones,” in the words of Margaret George, author
                     of one of the earliest second-wave feminist biographies of Wollstonecraft (11).

                              Wollstonecraft” first alerted me to the book. Mari Jo Buhle’s Feminism and Its Discontents
                              treats Modern Woman’s analysis of Wollstonecraft in the context of twentieth-century
                              American ego psychology. Otherwise, little has been written about Modern Woman’s bizarre
                              attack on Wollstonecraft.</span></div>
                     </div> But the reluctance to engage with <em>Modern Woman</em>’s cartoonish depiction of Wollstonecraft has not, I would argue, been without its
                     costs. A fuller reading of <em>Modern Woman</em>’s “analysis” goes a long way towards clarifying the source of some of the intensely
                     negative affect that has long surrounded both Wollstonecraft and feminism. As seeming
                     exemplars of the mid-twentieth-century social scientific establishment and its celebratory
                     modernity—Farnham was a psychiatrist and Lundberg was a journalist and sociologist—the
                     authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> were strangely passionate in their fierce defense of tradition. For <em>Modern Woman</em>, Wollstonecraft personifies the “killjoy” whose world-destroying modernity annihilates
                     everything in its path and must be stopped.</p>

               <p>“Mary Wollstonecraft’s life reads like a psychiatric case history,” Farnham and Lundberg
                  begin, speculating that had “psychoanalysis existed in 1792,” <span class="quote">‘and had a psychoanalyst (Freud, let us fancy) been reviewing <em>A Vindication</em> for one of the journals of the day, he would have been able to come at once to many
                     certain conclusions about the unknown author. . . . As he read, our imaginary psychoanalyst
                     of 1792 would not too slowly have come to the conclusion that the author was afflicted
                     with a severe case of “penis-envy,” a term the founder of psychoanalysis coined to
                     describe the attitude of those women who envy and constantly measure themselves against
                     men, consciously or unconsciously. They can, so they fantasy, do anything a man can
                     do. . . .The shadow of the phallus lay darkly, threateningly, over every move [Wollstonecraft]
                     made, as it lay over the minds of the latter-day feminists. (149)’</span> Analyzing Wollstonecraft according to the terms of an unrelenting Freudianism that
                  saw “penis-envy” as the structuring force driving her neurotically fueled feminism,
                  Farnham and Lundberg proceeded with breathtaking confidence to an extended interpretation
                  of her early life that firmly located the constitutively perverse origins of modern
                  feminism in the fact that Wollstonecraft’s <span class="quote">‘childhood had been fearfully tragic and had left her with a twisted personality.
                     The reader must not lose sight of this fact, because it is to this book that feminism
                     <em>as an ideology</em> is directly traceable. <em>A Vindication</em> was reprinted many times during the nineteenth century, and many eulogistic biographies
                     and biographical sketches of the author appeared. There was hardly a feminist who
                     did not, at some time, pay tribute to <em>A Vindication</em>, and credit it with being the source and fountainhead of feminist beliefs. The book
                     and its author have been apostrophized again and again. (151)’</span> One of the first things to note about the above passage is that the precise referent
                  of “this book” is not immediately apparent. Upon rereading, it does in fact become
                  clear that the authors are referring to Wollstonecraft’s 1792 <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, but on an initial scan, it seems almost as though Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality”
                  is in fact the “book” to which “feminism <em>as an ideology</em> is traceable.” That sense is reinforced a few pages later, when the reader is told
                  that “Mary Wollstonecraft was an extreme neurotic of a compulsive type,” and that
                  apparently, “out of her illness arose the ideology of feminism” (159). The relationship
                  between Wollstonecraft and feminism that emerges here is one of part to whole: feminism
                  is not a widespread social movement born of the experiences of millions of women,
                  but rather an illness that can be traced to the “twisted” mind of one woman.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This referential ambiguity, the suggestion that Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality”
                     is the “book” to which feminism owes its very existence, is not without precedent.
                     William Godwin’s 1798 biography of Wollstonecraft, written and published only months
                     after she died, is entitled <em>Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>. Yoking the author and her work, and substituting, moreover, the text for which she
                     is most famous for the woman herself, Godwin’s title stands as the first in a long
                     line of conflations of Wollstonecraft’s life narrative with the quintessential example
                     of her life’s work. When <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> was published in a new edition in 1844—the first since the 1790s—it included large
                     sections of Godwin’s <em>Memoirs</em> in the preface, beginning the tradition of reading <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> through the scandal-inflected lens of Wollstonecraft’s life, a lens through which
                     the work was primarily read for generations. <em>Modern Woman</em>’s insistence on an equivalence between the “book and its author,” both of which purportedly
                     “have been apostrophized again and again,” only added to the sense that Wollstonecraft
                     and her best-known book were easily substituted, one for the other, and substituted,
                     finally, in the mode of apostrophe. That is to say, the dead and absent author and
                     the inanimate book were both addressed by the living, and both were made present or
                     animate—anthropomorphized, even—by the apostrophic address. That Wollstonecraft was
                     hardly apostrophized until at least the end of the nineteenth century proved to be
                     no obstacle to the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em>, who hyperbolically (and counterfactually) declared that she was apostrophized “again
                     and again,” and whose own voices were as a result thrown at times in the very manner
                     of apostrophe.

                              figure of apostrophe. “The absent, dead, or inanimate entity addressed,” Johnson writes,
                              “is thereby made present, animate, and anthropomorphic. Apostrophe is a form of ventriloquism
                              through which the speaker throws voice, life, and human form into the addressee, turning
                              its silence into mute responsiveness” (30).</span></div>
                     </div> Ventriloquists after a fashion, Farnham and Lundberg occasionally put words in Wollstonecraft’s
                     mouth, as we will see, or mocked her by speaking in her voice, thus unexpectedly producing
                     the very effects of the apostrophic praise that they attributed to others.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>While Farnham and Lundberg seemed to be thin on the details of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, regularly misrepresenting its argument, they had amply absorbed, by contrast, its
                     famously withering tone. Roundly criticized for her acerbic air, Wollstonecraft was
                     no stranger to bombast, and was prone to an ostentatious style that the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> themselves inadvertently flattered through mimicry, offering, for example, this declamatory
                     summary of her central argument: “The all-powerful, all-evil male had contrived for
                     long ages to enslave and degrade the delicate, weak, all-good female. Only now was
                     she to be liberated—by Mary Wollstonecraft!” (145). The extravagance of this mock-heroic
                     invocation of Wollstonecraft might seem merely to underscore <em>Modern Woman</em>’s unambiguous contempt for its subject, but I suggest that this figuration in fact
                     revived rather than settled the ongoing question of Wollstonecraft and heroism. The
                     figure of Wollstonecraft as feminist heroine and martyr framed the sympathetic treatments
                     of her life starting in the late nineteenth century, with biographers such Elizabeth
                     Robins Pennell arguing in 1885, for example, that “few women have worked so faithfully
                     for the cause of humanity as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, and few have been the object
                     of such censure. She devoted herself to the relief of her suffering fellow-beings
                     with the ardour of a Saint Vincent de Paul, and in return she was considered by them
                     a moral scourge of God” (1). <em>Modern Woman</em>’s caricature of Wollstonecraft as chivalric protector, striving bravely to liberate
                     women everywhere from male oppression, did less than its authors may have liked to
                     undermine the stubborn association between Wollstonecraft and heroism: their mockery
                     provoked second-wave feminists to defend her virtue and celebrate their feminist foremother
                     as just the hero that the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> accused her of considering herself. The problem that they inadvertently perpetuated
                     becomes clear, however, when we remember the inconvenient fact that, as Barbara Taylor
                     has quipped, Wollstonecraft was “never keen on heroines” (252).

                     </div> Aiming, we might surmise, to expose with their mock tribute any lingering or latent
                     arrogance in Wollstonecraft, the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> worked instead to reinforce in the minds of subsequent generations of readers an association
                     of Wollstonecraft with heroism that Wollstonecraft herself would have readily critiqued,
                     and that <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> offered little ground to support.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> built their case against Wollstonecraft not only on an imprecise reading of <em>A Vindication</em>, but equally on a rather hyperbolic, not to say inaccurate, sense of Wollstonecraft’s
                     reception in the nineteenth century. Most feminist literary historians agree that
                     the publication of Godwin’s <em>Memoirs</em> inadvertently rendered his late wife’s name anathema in polite company for almost
                     a century because of its candid discussion of details related to Wollstonecraft’s
                     suicide attempts, illegitimate child, and torrid love affairs. As Barbara Caine observes,
                     “Wollstonecraft was not so much unknown to mid-Victorian feminists,” as she was “carefully
                     and consciously avoided, especially in their published and public work” (262). Describing
                     Wollstonecraft as “one of the dark secrets of Victorian feminism, haunting it as a
                     shadowy and disreputable presence,” Caine notes that it wasn’t until the 1880s that
                     “Wollstonecraft was finally rehabilitated and acknowledged as the founding figure
                     in modern feminism” (263).

                     most famous book went almost fifty years before being published in a new edition in
                     1844. After this new printing, the book languished again until the 1890s, when new
                     editions by Pennell and Millicent Garrett Fawcett were published. As for biographical
                     treatments of its author, it wasn’t until Pennell’s 1885 publication of the <em>Life of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin</em> that Wollstonecraft’s life was again the subject of an individual biography, almost
                     one hundred years after Godwin’s <em>Memoir</em>.

                     </div> Drawing heavily on Charles Kegan Paul’s biographical sketch in his edition of Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters to Imlay</em> (1879), Pennell’s biography was, as we just saw, part of an earnest late-Victorian
                     effort to restore Wollstonecraft’s sullied reputation, and to that end it trained
                     its sights on the deeply sentimental image of Wollstonecraft as virtuous mother (Caine
                     269–72). All of which is to say, <em>Modern Woman</em> in some measure produced an impression that it otherwise claimed merely to record:
                     namely, that a eulogistic aura surrounded Wollstonecraft through the nineteenth century.
                     In the absence of any actual evidence that would substantiate that Wollstonecraft
                     was continuously celebrated from the moment of her death, <em>Modern Woman</em> obfuscated with rhetoric what it was unable to confirm with fact. With its anxious
                     repetitions, overstatements, and mock tributes—“reprinted many times,” “many eulogistic
                     biographies,” “apostrophized again and again”—<em>Modern Woman</em> risked being mistaken at moments for the very praise it roundly censured (151).</p>

                  <p>Compared to Wollstonecraft’s contemporary Hannah More, for instance, who was the subject
                     of countless biographical treatments throughout the nineteenth century—and, as epitomized
                     by Anne Stott’s biography, <em>Hannah More: The First Victorian</em>, was beatified by Victorian writers—discussions of Wollstonecraft’s life among the
                     generations that followed her were scant and few. In contrast to <em>Modern Woman</em>’s assertion that during the nineteenth century there “was hardly a feminist who did
                     not, at some time, pay tribute to <em>A Vindication</em>, and credit it with being the source and fountainhead of feminist beliefs,” the historical
                     record would suggest that very few in fact even dared to acknowledge an influence
                     (151). Harriet Martineau was famously no fan of Wollstonecraft’s, raising her predecessor
                     as a topic of discussion in her <em>Autobiography</em>, as Caine argues, “only to dismiss her” (265). According to Caine, Martineau “took
                     pains to deny that she had been influenced by Wollstonecraft,” and had no patience
                     with Wollstonecraft’s unregulated emotional life. Martineau referred to Wollstonecraft
                     in rather patronizing terms as “a poor victim of passion, with no control over her
                     own peace, and no calmness or content except when the needs of her individual nature
                     were satisfied” (400).

                     herself. Observing in an essay on Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller that there existed
                     “in some quarters a vague prejudice against the <em>Rights of Woman</em> as in some way or other a reprehensible book,” Eliot asserted that “readers who go
                     to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely
                     moral, and withal rather heavy,” and cited its weighty content as “the true reason,
                     perhaps, that no edition has been published since 1796, and that it is rather now
                     scarce” (201).

                     </div> Seemingly perplexed that readers conflated Wollstonecraft’s life with her work, Eliot
                     raised the possibility that Wollstonecraft’s work went unread in the nineteenth century
                     precisely because it was continually mistaken for her life. In the nineteenth century,
                     few read the book because most conflated it with the supposed immorality of the life.
                     The history of the reading of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> would thus have to include a history of its not having been read, or its having been

               <p>By now it should be apparent that <em>Modern Woman</em> was marked by a pervasive sense of historical anachronism, one that was most noticeable
                  and of greatest consequence when it came to the question of domesticity. If a primary
                  goal of the book was to convince women to leave the workforce and to return to the
                  home, then it is not surprising that the terrain of domesticity was a particularly
                  charged one, and that this produced some intriguing distortions. Consider the following
                  discussion from <em>Modern Woman</em> about men, women, work, and family:<span class="quote">‘Mary Wollstonecraft, in her <em>Vindication</em>, approvingly echoed Francis Bacon’s sentiments about wife and children being hostages
                     to fortune. Commenting on Bacon’s wholly erroneous statement, “Certainly the best
                     works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or
                     childless men,” Mary said, “I say the same of the women.” Women, said Mary, had allowed
                     men to weaken their bodies and cramp their minds, and by such “sinister methods” had
                     been persuaded “to stay at home, and fulfill the duties of a mother and mistress of
                     a family.” (162)’</span>Sounding more like a second-wave feminist on the horizon of things to come—someone
                  such as Betty Friedan—than a late eighteenth-century critic of prevailing female manners
                  and education, Wollstonecraft and her words are decontextualized here to a degree
                  that borders on preposterous, and that raises once again the specter of the thrown
                  voice. Her comments about Bacon actually occurred in the context of a much broader
                  discussion of how male writers of conduct books had not prepared women effectively
                  for the work of raising children and managing a family by proffering instead “arguments
                  dictated by gross appetite” that “weaken [women’s] bodies and cramp their minds” (133).
                  According to Wollstonecraft, feeble-minded and coquettish women did not make good
                  mothers, and the advice literature addressed to women had for too long been dominated
                  by male proponents of female servility in all things. Contra <em>Modern Woman</em>, Wollstonecraft’s argument was not that women had been duped into being mothers when
                  they could or should instead have been unencumbered geniuses. Indeed, her primary
                  concern throughout <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> was that women had been trained to focus less on being prudent mothers and more on
                  being alluring wives. “To be a good mother,” Wollstonecraft argued, <span class="quote">‘a woman must have sense, and that independence of mind which few women possess who
                     are taught to depend entirely on their husbands. . . . I now only mean to insist,
                     that unless the understanding of woman be enlarged, and her character rendered more
                     firm, by being allowed to govern her own conduct, she will never have sufficient sense
                     or command of temper to manage her children properly. (222)’</span>Arguably the very architect of what would come to be one version of bourgeois motherhood
                  in the Victorian era, Wollstonecraft, far from luring women away from the home and
                  from their full and inevitable existence as mothers, was instead quite possibly the
                  inventor of at least one version of the traditional domesticity that the authors of
                  <em>Modern Woman</em> were so deeply anxious to recover.</p>
               <p>Such historical irony extends to <em>Modern Woman</em>’s discussion of the “program of feminism” supposedly laid out in Wollstonecraft’s
                  <em>Vindication</em>:<span class="quote">‘In its main portions, <em>A Vindication</em> argued for an education for women the same as that which men were receiving in the
                     many schools, particularly technical schools, now springing up. Along with equal education,
                     Mary said, women would also enjoy an equal moral standard, equal political rights,
                     equal laws, equal work opportunities, equal pay and equal participation in the trades
                     and professions. <em>A Vindication</em>, in short, laid out the entire program of feminism, and unrealized parts of the program
                     (such as equal pay for equal work) are still being sought by feminists. (146)’</span> Most readers of Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> would have been surprised to learn that there was anything resembling a “program”
                  within its pages. The criticisms generally leveled at the book were that it was by
                  turns digressive, disorganized, discontinuous, and full of perambulations. Not surprisingly,
                  Wollstonecraft had nothing to say about equal pay for equal work, or even much to
                  say about women and work, period. The misapprehension that Wollstonecraft’s feminism
                  was one that yearned to emancipate women from the strictures of domesticity has been
                  longstanding in feminist history and has produced peculiar anachronisms. Such an argument
                  might seem to be supported by a text like Wollstonecraft’s <em>The Wrongs of Woman</em>, which is devoted to the idea that domesticity oppresses women. In that novel, marriage
                  is figured as that which has “bastilled” the central character, Maria, “for life,”
                  a focus which has been taken as one more in a long line of feminist denunciations
                  of domesticity as nothing more than an alibi for female incarceration by men. This
                  seeming contradiction can be resolved, however, if we consider that Wollstonecraft
                  is working with what we might call a stadial theory of domesticity, with a novel such
                  as <em>Wrongs</em> figuring an earlier, “barbaric” stage of domestic life, and the later chapters of
                  <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> sketching a hopeful future for women in the form of companionate marriage and bourgeois
                  domesticity. Conferring upon women a quasi-professional status as mothers and household
                  managers, modern bourgeois domesticity can thus be understood by Wollstonecraft as
                  a space of liberation for women. That is, far from promoting women’s turn away from
                  marriage, home, and motherhood, Wollstonecraft was arguably the architect of one version
                  of the very “traditional” domesticity whose disavowal is constitutive of feminist
                  historiography as such. This is a view that was lost, however, as Wollstonecraft’s
                  vision of female influence in the home passed through a postwar feminism organized
                  in large part by the drive to rescue women from domesticity, not launch them headlong
                  towards it.</p>
               <p>The most powerful example of <em>Modern Woman</em>’s blinkered view is by far its discussion of Wollstonecraft and “equality,” a term
                  that bears enormous freight for Farnham and Lundberg’s text, and one whose origin
                  in feminist thought the authors attempted to lay at the foot of Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindication</em>. Seemingly unconcerned that <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> invoked the term “equality” and its cognates a scant number of times over the course
                  of hundreds of pages, the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> forged ahead in their determination to hold Wollstonecraft responsible for what they
                  perceived as the scourge of feminism. “The central and guiding idea of the book as
                  a whole,” they argue, is “centered around the magic word ‘equality’—a fetish of the
                  feminist movement ever since. The word is just as evocative emotionally to feminists
                  today as it was to Mary Wollstonecraft” (147). The problem, however, is that the word
                  “equality” had none of the talismanic force for Wollstonecraft that it did for the
                  authors of <em>Modern Woman</em>. In a strange act of projection, the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> attribute to Wollstonecraft the magical thinking about equality that they themselves
                  embody. <em>Modern Woman</em>’s archaic fear of feminism is captured in the text’s anxiety about the potential
                  for an abstract idea to come to life, and for Wollstonecraft, the personification
                  of feminism, to speak from beyond the grave.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>Modern Woman</em> reproduced the longstanding tendency to confuse Wollstonecraft and her book, the person
                     and the thing. But <em>Modern Woman</em>’s “analysis” of Wollstonecraft is even more remarkable for, among other things, the
                     degree to which the authors display a restless anxiety about the animating agency
                     of their own writing about Wollstonecraft. The authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> give feminism a disfigured face, Wollstonecraft’s face, and then tremble at what they
                     have created. This is all the more striking when we think about what is—inevitably—missing
                     from <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>: a robust discussion of legal personhood and women’s political agency. Wollstonecraft’s <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> was published in 1792, soon after which discussions of the rights of women all but
                     disappeared until late in the nineteenth century.

                              the lives of women. In the absence of a robust conversation about rights, collective
                              biographies of women, or the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, became
                              the primary way of measuring the progress of women. See Murray, 
                              “Mary Wollstonecraft and Modernity.”
                              </span></div>
                     </div> Nineteenth-century Britain was dominated not by debates about women’s legal personhood
                     but, rather, in the wake of Godwin’s <em>Memoirs</em>, by furtive whisperings about Wollstonecraft’s personal life, culminating in <em>Modern Woman</em>’s triumphant revelation of her “twisted personality.” Heather Keenleyside has argued
                     that across the “modern disciplines,” such as “sociology and ethnology” but also “political
                     economy, law, and psychoanalysis,” “writers turn to personification to establish their
                     own modernity, repeatedly defining this modernity against a primitive confusion of
                     persons and things” (447). One would think that as representatives of the social scientific
                     establishment in postwar America, with its burgeoning inquiry into the study of personality,
                     the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> would be firmly on the side of the moderns. But in an ironic reversal, it is the social
                     scientists here who are premodern, producing the modernity of Wollstonecraft—and feminism—as
                     an effect of their own “primitive” fear.</p>
               </div>
               <p>In a further, awkward attempt to pathologize feminism, to insist on its very origin
                  in one woman’s “twisted personality,” the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> linked it to the violent dramas of the Wollstonecraft family: <span class="quote">‘Mary had a real grievance, but it was against her parents; the same was true of later
                     feminists. These parents had been the agents of a vicious society (as exemplified
                     by the childhood household) vis-à-vis the growing child. To Mary, all men were oppressors
                     of women. All women were long-suffering, all the cards in the deck were stacked against
                     them. . . . All men had always, without exception, beaten women black and blue, humiliated
                     them, as her father had done to her and her mother. And all women had, like her mother,
                     accepted such humiliation without a whimper. . . . In retaliation Mary wanted women
                     to turn on men and injure them. The worst humiliation she could think of for them,
                     however, the crowning ignominy, was to make them acknowledge the “equality” of women,
                     their identity with men. (159–60) ’</span>The intensity of the psychic and affective drama in this passage is almost stupefying.
                  In short order, we are presented with Wollstonecraft’s supposed resentment towards
                  her parents, her resentment towards all men, and her subsequent desire to humiliate
                  them by forcing them to acknowledge women’s equality with men. Superimposed on this
                  Oedipal scene we also have a version of the revenge of the psychoanalysts: a potent
                  brew of projection, ressentiment, and misogyny. If we throw into the mix what Susan
                  Gubar calls Wollstonecraft’s own brand of “feminist misogyny,” then the analysts become
                  ever more deeply entangled with their analysand (453). As Mari Jo Buhle observes,
                  <em>Modern Woman</em> “appeared as the first popular application of selected—and bowdlerized—tenets of
                  ego psychology to a refutation of feminism” (176). <em>Modern Woman</em> was an exemplary site in which the punitive ego psychology of postwar American Freudian
                  psychoanalysis revealed most chillingly its fundamental hostility to feminism.</p>
               <p>It is clearly not difficult to find fault with <em>Modern Woman</em>. Since its initial publication it has been controversial, with opinions varying wildly
                  even as it climbed the best-seller list. The anthropologist Margaret Mead was keenly
                  alert to peculiarities of voice and tone, and observed in a 1947 review in the <em>New York Times</em> that <em>Modern Woman</em> was written “in assorted styles and moods, which suggest that the book had not two
                  authors but four or five, or that it was written over a long period of time during
                  which the mood of each changed markedly.” She went on to note that “perhaps most puzzling
                  of all are the sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on the feminist movement,” with
                  a good portion of those sixty pages devoted to a savage attack on Wollstonecraft (BR18).
                  Mead’s comments are suggestive in indicating that, even at the moment of its publication,
                  <em>Modern Woman</em> was understood as the product of a highly erratic—even “twisted”—voice, one that
                  shifted, morphed, and was projected, or, in the idiom of apostrophe, thrown. Reading
                  <em>Modern Woman</em>, one senses the instability of that voice, and the uncertainty about where it is
                  coming from. At times patronizing, clinical, and detached, and at others possessed
                  by an unrestrained contempt for its subject that feels impossibly personal, <em>Modern Woman</em> constitutes an attack on Wollstonecraft that is so total and complete, as if to suggest
                  that without Wollstonecraft and her “twisted personality,” the world would have been
                  spared the scourge of feminism entirely.</p>
               <p>What emerges from these inconsistencies is <em>Modern Woman</em>’s massive overinflation of Wollstonecraft’s power: it fetishizes her by turning her
                  into a totemic figure far more dangerous than she in fact was. “Only deeply disturbed
                  women,” they write, “disturbed by the nature of their childhood upbringing in the
                  shattered home and the constricted circumstances they encountered in adult life,”
                  could have “drawn what they supposed was pure wisdom from <em>A Vindication</em>” (161). The authors of <em>Modern Woman</em> feared the affective contagion that would spread if women read Wollstonecraft’s work,
                  and wanted to ensure that no woman—let alone the “deeply disturbed”—derived “wisdom”
                  from Wollstonecraft’s writing. As they put it: “Mary Wollstonecraft hated men. . .
                  . Hers was hatred of creatures she greatly admired and feared” (145). One wonders,
                  finally, about the degree to which the same sentiment is true of the authors of <em>Modern Woman</em>, with respect to the subject of their “analysis.”</p>

                     it is, quite simply, difficult to imagine Wollstonecraft as threatening. Far easier
                     is to imagine her simply as irrelevant, or perhaps complicit with a blinkered view
                     of progressive modernity, especially as second-wave celebrations of feminism’s founding
                     mother gave way to third-wave critiques of Wollstonecraft’s proximity to imperialist
                     logics, bourgeois sexual morality, even misogyny as such.

                     organized along generational lines of inheritance and succession, Wollstonecraft’s
                     name conjures for many the feeling reserved for an aging and distant female relative.

                     title of Ahmed’s recent book, <em>Living a Feminist Life</em> (2017), which she wrote while working on her blog, <em>feministkilljoys</em>, reveals close affinities—perhaps not immediately apparent—with Wollstonecraft.

                              from her position as a tenured professor at Goldsmiths in London, a post she left
                              in 2016 in protest over that institution’s handling of sexual harassment cases brought
                              by students against members of Goldsmiths’ academic staff.</span></div>
                     </div> <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> is a critique of male-authored conduct books for women even as it is itself a conduct
                     book, after a fashion. The same might be said, in some measure, about Ahmed’s <em>Living a Feminist Life</em>. Ahmed’s effort to distinguish her book from something like prescriptive feminism
                     is apparent on the first page: “Living a feminist life does not mean adopting a set
                     of ideals or norms of conduct,” Ahmed insists, “although it might mean asking ethical
                     questions about how to live better in an unjust and unequal world” (1). Ahmed continues:<span class="quote">‘It is worth noting from the outset that the idea that feminism is about how to live,
                        about a way of thinking how to live, has often been understood as part of feminist
                        history, as dated, associated with the moralizing or even policing stance of what
                        might be called or might have been called, usually dismissively, cultural feminism.
                        (1)’</span>Ahmed clearly does not understand herself to be writing a feminist conduct book, yet
                     an anxiety about prescriptive norms haunts the book, starting with the title. Given
                     the “feminist history” to which she refers, it is difficult not to hear “How to Live
                     a Feminist Life” even as one reads <em>Living a Feminist Life</em>. The effort to place prescriptive feminism safely in the past, as “part of feminist
                     history, as dated,” is belied by the stuttering over tense that happens when Ahmed
                     gets to “the moralizing or even policing stance of <em>what might be called or might have been called</em>, usually dismissively, cultural feminism” (emphasis added). The charge of moralizing
                     or policing is one that Ahmed herself has felt: “I have heard that judgment,” she
                     writes; “it has fallen on my own shoulders” (2).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>This tripping or stumbling over tense is not surprising when we think about the persistence
                     of the logic of progressive modernity that informs feminist historiography. Each successive
                     wave of feminism understands itself as having absorbed the lessons, mistakes, and
                     hard-won knowledge of the previous wave. But what Ahmed registers at the start of
                     her book is the degree to which arguments about feminism and moral authority are alive
                     and well: the feminist killjoy lives. Feminism in the twenty-first century is still
                     in some measure about a right and a wrong way to live a feminist life.

                              women disavow the ostensibly prim, constraining morality of previous “waves” of feminism.</span></div>
                     </div> To be a killjoy, moreover, is in some sense to <em>be</em> an affect, to <em>be</em> the murderer of joy, to <em>be</em> joylessness. Ahmed writes about moving through the world as a feminist killjoy and
                     about the way it feels to be the one to make others uncomfortable, to bring to a halt
                     otherwise congenial conversation and sociability:<span class="quote">‘Sometimes we keep laughing out of fear of causing a breakage. We might, in other words,
                        decide not to become a killjoy in certain moments, because the costs would be too
                        high: we would break what we need to hold on to, a relationship that we care about,
                        a person we love, a world we cannot let go of. (171)’</span> <em>Living a Feminist Life</em> bears all the marks of the autobiographical, autoethnographic, and experiential writing
                     that has come to characterize feminist writing of the third wave and beyond. But it
                     also bears the marks of the writing of Wollstonecraft, whose <em>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796) might well have been entitled <em>Living a Feminist Life</em>. Part travel narrative, part ethnographic record, part lover’s litany and personal
                     memoir, <em>A Short Residence</em> constitutes an early example of feminist writing that seizes on the importance, for
                     world-making, of a canny and shrewd sense of the affective culture that makes and
                     unmakes our public lives and private pain. There is a cruel irony in the fact that
                     the feminist historiography we have long credited Wollstonecraft with inventing has
                     impoverished our very ability to read her. When we reduce her to a cartoonish worshipper
                     of progress, we are no longer able to recognize the restless and affective ambivalence
                     that she possessed not simply toward the past, but also the present and the future.

                     that we are only now approaching the limit beyond which we might begin.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Wollstonecraft was in the main similarly left out of the otherwise ubiquitous Victorian
               publishing phenomenon of collective biographies of women, which were volumes of women’s
               lives organized according to an endless array of rubrics: women writers, pious women,
               royal women, elite and learned women, history’s “great women,” and so on. See Alison
               Booth’s <em>How to Make It as a Woman: Collective Biographical History from Victoria to the Present</em> for a comprehensive study of the genre. Booth suggests that collective biographies
               of women constitute the “lost ancestors of late-twentieth-century women’s studies”
               (3). The ironic juxtaposition of Wollstonecraft’s dislike of the genre of “women worthies,”
               as they were called, with her “heroic” place in origin stories of women’s studies
               suggests that our literary histories of the discipline of women’s studies are still
               incomplete, and that a fuller treatment of the history of women’s studies, one that
               takes into account literary and generic studies such as Booth’s, is yet to come.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the lives of women. In the absence of a robust conversation about rights, collective
               biographies of women, or the genre of “women worthies,” as they were called, became
               the primary way of measuring the progress of women. See Murray,
