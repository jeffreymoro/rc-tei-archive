               “The Philosopher and Her Poor: Wollstonecraft, Rancière, and the Rights and Duties
               of Humanity”
               argues that Wollstonecraft asserts rights not as the corrective of localized wrongs
               (and thus the mirror image of the dominant order), but as the necessary correlative
               of duties. By formulating women’s work as duty—a form of rational, voluntary obligation
               that entails reciprocal relations, including rights—Wollstonecraft recasts the ostensibly
               apolitical obligations of women as the <em>actions</em> of the political subjects they already are. By shifting focus from the entitlement
               to rights to the performance of duty,  Wollstonecraft ties rights to the realization
               of one’s human capacities rather than status (wealth, rank, sex, or even humanity
               as mere species membership). She thereby creates the basis for a revolutionary political
               order that does not simply extend the prerogatives of an unjust status quo to new
               claimants but overturns the very structures that disbar women from exercising their
               rights.</p>

                  <p>I take my title from Jacques Rancière’s <em>The Philosopher and his Poor</em>, which asks how those systematically excluded from philosophy and from politics—the
                     poor, the worker, the disenfranchised, the enslaved, what he calls the “non-part”—come
                     to take their rightful part or share in the world.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Rancière, “the poor” includes not just the “economically disadvantaged part of
                              the population,” but also “the people who do not count, who have no entitlement to
                              exercise the power of the archê, none for which they might be counted” (Rancière,
                              “Ten Theses” 32).</span></div>
                     </div> Drawing on the Platonic insistence that no man can have more than one occupation—a
                     shoemaker must only be a shoemaker and nothing more—Rancière shows how the strict
                     division of labor elaborated in Plato’s <em>Republic</em> institutes an unjust order that cancels out the place of the poor, not least by securing
                     the philosopher’s monopoly on thought. By aligning individuals and their purported
                     abilities with fixed roles, this division codifies an essential character—an inalterable
                     identity—that naturalizes a hierarchical order. Indeed, the shoemaker’s labor involves
                     less the production of shoes than the reproduction of that order, for in doing only
                     one thing, “the thing that marks him off and serves to put him in his place,” the
                     shoemaker “does nothing but accredit, even at the cost of lying, the declared lie
                     that puts him in his place” (<em>Philosopher</em> 22, 29).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>If one’s place in the order of things exhausts one’s identity, then there is no surplus,
                              no room to maneuver, no means to reallocate, power, resources, or speech within what
                              Rancière calls the “distribution or partition of the sensible.” On the distribution,
                              see The Politics of Aesthetics, especially pp. 9–45.</span></div>
                     </div> On what terms, Rancière asks, can this declared lie—this fundamental wrong in the
                     construction of the political order—be corrected, enabling those who do not have rights
                     to become subjects able to assert or enact these rights? How “can those whose business
                     is not thinking assume the authority to think and thereby constitute themselves as
                     thinking subjects?” (<em>Philosopher</em> xxvi). How are those excluded from philosophy and from politics to claim a place within
                     the world?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Inasmuch as the exclusion of what Rancière calls the “non-part” from the whole is
                  not a reflection of the political order, but <em>constitutive</em> of it, the question of the poor or the “non-part” is not a challenge to the status
                  quo that arises from the margins; it is intrinsic to the very structure of politics.
                  Setting aside for the moment the slippage between literal and metaphorical uses of
                  poverty in Rancière’s discussion, I want to think about the way questions of right
                  and of rights issue from the wrongful exclusion of certain parties. The unequal distribution
                  of rights in Rancière’s account is “not just the class struggle, internal dissension
                  to be overcome by giving the city its principle of unity”; it is rather “the constitutive
                  wrong or torsion of politics as such” (<em>Disagreement</em> 13, 14). That is, politics is not simply the relations that emerge from an anterior
                  distribution of right (or rights) in a given order; instead, it is the manifestation
                  of a fundamental wrong that unleashes the insurgent efforts of the non-part to take
                  (its) equal part. “The struggle between the rich and the poor is not social reality,
                  which politics then has to deal with,” Rancière contends. “It is the actual institution
                  of politics itself” (<em>Disagreement</em> 11). On these terms, a constitutive wrong is always already internal to our discourses
                  of right.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In what follows, I want to use Rancière to address the way the revolutionary philosopher
                     Mary Wollstonecraft thought about <em>her</em> poor—a group that, in eighteenth-century Britain and its empire, included not only
                     the economically impoverished and the politically disenfranchised, but also women
                     of all ranks, classes, and degrees of power. Like Rancière, Wollstonecraft places
                     wrongs anterior to rights, recognizing how the unequal constitution of the political
                     order comes before and lies behind the injustices done to women. Patriarchal domination
                     is not the unrecognized backdrop in debates over the rights of man, but integral to
                     the political order; women are active participants both in the oppressive status quo
                     and in the revolutionary struggle against it, not passive bystanders upon whom prerogatives
                     may be arbitrarily conferred. The struggle between men and women is not a social reality,
                     which politics then has to deal with, but the actual institution of politics itself.
                     On these terms, the wrongs done to women cannot simply be righted by expanding the
                     numbers included in the status quo (by extending the franchise or giving select women
                     power, for example), because the extension of the prerogatives of an unjust order
                     to new claimants (whether the poor or women) leaves the underlying distribution of
                     power, of visibility, intact. The extension of rights to new claimants will not suffice;
                     the very terms on which rights are understood to exist must change.

                              persons one by one, as Etienne Balibar has pointed out, we are not really working
                              with a universal; instead, we are reinscribing the initial division within an ever-growing
                              class. That is, if human rights start with two individuals made equal and then expand
                              outwards, then we must always grapple with the inequality between the initial two
                              and the rest. See Balibar.</span></div>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In reading Wollstonecraft with (and against) Rancière, I want to consider how his
                     understanding of wrongs can help us grasp the terms of her reclamation of rights.
                     Although gender is not a privileged category of analysis for Rancière (he does not
                     single out women’s oppression as a special case, but treats it as yet another instantiation
                     of injustice), the nigh-universal exclusion of women—half of the human race—from early
                     political theory exemplifies his contention that politics emerge from a fundamental
                     exclusion from the recognized order: an anterior distribution that decides who has
                     power and who does not, who can speak and who can be heard. Enlarging an unjust political
                     order does not produce justice; rather, the very basis for the distribution of rights
                     must be revolutionized. It is for this reason, I argue, that Wollstonecraft asserts
                     rights not as the corrective of localized wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror image
                     of the dominant order), but as the necessary correlative of duties.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“In eighteenth-century British political thought, rights such as freedom of conscience
                              were often paired with duties such as religious tolerance. In such moral pairings,
                              rights were understood as correlative, or reflexive and relational. Such correlative
                              rights served as a kind of practical shorthand for abstract moral principles that
                              defined ethical human relationships and obligations to one another within political
                              communities” (Botting, Wollstonecraft 31).</span></div>
                     </div> By formulating women’s toil as duty—a form of rational, voluntary obligation that
                     entails reciprocal relations, including rights—Wollstonecraft shows how the existing
                     status of women already harbors within it the grounds for women’s title to rights.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Since Wollstonecraft insists that only human beings can have duties, the description
                  of women’s activities as duty also implies a species classification, one that draws
                  women into the compass of the revolutionary rights of man. Indeed, inasmuch as duties
                  as ongoing actions constitute the subject who performs them, they enable new individuals
                  and groups to join the circle of beings who possess what Hannah Arendt calls the “right
                  to have rights,” by making human capacities and actions rather than property or inherited
                  status into the basis for political personhood (<em>Origins</em> 296). Because duty is an ongoing activity intrinsic to the realization of one’s human
                  purpose, the rights with which it is coupled cannot be static possessions that some
                  parties have and others lack. Duty creates what might be called rights-enacting rather
                  than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft to circumvent the sharp division
                  between human and political rights that has bedeviled philosophers from Edmund Burke
                  to Hannah Arendt and Jacques Rancière. In insisting that “rights and duties are inseparable,”
                  Wollstonecraft not only creates a space for those excluded a priori from the rights-bearing
                  community, she also uses duty to reveal that women are <em>already</em> a part of the political order (266). By recasting the ostensibly apolitical obligations
                  of women as the actions of political subjects, Wollstonecraft leverages the performance
                  of duty into a reclamation of rights.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>At first glance, rights play a strangely marginal role in Wollstonecraft’s oeuvre,
                     notwithstanding their titular centrality to both <em>Vindications</em>. Many critics have observed that Wollstonecraft’s emphasis on duty, education, and
                     virtue seems like a deflection from the incendiary question of rights (ask not what
                     you can do for women, but what women can do for you). Eileen Botting points to the
                     fact that the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> features “the term ‘rights’ thirty-two times,” while the word “duties” appears “three
                     times as often” (78); Virginia Sapiro notes that Wollstonecraft’s stress on “virtue”
                     marks her commitment to a civic republican tradition rather than to a Lockean discourse
                     of rights and contract. Barbara Taylor, Susan James, and Sandrine Bergès, among others,
                     have given pride of place to Wollstonecraft’s interest in education, prioritizing
                     interdependence over the autonomy that holds sway over proprietary models of rights.

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>James notes that Wollstonecraft sees “our rights as powers that are created by the
                              institutional and personal relations between many embodied individuals. . . . Locating
                              our rights or powers to act in individuals is a sort of shorthand. . . . If we want
                              to concentrate rights . . . in individual hands . . . we need to start, as Wollstonecraft
                              does, from the recognition of our mutual dependence” (159–60).</span></div>
                     </div> Inasmuch as duty, virtue, and education create rational, moral free agents, they enable
                     women to realize the humanity that makes one a rights-bearing subject. Wollstonecraft’s
                     emphasis on duty places not the bare necessities of life but the exercise of human
                     capacities at the heart of women’s claim to rights.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Wollstonecraft’s commitment to human capacities and obligations as the basis for rights
                  famously pits her against her contemporary Edmund Burke, who derides the “rights of
                  man” as an airy metaphysical abstraction in his <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em>. Rights established through mere human being have no force for Burke. “In proportion
                  as they are metaphysically true,” he asserts, “they are morally or politically false”
                  (153). Custom, property, and reverence for authority—“the super-added ideas, furnished
                  from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns, and the understanding
                  ratifies, as necessary to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature”—secure
                  the political order in Burke’s account. Without these collectively held fictions,
                  “a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal; and an animal
                  not of the highest order” (171). Humanity here is not the basis of a common title
                  to rights, but a residue left when the trappings of rank and tradition have been stripped
                  away.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Wollstonecraft excoriates Burke’s worship of the “demon of property” and the “pestiferous
                     purple” both in her response to the <em>Reflections</em>, the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Men</em>, and in the <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (<em>VRM</em> 9; <em>VRW</em> 87). Devoted to “the unnatural customs, which ignorance and mistaken self-interest
                     have consolidated,” Burke fails to recognize the way inherited privilege and the interests
                     (national and private) of the propertied deform human nature: “The Briton takes the
                     place of the man, and the image of God is lost in the citizen!” (<em>VRM</em> 10, 15). Whereas classical theories of political rights derive the possibility of
                     equality from the supplanting of (unequal, because differently endowed) men by the
                     fictive equality of the person (the man, the citizen), Wollstonecraft argues that
                     the unequal distribution of political personhood introduces inequality within a community

                     </div> In her account, the replacement of the man by the citizen is a self-serving alibi
                     for the degradation of one’s fellows to the status of beasts, as unjust prerogatives
                     blind the privileged to the anterior claims of their fellows: “The man [is] changed
                     into an artificial monster by the station in which he was born” (<em>VRM</em> 10). Burke rates the poor as little better than beasts. “Your respect for rank,” Wollstonecraft
                     rages, “has swallowed up the common feelings of humanity; you seem to consider the
                     poor as only the livestock of an estate, the feather of hereditary nobility” (<em>VRM</em> 17). Lacking the institutions (the state, the law, property) that would enable them
                     to assert rights, the poor are at best entitled to compassion “extorted from a mixed
                     feeling of disgust and animal sympathy” (<em>VRM</em> 11). Like Burke’s denuded queen, that animal “not of the highest order,” the poor
                     are instances of bare shivering humanity, whose defenseless plight substantiates Burke’s
                     claim that the “abstract perfection” of natural rights “is their practical defect,”
                     for such rights can be enforced only “<em>by a power out of themselves</em>” (151).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Burke’s treatise anticipates elements of Hannah Arendt’s influential description of
                  the impotence of human rights in her account of the plight of stateless populations
                  in the wake of World War I (to which, importantly for my purposes, Rancière responds).
                  Indeed, Arendt invokes Burke’s pragmatic insistence that “the rights which we enjoy
                  spring ‘from within the nation’” (<em>Origins</em> 299). Although the inalienable “rights of man” ostensibly require “no special law
                  . . . to protect them because all laws were supposed to rest upon them,” Arendt notes,
                  they cannot uphold themselves (291). Once “human beings lacked their own government
                  and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them
                  and no institution was willing to guarantee them” (292). Nationless refugees thus
                  found themselves reduced to what Arendt famously called “the abstract nakedness of
                  being nothing but human” (300). Stripped of “the protecting mask of a legal personality,”
                  the mere human being is “without rights and duties, . . . outside the range of the
                  law and the body politic of the citizens, as for instance a slave—but certainly a
                  politically irrelevant being” (<em>Revolution</em> 108, 107). On these terms, the human rights granted to refugees and others are, for
                  Arendt, empty—rights in name only, bestowed upon subjects bereft of the powers to
                  wield them.</p>
               <p>The stark division between human and political rights that resides at the heart of
                  Wollstonecraft’s struggle with Burke is likewise central to Rancière’s critique of
                  Arendt’s description of human rights. Both Burke and Arendt see political rights as
                  belonging to specific designated parties (for Burke the king, the propertied, authorities
                  sanctioned by time and tradition; for Arendt citizens, or politically recognized “persons”).
                  Yet if the community of rights-bearers is always already designated, how are the rightless
                  to attain the rights from which they are categorically barred? Both Burke’s and Arendt’s
                  accounts create an impasse in which, as Rancière has contended, “either the rights
                  of the citizen are the rights of man—but the rights of man are the rights of the unpoliticized
                  person; they are the rights of those who have no rights” <em>or</em> “the rights of man are the rights of the citizen . . . [which] means that they are
                  the rights of those who have rights, which amounts to a tautology” (“Who?” 302). To
                  treat only of political rights (or to treat human rights as if they can only be addressed
                  in terms of preexisting political rights) is to accept the terms of a rigged system.
                  That is, by creating a sharp line between the political and the nonpolitical subject,
                  Arendt misrecognizes that it is precisely the drawing of this line—the exclusions
                  made in the very constitution of the political—that is <em>the</em> political question par excellence. How, Rancière asks, can this line be redrawn?</p>
               <p>Rancière uses the human to relitigate this division, leveraging the ability to exercise
                  human capacities to open up an exclusionary order, blurring the thresholds between
                  the political and the nonpolitical, citizen and human. Describing the rights of man
                  in deliberately paradoxical terms as “the rights of those who have not the rights
                  that they have and who have the rights that they have not,” Rancière argues that rights
                  are not “predicates belonging to definite subjects”—nominal possessions that some
                  humans “have” and others do not—but generative principles that entitle their claimants
                  to “a sphere of implementation of these predicates” (302, 303, 303). Rights, that
                  is, create the “opening of an interval for political subjectivization,” in which subjects
                  use rights that they do not (yet) possess (304). This seemingly contradictory formulation
                  creates a kind of no-man’s (no-woman’s) land (or a not-yet-someone’s land) that tests
                  the borders of inclusion and exclusion. In this paradoxical space in which one has
                  and doesn’t have rights at one and the same time, those excluded from the political
                  order can convert themselves from a “non-part” to a part (302).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Inasmuch as “political predicates are open predicates,” Rancière argues, “they open
                     up a dispute about what they exactly entail and whom they concern in which cases”
                     (303). It is apt for my purposes that the example Rancière uses to illustrate this
                     “dispute” is a statement made by another female revolutionary: not Wollstonecraft,
                     but Olympe de Gouges, author of the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Woman</em>, who insisted that “if women are entitled to go to the scaffold, they are entitled
                     to go to the assembly” (303). That the revolutionary government executes women, Rancière
                     points out, reveals that their bare ostensibly apolitical lives are in fact always
                     already political, for if women may be killed by the state, then they are recognized
                     as subjects within it.

                     maternal duty entails what might be deemed the most political act of all: the reproduction

                     “educational in and of themselves” in that they enable women “to view themselves in

                              Each component of Wollstonecraft’s virtue-duty-reason nexus appears to depend upon
                              the others: if, as Wollstonecraft affirms, “every being may become virtuous by the

                     </div> Serving “as the very content and medium of instruction,” human rights spur on the
                     actualization of one’s human being (184). While for Lefebvre, rights anticipate the
                     human subjects who will come to exercise them, duty, I want to argue, offers the means
                     and immediacy of a present enactment, materializing virtue in practice by revealing
                     that the subject is already the being she strives to be. If Rancière’s subjects “have
                     the rights they do not have,” Wollstonecraft’s subjects have the virtue they do not
                     have, realized through the enactment of duty that performs and creates the subjectivity
                     that does not (yet) have rights. Duty thus does not de facto reproduce an oppressive
                     division of labor; it entails forms of self-transformation that alter the very constitution
                     of the political order. On these terms, duty precedes the acknowledgment of rights
                     claims (if not the rights themselves), as humans perform subject-constituting activities
                     in anticipation of legal and philosophical recognition of the human prerogatives they <em>already</em> possess.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Duty creates rights-enacting rather than rights-bearing subjects, enabling Wollstonecraft
                  to get around the sharp division between human and political rights that (as we saw
                  above) Rancière condemns in Arendt’s account. Because duty is an ongoing activity
                  intrinsic to the realization of one’s human purpose, the rights with which it is coupled
                  cannot be static possessions that some parties have and others lack. For Wollstonecraft,
                  capacities and actions rather than property or inherited status thus become the basis
                  for rights. Put another way, neither men nor women “have” rights, for to “have” a
                  right is to operate precisely according to a logic of possession that treats the class
                  of rights-bearers as an already established fact. Instead, women and men <em>perform</em> the duties that show them to be—and enable them to become—rights-enacting subjects.
                  Wollstonecraft thus uses duty to transform rights from something one has or owns into
                  active principles acquired and wielded through virtuous action. As a result, rights
                  may both be gained—and forfeited. As Wollstonecraft points out, those who fail to
                  perform their duty—the idle rich who neglect their moral and political obligations—relinquish
                  their rights: “A right always includes a duty,” Wollstonecraft notes, “and I think
                  it may, likewise, fairly be inferred, that they forfeit the right, who do not fulfill
                  the duty” (<em>VRW</em> 227). Prerogatives exercised without the counterweight of duty, Wollstonecraft insists,
                  are not rights but tyrannical powers.</p>

                  <p>At first glance Wollstonecraft’s insistence on duty may seem to reinstate a sexual

                     shoemaker must stick to his last, so too are Wollstonecraft’s women seemingly enjoined
                     to perform the very duties that trap them in patriarchal structures. Indeed, Wollstonecraft
                     is careful to avoid intimating that she wishes to annihilate women’s customary obligations:
                     “When I treat of the peculiar duties of women, as I should treat of the peculiar duties
                     of a citizen or father, it will be found that I do not mean to insinuate that they
                     should be taken out of their families, speaking of the majority” (<em>VRW</em> 132). Yet by placing women’s duties alongside the obligations of men as citizens and
                     fathers, Wollstonecraft reclassifies women’s domestic labors as themselves political,
                     and throughout the text, she harnesses the performance of domestic duties to a grander
                     trajectory of human self-realization: “Connected with man as daughters, wives, and
                     mothers,” she writes, “their moral character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling
                     these simple duties: but the end, the grand end of their exertions should be to unfold
                     their own faculties and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue” (<em>VRW</em> 95). The duties with which men and women are charged are not outwardly imposed, circumscribed
                     tasks, but subject-constituting activities, driven by an active imperative for human
                     self-realization.

                              unfold their faculties” (VRW 74), and thus have, as Botting puts it, a “duty to develop
                              their moral and intellectual potential as rational creatures of God.” Humanity furnishes
                              a “naturalistic foundation” for rights claims prior to the institution of a social
                              order able to assert normative standards (Wollstonecraft 51, 74). Her version of humanity
                              is grounded in god-given capacities, a theological model that embraces perfectibility
                              in a future orientation.</span></div>

               <p>Although the tasks of individuals may diverge depending on occupation, sex, rank,
                  bodily strength, and skill, the principles that govern duty apply equally to all human
                  beings. “I allow,” Wollstonecraft notes, that women “may have different duties to
                  fulfil; but they are <em>human</em> duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them . . . must
                  be the same” (<em>VRW</em> 120). Notably, Wollstonecraft does not lean on a common “humanity” to justify women’s
                  claims; instead, she treats “the human” as a modifier, a qualifier of an action rather
                  than a noun: these are “<em>human</em> duties”—things that those who are to be considered human do. The humanity that for
                  Wollstonecraft grounds a claim to human rights is not on these terms a simple matter
                  of species belonging (in her account, women are often degraded to the status of prattling
                  creatures, pets, birds). Rather, it involves the acquisition and exercise of reason
                  and virtue (both qualities that distinguish humans from animals) through education
                  and the performance of duty. “Reason,” Wollstonecraft insists, “is absolutely necessary
                  to enable a woman to perform any duty properly,” for “it is a farce to call any being
                  virtuous whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own reason” (<em>VRW</em> 133, 90). Duties are “not the blind impulse of unerring instinct” that drives beasts
                  (<em>VRM</em> 31). It is the knowing performance of a moral obligation that distinguishes duty
                  from slavish toil in obedience to a command.</p>
               <p>Indeed, so fundamental is duty to Wollstonecraft’s understanding of humanity that
                  those who thwart women in performing duties prevent them from realizing their human
                  being, magnifying “their inferiority till women are almost sunk below the standard
                  of rational creatures” and creating the “doubt whether she is a moral agent, or the
                  link which unites men with brutes” (<em>VRW</em> 104). To prevent women from performing their duty is to strip them of the virtue
                  that “can only be acquired by the discharge of relative duties,” reducing them to
                  “mere animals” (<em>VRW</em> 211, 76). It is on these terms, as Lena Halldenius argues, that we can argue that
                  Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindication</em> “is <em>primarily</em> about rights: a right to the circumstances in which we can legitimately be expected
                  to perform the duty of virtue” (
                  “Primacy”
                  80).</p>
               <p>It is because Wollstonecraft wishes for women to have rights in a just order, rather
                  than powers in an unjust one, that she focuses on the reciprocal relationship of rights
                  and duties rather than grounding her arguments for rights solely on the wrongs suffered
                  by women. Whereas Olympe de Gouges uses wrongs to claim rights, as we saw above, Wollstonecraft
                  fears that a claim to rights based on wrongs will reproduce the structural principles
                  that perpetuate injustice: a politics that is premised on wrongs rather than duty
                  cannot escape or revise the structures that have produced an unjust status quo. The
                  reversal of a wrong does not a priori yield a symmetrical right, nor does the negation
                  of one term offer a clear portrait of what its opposite might entail. While correlative
                  theories entail the reflexive relation of rights and duties, the seeming symmetry
                  of rights and wrongs entails a reversal in which the injury defines the nature of
                  the right and the subject called into being is defined through a harm. As Wendy Brown
                  has argued, “ideals of freedom ordinarily emerge to vanquish their imagined immediate
                  enemies, but in this move they frequently recycle and reinstate rather than transform
                  the terms of domination that generated them . . . without addressing the <em>subject constitution that domination effects</em>” (7). Discussions of rights that focus on the adjudication of wrongs recognize only
                  sensibility (a property shared by animals) rather than reason or virtue (human qualities),
                  recapitulating the structural disenfranchisement that casts women as victims (and
                  thus as unqualified to become subjects of rights).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Alleviating suffering palliates the overt injury, while leaving intact the <em>real</em> wrong (the anterior injustice, the lack of right, the underlying exclusion that constructs
                     the political order). Thus, for example, men’s kindness to women, like their “tenderness
                     for their humble dumb domestics,” reflects men’s duty to treat women gently, not an
                     acknowledgement of women’s rights, while charity to the impoverished, Wollstonecraft
                     observes, is condescension, not justice: “If the poor are in distress,” she notes,
                     the rich “will make some benevolent exertions to assist them; they will confer obligations,
                     but not do justice” (<em>VRW</em> 243; <em>VRM</em> 52). Rather than recognizing rights, the empowered confer—indeed, create—obligations.
                     The act of “righting wrongs” thus installs certain parties as “the dispenser[s] of
                     these rights,” as Gayatri Spivak has argued, confirming the existing monopoly on power
                     by upholding the subordination of the weak to the empowered protectors or defenders
                     of rights (524). Women and the poor are invited to feast on the crumbs dropped from
                     the table rather than being offered a spot at it. It is in order to avoid this slippage
                     from justice to benevolence that Wollstonecraft so insistently turns from the disempowering
                     binary of right and wrong to the empowering reciprocity of rights and duties—a slippage
                     also apparent in the elision of human rights and humanitarianism in our own day.

                              the treatment Wollstonecraft advocates for animals. For Wollstonecraft, kindness to
                              animals is a human duty, not an animal right, for the correlative theory of duties
                              and rights does not extend to beasts: “While humans had a duty to respect sentient
                              life,” Botting notes, “animals did not have a corresponding right to be free from
                              abuse by humans.” The claim that something should not be harmed (the recognition that
                              it may be wronged) does not entail rights—nor does it acknowledge the humanity of
                              the victims (Bott…</span></div>

                  <p>Yet Wollstonecraft also cannily exploits this reduction of women to suffering objects
                     in order to vindicate her claims, ruthlessly compelling her reader to follow through
                     on the logic of the present system in an all-or-nothing gambit. If rights and duties
                     are the god-given birthright of <em>all</em> human beings (not concessions made by the dominant class to the poor), the only argument
                     that justifies their denial is the categorical reclassification of the claimant as
                     an animal: “Let women share the rights and she will emulate the virtues of man; for
                     she must [either] grow more perfect when emancipated, or justify the authority that
                     chains such a weak being to her duty.—If the latter, it will be expedient to open
                     a fresh trade with Russia for [the] whips . . . [used by a husband or father to] reign,
                     wielding this scepter, sole master of his house, because he is the only being in it
                     who has reason” (266). Either the work that constitutes women’s duty is the activity
                     of a rational (human) creature, in which case it demands the recognition of rights—or
                     it is not, in which case women should be classed as animals.

                     raises the stakes even higher, exposing the centrality of women’s work to the reproduction
                     of the very order upon which all alike depend.</p>

                     condemns. The line she seeks to draw between elective duty and the rightless toil
                     that reduces women to beasts of burden presupposes an independence from necessity
                     that allows tasks to be freely chosen—a version of work largely unavailable to the
                     poor. Wollstonecraft’s celebration of the dignity of duty obscures the imperatives
                     that constrain actual labor and the ways unremitting toil degrades the worker, male
                     and female alike. Indeed, even as Wollstonecraft turns “impatiently to the poor, to
                     look for man undebauched by riches or power,” she discovers that privation and a lack
                     of education have left him “scarcely above the brutes, over which he tyrannized; a
                     broken spirit, worn- out body, and all those gross vices which the example of the
                     rich, rudely copied, could produce” (<em>VRM</em> 58). Hard labor proves to be a material impediment to reflection or to revolutionary
                     critique: “The vulgar have not the power of emptying their mind of the only ideas
                     they imbibed whilst their hands were employed” (<em>VRM</em> 16–17). Unable to attain the disinterested stance of the philosopher necessary to
                     critique the system, the “vulgar” swallow ideas decanted into them from above. The
                     theoretical tools required to dismantle the master’s house cannot be fashioned by
                     the poor themselves. Wollstonecraft’s theory, like that of Rancière’s philosopher,

                     might claim beyond the rights and duties Wollstonecraft stakes out—an open question.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">For Rancière, “the poor” includes not just the “economically disadvantaged part of
               the population,” but also “the people who do not count, who have no entitlement to
               exercise the power of the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">archê</span>, none for which they might be counted” (Rancière, “Ten Theses” 32).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">If one’s place in the order of things exhausts one’s identity, then there is no surplus,
               no room to maneuver, no means to reallocate, power, resources, or speech within what
               Rancière calls the “distribution or partition of the sensible.” On the distribution,
               see <em>The Politics of Aesthetics</em>, especially pp. 9–45.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">When we attribute rights to certain individuals, and then enlarge the sphere of rights-bearing
               persons one by one, as Etienne Balibar has pointed out, we are not really working
               with a universal; instead, we are reinscribing the initial division within an ever-growing
               class. That is, if human rights start with two individuals made equal and then expand
               outwards, then we must always grapple with the inequality between the initial two
               and the rest. See Balibar.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">“In eighteenth-century British political thought, rights such as freedom of conscience
               were often paired with duties such as religious tolerance. In such moral pairings,
               rights were understood as correlative, or reflexive and relational. Such correlative
               rights served as a kind of practical shorthand for abstract moral principles that
               defined ethical human relationships and obligations to one another within political
               communities” (Botting, <em>Wollstonecraft</em> 31).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">James notes that Wollstonecraft sees “our rights as powers that are created by the
               institutional and personal relations between many embodied individuals. . . . Locating
               our rights or powers to act in individuals is a sort of shorthand. . . . If we want
               to concentrate rights . . . in individual hands . . . we need to start, as Wollstonecraft
               does, from the recognition of our mutual dependence” (159–60).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">For Arendt, “we are not born equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength
               of our decision to guarantee ourselves mutually equal rights” (Arendt 301).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">It is worth noting that Arendt registers this argument in <em>Origins</em>. Stateless people are deprived of legality in a way that leaves them worse off than
               criminals: “It seems to be easier to deprive a completely innocent person of legality
               than someone who has committed an offence. . . . The deprivation of legality, <em>i.e.</em>, of <em>all</em> rights, no longer has a connection with specific crimes” (295). Wollstonecraft notes
               that women are “denied all political privileges, and [are] not allowed, as married
               women, excepting in criminal cases, a civil existence” (<em>VRW</em> 256). The law only acts to protect women when the violation is materialized as physical
               violence: “The laws of this country—if women have a country—afford her no protection
               or redress from the oppressor, unless she has the plea of bodily fear” (<em>Maria</em> 92).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Wollstonecraft recognizes the connection between sexual and economic oppression, even
               as she distinguishes between them. Lena Halldenius argues that what distinguishes
               the oppressed state of women from that of the poor for Wollstonecraft is not any intrinsic
               difference in their oppression, but the addition of “a ‘false morality’ identifying
               a woman’s virtue with subjugation and passivity” (Halldenius, 
               “Primacy”
               78).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">On Wollstonecraft and maternal duty, see Sapiro, 154–61. Wollstonecraft states that
               women’s first duty is “to themselves as rational creatures, and the next, in point
               of importance, as citizens, is that, which includes so many, of a mother” (VRW 216).
               If duty is a form of subject-constituting labor that for women involves the reproduction
               of others, to what degree is that labor absorbed by the self? Wollstonecraft’s model
               of maternal duty intersects with questions of property and the rights understood to
               issue from such claims. In a 1794 letter, Wollstonecraft uses Locke’s model of labor
               to stake a claim to women’s propriety over children: “Considering the care and anxiety
               a woman must have about a child before it comes into the world, it seems to me, by
               a <em>natural right</em>, to belong to her” (qtd. in Sapiro 157). Yet Wollstonecraft elsewhere pits herself
               against Lockean models of ownership as the basis for rights, as Lena Halldenius has
               argued, questioning the assimilation of the fruits of workers’ labor into the masters’
               property and—by extension—the notion that parental labor grants similar rights over
               children (
               “Feminist Critique”
               ).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">She thereby changes the basis for rights claims so as to circumvent what Wendy Brown
               describes as one of the key paradoxes of rights. Since masculinist rights discourse
               “presumes an ontologically autonomous, self-sufficient, unencumbered subject,” Brown
               argues, early feminists like Wollstonecraft “were arguing for something that could
               not be produced without simultaneously demanding a transformation in the nature of
               what they were arguing for, namely, the ‘rights of man’ for women. . . . Women both
               require access to the existence of this fictional subject and are systematically excluded
               from it by the gendered terms of liberalism” (431).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">Lefebvre’s account affords a way out of the circular logic that haunts Wollstonecraft’s
               text, in which the realization of subjectivity can start to seem like a form of autopoeisis.
               Each component of Wollstonecraft’s virtue-duty-reason nexus appears to depend upon
               the others: if, as Wollstonecraft affirms, “every being may become virtuous by the
               exercise of its own reason,” but virtue depends upon duty, and duty requires reason,
               what comes first (<em>VRW</em> 90)? In order to escape from this circular logic, Wollstonecraft construes politics
               not as a sphere but as a process by which subjects are constituted in an ongoing fashion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">12. </span><span class="noteBody">Women are “human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed upon this earth to
               unfold their faculties” (<em>VRW</em> 74), and thus have, as Botting puts it, a “duty to develop their moral and intellectual
               potential as rational creatures of God.” Humanity furnishes a “naturalistic foundation”
               for rights claims prior to the institution of a social order able to assert normative
               standards (<em>Wollstonecraft</em> 51, 74). Her version of humanity is grounded in god-given capacities, a theological
               model that embraces perfectibility in a future orientation.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">Indeed, the compassionate treatment of women or the poor is distressingly close to
               the treatment Wollstonecraft advocates for animals. For Wollstonecraft, kindness to
               animals is a human duty, not an animal right, for the correlative theory of duties
               and rights does not extend to beasts: “While humans had a duty to respect sentient
               life,” Botting notes, “animals did not have a corresponding right to be free from
               abuse by humans.” The claim that something should not be harmed (the recognition that
               it may be wronged) does not entail rights—nor does it acknowledge the humanity of
               the victims (Botting, 
               “Mary Wollstonecraft”
               94). On Wollstonecraft’s view of the human distinction from animals, see Ruston 28–62
               and Seeber; on Wollstonecraft and slavery, see Brace.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">14. </span><span class="noteBody">“Should it appear,” Wollstonecraft observes, “that like the brutes, [women] were principally
               created for the use of man, he will let them patiently bite the bridle, or should
               their rationality be proved he will not impede their improvement merely to gratify
               his sexual appetites” (104).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15. </span><span class="noteBody">“If you do not respect people’s rights,” as Halldenius puts it, “you are not entitled
               to expect them to perform duties, for the simple reason that they do not have any”
               (
               “Primacy”
               90). By grounding rights not in property but human reason, she allows the excluded
               to accede to the title; her emphasis on education offers us a subject that doesn’t
               already exist but can come to be.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">16. </span><span class="noteBody">In a material sense, eighteenth-century Englishwomen of course could not readily become
               shoemakers, which is one of the reasons Wollstonecraft gives such centrality to women’s
               right to work, on the one hand, and to the right to keep the fruit of one’s labors
               as opposed to property, on the other. “A man with half my industry, and, I may say,
               abilities, could have procured a decent livelihood, and discharged some of the duties
               which knit mankind together,” the abused servant Jemima charges in <em>Maria</em>, “whilst I, who had acquired a taste for the rational, nay, in honest pride let me
               assert it, the virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast aside as the filth of society”
               (49). The capacity to support oneself here becomes the basis for belonging to the
               social and political community. Deprived of the ability to work, Jemima cannot gain
               the basic necessities required to perform her civic duty.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">The uneasy relation Wollstonecraft takes to “the poor” on whose behalf she (intermittently)
               speaks is evident in her pronoun usage throughout the <em>Vindication</em>, where she shifts from the first person “I” to an inclusive “we” to a third-person
               characterization of women. If at times she identifies herself as a woman (“my own
               sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures”), at others
               she separates herself from the disenfranchised category of “woman” she claims to represent
               (“I do not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves”) (<em>VRW</em> 75, 131). The economically impoverished—the literal rather than the metaphorical
               poor—are described by Wollstonecraft in the third person, typically en masse as the
               collective poor. Wollstonecraft’s philosophical voice thus claims a monopoly on discourse,
               reinscribing the fundamental political wrong that excludes the non-part from its rightful
               place.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
