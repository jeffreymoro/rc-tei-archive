                <p rend="noCount"><emph>As a professional Romanticist, I’ve spent time swimming in pools—lakes, ponds—of melancholy and loss. In 
                    this liquid milieu, I learned about tears and thoughts too deep for tears. Lately though, I find myself in a 
                    more desiccated landscape, lit with fiery rage. When I was young, feelings of sorrow and rage converged; it 
                    seemed to me all one terrain. The girl cried while fighting; she fought while crying. Now I stare at the 
                    response emoji on Facebook where a face wet with tears sits apart from one burning with anger, each a distinct 
                    emotional ecosystem. In these heydays of chaos, can’t we find ways to hold together tears and anger, water and 
                    fire?</emph></p>
                <p>Part of this question I borrow from Stanley Cavell, as he considers “the unknown woman” of Hollywood melodramas 
                    of the ’30s and 40s. Are we up to, he wonders, have we forms of intelligibility strong enough to match “the 
                    heydays of chaos reaching our ears?” (Cavell 45). For Cavell, the heroine of melodrama presents one such form. 
                    She figures a specific kind of unknown-ness, he writes, in which she appears “powerless to make [herself] known,” 
                    because in the current world she remains unwelcome on her own terms. Equally unheard on her own terms, this 
                    misfit inhabits extreme states of structural “voicelessness,” an incomprehension or suppression of her voice that 
                    can amount to “suffocation” (43). In the isolation which attends the voicelessness of the heroine of melodrama, 
                    Cavell discovers the source of her critical power, “her ability to judge the world” (16). In addition to the 
                    unknown woman, other features distinguish these melodramas: conversation brought to an impasse (particularly 
                    between woman and man); a past that has been “frozen, mysterious, with topics forbidden”; and “the negation of 
                    marriage itself,” especially “marriage as a route to creation” and happiness (6).<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">All these features mark the two literary texts that motivate this essay, Mary 
                        Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written during a Short Residence</title> and Sophocles’ 
                        <title level="m">Antigone.</title></note> But it is most pointedly in the theatrical, excessive, desperate, 
                    and, I would add, often lyrical expression of a woman’s suffocating voicelessness that we find the possibility 
                    of alternate, alien forms of intelligibility, forms strong enough perhaps to match our own heydays of 
                    chaos.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Structural madness” is Cavell’s useful characterization of this woman’s 
                        position.</note></p>

                    </figure>
                <p>The melodrama of the unknown woman is for Cavell an avenue to philosophy itself (“the opening knowledge of the 
                    human is conceived as the experience of being unknown”), its gendered politics muted though not absolutely 
                    unvoiced (22).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In her <title level="a">Reply to Cavell</title> and 
                        <title level="m">Feminism Without Women</title>, Modleski offers an early feminist critique of Cavell’s 
                        treatment of film melodrama. He responds to her charges in <title level="m">Contesting Tears</title> (30–37) 
                        even as he admits his “repeated reluctance to attempt to catch the tide of debate on this issue of gender” 
                        (30).</note> Several feminist thinkers have effectively bent Cavell’s insights toward a consideration of 
                    modern feminism, itself often unwelcome and unheard on its own terms. Like Cavell they discover surprising 
                    resources embedded in melodrama. Lauren Berlant, Sara Ahmed, and others have pinpointed the melodramatic “female 
                    complaint,” “feminist killjoy,” and “affect alien” as agents of feminist and queer critique. To resist “getting 
                    along,” to refuse to “move on” or align with conventional notions of progress and happiness serves, in Ahmed’s 
                    words, to “expose the bad feelings that get hidden, displaced, or negated”—and consequently unknown—“under public 
                    signs of joy.” If one recognizes “the objects that promise happiness to be not quite so promising,” a coincident 
                    sadness and anger may leap forth (Ahmed 38–39). Melodrama relies on those angrily sad and sadly angry ones who, in 
                    Ahmed’s terms, are “prepared to kill some forms of joy”— even if it requires, in some cases, killing themselves 
                    (50).</p>
                  <figure rend="rightFloat">

                <p>These concerns—of sorrow as anger, of voicelessness as voices unheard—and the forms for their intelligibility all  
                    meet in Mary Wollstonecraft’s last finished work, the remarkable <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short 
                        Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</title> (1796). The same concerns motivate Bonnie Honig’s revisionary 
                    reading of Sophocles’ <title level="m">Antigone</title> for contemporary feminist political theory. Approaching 
                    the <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title> as Honig approaches <title 
                        level="m">Antigone</title>, through the lens of melodrama, makes intelligible feminist possibilities in 
                    Wollstonecraft’s most plaintive—and, I would suggest, quite angry—work, composed between her two attempts at 
                    suicide. When we place Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written</title> alongside recent feminist work 
                    on <title level="m">Antigone</title>, we begin to hear what is unvoiced or barely voiced in her writing. We discover 
                    a vital and timely feminist poetics.</p>
                    
                <p>In turning to <title level="m">Antigone</title>, feminist scholars add a question prior to the one concerning forms 
                    of intelligibility: do we have ears disposed to catch the un- or under-known, the un- or under-voiced? When 
                    Sophocles’ heroine reflects, “I’m a strange new kind of in-between thing, aren’t I? / Not at home with the dead or 
                    the living,” the Theban Chorus refuses to hear her: “You’re too extreme / you reckless girl” (Sophocles 39). When 
                    Wollstonecraft, writing to Gilbert Imlay after her first suicide attempt, writes: "I . . . seem to have no home, 
                    no resting place to look to—I am strangely cast off," is she also too extreme? Is he even listening? (<title 
                        level="m">Works</title> 6:426–27). Wollstonecraft rewrote this and other letters from her travels in Scandinavia 
                    for the published <title level="m">Letters Written</title>. Even after reclaiming her letters, though, her 
                    questions persist: “Life, what art thou? Where goes this breath? this I, so much alive?” (6:279). How much does 
                    her reader hear in that cry?</p>

                    <p>It may be a perverse thought, that a feminism derived from Sophocles’ <title level="m">Antigone</title> can teach 
                    us something about Wollstonecraft. I want to pursue that thought, and also reverse it, so that we find 
                    Wollstonecraft shaping the reception of a feminist Antigone. Investigation suggests the story of Antigone had 
                    no direct influence on Wollstonecraft. In his sweeping survey, <title level="m">Antigones: How the Antigone Legend 
                        Has Endured in Western Literature, Art, and Thought</title>, 
                    George Steiner dates the start of the “Antigone vogue” almost exactly to the time of Wollstonecraft’s death. He 
                    muses that she, Jeanne Manon Roland, and Germaine de Stael share a “resonance” that anticipates Antigone’s 
                    subsequent Romantic appeal (Steiner 7, 10). Whether <title level="m">Antigone</title> “resonated” with 
                    Wollstonecraft, whether she read or saw the play, remains unknown. A student of the philosophical travelogue, 
                    she very probably read Barthélemy’s popular <title level="m">Travels of Anacharsis the Younger</title> (1788), 
                    where, after watching Sophocles’ tragedy performed, Anacharsis stands exhausted: “I had no more tears to shed” 
                    (qtd. in Steiner 7).<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="j">The Analytical Review</title>, where 
                        Wollstonecraft often published, noted with joy the election of Barthélemy, “the author of Anarcharsis,” 
                        “a man of letters, of genius, of sublime views” to the French Directorate. <title level="a">National 
                            Affairs,</title> vol. 25, no. 6, Jun. 1797, 668.</note> Steiner finds this dehydrated “seminal 
                    passage . . .  echoed” by Antigone’s male admirers throughout the nineteenth century (7). We know that 
                    <title level="m">Antigone</title> captivated German philosophers and poets circa 1800, that Wollstonecraft’s 
                    son-in-law Percy Shelley later confessed his adoration for the play’s “godlike victim” (“Some of us,” he wrote, 
                    “have in a prior existence been in love with an Antigone”); and we know, thanks to Yopie Prins, that Antigone was 
                    an alluring figure for later “women of Greek Letters” (qtd. in Steiner 10; Prins 234–36). Yet in eighteenth-century 
                    literary circles, Antigone remained a minor character, seldom on stage and celebrated primarily as devoted daughter 
                    or star-crossed lover, with no signal appeal for women intellectuals. That Antigone had little appeal, found no 
                    audience, accords with a point she makes herself: “O reaches of the plains of Thebes,” she complains, “no one sheds 
                    a tear for me” (Sophocles 39). Wollstonecraft makes a similar cry, near the close of her <title 
                        level="m">Letters</title>, “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted tear!’” (6:344). 
                    This last, perplexing cry will return later, but for now it tells that the legacy of Wollstonecraft, like that 
                    of Antigone, is tied up with the limits not just of intelligibility, but also of tears: a melodramatic 
                    legacy.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Horrocks’ edition points out that this line echoes a line from 
                        <title level="m">Mary, A Fiction</title>: “Forgetting her own griefs, she gave the world a much indebted

                <p>In addition to the apparent anachronism of my pairing, there is the generic mismatch of a figure from classical 
                    tragedy with an epistolary first-person narrator. Antigone: tragic, timeless, defiant even of worldly time. 
                    Wollstonecraft’s traveler: subject to a historical moment she strains to transcend. Her persona—a single mother 
                    traveling alone after a period of emotional duress, writing to an unresponsive “you”—appears ripe for film 
                    melodrama, uncannily like the anonymous woman in Max Ophuls’ <title level="m">Letter from an Unknown Woman</title> 
                    or Charlotte Vane in <title level="m">Now Voyager</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Berlant on travel

                        (81–114, 115–50).</note> Despite generic discrepancies, though, Antigone and Wollstonecraft do both serve as 
                    icons for Western feminism: person and persona, melodramatic and tragic, larger than life. It’s worth recalling 
                    Lacan’s thought that the “figure of Antigone forms part of our [i.e., Western] morality” whether we know it or 
                    not; worth recalling too is Honig’s conviction that “the idea that we [in the West] could . . . think politically 
                    in ways untouched by [Antigone] is as improbable as Oedipus’s hope that he could . . . live out his life . . . 
                    untouched by fate” (Lacan 284; Honig 37). By these accounts, any feminist politics or moral philosophy 
                    <emph>must</emph> be touched by Antigone. Lacan’s thought and Honig’s conviction suggest a Wollstonecraft—and 
                    a feminism—inevitably touched by tragedy, myth, and fatalism. They suggest consequently the touch of 
                    timelessness brushing against any feminism living in time.</p>
                <p>But what of the inverse, the conviction that Wollstonecraft’s Romantic feminism, a feminism <emph>in time</emph>, 
                    touches on myth? Or that Antigone cannot be understood without Wollstonecraft?<note place="foot" 
                        resp="editors">Cecilia Sjöholm pivots from Hegel’s reading of Antigone to the feminist ethics of 
                        Wollstonecraft’s writings in order to investigate Antigone’s role in “the invention of feminine desire” 
                        (Sjöholm 14–27).</note> When Steiner remarks that the “life” of Wollstonecraft “resonates” with the figure 
                    of Antigone elevated by nineteenth-century writers, he implies that Wollstonecraft forecasts the image of 
                    Antigone forged by Schiller, Hegel, and subsequent writers: a modern Antigone “emblematic of a programme of 
                    feminine emancipation and political parity” (Steiner 9–10). If, for instance, one considers Antigone from the 
                    angle of Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written</title>, striking correlations appear. Neither woman 
                    “knows her place”: they insist on venturing outside the walls of domestic space. Both stand—scandalously—outside 
                    the institution of marriage. Both provoke comment that they speak like men. Both women find themselves in a 
                    landscape riven by war and death. Isolated by grief, each announces her grievances against the gendered lifeworld 
                    that surrounds her, a lifeworld that hardly responds. Each obsesses about confinement, suffocation, and being shut 
                    up. Each identifies repeatedly with birds and other creatures with wings.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Birds 
                        are a persistent motif in <title level="m">Antigone</title>. Wollstonecraft invokes “wings” nine times in

                    repeatedly, their time. And each one attempts to take her life.</p>
                <p>With these resonances in mind, one can begin to see how, marked by the limits of gender, by suicide and mourning, 
                    the tragedy of <title level="m">Antigone</title> and Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Letters Written During a

                <p>Sophocles’ tragedy opens at dawn, with Antigone trying to recruit her sister Ismene’s help in burying their 
                    brother Polyneikes. Their uncle Kreon, ruler of Thebes, has commanded that Polyneikes’ corpse remain unburied 
                    and dishonored, carrion for the birds that circle beyond the walls of the city. When Ismene balks, Antigone 
                    grows scornful. The scene ends with Antigone rebuking her sister: “I would not take your help now if you asked 
                    me” and with Ismene offering this blessing: “Go then but know / although you go without your mind / you go as

                <p>Soon afterward a sentry reports to Kreon that Polyneikes’ corpse has been mysteriously covered with dust; later, 
                    guards catch Antigone trying to re-cover it. Kreon sentences his rebellious niece to be buried alive. Ismene 
                    begs to join her; Antigone declines the offer: “Take heart and live, Ismene / my soul died long ago” (30). In 
                    an extended dirge for herself, Antigone names her prison in terms that reduce a woman’s life to one claustral 
                    spot: “O tomb / O bridal chamber / O house in the ground forever” (40). She is to be shut up, “bastilled . . . for 
                    life,” to quote Wollstonecraft’s <title level="m">Maria</title> (<title level="m">Works</title>

                    does Ismene, last of the children of Oedipus and Jocasta. Beside himself with grief as the play ends, the ruler 
                    speaks of himself in the third person: “Kreon no more exists than someone who does not exist” (Sophocles 54).</p>

                <p>For recent feminist thinkers, <title level="m">Antigone</title> plays a crucial role.<note place="foot" 
                    resp="editors">Walsh provides an excellent survey of recent feminist engagement with <title 
                        level="m">Antigone</title> in criticism and performance. Feminist classicists especially, in the words of 
                    Page Dubois, seek a more “heterogeneous, unstable, polymorphous kind of reading” of Greek tragedy (qtd. in 
                    Walsh 7).</note> Twice Judith Butler reflects on the play, in readings that respond to the last two centuries 
                    of Western philosophical inquiry. Like her predecessors, Butler emphasizes Antigone’s defense of the burial of 
                    her brother. But <title level="m">Antigone’s Claim</title> (2000) also presents the heroine as the daughter of 
                    incest who loves her dead, traitorous brother in excess of law, contesting thereby the assumed interdependency 
                    of laws of kinship and laws of state. Antigone’s words, by which the monstrously “unspeakable nevertheless 
                    makes itself heard,” are governed, Butler proposes, by catachresis, the rhetorical figure or intelligible form 
                    which “exploit[s] the very terms . . . meant to enforce its silence”: voicelessness voiced (<title 
                        level="m">Claim</title> 78; also 82). In <title level="m">Precarious Life</title> (2004), written in the 
                    early years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Butler again recommends Antigone, this time as a model for mourning 
                    that crosses the lines of enmity and amity, private and public, life and death. “Risking death herself to bury 
                    her brother against the edict of Creon,” this latter Antigone “exemplifies the political risks in defying the 
                    ban against public grief” (<title level="m">Precarious</title> 46). (Like others, Butler mutes Antigone’s 
                    suicide.)<note place="foot" resp="editors"><title level="m">Home Fire: A Novel</title>, Kamila Shamsie’s 2017 
                        fictional adaptation and update of <title level="m">Antigone</title>, treats the suicide at length—a 
                        rarity.</note> Antigone’s classical status—that is, her felt timelessness—strengthens Butler’s claims for 
                    a general sense of shared mortality, as Keri Walsh has argued. Antigone secures an eternal return to the end 
                    of human life: as it has been, so it will be, ever-endingly.</p>
                <p>Butler’s meditations on mourning lean heavily on the expression I used to describe Kreon: “beside himself.” To 
                    be “<emph>beside oneself</emph> with rage or grief”—Butler binds the two emotions—is to be <emph>ecstatic</emph>, 
                    she explains (<title level="m">Precarious</title> 24). Ecstasy supplants catachresis as the chosen form of 
                    intelligibility.<note place="foot" resp="editors">It hints too at the Dionysian rituals surrounding Athenian 
                        tragedy, performed just outside, “beside,” the Agora, the space of democratic debate (Loraux 24–25).</note> 
                    Though she associates a politics of ecstasy with “the feminist and lesbian/gay movements” of previous decades, 
                    Butler muses that perhaps such being beside oneself is “more persistent . . . maybe it is with us all along” 
                    (24). Maybe it is classic rather than historical. Here Butler finds the source of community: “Despite our 
                    differences in location and history,” she remarks, “Loss has made a tenuous ‘we’ of us all” (20).</p>
                <p>On this account, neither “I” nor “we” have much choice about loss; being exposed happens inevitably—a 
                    circumstance that puts us within the ambit of tragedy. Butler accepts that “any narrative of personal 
                    grief <emph>would have to be</emph> a story in which the very ‘I’ who seeks to tell the story is stopped in 
                    the midst of the telling; the very ‘I’ is called into question by its relation to the Other (23; emphasis 
                    added). Such acute self-consciousness echoes Kreon, the ruler, at the end of the tragedy. Beside himself with 
                    grief, “seeking refuge from sovereignty,” he acknowledges the flimsiness of “I”: “Take Kreon away / he no more 
                    exists than someone who does not exist” (Honig 89; Sophocles 54).</p>

                    </figure>
                <p>Via tragedy, Butler cultivates the timelessness of loss for the ecstatic state it discloses, a state that was 
                    there all along. It must inevitably overwhelm each living “I,” inviting it to become larger than life, more 
                    self-consciously mortal yet more ecstatically—in grief, in rage—beside itself with others, living or dead (the 
                    distinction hardly matters). But Antigone does not share this welcome fatality; Kreon does. Yes, Antigone buries 
                    her outlaw brother. Yes, she embraces the dead as she heads toward death. But the wailing lament she delivers is 
                    for herself. Voiced proleptically before she dies, staged before the chorus, her dirge protests the sentence of 
                    death and calls down vengeance. If Antigone claims timelessness, she does so by defiantly taking time for 
                    herself. She leaves not on Kreon’s terms or timetable, immured in a cave, waiting to suffocate. She refuses that 
                    fatal air. Instead she takes her own life, stealing the sovereign prerogative. Coming halfway through the play, 
                    her suicide does not fulfill tragedy. Her chosen mode of death is not inevitable.</p>
                <p>There is losing, and there is also taking. “Take heart,” she instructs her sister, “and live” (30).</p></div>

                <p>My reading of Butler’s Antigone is prompted by <title level="m">Antigone, Interrupted</title> (2013), written by 
                    feminist political theorist Bonnie Honig. In part a response to <title level="m">Precarious Life</title>, 
                    Honig’s book cautions against the pull of “precarity” for at least two reasons. First, because ecstatic grief 
                    risks blunting anger. In undoing sovereign power, that is, grief can undo the contestation necessary to a vital 
                    politics.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Butler offers her reflections as “beside” argumentation (<title 
                        level="m">Precarious Life</title> 19, 24–25).</note> Second, Honig questions a humanism and feminism defined 
                    by fatality rather than natality. She cites Hannah Arendt’s <title level="m">The Human Condition</title> to claim 
                    that being mortal “does not mean that we are born to die.” By extension, “the fact that we grieve does not mean 
                    that grief and grievability should be the center of our politics” (Honig 119–20). Honig could have recruited 
                    Luce Irigaray as well, whose most recent reflections center on Antigone’s devotion to a cosmically full life-world, 
                    where the burial of corpses is an act of ecological responsibility. For Irigaray, “The supreme value for 
                    [Antigone] is life. No other value can substitute for it: no abstract ideal, no truth or absolute” 
                    (Irigaray 9).</p>
                <p>In the light of natality, Honig recasts Butler’s ecstatic grief into fierce, combative grievance. “<emph>To 
                    grieve</emph>,” she reminds us, “is both extra-political . . . and fundamentally political” in often 
                    uncomfortable ways. “The term connotes mourning, resistance to injustice, reification of wrong and,” she adds, 
                    “vengeance for it.” Grievance actively “takes sides” (120). Such grievance ripples the surface, for instance, 
                    when Wollstonecraft warns her reader, “I am sad . . . and have cause” (6:331).</p>
                    <figure rend="leftFloat">

                    </figure>
                <p>Within this layered sense of grievance in Sophocles’ drama, Honig finds active conspiracy. She asks us to hear 
                    the link between <emph>conspire</emph> and <emph>aspire</emph> (perhaps <emph>inspire</emph> and 
                    <emph>respire</emph> as well): a shared breath of possibility (91). Conspiracy can offer a “mechanism of change” 
                    within overpowering systems and structures. Partaking of both sovereignty and vulnerability, conspiracy gives 
                    us “both more and less agency than we think,” Honig argues (88). Attending to conspiracy, moreover, swings the 
                    weight of the play away from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">agon</foreign> of Kreon-Antigone to more intricate, 
                    lateral relationships between the sisters, Chorus, soldiers, audience, and utterances of the play 
                    (88).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Katie Fleming probes the ways Sophocles’ tragedy has been performed 
                        in “complicit[y] with fascism” (Fleming 169). Honig implies that collaboration and complicity have no 
                        inherent ideological bent.</note> Antigone’s initial effort to conspire with her sister appears to fail, 
                    but Honig suggests both women learn as they go, growing more subtle and successful as they conspire (aspire, 
                    inspire) with language and with others. A similar trajectory marks Wollstonecraft’s <title

                    how different audiences will understand the same locution” (Burton). Examples 
                    in the play abound, including the last exchange between Ismene and Antigone, a delicate dance performed before 
                    their uncle.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Honig argues that Ismene was responsible for the “first burial”

                        Written During a Short Residence</title>. “Words that Kreon hears as mere self-indulgent lamentation,” a 
                    grieving that “goes on” too long, Honig explains, are simultaneously “seeking, soliciting, constituting publics 
                    elsewhere” (Honig 90; Sophocles 40). This is one form of grievance available to these women: openly sorrowing, 
                    covertly inciting.<note place="foot" resp="editors">A notorious crux in her speech, for instance, cites a tale

                        122–29.</note> Complaints deemed “too extreme” and dismissed by one audience may be cultivating other 
                    audiences: this happens when Wollstonecraft revises and then publishes her letters to Imlay, activating 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> each time she addresses “you,” her variously constituted readers.</p>
                <p>In its untimely conspiracy with language, the heroine’s voice refuses a place within what Honig calls “an economy 
                    of citizenship that domesticates”—which is to say, entombs and suffocates—“desire, longing, pain and loss” (122; 
                    also 135). Think of <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> as one weapon in the heroine’s arsenal of 
                    excess—talking too much, borrowing without permission, reaching out beyond her immediate audience, taking what 
                    is not hers, airing grievance—in a situation defined by rigid economies of time and money, as Carson’s

                <div type="section">
                <p>Both Butler and Honig borrow from the work of feminist classicist Nicole Loraux, whose account of the mourning 
                    voice in classical Greek tragedy upends traditional scholarship. In distinction from the rhetorical forms that 
                    hold Honig and Butler, Loraux attends to poetics. In particular her discussion of the adverb for always—<foreign 
                        xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>—discloses yet another form of intelligibility where sorrow and anger fuse. By 
                    focusing on the moments when Antigone forsakes the time of the present for the timelessness of <emph>always</emph>, 
                    we can detect the feminist implications of Loraux’s insights.</p>
                <p>In ancient Greek, the value of always—<foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>—typically aligns with a vital force 
                    constantly regenerating itself. Émile Benveniste characterizes it as “transitory and permanent, running out and 
                    being reborn in the course of generations . . . subsisting forever in its <emph>endlessly beginning</emph> 
                    finitude” (qtd. in Loraux 28; emphasis added). We might think of it as the flip-side to Butler’s ever-ending 
                    mortality. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Aei</foreign> usually signifies an <emph>always</emph> in time and full of 
                    time (<foreign xml:lang="la">saecula saeculorum</foreign>), derived from human measure, specifically the cycles 
                    of human generation. Designating a regularly renewing identity that overrides superficial alterations, the 
                    adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> helps secure the ongoingness of an autochthonous State. It may be 
                    familiar to us as the <emph>always</emph> of Burkean tradition (“always acting as if in the presence of 
                    canonized forefathers”) or the permanence of the classics, or even as an ever-regenerating Romanticism (Burke 
                    102). Yet in her very name, Antigone (<emph>anti</emph> [against]—<emph>gone</emph> [birth, offspring]) 
                    protests this sort of <emph>always</emph>. For her part, Wollstonecraft in the <title level="m">Letters 
                        Written</title> famously imagines an end to human ongoingness, a time “when the earth could no longer 
                    support [man]. Where was he to fly from universal famine? . . . The world appeared a vast prison” 
                    (102).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Juengel and Seiler-Smith have helped me appreciate this

                <p>Loraux calls attention though to a mutant version of <emph>always</emph> alive in the tragedies, especially 
                    Sophocles’. There the adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> “does not belong to [humans]” but to the 
                    atemporality of gods immune to death. It attaches particularly to passion and obsession, to madness, or, in 
                    Antigone’s case, to what Loraux designates as a “rigid indeterminability” (or unendingness) for which her world 
                    has no terms (31). Protagonists like Antigone export their grieving outside the strictures of state law to the 
                    timeless realm of this other <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>. Their “passion <emph>lives</emph> by 
                    claiming for itself <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>, always, as its temporality” (32; emphasis added). 
                    Loraux’s choice of verb accentuates the implication: the interminable griever grabs at a mode of life untethered 
                    to generation, mortality, or fatality. In the tragedies <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> issues “a repetitive 
                        de-negation” of “man’s destiny as mortal,” as “made of death” (34). Such grieving flies against the Greek 
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">polis</foreign> and its monopoly on <emph>always</emph>.<note place="foot" 
                            resp="editors">Irigaray makes a parallel distinction between Antigone’s devotion to generation (of life) 
                            as opposed to genealogy (inheritance of property and patronym) (Irigaray 10).</note> Additionally, as 
                    a “fierce and obstinate rejection of forgetting,” this <foreign xml:lang="grc">aie</foreign> protests separating 
                    past from present (34).</p>
                <p>Such timelessness belongs to the gods—and to a lyric mode that presses beyond language. It penetrates the sonic 
                    texture of tragedy, Loraux finds, each time  the word repeats exhalations of grief. <foreign 
                        xml:lang="grc">Aiai</foreign>—an exclamation like “alas!”—reverberates in <foreign 
                            xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> and in its combinations so that when, for instance, Antigone exclaims, 
                    “O home in the ground forever,” the word signifying forever (άϴίφρουρο/<foreign 
                        xml:lang="grc">aeiphrouros</foreign>) redoubles her plaint. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign> 
                    of <emph>always</emph> sings out in ubiquitous cries (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Aiai</foreign>), but also in 
                    internal rhymes, freighted moments of assonance, and frequent passages of song. <emph>Always</emph> and 
                    <emph>alas</emph> thus conspire with the singing of choral refrains. Like Honig’s 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign>, they are there waiting to be heard.</p>
                <p>Loraux makes analogies between these phonic signals in the tragedies and oratorio or lyric poetry (51). But 
                    emphasizing the role of sound and song in tragic grieving pulls her account close to a particularly Romantic 
                    form of intelligibility, by which that era’s heyday of chaos reached many ears. Emergent even as Antigone 
                    assumed her place in modern Western thought as “emblematic of a programme of feminine emancipation and political 
                    parity,” even as the author of <title level="m">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title> died from giving 
                    birth, that form is melodrama (Steiner 9–10).<note place="foot" resp="editors">In recruiting both Arendt and 
                        melodrama for her reading of Antigone, Honig steps away from Anna Siamopoulos, who uses Arendt to critique 
                        the “melodramatic worldview” of Hollywood film (Siamopoulos 181–82). Carolyn Williams helpfully situates 
                        early nineteenth-century melodrama in a more radical political framework than Hollywood’s version (Williams 
                        360–61).</note> </p></div>

                <p>At this point you may be feeling sad and angry that this essay has not engaged Wollstonecraft’s writing in much 
                    detail. But perhaps, insofar as Mary Wollstonecraft helped write the script for a modern Antigone, this essay 
                    has been talking about Wollstonecraft’s work all along.</p>
                <p>In addition to anticipating Antigone, Wollstonecraft anticipated in her <title level="m">Letters Written</title> 
                    such moments of audience annoyance (“You will say that I am growing bitter, perhaps personal—Ah! Shall I whisper 
                    to you that you—yourself—are strangely altered?’?” [172]) as well as audience impatience (“Still harping on the 
                    same subject, you will exclaim——How can I avoid it . . . ?” [153]). Her ventriloquism offers moments of <foreign 
                        xml:lang="grc">adianoeta</foreign> that further conspiracy, splitting the nominal letter-reader apart from 
                    readers of the published text, whom she woos to her sense of grievance. Playing too on the distance of the spoken 
                    from the written word, she insists on being heard even as she anticipates the desire for her to be quiet (“shall 
                    I whisper to you?”).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Writing of nineteenth-century stage melodrama in ways that 
                        echo Cavell, Williams refers to the dialectic of “melodrama’s generic form”: a consistent attempt both “to 
                        silence” and “to ‘tell all’” “mediat[es] the difficulty of expression—the many opportunities for it to be 
                        suppressed, to go wrong, to be misunderstood” (Williams 363).</note> The verb “harping” only heightens this 
                    dialectical unease, suggesting on the one hand that the letter-writer “repeat[s] or dwell[s] upon a subject to 
                    a wearisome or tedious length” and on the other “play[s] upon a [harp] string, to make music” (OED). A killjoy’s 
                    tedium to some ears may be stirring music to others. The OED cites a tone-deaf Polonius calling out Hamlet for 
                    “harping still on my daughter,” the ambivalence of the word—dwelling upon? playing upon?—opening up rich 
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">adianoetic</foreign> possibilities. Are we to hear <title level="m">Hamlet</title> in 
                    the letter-writer’s (ventriloquized) phrase? Wollstonecraft keeps such possibilities alive throughout the letters, 
                    as she works various potential “you”s with and against each other, her address veering from a tone of <foreign 
                        xml:lang="fr">entre nous</foreign> to subtle antagonism to stern command, as scholars have noted (e.g.,

                <p>Less recognized perhaps is the fact that the letter-writer simultaneously taps into lyric potential here, hoping 
                    that the arguments she harps upon will unleash a  sonic undercurrent, her own enduring <foreign 
                        xml:lang="grc">aei</foreign>. Here is the full paragraph,  a dramatic flourish near the close of the

                    Many things could be said of the rhetoric of this passage—the switch 
                    to a “we” that excludes “you,” for instance, and the explicitly feminist stance. I want, though, to mark in 
                    its lyricism a premonition of the melodramatic and its service to feminism. Not simply the posture of female 
                    complaint—what Lauren Berlant recognizes as “the bitter vigilance of the intimately disappointed”—but the 
                    exploitation of lyric strategies, that singing harp, make the narrator’s voice heard even when her audience 
                    wants not to hear it (Berlant, <title level="m">Complaint</title> 1). Melo+drama, of course, implies the mix 
                    of music with drama. Note the music of Wollstonecraft’s closing chiasmus: “we reason deeply when we forcibly 
                    feel.” Pleading, keening, and aggrieved, the writer plays upon one string:  “W<hi rend="bold">e</hi> r<hi 
                        rend="bold">ea</hi>son d<hi rend="bold">ee</hi>pl<hi rend="bold">y</hi> when w<hi rend="bold">e</hi>

                    <emph>ee</emph>, // <emph>ee</emph>’, <emph>ee</emph>, <emph>ee</emph>’). Is this music—or the screech of 
                    nails on a chalkboard? Either way, the sound defies forgetting. You may wake tomorrow and hear it still.</p>

                <p>In <title level="m">Cruel Optimism</title>, Berlant turns to genres such as melodrama to trace how they mediate 
                    “pressures of the present moment on the subject’s sensorium”—Cavell’s “heydays of chaos reaching our ears” (9). 
                    For Wollstonecraft, lyric moments similarly mediate or channel scraps and bits of tragedy for the reader’s 
                    sensorium. The landscape of the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> is littered with the dead, we recall: 
                    mummies, executions, soldiers training “to slaughter and be slaughtered,” phantoms, hauntings, and everywhere 
                    the stench of rotting fish. Wollstonecraft then fills the landscape with echoes of tragedy—Shakespeare’s 
                    specifically. In addition to Lear (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:310, 322, 414) and Macbeth (6: 252, 343, 
                    378),  the letter-writer alludes to or quotes the suicidal Prince of Denmark, as when we read, “the world’s 
                    a vast prison,” or the lament that “war, and ‘the thousand ills that flesh is heir to,’ mow [men] down in 
                    shoals” (6:336; also 253, 372, 277).<note place="foot" resp="editors">The editors of the <title level="m">Works

                    (6:285). In each case, the well-known lines both recall and effect turbulence. Like Antigone, the radical 
                    egalitarian writer claims identification with royalty and nobility; yet the words she quotes, like those 
                    from <title level="m">Lear</title>, attest to the futility of such distinctions: she sees “an effigy of majesty 
                    burned down to its sockets” (6:322). Whatever authority remains in the form of tragedy <emph>sounds</emph> 
                    fractured, vestigial, and gothic, relics presented in a minor key. The tragic pose thus risks sounding 
                    excessive, histrionic, overwrought: melodramatic. After all, this is a travelogue: she’s on a <emph>business

                <p>Jeffrey Cox explains that in the Romantic era, the tragic hero can “only struggle to become a hero,” alienated 
                    as she is from the “fully meaningful world of gods and heroes” (Cox 158). If that’s the case, then 
                    Wollstonecraft, like the protagonists of melodrama, declines the struggle. She borrows. She feints. She plays, 
                    as the advertisement to her <title level="m">Letters Written</title> confesses, the part of “<emph>little</emph> 
                    hero of each tale,” pluralizing her roles (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:241; emphasis added). That 
                    pluralization has critical effect: for every reader who might hear self-indulgent sentiment on these pages, 
                    others might hear the music of unspoken acts of suicide, madness, and vengeance. Someone, something, 
                    <emph>has</emph> been killed, over and over again. Lyric strains and scattered echoes of tragedy sound against 
                    a death-strewn landscape, giving the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> an excessive or “extimate” 
                    dimension, allowing a timeless sense of grievance to intrude upon a living present even as the traveler eats 
                    meals, arranges transport, and describes the local customs of dress (Honig 149). If she cannot be understood in 
                    her owns terms, she will collect, parrot, or take the language of an authority—tragic, mythic, aristocratic, 
                    sovereign—an authority she knows and exposes as hollow.</p>
                    
                <p>These are the tactics of melodrama, that “peculiarly modern form” born in France alongside regicide, revolution, 
                    and “the loss of a tragic vision,” and carried to Britain in 1801 by Thomas Holcroft, sometime friend of William 
                    Godwin (Brooks 14).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On the “political power” of the voiceless in early 
                        melodrama, see Williams 359–63.</note> Honig acknowledges that the features she detects humming through 
                    <title level="m">Antigone</title>—grievance, conspiracy, and the untimely lyric registers of the overwrought 
                    and inexpressible—all reverberate within the distinctly modern mode of melodrama. If Honig imports melodrama 
                    into tragedy—in order to construct a contestatory, natalist, and democratic feminist politics, open to new 
                    publics—Wollstonecraft scatters tragedy into melodrama. Or at least, in the hybrid form of her <title 
                        level="m">Letters</title>—epistolary novel, travelogue, philosophical history, reverie, and memoir, 
                    threaded through with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">phonos</foreign> of tragedy and lyric—Wollstonecraft brings 
                    her reader to the verge of melodrama, searching for a form to make grievance intelligible. The “waning of genre” 
                    on display in melodrama, is not, Lauren Berlant reminds us, the waning of affect (<title 
                        level="m">Optimism</title> 6). Tragedy declined, at least in Wollstonecraft’s declension, does not sacrifice 
                    affective power. Nor does it slacken its reach for a passionate <emph>always</emph> on behalf of “the oppressed 
                    state of my sex.”</p><figure rend="leftFloat">

                <p>For if melodrama collects the vestiges of a tragic vision, in its Romantic moment it also enacts “passion’s 
                    revenge” upon the sentimental mode so dominant in the late eighteenth century (Chandler 34). With modern 
                    feminism, as I have sought to suggest with and through Antigone and Wollstonecraft, melodrama demands the 
                    exhaustion of sympathetic tears and their replacement with something more aggrieved. In her <title 
                        level="m">Letters</title>, Wollstonecraft conjures tears several times, and readers have taken them as 
                    signposts on a melancholy, sentimental journey away from the polemics of her two <title 
                        level="m">Vindications</title>. With the help of <title level="m">Antigone</title>, though, I hear 
                    something else raging through the letters of the wandering woman. The female “I” invokes tears in a gestural, 
                    stylized way: “I wished for night to hide the starting tears, or shed them on my pillow, and close my eyes on 
                    a world where I was destined to wander alone” (<title level="m">Works</title> 6:298). So stylized are these 
                    mentions that the incipient tears dwindle in the course of the <title level="m">Letters Written</title> to a 
                    single spare tear, no sooner summoned than disowned (“why starts the tear . . . ?” [6:272]; “The tear 
                    starts . . . I must fly” [6:294]). Such considerations lead back to the line encountered earlier, the closing 
                    gesture of the penultimate letter: “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted ear!’” 
                    (6:344).</p>
                <p>The apostrophe to the world is itself indebted to Edward Young’s influential poem, <title level="m">The Complaint, 
                    or Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality</title>, where it signals a selfless, religiously inspired 
                    sympathy (I ought to cry for you, world, not for myself) even as it intensifies the speaker’s isolation from 
                    any fellow feeling out there in the world. In Wollstonecraft’s hands, the isolation is compromised by quotation: 
                    obviously, she and Young share this feeling (as does Wollstonecraft’s heroine in <title level="m">Mary, A 
                        Fiction</title>, who repeats the phrase). There’s an acknowledgment too, perhaps, of what her prose owes to 
                    her reading of lyric poetry. More significant, though, is the fact that the indebted line culminates several 
                    pages of mounting critique of “the whirlpool of gain,” the love of profit, and the “baleful effects of 
                    speculation,” announced at the demoralized end of a journey dictated, she implies, by “the commercial spirit” 
                    and paid for by her correspondent, himself “strangely altered” from his immersion in war speculation (6:340). 
                    In this context the language of sentiment, of tears exchanged, shows itself tainted by the credit-debt system 
                    that has enveloped wartime Europe. More even than the loss of tragic vision, melodrama exposes the bankruptcy 
                    of the sentimental. How much debt does that circulating tear carry, travelling from one cheek to another like a
                    promissory note? Honig finds Antigone refusing her place within “an economy of citizenship that domesticates 
                    desire, longing, pain and loss” (122; also 135); Wollstonecraft carries that refusal from the domesticating 
                    economy of <foreign xml:lang="grc">polis</foreign> to the sentimentalizing economy of capital.<note place="foot"

                        engine, sympathy, in <title level="m">Romantic Intimacy</title>, 25–48.</note> “Take, O world, thy much 
                    indebted tear” may express selfless concession, or instead it may throw tears back in the world’s face: “Take 
                    that!” Or maybe, “Take it back!”—passion’s revenge, forcibly felt.</p><figure rend="rightFloat">

                <p>The letter-writer calls up a sentimental tear—as she calls up tragedy—to dramatize the expiration of its power. 
                    Like Antigone, she makes heard both sorrow and rage in language that echoes and implicates and speaks out of 
                    bounds, in excess of herself. In each case, with rhetorical sophistication, conspiratorial play, the sonic 
                    resources of lyric, and a desperate desire to take what hasn’t been given her, the woman voices her grievance 
                    against the state of the oppressed. She leans toward the melodramatic, suggesting the power of that mode for an 
                    unending feminism.</p>
