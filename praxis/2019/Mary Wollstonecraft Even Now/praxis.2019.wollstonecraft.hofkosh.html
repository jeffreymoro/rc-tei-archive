            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <p>This collection of essays attests to Virginia Woolf’s claim in <em>The Common Reader</em> (1932) that Mary Wollstonecraft remains a vital presence “even now,” even in this,
                  our (so-called) postmodern, postfeminist, or posthuman time (163). Wollstonecraft
                  considered herself among “those who are bold enough to advance before the age they
                  live in, and to throw off, by force of their own minds, the prejudices which the maturing
                  reason of the world will in time disavow” (<em>Letters</em> 410), and she has often been described as “visionary” (Sapiro 33) or “way ahead of
                  her time” (Rushton). We could say that as much as her work evolves out of and in urgent
                  response to her own era, she also wrote for an era beyond her own, projecting into
                  an uncertain future, sending up flares for the generations to come. From the opening
                  sentences of her first published book, <em>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</em> (1787), where she castigates mothers whose “thoughtless disregard of every thing,
                  except the present indulgence” leads them to neglect their children (7), to the last
                  sentences of the posthumously published <em>Lessons</em> (1798), in which she anticipates “another day” for the girl to learn “how to think
                  . . . herself” (474), she was always taking a prospective view, looking ahead, if
                  not always hopefully, at least with an eye fixed on the need for change.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Given her orientation towards a future time, it should not be surprising that Wollstonecraft
                     is still felt to be “alive and active” among us in the current moment, a moment in
                     the still incomplete transformation of the world she sought to argue or experiment
                     into existence. Claudia Johnson has noted “her remarkable afterlife” (5), and in surveying
                     her mixed reception and “mutable legacies” through the twentieth century, Cora Kaplan
                     has concluded that Wollstonecraft persists as “a living presence in an on-going struggle
                     . . . more complicated and unfinished than ever” (268–69). Though it has been objected
                     that regarding Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” distorts the historical record,

                              essay about anachronistic readings of Wollstonecraft and Frances Ferguson’s response
                              to it in Gender &amp; Theory: Dialogues on Feminist Criticism. Ferguson invokes the claim
                              of Wollstonecraft as “our contemporary” to address the presentism in Reiss’s own argument.</span></div>
                     </div> recent readers continue to hear her voice in current debates on a range of social
                     and political issues or to trace her influence in their own critical or creative projects.
                     For example, Catherine Packham has recently heard echoes of Wollstonecraft’s arguments
                     in Oxfam’s 2017 report on global economic disparity (
                     “Mary Wollstonecraft, our Contemporary”
                     ), and photographer Moyra Davey invokes Wollstonecraft’s life story as a touchstone
                     in her own meditation on family and memory in her films <em>Les Goddesses</em> (2011) and <em>Hemlock Forest</em> (2016).

                     </div> An Oxfam report and an autobiographical video project may sound like unlikely manifestations
                     of what Kaplan calls Wollstonecraft’s “almost material presence” among us (260), but
                     their very unlikelihood signals that her words, her ideas, and her life experience
                     still live on in disparate and sometimes unexpected guises, transfigured in ways that
                     may indeed reach “beyond what she might personally have imagined” (Reuter et al. 907).
                     Indeed, as she sat for her portrait in 1790 and again in 1797, she is unlikely to
                     have imagined that one of those portraits would be gigantically projected onto the
                     Houses of Parliament in 2011 (to launch the Mary on the Green campaign) or that in
                     2013 her image would be stenciled on the wall of the Newington Green Unitarian Chapel
                     by the street artist Stewy (reproduced on the cover page of this volume); such recent
                     remediations illustrate that Wollstonecraft continues to appear in surprising forms
                     among us, even now.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These essays consider in particular some of the figurations and transfigurations of
                     Mary Wollstonecraft as they appear in various arguments, theories, or practices among
                     those which constitute the ongoing history of feminism, or, we should say, of feminisms.
                     They think with as well as about Wollstonecraft by thinking with and about that history
                     as it continues to be formulated and reformulated in the present. They do not attempt
                     to provide a definitive or comprehensive portrait of Wollstonecraft or of the ongoing
                     feminist movement for which her work offered an early impetus; such a moving picture
                     could hardly be drawn once and for all in any essay or even in six. Instead, they
                     comprise a sort of album of sketches or snapshots, each one approaching its subject
                     in a different setting, from a different angle, or with a different lens and focus.
                     They move in some of the directions her work points and explore some of the paths
                     she marks out, though they do not always follow her blazes without doubling back (for
                     instance to <em>Antigone</em>) or venturing into territory (such as cyberspace) that would not have appeared on
                     any map Wollstonecraft might have used to plot her own revolutionary itinerary. These
                     essays hear Wollstonecraft’s voice spoken with unexpected accents (for instance, in
                     the misogyny of twentieth-century pop psychology or the poststructuralist philosophy
                     of Jacques Rancière) and find traces of her influence in positions she apparently
                     refuted (such as on exceptional women as a force for social change). In her essay
                     in this volume, historian Arianne Chernock observes that feminism “never has been
                     a linear development,” and the essays collected here demonstrate that Wollstonecraft’s
                     impact on feminist thought and movement also registers in loops and swerves, indirectly,
                     and in ways that are often contested. The volume takes up the question of Wollstonecraft’s
                     continuing relevance to contemporary feminist thought and its wider cultural movements
                     as unfinished business, not to finish it, but to open the question to new or revisionary
                     modes of critical inquiry and new or newly resonant terms of critical engagement—for
                     example, to Julie Carlson’s “passional” reading of Wollstonecraft, which engages contemporary
                     debates about care work and itself involves a kind of giving (or taking) care. Criticism
                     that is motivated by or responsive to the lived experience of the critic has long
                     been deemed a crucial feature of feminism.

               <p>Making connections between Wollstonecraft’s efforts to think and live both within
                  and beyond Enlightenment principles of liberal humanism and various ongoing issues
                  and debates in contemporary culture, from the political efficacy of social media to
                  the impasses in theories and practices of social justice (including the impasses in
                  our own critical theories and pedagogical practices), these essays not only ask how
                  Wollstonecraft’s pioneering arguments live on after her in feminist thought, theory,
                  and practice now, but they also collectively raise questions about how feminist thought,
                  theory, and practice live on; together, they query how, what, or for whom feminism
                  argues now.</p>
               <p>If today we can recognize the gender trouble <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (1792) brews in Wollstonecraft’s rhetorical question, “Where is then the sexual difference,
                  when the education has been the same?” or in her “wild wish . . . to see the distinction
                  of sex confounded in society,” what might further consideration of her arguments about
                  the condition of women based on their shared experience of oppression provide to current
                  thinking about the social construction of sex or the fluidity of gender identity or
                  the differences and complexities in the experience of oppression which are obfuscated
                  in assertions of a universal womanhood (92, 126)? Wollstonecraft argued for the rights
                  of “woman” as a specific social category of bodies for whom biology constituted an
                  essential if not an absolutely delimiting circumstance. But as her earlier <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</em> (1790) also shows, that argument was pitched as part of a much larger set of concerns:
                  the “revolution in female manners” for which she calls in <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> was integral to a wider call “to reform the world,” and she saw the liberation of
                  women from the conventions that kept them physically and intellectually weak and dependent
                  as a necessary step in the effort to dismantle the “despotism” that more broadly constrained
                  the lives of humans in the material realm of the social, the political, and the economic
                  (114). The vocabulary with which she took up these issues has changed in current discourse—we
                  are less likely to employ the language of reason or virtue to talk about the fundamental
                  principles of human rights or social justice—but this volume revisits and revitalizes
                  in modern terms some aspects of what Wollstonecraft herself called “my old argument,”
                  which was, simply put, that women, however constituted as such, are people with minds
                  as well as bodies, that women’s rights are human rights (<em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> 132). As Lynn Festa’s rigorous scrutiny of this claim in her essay demonstrates,
                  the different ways old arguments inform or impel new ones is part of what this collection
                  seeks to explore.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The contributors gathered here work in three different disciplines—literature, history,
                     and political science—though each of their essays crosses disciplinary borders strictly
                     construed; each brings a multivalent perspective to the topic of how Wollstonecraft’s
                     arguments and experiments continue to inflect feminist theories and practices today.
                     Their essays are layered and adventurous; a few of them extend the dimensions of the
                     essay form, taking advantage of the opportunities technology affords to incorporate
                     other media, as Eileen Hunt Botting does, or to suggest other lines of thought in
                     the margins, as Mary Favret does. The writer they are addressing—at once political
                     philosopher and author of tales for children—may indeed demand such a hybrid and genre-stretching
                     critical methodology, but we can also say that as a collection these essays themselves
                     exemplify Wollstonecraft’s lively presence among us, taking up her challenge of writing
                     as a form of political praxis, a mode of doing one’s work that tests conventional
                     boundaries with the aim of pushing for systemic change going forward.

                     </div> That all the contributors to this volume are white, cis-women may be one among many
                     indications that even here, even now, the radical change to which Wollstonecraft looked
                     forward is yet to be realized. The challenge is still on.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Julie Carlson explicitly confronts that challenge by considering the ascription of
                  Wollstonecraft’s feminism as straight, white, and middle class. Framing her reading
                  within current debates about the ethics of care, Carlson explores the possibilities
                  of a less normative, more intersectional feminism emerging in Wollstonecraft’s work.
                  Proposing that humans are interdependent rather than autonomous, the care movement
                  redraws the boundaries between public and private, institutional structures and individuals,
                  the social and the psychological, much as Wollstonecraft did in her political polemic,
                  her attempts at philosophical fiction, and her struggle to live a life of the mind
                  as a kind of activism or revisionary practice. Carlson sees Wollstonecraft elaborating
                  an ethics of care especially in <em>Mary: A Fiction</em> and <em>Maria; or the Wrongs of Woman</em>, where stories of women’s disparate yet linked caregiving activities dramatize the
                  risky process of establishing relationships through acknowledging and working across
                  difference. Seeing this dynamic shifts Carlson’s critical focus from the much-discussed
                  limitations of Wollstonecraft’s feminist legacy to the potential insight inadequacy
                  or failure offers into complex systems of exploitation and injustice, including those
                  operating at the ground of (inter)personal relations.</p>
               <p>Approaching Wollstonecraft through Jacques Rancière’s ideas about the exclusions that
                  structure the very logic of the political order, Lynn Festa addresses a contradiction
                  that arises in Wollstonecraft’s argument that women’s rights are human rights. And
                  not unlike Carlson, Festa ultimately reclaims the contradiction as the dispute or
                  “dissensus” that creates space for reconstituting the political order at its foundation
                  rather than merely expanding its boundaries. For the revolutionary philosopher of
                  <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Man</em> and <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, Festa contends, the discourse of rights develops “not as the corrective of localized
                  wrongs (and thus the obverse or mirror image of the dominant order), but as the necessary
                  correlative of duties.” Proposing duties as the basis for rights allows Wollstonecraft
                  to conceive political subjectivity as the capacity for action rather than a possession
                  that some people have and others do not. Festa thus sees Wollstonecraft strategically
                  turning “from the disempowering binary of right and wrong to the empowering reciprocity
                  of rights and duties” in order to argue that fulfilling domestic duties in itself
                  constitutes women’s political participation. Admitting that an exclusionary division
                  of labor inevitably haunts this stance, Festa nonetheless finds that in compelling
                  the reader to confront the stark choice between seeing women as humans or seeing them
                  as brute beasts, the text performs the dissensus Rancière proposes as crucial to revolutionary
                  change.</p>
               <p>In her essay, Julie Murray discerns a shadowy figure of Wollstonecraft cast in Sara
                  Ahmed’s recent characterization of the feminist killjoy, though she focuses on a text
                  from the mid-twentieth century to examine the force of seeing Wollstonecraft in Ahmed’s
                  terms. In its “cartoonish depiction of Wollstonecraft” as a penis-envying neurotic,
                  the authors of the pop psychology best-seller, <em>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</em> (1947), trace what they regard as the world-destroying ideology of feminism directly
                  back to Wollstonecraft’s “twisted personality.” Yet, as Murray reveals, their scathing
                  critique at times appears to speak in a voice not so unlike Wollstonecraft’s own,
                  absorbing her “withering tone” or adopting the technique of ironic mimicry she uses
                  in <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>. And the book written so passionately (or perhaps we could say, hysterically) against
                  her inadvertently works to bolster her reputation, exaggerating her importance, at
                  least relative to more recent accounts which dismiss her work for its complicity in
                  liberal feminism’s normative prescriptions and progressive historiography. Murray
                  returns to Ahmed at the end of her essay to suggest that in closely attending to the
                  complicated and often conflicted affects involved in living a feminist life—especially
                  negativity or ambivalence—we may discover not so much a particular path forward as
                  a different mode of being in or of (re)making the world.</p>
               <p>Eileen Hunt Botting’s contribution updates Murray’s interest in the caricature of
                  Wollstonecraft’s arguments in twentieth-century popular discourse by considering the
                  significant social and political reverberations of memes that get reproduced and disseminated
                  through twenty-first-century social media as widely visible, as well as endlessly
                  malleable, symbols of ideas. Looking at how Wollstonecraft herself was fashioned and
                  also fashioned herself as a meme well before the invention of the World Wide Web,
                  Hunt Botting advises that feminism needs to learn how to deploy these arguably superficial
                  but nonetheless powerful symbols “for successful political action in the present and
                  future.” For Hunt Botting, Hillary Clinton (or her campaign machine), along with Malala
                  Yousafzai and Emma Watson, represent those who have begun to realize the feminist
                  potential within the global circulation of memes; they also represent how high the
                  stakes are in “the risky and virulent politics” of meme warfare. In the currency of
                  Hunt Botting’s discussion, as well as in how quickly current circumstances turn into
                  past history in the age of the internet, we can appreciate in a particularly striking
                  way that what Woolf called Wollstonecraft’s immortality is sustained more by transformation
                  or adaptation than by mere reiteration in the ongoing present.</p>
               <p>Arianne Chernock detects the tones of Wollstonecraft’s voice submerged in the history
                  of opinion about the role that queens and other royal women could play in feminist
                  critique. If Wollstonecraft’s reflections on this issue were indirect or “more muted”
                  than those of her peers Mary Hays or Mary Robinson, it is nonetheless important to
                  be more attuned to this aspect of her thinking “both for our understanding of Wollstonecraft
                  herself and for the broader feminist conversation in which she was, and indeed remains,
                  a central participant.” Even when narrowly construed, the broader conversations of
                  Western feminism or liberal feminism or white, middle-class feminism should be seen
                  as more nuanced and multifaceted, interwoven with more divergent strands of thought
                  and building their claims on more varied foundations than has typically been recognized.
                  In the present moment, Chernock proposes, feminist scholars might look with more careful
                  attention at the continuing appeal of “princess culture” among little girls and others
                  in the West, which, though apparently so invested in perpetuating gender and race
                  stereotypes, could also provide opportunities for revising those stereotypes as well
                  as reimagining the structures of power they subtend.</p>
               <p>Reaching farthest into the past of the essays included here, Mary Favret addresses
                  the question of how Wollstonecraft lives among us even now by approaching <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796) through <em>Antigone</em> and recent revisionary accounts of Sophocles’ tragedy. In the resonant echoes produced
                  by what we might call a form of strategic anachronism (whereby Wollstonecraft is seen
                  to anticipate modern feminist readings of <em>Antigone</em>), Favret elicits the unvoiced or unheard affects which register in Wollstonecraft’s
                  work, especially the rage which accompanies sorrow and which turns what can sound
                  like melodramatic excess into “a vital and timely feminist poetics.” Timely, but also
                  in Favret’s terms, crucially time<em>less</em>—that is, unending, not yet or possibly ever over. In elaborating the ways Antigone’s
                  cry of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">aei</span> (always) reverberates in <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em>, Favret makes the force of feminist complaint audible as the “lyric potential” of
                  Wollstonecraft’s prose. Lyric may be a particularly Romantic modality, like melancholy
                  or the sentimental, but it also articulates more public feelings; amplifying in her
                  own prose style what she calls the “sonic undercurrent” of Wollstonecraft’s writing,
                  Favret makes us hear Wollstonecraft’s expressions of private grief as “her grievance
                  against the state of the oppressed.”</p>
               <p>As Wollstonecraft looked forward to a future time when the world will have disavowed
                  its prejudices, so these essays contemplate the problems feminism has sought to address
                  as still unresolved. If this album of sketches or snapshots presents six different
                  views of how Wollstonecraft appears “even now among the living,” it necessarily remains
                  an open book, with many pages still blank and ready to be filled with other perspectives
                  and other outlooks on both the past and the future.</p>
