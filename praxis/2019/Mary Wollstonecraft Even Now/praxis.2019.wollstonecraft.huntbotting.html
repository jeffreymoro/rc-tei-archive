               <p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton—the first woman nominated by a major party to run for the
                  office of the U.S. presidency—tried and failed to take control of the memes circulating
                  around her political identity. Alt-right social media posts, tweets, and news articles
                  literally pictured her as a <a class="link_ref" href="https://i.imgflip.com/16zdj7.jpg">devil</a>, a <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/agenda/walking-dead-hillary-clinton-zombie-candidate">zombie</a>, or in <a class="link_ref" href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/88/5c/79885c807cf82a337f545f20f46f4dd9.jpg">prison</a>. In this ultraconservative media stream, Hillary was hardly presidential material.
                  She was, rather, an establishment politician from hell who was heading to jail for
                  her supposed crimes—that is, if she didn’t die first from the health problems that
                  her campaign was desperately hiding from the public.</p>
               <p>In response, Clinton and her supporters tried to take “the high road.” They produced
                  some signature memes of the campaign, which underscored her qualifications for the
                  presidency (see <a class="link_ref" href="http://textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr.com/">Texts from Hillary</a>), her solidarity with girls, women, and minorities (through the <a class="link_ref" href="https://fsmedia.imgix.net/ed/21/75/4d/90a5/4ba2/931a/422695503190/this-collage-is-a-popular-image-on-various-pantsuit-nation-facebook-groups.jpeg">Pantsuit Nation</a> secret Facebook group), and her hopeful, progressive vision of social justice for
                  all (such as “<a class="link_ref" href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/669/ChlZGdOW0AAFhUD.jpg">I’m with Her</a>” or “H→”) (Thrift). They also strove to subvert the misogynist language streaming
                  forth from Trump and his followers (Martin). By appropriating a Trumpian term of hate
                  like “<a class="link_ref" href="https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-12-22/7dba1be0-c870-11e6-864a-5359b2af823c_nw.gif">Nasty Woman</a>,” encircling the insult in a red heart, and wearing the new logo on T-shirts for
                  social media selfies, they put a positive yet defiant spin on one of the opposition’s
                  malicious memes, transforming it into a code word for the cause to elect the first
                  American woman president (Petrarca; Hess).</p>
               <p>We all know who won this “meme warfare” (Boyd; Haddow). Former U.S. senator and secretary
                  of state Clinton’s typically upbeat, liberal, and cosmopolitan message was trumped
                  by the consistently negative, nationalistic, overtly white-male-supremacist campaigning
                  of her rival, a man without political experience. A few days before Donald J. Trump
                  won the White House without a majority of the popular vote (and to the surprise of
                  most of the media, the political establishment, and the profession of political science),
                  the British journalist Douglas Haddow remarked: “memes are ruining democracy” and
                  have “poisoned the U.S. election” through their “mass replication” (Haddow).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Haddow’s then ominous, now prescient remark about the spread of politically poisonous
                     memes raises some theoretical questions. What is a meme? What does it mean for a meme
                     to be poisonous? How and why do memes replicate on a mass scale? To address these
                     and other questions provoked by the unexpected outcome of Clinton’s loss to Trump,
                     this essay clarifies the meaning of the meme and its roles in representing women in
                     politics since the time of Mary Wollstonecraft. As scholars of British Romantic and
                     Victorian literature know well, Mary

                              public and political reception to Hillary’s. For women—especially those who are women’s
                              rights advocates—first-name recognition can be good or bad, because it does not always
                              connote respect, and can often reduce the woman to stereotypes associated with her
                              gender.</span></div>
                     </div>—much like Hillary more than two centuries after her—has been the subject of many
                     portraits in the public sphere. These portraits—good, bad, and ugly—have shaped the
                     trajectory of feminist politics worldwide (Kaplan 246–70).</p>
               </div>
               <p>Elsewhere I have argued that Wollstonecraft was the first woman to become an international
                  feminist meme—or a highly visible, malleable, and cross-national symbol of the women’s
                  movement—due to the transatlantic marking of the major centennials of her life, work,
                  and death in the 1890s (Botting, Carey, and Wilkerson 13–38; Botting, <em>Wollstonecraft, Mill</em> 204–48). Even from the 1790s onward, she has been a widely recognized and controversial
                  symbol for women’s rights, wielded by both critics and adherents alike, across languages,
                  cultures, and nations. Like Hillary, Mary has done better internationally than in
                  her often-hostile homeland in terms of her public reception (Botting, “Making” 273–95;
                  Botting, “Wollstonecraft in Europe” 503–27). The study of the evolution of the Wollstonecraft
                  meme in several of its symbolic iterations—both negative and positive—yields some
                  important lessons for future feminist interventions in the risky and virulent politics
                  of meme warfare. As Clinton’s defeat indicates, there is an urgent need for twenty-first-century
                  feminists of all stripes to strategize the successful manipulation of the meme for
                  their political ends. Now that the internet meme has become one of the most vital
                  and volatile conveyors of ideas in contemporary politics, feminists must learn from
                  their past (including their past mistakes) to tap the full power of the meme as a
                  strategic asset, not a liability, for their common causes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2">
               <h2><span class="head">What Is a (Feminist) Meme?</span></h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3">
               <p>Before we understand the historical development of the meme and its relationship to
                  feminism and other forms of politics, we need to define what a meme is (Botting, “Why
                  Memes Matter”). Memes are a staple of contemporary popular culture, but most people
                  would be hard-pressed to define what exactly they are. Simply put, memes are broadly
                  identifiable yet variously replicated symbols of ideas. In the twenty-first century,
                  most people associate the meme with social media, in which a photo or picture is posted,
                  circulated, annotated with a brief quote or slogan, then recirculated and reedited
                  into new iterations of the original meme.</p>
               <p>Within contemporary feminism, one famous recent example of such an internet meme is
                  
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="http://feministryangosling.tumblr.com/">Feminist Ryan Gosling</a>,”
                  a series of images of the “sensitive” male actor emblazoned with woman-friendly invitations
                  such as “Hey girl, keep your laws off my body, but keep your hands on it.” As this
                  example suggests, internet memes can be vehicles for irony and wry discontent with
                  the status quo. They can also be more straightforward means of conveying information,
                  supporting causes, and spreading awareness. “Feminist Ryan Gosling” aims to achieve
                  the latter goals by educating people about basic feminist ideas in a funny and memorable
                  way. While directed at an imaginary female audience, these feminist memes are not
                  only for women. A recent study has shown that men are more likely to support feminist
                  ideas after viewing the original “Feminist Ryan Gosling” memes. Danielle Henderson,
                  a graduate student in gender studies, began to create the memes in 2011 in order to
                  make some of the fundamental points of feminist theory more accessible and understandable
                  to broader audience (Henderson).</p>
               <p>Richard Dawkins invented the term <em>meme</em> to describe the nonteleological, evolutionary cultural process by which social symbols
                  are formed, cross-fertilized, and reproduced in new and diverse iterations of an original
                  (or “genetic”) idea (Dawkins 192, 322). Richard Rorty argued in turn that “memes are
                  things like turns of speech, terms of aesthetic or moral praise, political slogans,
                  proverbs, musical phrases, stereotypical icons, and the like” (Rorty 22). Upholding
                  the political relevance of Dawkins’s concept for a pragmatic conception of feminism,
                  Rorty explained that “different batches of . . . memes are carried by different human
                  social groups, and so the triumph of one such group amounts to the triumph of those
                  . . . memes” (Rorty 22). In this light, feminist memes can be understood as dominant
                  clusters of public symbols that influence and embody the political ideas of the movement
                  for women’s liberation from conditions of patriarchal oppression.</p>
               <p>At first glance, memes may look like irrational or nonrational replications of stereotypes,
                  as Colin McGinn recently argued. On this reading, memes are merely a series of reductive
                  symbols produced by a random network of people. As such, memes lack substance or the
                  capability to convey any truth: as mere stereotypes, they can only perpetuate stereotypes
                  and untruths, such as racist (or also, on McGinn’s reading, religious) ideas. McGinn
                  contrasts memes with “themes,” such as well-known refrains from classical music or
                  other products of what he (rather exclusively) defines as human rationality, such
                  as scientific concepts or theories.</p>
               <p>Contra McGinn, I contend that the history of feminism suggests precisely the opposite
                  about the relevance of the meme for philosophy and politics. Despite their seemingly
                  superficial treatment of ideas, memes have proven to be powerful means for the public
                  exchange of and critical engagement with complex feminist theories. The global popularity
                  of “Feminist Ryan Gosling” alone suggests that, even in their less academic and political
                  forms, memes can play an important role in the public representation of challenging,
                  rapidly changing, and often abstruse ideas about gender, sex, and sexuality. 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/02/We-Can-Do-It-Rosie-the-Riveter-Wallpaper-2-AB.jpeg">Rosie the Riveter</a>”
                  is another example of a meme that has had incredible staying power and cross-cultural
                  appeal for feminism despite its specific genesis in U.S. propaganda during the Second
                  World War.</p>
               <p>Contemporary artist Barbara Kruger’s work from the 1980s—especially a poster developed
                  for a pro-choice rally in Washington, D.C.—is another watershed for the emergence
                  of the modern feminist meme. In 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger/untitled-your-body-battleground">Untitled</a>”
                  (1989), Kruger bisected a photo of a female model’s face, depicting one side as the
                  negative image of the other. She sliced the bright-red slogan “Your body is a battleground”
                  through the center of the picture. Through the cutting of the woman’s face into opposing
                  halves, the striking reversals of color (black/white, red/monochrome), and the superimposition
                  of text that can be read in different ways, Kruger created a multilayered political
                  statement. “Untitled” at once exposes the divisiveness of abortion politics, the media’s
                  harmful distortion of women’s self-images, the objectification of women’s bodies for
                  men’s sexual and reproductive ends, and even the ironies of the feminist movement
                  to “reclaim” or “defend” women’s bodily autonomy from domination under antiabortion
                  policies. Kruger’s innovative combination of iconic imagery and ironic slogans in
                  her artwork has since become a model for memes of all kinds, but perhaps especially
                  the feminist memes shared on the pathways of the internet.</p>
               <p>In his book <em>Media Virus</em> (1994), Douglas Rushkoff developed an interpretive framework for understanding the
                  virulent spread of memes through modern media. He conceptualized memes as a kind of
                  “ideological code” that spread, like a virus, through media networks (Rushkoff 9–10).
                  Memes attached themselves to whichever hosts proved hospitable for the reproduction
                  and spread of their views, whether in belief, action, voice, print, or art. Rushkoff
                  concluded that memes “infiltrate the way we do business, educate ourselves, interact
                  with each other—even the way we perceive ‘reality’” (9–10).</p>
               <p>Ruskoff’s theory of meme replication as akin to viral transmission influenced activist
                  Andrew Boyd, who coined the term <em>meme warfare</em> in 2002. Boyd argued that memes had become the most significant political weapons
                  in “the matrix of hearts and minds and media” that was “a vast theatre of viral warfare”
                  (Boyd). Like other political movements, feminism has found its way into this vast
                  twenty-first-century theatre of art and war, a virtual and digital battleground of
                  signs and symbols. In order to navigate its own path through that battleground, feminism
                  must pay heed to its past—especially the global reception of one of its founders—as
                  a guide for successful political action in the present and future.</p>

               <p>Long before 
                  “Feminist Ryan Gosling,”
                  
                  “Your Body is a Battleground,”
                  and 
                  “Rosie the Riveter,”
                  feminists across eras and cultures have made use of the meme for thoughtful and deliberate
                  political purposes. Mary Wollstonecraft was exceptional in this regard for two reasons.
                  First, it is widely known that she became a kind of putty in the hands of her patriarchal
                  critics, especially after her untimely death from a childbirth infection in 1797.
                  Her husband William Godwin’s well-meaning posthumous tribute, <em>Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (1798), shared too much information with the conservative British public about Wollstonecraft’s
                  experiences with love outside of the institution of patriarchal marriage. English
                  anti-Jacobin (anti–French Revolution) writers such as Richard Polwhele and John Corry
                  seized the opportunity to recast Wollstonecraft in the image of their own critique
                  of early feminist ideas, upholding her as the fallen woman in an oft-told morality
                  tale detailing the inevitably tragic consequences of the permissive sexual behavior
                  of the radicals of the Revolutionary era (Botting, 
                  “Wollstonecraft in Europe,”
                  503–27).</p>
               <p>In 1798, John Chapman created a stipple engraving of 
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw41811/Mary-Wollstonecraft">Mrs. Godwin</a>”
                  —preserved by the National Portrait Gallery, London—which built upon these anti-Jacobin
                  stereotypes of Wollstonecraft. Chapman altered Wollstonecraft’s 1797 portrait by John
                  Opie so that she looked masculine in her facial features, and donned a hat typically
                  worn by male supporters of the French Revolution, thus signaling to the public that
                  her feminist ideas were a threat to womanhood itself. While these antifeminist morality
                  tales instigated a negative trend in the reception of Wollstonecraft, especially in
                  Britain during the Napoleonic era, they also made her even more famous worldwide.</p>
               <p>With the international spread of newspapers and other journalistic media in the nineteenth
                  century, Wollstonecraft became <em>the</em> household name for what she stood for—women’s rights (Botting, 
                  “Making”
                  273–95). Whether loved or hated, she was a highly visible symbol of nascent feminist
                  ideas of love, marriage, liberty, and citizenship, especially in continental Europe
                  and the Americas during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Botting, 
                  “Making”
                  273–95; Botting, 
                  “Wollstonecraft in Europe”
                  503–27; Botting and Matthews, 
                  “Overthrowing”
                  64–83). By 1915, <em><a class="link_ref" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1915/07/11/archives/woman-suffrage-campaign-in-books-an-annotated-list-of-the-leading.html">The New York Times</a></em> could claim in a headline that the “Woman Suffrage Campaign” began with a book by
                  “Mary Wollstonecraft More Than a Century Ago,” and append to the article an overtly
                  feminized portrait-meme based upon the 1797 painting by John Opie.</p>
               <p>Less discussed is a second political and literary trend that Wollstonecraft herself
                  instigated with her first, quasi-autobiographical novel, <em>Mary, a Fiction</em> (1788). A decade before the British anti-Jacobin critics turned her into a symbol
                  of the dangerous assertion of women’s rights, Wollstonecraft made herself into a feminist
                  meme by sharing in the public sphere a series of powerful arguments and vivid stories
                  about her experiences and observations of women’s oppression on the basis of their
                  sex. Between the publication of <em>Mary</em> and her last, unfinished novel <em>Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman</em> (1798), she self-reflectively fashioned (and refashioned) her public personae through
                  the creation of literary personae who were composites of herself and other women in
                  her life. She became we. Mary in her different incarnations was at once a woman philosopher
                  who argued for equal rights for the sexes, a melancholic yet heroic survivor of a
                  bad romance, and an “everywoman” who had suffered oppression due to sexual discrimination.
                  From her autobiographically inflected novels to her published letters to her political
                  treatises, Wollstonecraft’s various self-images led to countless public reimaginings
                  of the meaning of her life and writings for the evolution of feminism itself.</p>
               <p>One of the unsung, yet strikingly successful, political strategies of first-wave feminists
                  was to reclaim and repurpose negative memes of Wollstonecraft for the sake of fostering
                  the authority, public appeal, and internal solidarity of their women’s movements.
                  A veritable pantheon of first-wave feminist writers—Hannah Mather Crocker, Flora Tristan,
                  Lucretia Mott, Margaret Fuller, George Eliot, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony,
                  Olive Schreiner, Bertha Pappenheim, Elvira López, Ruth Benedict, Emma Goldman, Carrie
                  Chapman Catt, and Virginia Woolf—looked back to Wollstonecraft’s life and ideas as
                  an inspiration for their own pathbreaking storytelling and argumentation concerning
                  the political urgency of the growing cause of the rights of women worldwide. Immortalizing
                  in literature Wollstonecraft’s staying power as a feminist meme, Woolf wrote in 1929:
                  “She is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace
                  her influence even now among the living” (176).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.7">
               <p>Back in the twenty-first century, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai, and Emma Watson
                  are among the recent iconic counterparts to Wollstonecraft, the mother of modern feminist
                  memes. Hillary has taken a long journey of public refashioning of herself. Her career
                  has been a case study in cultivating political personae, beginning in the 1970s when
                  the star graduate of Yale Law School chose to support her husband’s aspirations for
                  the presidency rather than immediately pursue political office, and extending into
                  the 2000s when she used her years as a U.S. senator and U.S. secretary of state to
                  define her global political identity as the first competitive female candidate for
                  the U.S. presidency (Clinton i). While there have been many negative iterations of
                  the Hillary meme—often making the lame suggestion she is actually a man in drag, much
                  like Horace Walpole derided Wollstonecraft as a “hyena in petticoats”—these insults
                  have in fact fueled her visibility as a significant political actor on the national
                  and international stage (Walpole 337–38).</p>
               <p>Critical responses to misogynistic Hillary memes have also trained two generations
                  of feminists in the art of public defense of their favored political candidates. This
                  is true on the national as well as international level. In 2015, Malala undercut the
                  misogynistic meme of Hillary (or any woman) as unqualified to serve in the highest
                  political offices of the world: “Even in America, even in America, people are waiting
                  for a woman president” (qtd. in Porges). Malala’s own shifting self-narratives have
                  likewise made her, arguably, among the most influential international feminist memes
                  (and meme-makers) today. The youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize—awarded for
                  her death-defying advocacy of the education of girls against the wishes of the Taliban—Malala
                  now owns the internet when it comes to one of Hillary’s signature slogans, “Women’s
                  rights are human rights.” This political slogan is philosophically rooted in the watershed
                  arguments of Wollstonecraft’s 1792 book, <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (Botting, <em>Wollstonecraft, Mill</em> 1–17). Hillary’s signature meme and Malala’s iteration of it therefore reproduce
                  a venerable tradition of feminist argumentation dating to the French Revolutionary
                  period.</p>
               <p>Interviewed in 2015 by Emma Watson, U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador, Malala helped
                  to define feminism—a controversial word in her Islamic culture that she had carefully
                  avoided in her previous speeches and writings—in a way that would appeal to the broadest
                  possible audience. As she simply and clearly put it: “Feminism is another word for
                  equality” (qtd. in Vagianos). This slogan has since appeared under the image of Yousafzai
                  with Watson, and circulated in various mimetic forms on the internet—producing yet
                  another testament to the power of memes (and their makers) to thoughtfully and rationally
                  engage, and thereby advance, the ideas of feminism worldwide (Vagianos). The <a class="link_ref" href="https://images.app.goo.gl/DPWLdysDHNPXe4wYA">2016 Hillary presidential campaign</a> made a meme of this interview, with the text “I really think America needs a woman
                  president” superimposed on the GIF of Emma and Malala conversing. Though on one level
                  arguably parasitic, such a strategic appropriation of the Malala-Emma GIF demonstrates
                  the ways that feminist memes—like memes more broadly—grow and spread through symbolic
                  cross-pollination.</p>
               <p>During her 2016 campaign for the presidency, Hillary embraced this tradition of making
                  women (including herself) into positive memes for the sake of advancing women’s rights.
                  In response to waves of misogynist attacks from the Trump campaign, Team Hillary—both
                  her official and her grassroots campaigners—gave her public image a series of upbeat,
                  appealing, good-humored makeovers. A working woman who once looked down on baking
                  cookies became a <a class="link_ref" href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/70/8c/69/708c695f8786af87703c1a7c2eaf8e82.jpg">maternal executive</a>. The lying yet loyal First Lady became a strongly patriotic yet fiercely private
                  world leader. She rose from the ashes of the scandals of Lewinsky, Benghazi, and “emailgate”
                  to assume the pop-feminist incarnation of “<a class="link_ref" href="https://images.app.goo.gl/bKMmWy8WUvwuXdes7">Notorious HRC.</a>” Even as many wished her to go to prison for her cache of top-secret emails, a growing
                  number saw her “notorious” history as an asset in the dark and dangerous realms of
                  presidential and international politics. Neither a devil nor a witch, she became in
                  these memes a powerful stateswoman poised to do what it took to protect her nation
                  from threats both domestic and international. Called a “progressive hawk,” she was
                  represented as prepared to take down tyrants through special ops, beat a would-be
                  dictator in a high-stakes presidential election, and make hard yet sober choices to
                  defend her country’s security and other political interests on the global political
                  stage (Cassidy). Almost every negative or mocking image of Hillary was turned upside
                  down and transformed to advance her campaign for the presidency.</p>
               <p>Was it all for naught? However creative, funny, and smart they may have been, the
                  feminist memes made for Hillary’s 2016 campaign did not succeed in shattering that
                  last glass ceiling for women in world politics: the U.S. presidency. In a conservative
                  postmortem on the election results, Mark Lilla gleefully surmised that Hillary’s defeat
                  marked the end of “identity politics,” including feminism: no longer could liberals
                  assume that diffuse and abstract ideas such as “diversity” could successfully unite
                  people around concrete and viable candidates, platforms, and policies (Lilla).</p>
               <p>While nicely acerbic, Lilla’s critique of liberalism and feminism is (ironically,
                  for an intellectual historian) conveniently shortsighted. If he took the long view—all
                  the way back to the time of the French Revolution and its aftermath—he’d see that
                  other feminists, such as Wollstonecraft and many of her followers, had suffered grave
                  defeats and yet rose from the ashes, phoenix-like, in new, even more politically salient
                  forms. Against this background, the 2016 U.S. presidential election marked not the
                  end of feminism but the need for its rebirth in new political media.</p>
               <p>Those new political forms include the ever-malleable, though still potent, feminist
                  meme. If there is any lesson that Wollstonecraft and her many memes teach twenty-first-century
                  feminisms, it’s the power of rebirthing and reshaping old ideas through new words,
                  images, and media. Applying ourselves to this historic feminist task, especially in
                  the wake of defeat, is the only path toward a new, hopefully successful, form of democratic
                  politics that puts the protection of the rights of all people at its core. Sound familiar?
                  It should. For readers of Wollstonecraft, the path forward for twenty-first-century
                  feminisms will feel like an uncanny return to some of the guiding principles of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, which have been reinvigorated by the many mimetic iterations of the book and author
                  in the centuries since.</p>
