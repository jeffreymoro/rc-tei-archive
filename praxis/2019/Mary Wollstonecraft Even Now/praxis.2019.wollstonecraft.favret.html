            <p class="noCount">This essay uses recent feminist work on <em>Antigone</em> to investigate a feminist poetics within Wollstonecraft's <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em>, her last completed work. It simultaneously understands the Antigone we have inherited
               from the early nineteenth century as, in fact, following in Wollstonecraft's wake.
               The shared feminist poetics of these two works holds together grief and rage (as grievance)
               in forms that resemble melodrama and voices that claim to live <em>always</em>.</p>

                     and loss. In this liquid milieu, I learned about tears and thoughts too deep for tears.
                     Lately though, I find myself in a more desiccated landscape, lit with fiery rage.
                     When I was young, feelings of sorrow and rage converged; it seemed to me all one terrain.
                     The girl cried while fighting; she fought while crying. Now I stare at the response
                     emoji on Facebook where a face wet with tears sits apart from one burning with anger,
                     each a distinct emotional ecosystem. In these heydays of chaos, can’t we find ways
                     to hold together tears and anger, water and fire?</em></p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Part of this question I borrow from Stanley Cavell, as he considers “the unknown woman”
                     of Hollywood melodramas of the ’30s and 40s. Are we up to, he wonders, have we forms
                     of intelligibility strong enough to match “the heydays of chaos reaching our ears?”
                     (Cavell 45). For Cavell, the heroine of melodrama presents one such form. She figures
                     a specific kind of unknown-ness, he writes, in which she appears “powerless to make
                     [herself] known,” because in the current world she remains unwelcome on her own terms.
                     Equally unheard on her own terms, this misfit inhabits extreme states of structural
                     “voicelessness,” an incomprehension or suppression of her voice that can amount to
                     “suffocation” (43). In the isolation which attends the voicelessness of the heroine
                     of melodrama, Cavell discovers the source of her critical power, “her ability to judge
                     the world” (16). In addition to the unknown woman, other features distinguish these
                     melodramas: conversation brought to an impasse (particularly between woman and man);
                     a past that has been “frozen, mysterious, with topics forbidden”; and “the negation
                     of marriage itself,” especially “marriage as a route to creation” and happiness (6).

                     often lyrical expression of a woman’s suffocating voicelessness that we find the possibility
                     of alternate, alien forms of intelligibility, forms strong enough perhaps to match
                     our own heydays of chaos.

                  <p>The melodrama of the unknown woman is for Cavell an avenue to philosophy itself (“the

                     its gendered politics muted though not absolutely unvoiced (22).

                              and Feminism Without Women, Modleski offers an early feminist critique of Cavell’s
                              treatment of film melodrama. He responds to her charges in Contesting Tears (30–37)
                              even as he admits his “repeated reluctance to attempt to catch the tide of debate
                              on this issue of gender” (30).</span></div>
                     </div> Several feminist thinkers have effectively bent Cavell’s insights toward a consideration
                     of modern feminism, itself often unwelcome and unheard on its own terms. Like Cavell
                     they discover surprising resources embedded in melodrama. Lauren Berlant, Sara Ahmed,
                     and others have pinpointed the melodramatic “female complaint,” “feminist killjoy,”
                     and “affect alien” as agents of feminist and queer critique. To resist “getting along,”
                     to refuse to “move on” or align with conventional notions of progress and happiness
                     serves, in Ahmed’s words, to “expose the bad feelings that get hidden, displaced,
                     or negated”—and consequently unknown—“under public signs of joy.” If one recognizes
                     “the objects that promise happiness to be not quite so promising,” a coincident sadness
                     and anger may leap forth (Ahmed 38–39). Melodrama relies on those angrily sad and
                     sadly angry ones who, in Ahmed’s terms, are “prepared to kill some forms of joy”—
                     even if it requires, in some cases, killing themselves (50).</p>

               <p>These concerns—of sorrow as anger, of voicelessness as voices unheard—and the forms
                  for their intelligibility all meet in Mary Wollstonecraft’s last finished work, the
                  remarkable <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</em> (1796). The same concerns motivate Bonnie Honig’s revisionary reading of Sophocles’
                  <em>Antigone</em> for contemporary feminist political theory. Approaching the <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence</em> as Honig approaches <em>Antigone</em>, through the lens of melodrama, makes intelligible feminist possibilities in Wollstonecraft’s
                  most plaintive—and, I would suggest, quite angry—work, composed between her two attempts
                  at suicide. When we place Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters Written</em> alongside recent feminist work on <em>Antigone</em>, we begin to hear what is unvoiced or barely voiced in her writing. We discover a
                  vital and timely feminist poetics.</p>
               <p>In turning to <em>Antigone</em>, feminist scholars add a question prior to the one concerning forms of intelligibility:
                  do we have ears disposed to catch the un- or under-known, the un- or under-voiced?
                  When Sophocles’ heroine reflects, “I’m a strange new kind of in-between thing, aren’t
                  I? / Not at home with the dead or the living,” the Theban Chorus refuses to hear her:
                  “You’re too extreme / you reckless girl” (Sophocles 39). When Wollstonecraft, writing
                  to Gilbert Imlay after her first suicide attempt, writes: "I . . . seem to have no
                  home, no resting place to look to—I am strangely cast off," is she also too extreme?
                  Is he even listening? (<em>Works</em> 6:426–27). Wollstonecraft rewrote this and other letters from her travels in Scandinavia
                  for the published <em>Letters Written</em>. Even after reclaiming her letters, though, her questions persist: “Life, what art
                  thou? Where goes this breath? this I, so much alive?” (6:279). How much does her reader
                  hear in that cry?</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It may be a perverse thought, that a feminism derived from Sophocles’ <em>Antigone</em> can teach us something about Wollstonecraft. I want to pursue that thought, and also
                     reverse it, so that we find Wollstonecraft shaping the reception of a feminist Antigone.
                     Investigation suggests the story of Antigone had no direct influence on Wollstonecraft.
                     In his sweeping survey, <em>Antigones: How the Antigone Legend Has Endured in Western Literature, Art, and Thought</em>, George Steiner dates the start of the “Antigone vogue” almost exactly to the time
                     of Wollstonecraft’s death. He muses that she, Jeanne Manon Roland, and Germaine de
                     Stael share a “resonance” that anticipates Antigone’s subsequent Romantic appeal (Steiner
                     7, 10). Whether <em>Antigone</em> “resonated” with Wollstonecraft, whether she read or saw the play, remains unknown.
                     A student of the philosophical travelogue, she very probably read Barthélemy’s popular <em>Travels of Anacharsis the Younger</em> (1788), where, after watching Sophocles’ tragedy performed, Anacharsis stands exhausted:
                     “I had no more tears to shed” (qtd. in Steiner 7).
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                              (4)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Analytical Review, where Wollstonecraft often published, noted with joy the election
                              of Barthélemy, “the author of Anarcharsis,” “a man of letters, of genius, of sublime
                              views” to the French Directorate. 
                              “National Affairs,”
                              vol. 25, no. 6, Jun. 1797, 668.</span></div>
                     </div> Steiner finds this dehydrated “seminal passage . . . echoed” by Antigone’s male admirers
                     throughout the nineteenth century (7). We know that <em>Antigone</em> captivated German philosophers and poets circa 1800, that Wollstonecraft’s son-in-law
                     Percy Shelley later confessed his adoration for the play’s “godlike victim” (“Some
                     of us,” he wrote, “have in a prior existence been in love with an Antigone”); and
                     we know, thanks to Yopie Prins, that Antigone was an alluring figure for later “women
                     of Greek Letters” (qtd. in Steiner 10; Prins 234–36). Yet in eighteenth-century literary
                     circles, Antigone remained a minor character, seldom on stage and celebrated primarily
                     as devoted daughter or star-crossed lover, with no signal appeal for women intellectuals.
                     That Antigone had little appeal, found no audience, accords with a point she makes
                     herself: “O reaches of the plains of Thebes,” she complains, “no one sheds a tear
                     for me” (Sophocles 39). Wollstonecraft makes a similar cry, near the close of her <em>Letters</em>, “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted tear!’” (6:344).
                     This last, perplexing cry will return later, but for now it tells that the legacy
                     of Wollstonecraft, like that of Antigone, is tied up with the limits not just of intelligibility,
                     but also of tears: a melodramatic legacy.

                     to a historical moment she strains to transcend. Her persona—a single mother traveling
                     alone after a period of emotional duress, writing to an unresponsive “you”—appears
                     ripe for film melodrama, uncannily like the anonymous woman in Max Ophuls’ <em>Letter from an Unknown Woman</em> or Charlotte Vane in <em>Now Voyager</em>.

                     </div> Despite generic discrepancies, though, Antigone and Wollstonecraft do both serve as
                     icons for Western feminism: person and persona, melodramatic and tragic, larger than
                     life. It’s worth recalling Lacan’s thought that the “figure of Antigone forms part
                     of our [i.e., Western] morality” whether we know it or not; worth recalling too is
                     Honig’s conviction that “the idea that we [in the West] could . . . think politically
                     in ways untouched by [Antigone] is as improbable as Oedipus’s hope that he could .
                     . . live out his life . . . untouched by fate” (Lacan 284; Honig 37). By these accounts,
                     any feminist politics or moral philosophy <em>must</em> be touched by Antigone. Lacan’s thought and Honig’s conviction suggest a Wollstonecraft—and
                     a feminism—inevitably touched by tragedy, myth, and fatalism. They suggest consequently
                     the touch of timelessness brushing against any feminism living in time.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">

                     forecasts the image of Antigone forged by Schiller, Hegel, and subsequent writers:
                     a modern Antigone “emblematic of a programme of feminine emancipation and political
                     parity” (Steiner 9–10). If, for instance, one considers Antigone from the angle of
                     Wollstonecraft’s <em>Letters Written</em>, striking correlations appear. Neither woman “knows her place”: they insist on venturing
                     outside the walls of domestic space. Both stand—scandalously—outside the institution
                     of marriage. Both provoke comment that they speak like men. Both women find themselves
                     in a landscape riven by war and death. Isolated by grief, each announces her grievances
                     against the gendered lifeworld that surrounds her, a lifeworld that hardly responds.
                     Each obsesses about confinement, suffocation, and being shut up. Each identifies repeatedly
                     with birds and other creatures with wings.

                              (qtd. in Walsh 7).</span></div>
                     </div> Twice Judith Butler reflects on the play, in readings that respond to the last two
                     centuries of Western philosophical inquiry. Like her predecessors, Butler emphasizes
                     Antigone’s defense of the burial of her brother. But <em>Antigone’s Claim</em> (2000) also presents the heroine as the daughter of incest who loves her dead, traitorous
                     brother in excess of law, contesting thereby the assumed interdependency of laws of
                     kinship and laws of state. Antigone’s words, by which the monstrously “unspeakable
                     nevertheless makes itself heard,” are governed, Butler proposes, by catachresis, the
                     rhetorical figure or intelligible form which “exploit[s] the very terms . . . meant
                     to enforce its silence”: voicelessness voiced (<em>Claim</em> 78; also 82). In <em>Precarious Life</em> (2004), written in the early years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Butler again recommends
                     Antigone, this time as a model for mourning that crosses the lines of enmity and amity,
                     private and public, life and death. “Risking death herself to bury her brother against
                     the edict of Creon,” this latter Antigone “exemplifies the political risks in defying
                     the ban against public grief” (<em>Precarious</em> 46). (Like others, Butler mutes Antigone’s suicide.)

                     </div> Antigone’s classical status—that is, her felt timelessness—strengthens Butler’s claims
                     for a general sense of shared mortality, as Keri Walsh has argued. Antigone secures
                     an eternal return to the end of human life: as it has been, so it will be, ever-endingly.</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Butler’s meditations on mourning lean heavily on the expression I used to describe
                     Kreon: “beside himself.” To be “<em>beside oneself</em> with rage or grief”—Butler binds the two emotions—is to be <em>ecstatic</em>, she explains (<em>Precarious</em> 24). Ecstasy supplants catachresis as the chosen form of intelligibility.

                              outside, “beside,” the Agora, the space of democratic debate (Loraux 24–25).</span></div>
                     </div> Though she associates a politics of ecstasy with “the feminist and lesbian/gay movements”
                     of previous decades, Butler muses that perhaps such being beside oneself is “more
                     persistent . . . maybe it is with us all along” (24). Maybe it is classic rather than
                     historical. Here Butler finds the source of community: “Despite our differences in
                     location and history,” she remarks, “Loss has made a tenuous ‘we’ of us all” (20).</p>
               </div>
               <p>On this account, neither “I” nor “we” have much choice about loss; being exposed happens
                  inevitably—a circumstance that puts us within the ambit of tragedy. Butler accepts
                  that “any narrative of personal grief <em>would have to be</em> a story in which the very ‘I’ who seeks to tell the story is stopped in the midst
                  of the telling; the very ‘I’ is called into question by its relation to the Other
                  (23; emphasis added). Such acute self-consciousness echoes Kreon, the ruler, at the
                  end of the tragedy. Beside himself with grief, “seeking refuge from sovereignty,”
                  he acknowledges the flimsiness of “I”: “Take Kreon away / he no more exists than someone
                  who does not exist” (Honig 89; Sophocles 54).</p>

               <p>Via tragedy, Butler cultivates the timelessness of loss for the ecstatic state it
                  discloses, a state that was there all along. It must inevitably overwhelm each living
                  “I,” inviting it to become larger than life, more self-consciously mortal yet more
                  ecstatically—in grief, in rage—beside itself with others, living or dead (the distinction
                  hardly matters). But Antigone does not share this welcome fatality; Kreon does. Yes,
                  Antigone buries her outlaw brother. Yes, she embraces the dead as she heads toward
                  death. But the wailing lament she delivers is for herself. Voiced proleptically before
                  she dies, staged before the chorus, her dirge protests the sentence of death and calls
                  down vengeance. If Antigone claims timelessness, she does so by defiantly taking time
                  for herself. She leaves not on Kreon’s terms or timetable, immured in a cave, waiting
                  to suffocate. She refuses that fatal air. Instead she takes her own life, stealing
                  the sovereign prerogative. Coming halfway through the play, her suicide does not fulfill
                  tragedy. Her chosen mode of death is not inevitable.</p>

                  <p>My reading of Butler’s Antigone is prompted by <em>Antigone, Interrupted</em> (2013), written by feminist political theorist Bonnie Honig. In part a response to <em>Precarious Life</em>, Honig’s book cautions against the pull of “precarity” for at least two reasons.
                     First, because ecstatic grief risks blunting anger. In undoing sovereign power, that
                     is, grief can undo the contestation necessary to a vital politics.
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

                     </div> Second, Honig questions a humanism and feminism defined by fatality rather than natality.
                     She cites Hannah Arendt’s <em>The Human Condition</em> to claim that being mortal “does not mean that we are born to die.” By extension,
                     “the fact that we grieve does not mean that grief and grievability should be the center
                     of our politics” (Honig 119–20). Honig could have recruited Luce Irigaray as well,
                     whose most recent reflections center on Antigone’s devotion to a cosmically full life-world,
                     where the burial of corpses is an act of ecological responsibility. For Irigaray,
                     “The supreme value for [Antigone] is life. No other value can substitute for it: no
                     abstract ideal, no truth or absolute” (Irigaray 9).</p>
               </div>
               <p>In the light of natality, Honig recasts Butler’s ecstatic grief into fierce, combative
                  grievance. “<em>To grieve</em>,” she reminds us, “is both extra-political . . . and fundamentally political” in
                  often uncomfortable ways. “The term connotes mourning, resistance to injustice, reification
                  of wrong and,” she adds, “vengeance for it.” Grievance actively “takes sides” (120).
                  Such grievance ripples the surface, for instance, when Wollstonecraft warns her reader,
                  “I am sad . . . and have cause” (6:331).</p>
               <figure class="figure leftFloat"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/wollstonecraft/images/Favret_margin9.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:345px;"/></figure>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Within this layered sense of grievance in Sophocles’ drama, Honig finds active conspiracy.
                     She asks us to hear the link between <em>conspire</em> and <em>aspire</em> (perhaps <em>inspire</em> and <em>respire</em> as well): a shared breath of possibility (91). Conspiracy can offer a “mechanism of
                     change” within overpowering systems and structures. Partaking of both sovereignty
                     and vulnerability, conspiracy gives us “both more and less agency than we think,”
                     Honig argues (88). Attending to conspiracy, moreover, swings the weight of the play
                     away from the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">agon</span> of Kreon-Antigone to more intricate, lateral relationships between the sisters, Chorus,
                     soldiers, audience, and utterances of the play (88).

               <p>Both Butler and Honig borrow from the work of feminist classicist Nicole Loraux, whose
                  account of the mourning voice in classical Greek tragedy upends traditional scholarship.
                  In distinction from the rhetorical forms that hold Honig and Butler, Loraux attends
                  to poetics. In particular her discussion of the adverb for always—<span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">aei</span>—discloses yet another form of intelligibility where sorrow and anger fuse. By focusing
                  on the moments when Antigone forsakes the time of the present for the timelessness
                  of <em>always</em>, we can detect the feminist implications of Loraux’s insights.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>In ancient Greek, the value of always—<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span>—typically aligns with a vital force constantly regenerating itself. Émile Benveniste
                     characterizes it as “transitory and permanent, running out and being reborn in the
                     course of generations . . . subsisting forever in its <em>endlessly beginning</em> finitude” (qtd. in Loraux 28; emphasis added). We might think of it as the flip-side
                     to Butler’s ever-ending mortality. <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">Aei</span> usually signifies an <em>always</em> in time and full of time (<span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">saecula saeculorum</span>), derived from human measure, specifically the cycles of human generation. Designating
                     a regularly renewing identity that overrides superficial alterations, the adverb <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span> helps secure the ongoingness of an autochthonous State. It may be familiar to us as
                     the <em>always</em> of Burkean tradition (“always acting as if in the presence of canonized forefathers”)
                     or the permanence of the classics, or even as an ever-regenerating Romanticism (Burke
                     102). Yet in her very name, Antigone (<em>anti</em> [against]—<em>gone</em> [birth, offspring]) protests this sort of <em>always</em>. For her part, Wollstonecraft in the <em>Letters Written</em> famously imagines an end to human ongoingness, a time “when the earth could no longer
                     support [man]. Where was he to fly from universal famine? . . . The world appeared
                     a vast prison” (102).

                  <p>Loraux calls attention though to a mutant version of <em>always</em> alive in the tragedies, especially Sophocles’. There the adverb <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span> “does not belong to [humans]” but to the atemporality of gods immune to death. It
                     attaches particularly to passion and obsession, to madness, or, in Antigone’s case,
                     to what Loraux designates as a “rigid indeterminability” (or unendingness) for which
                     her world has no terms (31). Protagonists like Antigone export their grieving outside
                     the strictures of state law to the timeless realm of this other <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span>. Their “passion <em>lives</em> by claiming for itself <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span>, always, as its temporality” (32; emphasis added). Loraux’s choice of verb accentuates
                     the implication: the interminable griever grabs at a mode of life untethered to generation,
                     mortality, or fatality. In the tragedies <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">aei</span> issues “a repetitive de-negation” of “man’s destiny as mortal,” as “made of death”
                     (34). Such grieving flies against the Greek <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">polis</span> and its monopoly on <em>always</em>.

               <p>Such timelessness belongs to the gods—and to a lyric mode that presses beyond language.
                  It penetrates the sonic texture of tragedy, Loraux finds, each time the word repeats
                  exhalations of grief. <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Aiai</span>—an exclamation like “alas!”—reverberates in <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">aei</span> and in its combinations so that when, for instance, Antigone exclaims, “O home in
                  the ground forever,” the word signifying forever (άϴίφρουρο/<span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">aeiphrouros</span>) redoubles her plaint. The <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">aei</span> of <em>always</em> sings out in ubiquitous cries (<span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Aiai</span>), but also in internal rhymes, freighted moments of assonance, and frequent passages
                  of song. <em>Always</em> and <em>alas</em> thus conspire with the singing of choral refrains. Like Honig’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">adianoeta</span>, they are there waiting to be heard.</p>

                  <p>Loraux makes analogies between these phonic signals in the tragedies and oratorio

                     pulls her account close to a particularly Romantic form of intelligibility, by which
                     that era’s heyday of chaos reached many ears. Emergent even as Antigone assumed her
                     place in modern Western thought as “emblematic of a programme of feminine emancipation
                     and political parity,” even as the author of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> died from giving birth, that form is melodrama (Steiner 9–10).

                              and “to ‘tell all’” “mediat[es] the difficulty of expression—the many opportunities
                              for it to be suppressed, to go wrong, to be misunderstood” (Williams 363).</span></div>
                     </div> The verb “harping” only heightens this dialectical unease, suggesting on the one hand
                     that the letter-writer “repeat[s] or dwell[s] upon a subject to a wearisome or tedious
                     length” and on the other “play[s] upon a [harp] string, to make music” (OED). A killjoy’s
                     tedium to some ears may be stirring music to others. The OED cites a tone-deaf Polonius
                     calling out Hamlet for “harping still on my daughter,” the ambivalence of the word—dwelling
                     upon? playing upon?—opening up rich <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">adianoetic</span> possibilities. Are we to hear <em>Hamlet</em> in the letter-writer’s (ventriloquized) phrase? Wollstonecraft keeps such possibilities
                     alive throughout the letters, as she works various potential “you”s with and against
                     each other, her address veering from a tone of <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">entre nous</span> to subtle antagonism to stern command, as scholars have noted (e.g., <em>Letters</em> 176).

               <p> Many things could be said of the rhetoric of this passage—the switch to a “we” that
                  excludes “you,” for instance, and the explicitly feminist stance. I want, though,
                  to mark in its lyricism a premonition of the melodramatic and its service to feminism.
                  Not simply the posture of female complaint—what Lauren Berlant recognizes as “the
                  bitter vigilance of the intimately disappointed”—but the exploitation of lyric strategies,
                  that singing harp, make the narrator’s voice heard even when her audience wants not
                  to hear it (Berlant, <em>Complaint</em> 1). Melo+drama, of course, implies the mix of music with drama. Note the music of
                  Wollstonecraft’s closing chiasmus: “we reason deeply when we forcibly feel.” Pleading,
                  keening, and aggrieved, the writer plays upon one string:  “W<span style="font-weight:bold">e</span> r<span style="font-weight:bold">ea</span>son d<span style="font-weight:bold">ee</span>pl<span style="font-weight:bold">y</span> when w<span style="font-weight:bold">e</span> forcibl<span style="font-weight:bold">y</span> f<span style="font-weight:bold">ee</span>l” (<em>ee</em> , <em>ee</em>’, <em>ee</em>’,  <em>ee</em>, // <em>ee</em>’, <em>ee</em>, <em>ee</em>’).

                  forgetting. You may wake tomorrow and hear it still.</p>

                  <p>In <em>Cruel Optimism</em>, Berlant turns to genres such as melodrama to trace how they mediate “pressures of
                     the present moment on the subject’s sensorium”—Cavell’s “heydays of chaos reaching
                     our ears” (9). For Wollstonecraft, lyric moments similarly mediate or channel scraps
                     and bits of tragedy for the reader’s sensorium. The landscape of the <em>Letters Written</em> is littered with the dead, we recall: mummies, executions, soldiers training “to
                     slaughter and be slaughtered,” phantoms, hauntings, and everywhere the stench of rotting
                     fish. Wollstonecraft then fills the landscape with echoes of tragedy—Shakespeare’s
                     specifically. In addition to Lear (<em>Works</em> 6:310, 322, 414) and Macbeth (6: 252, 343, 378),  the letter-writer alludes to or
                     quotes the suicidal Prince of Denmark, as when we read, “the world’s a vast prison,”
                     or the lament that “war, and ‘the thousand ills that flesh is heir to,’ mow [men]
                     down in shoals” (6:336; also 253, 372, 277).

                     </div> Outside Tonsberg, the traveler enters a house, “the tomb of the Capulets” she calls
                     it, where “the worm riots . . . on the cheek of beauty” (6:285). In each case, the
                     well-known lines both recall and effect turbulence. Like Antigone, the radical egalitarian
                     writer claims identification with royalty and nobility; yet the words she quotes,
                     like those from <em>Lear</em>, attest to the futility of such distinctions: she sees “an effigy of majesty burned
                     down to its sockets” (6:322). Whatever authority remains in the form of tragedy <em>sounds</em> fractured, vestigial, and gothic, relics presented in a minor key. The tragic pose
                     thus risks sounding excessive, histrionic, overwrought: melodramatic. After all, this
                     is a travelogue: she’s on a <em>business trip</em>. Yes, her lover left her and their child, but it’s not as if anyone’s been killed.
                     . . .</p>
               </div>
               <p>Jeffrey Cox explains that in the Romantic era, the tragic hero can “only struggle
                  to become a hero,” alienated as she is from the “fully meaningful world of gods and
                  heroes” (Cox 158). If that’s the case, then Wollstonecraft, like the protagonists
                  of melodrama, declines the struggle. She borrows. She feints. She plays, as the advertisement
                  to her <em>Letters Written</em> confesses, the part of “<em>little</em> hero of each tale,” pluralizing her roles (<em>Works</em> 6:241; emphasis added). That pluralization has critical effect: for every reader
                  who might hear self-indulgent sentiment on these pages, others might hear the music
                  of unspoken acts of suicide, madness, and vengeance. Someone, something, <em>has</em> been killed, over and over again. Lyric strains and scattered echoes of tragedy sound
                  against a death-strewn landscape, giving the <em>Letters Written</em> an excessive or “extimate” dimension, allowing a timeless sense of grievance to intrude
                  upon a living present even as the traveler eats meals, arranges transport, and describes
                  the local customs of dress (Honig 149). If she cannot be understood in her owns terms,
                  she will collect, parrot, or take the language of an authority—tragic, mythic, aristocratic,
                  sovereign—an authority she knows and exposes as hollow.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>These are the tactics of melodrama, that “peculiarly modern form” born in France alongside
                     regicide, revolution, and “the loss of a tragic vision,” and carried to Britain in
                     1801 by Thomas Holcroft, sometime friend of William Godwin (Brooks 14).

                     </div> Honig acknowledges that the features she detects humming through <em>Antigone</em>—grievance, conspiracy, and the untimely lyric registers of the overwrought and inexpressible—all reverberate
                     within the distinctly modern mode of melodrama. If Honig imports melodrama into tragedy—in
                     order to construct a contestatory, natalist, and democratic feminist politics, open
                     to new publics—Wollstonecraft scatters tragedy into melodrama. Or at least, in the
                     hybrid form of her <em>Letters</em>—epistolary novel, travelogue, philosophical history, reverie, and memoir, threaded
                     through with the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">phonos</span> of tragedy and lyric—Wollstonecraft brings her reader to the verge of melodrama, searching
                     for a form to make grievance intelligible. The “waning of genre” on display in melodrama,
                     is not, Lauren Berlant reminds us, the waning of affect (<em>Optimism</em> 6). Tragedy declined, at least in Wollstonecraft’s declension, does not sacrifice
                     affective power. Nor does it slacken its reach for a passionate <em>always</em> on behalf of “the oppressed state of my sex.”</p>
               </div>
               <figure class="figure leftFloat"><img src="/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/wollstonecraft/images/Favret_margin13.jpg" alt="" class="graphic" style=" width:255px;"/></figure>
               <p>For if melodrama collects the vestiges of a tragic vision, in its Romantic moment
                  it also enacts “passion’s revenge” upon the sentimental mode so dominant in the late
                  eighteenth century (Chandler 34). With modern feminism, as I have sought to suggest
                  with and through Antigone and Wollstonecraft, melodrama demands the exhaustion of
                  sympathetic tears and their replacement with something more aggrieved. In her <em>Letters</em>, Wollstonecraft conjures tears several times, and readers have taken them as signposts
                  on a melancholy, sentimental journey away from the polemics of her two <em>Vindications</em>. With the help of <em>Antigone</em>, though, I hear something else raging through the letters of the wandering woman.
                  The female “I” invokes tears in a gestural, stylized way: “I wished for night to hide
                  the starting tears, or shed them on my pillow, and close my eyes on a world where
                  I was destined to wander alone” (<em>Works</em> 6:298). So stylized are these mentions that the incipient tears dwindle in the course
                  of the <em>Letters Written</em> to a single spare tear, no sooner summoned than disowned (“why starts the tear .
                  . . ?” [6:272]; “The tear starts . . . I must fly” [6:294]). Such considerations lead
                  back to the line encountered earlier, the closing gesture of the penultimate letter:
                  “Why should I weep for myself?—‘Take, O world, thy much indebted ear!’” (6:344).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The apostrophe to the world is itself indebted to Edward Young’s influential poem, <em>The Complaint, or Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality</em>, where it signals a selfless, religiously inspired sympathy (I ought to cry for you,
                     world, not for myself) even as it intensifies the speaker’s isolation from any fellow
                     feeling out there in the world. In Wollstonecraft’s hands, the isolation is compromised
                     by quotation: obviously, she and Young share this feeling (as does Wollstonecraft’s
                     heroine in <em>Mary, A Fiction</em>, who repeats the phrase). There’s an acknowledgment too, perhaps, of what her prose
                     owes to her reading of lyric poetry. More significant, though, is the fact that the
                     indebted line culminates several pages of mounting critique of “the whirlpool of gain,”
                     the love of profit, and the “baleful effects of speculation,” announced at the demoralized
                     end of a journey dictated, she implies, by “the commercial spirit” and paid for by
                     her correspondent, himself “strangely altered” from his immersion in war speculation
                     (6:340). In this context the language of sentiment, of tears exchanged, shows itself
                     tainted by the credit-debt system that has enveloped wartime Europe. More even than
                     the loss of tragic vision, melodrama exposes the bankruptcy of the sentimental. How
                     much debt does that circulating tear carry, travelling from one cheek to another like
                     a promissory note? Honig finds Antigone refusing her place within “an economy of citizenship
                     that domesticates desire, longing, pain and loss” (122; also 135); Wollstonecraft
                     carries that refusal from the domesticating economy of <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc" class="foreign">polis</span> to the sentimentalizing economy of capital.

               <p>The letter-writer calls up a sentimental tear—as she calls up tragedy—to dramatize
                  the expiration of its power. Like Antigone, she makes heard both sorrow and rage in
                  language that echoes and implicates and speaks out of bounds, in excess of herself.
                  In each case, with rhetorical sophistication, conspiratorial play, the sonic resources
                  of lyric, and a desperate desire to take what hasn’t been given her, the woman voices
                  her grievance against the state of the oppressed. She leans toward the melodramatic,
                  suggesting the power of that mode for an unending feminism.</p>
