            <p class="noCount">Ever since Paul de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured,” we have come to see Percy Shelley’s
               final, unfinished poem, “The Triumph of Life,” as a symptom of the end of Romanticism
               and Romanticism as end. If or once things are over, why bother to re-visit the end?
               This is one of many questions Shelley’s poem compels its readers to ask, which is
               in turn to ask why we any longer need to re-visit the poem at this a time when so
               little apparently rests on our doing so. So, as if to prolong the idea of an end (whatever
               that might be), this volume is comprised of four essays compelled to return to the
               same poem, as if to read the poem as a crime scene that leaves a barrage of clues,
               none of them adding up to a crime, but each lingering differently with Shelley as
               Shelley lingers with life and history and as we linger (or not) with the shadows his
               future casts (or not) upon our present moment, which seems more than ever beyond our
               grasp, if it ever was within our ken. Why even bother? But then again, and just in
               case: if so little and so much is at stake, why not?</p>

                  <p>Orrin Wang recalls one origin of this volume in his wonderfully generous response
                     to its suite of gorgeously searching papers on Shelley’s last poem. Apparently I posed
                     to him the notion that “certain Romantic texts require repeated unearthing and burial—require/compel
                     our productively melancholic attachment to them. . . . We just thought it would be
                     cool to devote a whole panel to one poem in order to demonstrate precisely its compulsive
                     hold on our critical imaginations (a la de Man).” “We” refers to a conversation over
                     drinks with Jacques Khalip at an earlier NASSR conference (likely Boston 2013), during
                     which I broached the idea of devoting an entire conference panel, maybe even an entire
                     book, to one Romantic text. It would (have to) be a text I felt that one could or
                     should not live without, one that sustained repeated intervention, not just across
                     time, but within the concentrated challenges of our present time. My wish included
                     texts whose monumental (dis)figuration by and through time left them as open wounds
                     within literary history that begged for the <em>pharmakon</em> of interpretation. Khalip and I agreed that the most compelling work, very much but
                     not only because of Paul de Man’s seminal reading, was Shelley’s last poem, very much
                     though not only because of the final “fold / Of” the text after it begs the question
                     it cannot answer, “‘Then what is life?’
                     <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                              (1)
                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Percy Shelley, The Triumph of Life, ll. 547–48, 544, from Donald H. Reiman and Neil
                              Fraistat’s Norton edition of Shelley’s Poetry and Prose. All subsequent references
                              to Shelley’s writing, except where otherwise noted, are from this edition, indicated

                     </div> Like Keats extending his “living hand, now warm and capable / Of earnest grasping”
                     (<em>Poems</em> 1–2), the question makes a return to the poem at once compulsive and compulsory, but
                     it was also our hope to lose ourselves in this final fold “without any irritable reaching
                     after fact &amp; reason” (Keats, <em>Letters</em> 43), not to avoid facts altogether but to stop making sense in ways the world seems
                     increasingly to demand of us. Or as Orrin answers when he asks, in his 
                     “Response”
                      to the following essays, “Why read?,” we do so “out of a Shelleyan love based on something
                     like the sensation of the impermanence of our selves and our readings, our cognition
                     and our somatic experience.”</p>
               </div>
               <p>I never thought this idea would go anywhere. Then Sonia Hofkosh, in typically generous
                  fashion, invited me to organize one of the KSAA panels at the 2015 MLA, Sonia Hofkosh,
                  thus indulging my fantasy, which resulted in 
                  “The Futures of Shelley’s Triumph,”
                  consisting of Libby Fay, Jacques, Tres Pyle, and Orrin’s response. The conversations
                  that preceded and proceeded from that experience, to which are added those with this
                  volume’s fifth contributor, Chris Washington, are of the kind that, any time I feel
                  jaded or disheartened about the state of our profession and field, reminds me that
                  even the apparently smallest exchange of ideas can recall us to what really matters,
                  which is a matter of our very survival. If that sounds melodramatic, I mean it to.
                  For “We just thought it would be cool” is symptomatic, not of our nonchalance toward
                  our field, profession, or work, but rather of our sense that chances need to be taken.
                  As de Man says of Shelley’s last text, “Questions of origin, of direction, and of
                  identity punctuate the text without ever receiving a clear answer” (95–96). Going
                  for broke in the absence of clear answers may be a sign of desperation (“Why are we
                  any longer doing this??”) that stimulants often help me to quell. It also begs the
                  question of why we debate the interpretation of works that few people might or will
                  or want to read. What could possibly matter? And yet at the same time, why not? <em>If</em> the world seems to care less about what we do as scholars, then who cares that we
                  do this as long as there remains a place and time <em>to</em> do this, of course. But where at least two are gathered in the name of challenging
                  the world’s premises, there remains, not a dangerously deluded hope for the future,
                  but the queer capacity of an at once posthuman and all-too-human experience that offers
                  a chance to redeem the everyday nature of our lives as a way of addressing the otherworldly
                  stakes of our existence. As Tony Kushner writes in the Afterword to his monumental
                  <em>Angels in America</em> (1995), “Marx was right: The smallest indivisible human unit is two people, not one;
                  one is a fiction. From such nets of souls societies, the social world, human life
                  springs” (158). When Shelley envisioned a maximum of five readers for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), one responds either with, “Poor showing,” or, “Good start.”</p>
               <p>The compulsion to return to Shelley’s last poem begins, of course, with Mary Shelley,
                  whose editing of <em>Posthumous Poems</em> (1824), partly an act of impossible mourning, included a reading version culled from
                  the manuscript her husband left behind. That version, included largely unchanged in
                  her subsequent edition of <em>The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</em> (1839), remained authoritative until the early 1960s, when G. M. Matthews and Donald
                  H. Reiman revisited Mary’s version in consultation with the original manuscript, now
                  in the Bodleian, to produce the text we now cite. Given the manuscript’s largely chaotic
                  shape (only the opening stanzas exist in a relatively fair copy state) these were
                  Herculean editing labors. T. S. Eliot called Shelley’s mind “in some ways a very confused
                  one,” but he thought <em>The Triumph</em> (1822) was the “greatest though unfinished” of Shelley’s poems, “evidence not only
                  of better writing than in any previous long poem, but of greater wisdom” (90). Arguing
                  that only finished works can legitimate the apparent trajectory and philosophical
                  system of a poet’s vision, Earl Wasserman ends his monumental <em>Shelley: A Critical Reading</em> (1971) with <em>Adonais</em> (1821), Shelley’s self-proclaimed “highly wrought <em>piece of art</em>” (<em>Letters</em> 2: 294). Taking up readings of <em>Triumph</em>’s nod to a Dantesque eschatology (Timothy Webb) and Petrarchan humanism (Desmond
                  King-Hele), Angela Leighton finds in the poem, “in spite of all its pessimism, a renewed
                  confidence in the act of writing as the only means of saving inspiration from that
                  perfection which is the poet’s loss,” a “prognosticated happy ending” (one remembers
                  Robert Browning’s point that Shelley would have found sympathy among the Christians),
                  a redemptive possibility that Harold Bloom or Richard Cronin, also taken up by Leighton,
                  read as a parody or obfuscation, respectively, of any such ideal (Leighton 150–51).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The above responses reflect our longstanding habituation, first pushed by Mary, to
                     Percy as a second generation Romantic torn between skepticism and idealism, undecided
                     if he wanted to reform the world or get beyond it, which tension reaches its highest
                     pitch in <em>Adonais</em> and seems to get attenuated differently as Shelley moves on to <em>The Triumph</em> where, as Balanchandra Rajan argues, Shelley, despite more than likely intending to
                     finish the poem, toys with what Rajan calls the “form of the unfinished,” how the
                     poem “movingly confesses [its] inability to pronounce on its own nature” (209). An
                     earlier study such as C. E. Pulos’s <em>The Deep Truth</em> (1954) mitigates this ambivalence by reading Shelley as what Hugh Roberts calls a
                     “progressively more ‘idealist’ skeptic” (2). This mediation, symptomatic of a post-WWII
                     reclamation of Shelley’s reputation in the wake (for instance) of F. R. Leavis’s attack
                     on Shelley in <em>Revaluation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry</em> (1936), esteemed Shelley’s vatic power and poetic talent, though with a deepening
                     understanding of the dangers and excesses of his political and aesthetic idealism.
                     For Ross Woodman in <em>The Apocalyptic Vision of the Poetry of Shelley</em> (1964), <em>The Triumph of Life</em> presents an “Orphic vision of an annihilated world” (198), a mythopoeia that for Harold
                     Bloom in <em>Shelley’s Mythmaking</em> (1959) achieves its “final aspect” in “that the myth, and the myth’s maker, are fully
                     conscious of the myth’s necessary defeat” (275) by existence itself. This Shelleyan
                     apocalypse without millennium at once haunts and anticipates deconstruction’s influence
                     on Romantic studies, on full display in Bloom’s 1979 <em>Deconstruction and Criticism</em>, which contained Derrida’s and de Man’s landmark essays on <em>The Triumph</em> . De Man’s essay in particular attends to the poem’s fragmented, inchoate form as
                     a sign of how the weave all human endeavor remains frayed by history, a rather telling
                     sign of both Shelley’s and our crisis-ridden times. How and where does one now situate
                     Shelley’s disastrous text as a text both about and <em>of</em> disaster, as Chris Washington explores in his essay for this issue? The poem’s incessant
                     questioning of origins and identities, what Tilottama Rajan after de Man calls its
                     attention to “questioning, doubting, and emergent knowledge,” becomes symptomatic
                     of what she calls Shelley’s “purgatorial imagination . . . that derives its power
                     from the very manner in which it finds itself containing the reality that is to deconstruct
                     it” (<em>Dark Interpreter</em> 63, 71).

               <p>Deconstruction partly urged a revaluation of the epistemology and ontology of Shelley’s
                  formal strategies. For William Keach in <em>Shelley’s Style</em> (1984), Shelley’s verse, particularly its complex use of rhyme in <em>Triumph</em>, constitutes the productively ambivalent form of his thought, not as philosophical
                  system but as open-ended intellectual (r)evolution. For Ronald Tetreault in <em>The Poetry of Life: Shelley and Literary Form</em> (1987), the poem’s “desire for a reassuring certitude with which anxiety [for a center]
                  can be mastered” necessarily fails, but still with the confidence that “even in an
                  age of deconstruction poetry may still teach us how to live” (257). Perhaps above
                  all, critical responses to the poem thereafter had to contend with what was seen,
                  either generatively or critically, as deconstruction’s missed encounter with history.
                  Reading de Man reading Shelley reading, Orrin Wang (1996) calls <em>Triumph</em> a “disfigured monument” poised at the “limit of its historical and critical consciousness,”
                  unable to “resolve . . . the final form of its narration” (64). For Hugh Roberts in
                  <em>Shelley and the Chaos of History</em> (1997), Lucretian materialism offered Shelley a new model of history and its political
                  rhythms as a ceaseless becoming that reflects the “entropic and negentropic aspects
                  of evolutionary process” (406), which Amanda Jo Goldstein’s <em>Sweet Science</em> (2017) reads in terms of <em>Triumph</em>’s complex reciprocity between life and its symbolic manifestations, thus offering
                  a Shelleyan biopolitics of life. In <em>Shelley and the Revolutionary Sublime</em> (2005) Cian Duffy discusses how the poem’s representation of post-revolutionary change,
                  influenced by aesthetic theories of the sublime, questions the failure and subsequent
                  deadlock of imaginative will in transforming the political and historical landscape.
                  And in what is arguably the most significant single study of Shelley’s writing in
                  the past three decades, <em>Shelley’s Process</em> (1988), Jerrold Hogle reads the conflict of interpretations generated by this ineluctable
                  traversal between art, life, and history as transference, the nomadic principle of
                  Shelley's aesthetics as history’s drive, most powerfully in his final poem. In <em>The Supplement of Reading</em> (1990) Rajan reads this shifting principle of thought and representation in <em>Triumph</em> as neither loss nor recovery: “Fading is not disappearance, but something more haunting:
                  a presence that cannot be located and yet cannot be definitively renamed as absence
                  so that we will cease searching for it” (347). William Ulmer (1990) reads this lost
                  object (that can’t quite be called “lost”) as the force of eros behind Shelley’s politics
                  and its idealism. Stuart Peterfreund (2002) reads this longing for transcendence post-deconstructively
                  as the latent if unfulfilled spirit of Shelleyan verse, a potentiality Leighton targets
                  as a moving acknowledgement and commemoration of loss, which is for her the poem’s
                  “real triumph” (175).</p>
               <p>History, love, loss: binding this dizzying array of readings is our desire to know
                  what Shelley might have thought, felt, and intended when writing his final poem. Here
                  I imagine what Walter Benjamin might have been thinking and feeling when he wrote
                  his late theses on history, as if to remind a world that wasn’t listening why the
                  very history that could consume us was also, paradoxically, the one that mattered.
                  Benjamin’s survival was rather more precarious than Shelley’s. However, as if trapped
                  within history’s Janus-faced reality, realizing there could be no Archimidean point
                  from which to view and thus gain <em>some</em> kind of purchase on its onslaught— on history itself—Shelley struggles to see and
                  say his way through to a different materiality of things, which struggle we find ourselves
                  in the midst of. In <em>After Finitude</em> Quentin Meillassoux contemplates the existence of what he terms the “‘arche-fossil’
                  or ‘fossil-matter,’” which “indicat[es] the traces of past life . . . but [also] materials
                  indicating the existence of an ancestral reality or event” (10), like the luminescence
                  of a star reaching us after billions of years of light travel. Ancestrality indicates
                  a “world devoid of humanity” (127), which for Meillassoux challenges “the idea according
                  to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and
                  never to either term considered apart from the other” (5), which entails the Kantian
                  idealism that we can think the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ding an sich</span> of being, but only from the perspective of thought.</p>
               <p>Wrestling thinking from being demands that we think a being beyond our thought of
                  being, on its own terms, as it were, which is to say prior to its own “givenness.”
                  In Meillassoux’s wording, this is to locate “that outside which thought could explore
                  with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign territory – of being entirely elsewhere”
                  (7). Contemplating a thought beyond correlation, and thus after finitude, in Washington’s
                  powerful summation (in another context), “reveals an aporia that exists in both philosophy
                  and science: our inability to account for a world outside of us without, paradoxically,
                  accounting for it” (450). Shelley’s earlier <em>Queen Mab</em> (1813), attempting to account for the empiricism of this ancestral temporality by
                  taking its reader to the verges of the cosmos and of Shelley’s idealism, tarries with
                  this rift between being and thought, yet remains within the hope of making one commensurate
                  with the other. But in <em>Triumph</em> Shelley finds that being in the midst of the everyday experience of history leaves
                  him on the “foreign territory” of an attempt to exist <em>within</em> a history always out of our reach precisely <em>because</em> we exist in its midst. Thus abandoned, we are left to express an “inability to account
                  for a world outside of us without, paradoxically, accounting for it.” We are also
                  left with thought alone—with the being <em>of</em> thought, which Shelley expresses enigmatically as “thoughts which must remain untold”
                  (<em>Triumph</em> 21). To read Meillassoux perhaps somewhat differently, the matter of history is the
                  matter of ancestrality <em>now</em>, a being within being that cannot be thought, but also a thought within being that
                  has a being of its own that cannot be thought. History itself <em>is</em> the being Shelley needs to think his way into and out of, without ever touching upon
                  its foreign materiality in which he nonetheless finds himself enmeshed. Accounting
                  for this point resonates with the following essays’ various points of entry: the “queerly
                  erotic openness” of Jacques Khalip’s last look, the “beyondness” of Libby Fay’s detached
                  attachment to/attached detachment of the sensuality of verse, the glimmering phenomenality
                  of Tres Pyle’s account of the poem as minor event, Chris Washington’s exploration
                  of the physical immateriality of light and love.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>To move us toward a future of living on, with, and at the borders of history is to
                     dwell with what Denise Gigante calls Romanticism’s “uncontainable vitality” (6), which
                     at the same time expresses the killing moment of life’s disposal, feeding upon itself
                     as waste product, like the ruins of Saturn’s temple in Keats’s revision of <em>Hyperion</em> (1820) as <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> (eventually published in 1856) and or Shelley’s chariot as it plows on remorselessly,
                     senselessly, irrevocably. At the end of <em>Perestroika</em>, the second half of Kushner’s <em>Angels in America</em>, Prior Walter is offered the Tome of Immobility, the promise of an eternal existence
                     without suffering. The Angel warns Prior that life has become a “habit,” the result
                     of which will be a devastation equal to Byron’s “Darkness.” Having survived the devastation
                     that was dealing with AIDS in Reagan’s newly dawning America, his pre-Trump stab at
                     Making America Great Again, Prior is momentarily enticed. But to move deathwards toward
                     no death is to give into the defeat that the sheer lack of response to the dead and
                     dying demands, or rather quietly, implicitly, assumes. How to respond to the being
                     of death from within the living, a foreign territory that cannot be thought, although
                     death sure has its own thoughts on the matter. Which may be why Prior embraces, however
                     precariously, the promise of more life:

                     life?” The question stopped me dead in my tracks, as it were. How not to heed the
                     siren call of the biopolitical, to prolong and thus fetishize life against all odds,
                     as Tetreault’s reading suggests?

                     </div> What do we do to others in the name of protecting <em>homo sacer</em>, of making of life, like Moneta’s sanctuary, an inviolable temple to the stillborn
                     ruin of a life never surrendered? How to break the addiction to being alive? How to
                     refuse the call for more life now that we are confronting not just our personal deaths
                     but our extinction as a species?</p>
               </div>
               <p>Which got me thinking about what “just the animal” means in Prior’s speech. Can anything
                  matter to us if it isn’t somehow a deprived, destitute, or an uncannily vital reflection
                  of life? In <em>Adonais</em> Shelley is momentarily stunned by the creatively melancholic vitality of Keats’s
                  decaying mind—the necrophagia of life feeding on itself. Left among the living to
                  lament, Shelley is like Urania, who in one of Romanticism’s most freakishly gothic
                  scenes attempts to revive her son’s corpse by, according to the post-Oedipal logic
                  of Shelley’s poem, re-seducing him. Beware of mothers who fetishize life. According
                  to Shelley’s psychoanalysis of the circuit of creative desire, having killed the thing
                  she loved, the mother attempts to re-ingest it in a kiss—a word, as Khalip’s paper
                  reminds us—that fills the mouth with desire’s lost object. In this scenario what refuses
                  to cede its desire is not woman, but desire itself, or rather desire minus desire—sheer
                  drive, the mindlessness of words, which needs no object and instead wanders aimlessly
                  but irrevocably in its aimlessness. Despite its seemingly transcendental trajectory,
                  the poem laments Absolute Spirit, its dark and fearful affect materializing the move
                  past the loss of a history left behind once and for all. In <em>Hellas</em> (1822) when Mahmud describes “This firmament pavilioned upon chaos” (772), we’re
                  taken back to the future of <em>Queen Mab</em>, which finds Shelley already unable to resolve the empirical with the transcendental
                  and thus begins a move toward something like a Deleuzian horizon that unfolds the
                  transcendence of empiricism, the restlessly moving still point at which experience
                  at once appears and vanishes.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Put another way, the spectacle of <em>Adonais</em>— which includes a necrophilic muse, a poet acting like St. Sebastian, and a finish
                     that smacks of Busby Berkley, in which the “white radiance of Eternity” (463) smashes
                     the “dome of many-coloured glass” (462)—is a mere tryout for <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. Here the products of history are continually folded into a sheer visuality that
                     at once materializes and dematerializes our lives. Urania as desire becomes the Shape
                     all light and “fire for which all thirst” (485), not as lost object but as sheer drive.
                     Shelley awakens us to the performance of history itself, in which we “pant,” “sink,”
                     “tremble,” and “expire” on a daily basis (<em>Epipsychidion</em> 591). Here <em>Triumph</em> anticipates the invention of the film musical form, but fast-forwarded to versions
                     that expose the insidious post-capitalist logic of its visual and aural interpellation
                     of our subjectivities, the endless production and reproduction of perceptual information
                     about the human condition that leads us nowhere except along the infinite horizon
                     of our perpetual demise.

               </div>
               <p>In a brief, brilliant analysis of the aesthetic in Freud and Lacan, Alenka Zupančič,
                  addressing the difference between the uncanny and comedy, argues that whereas the
                  uncanny tarries with possibility of the lost object’s return as desire, comedy “point[s]
                  to the irreducible materiality of nothing” (59), by which she means, not the naming
                  of nothing as ‘something’ in order to give it symbolic consistency, but rather the
                  “<em>remainder</em> of nothing, . . . nothing as insisting/emerging in the real, while being deprived
                  precisely of its symbolic support” (60). This leaves nothing as a “‘mere hole,’ which
                  is to say—an object. It is a nothing that, literally, remains (there) to be seen”
                  (71). Like the gaze that cannot see itself, as Zupančič notes, thought cannot think
                  itself, hence, perhaps, for Shelley it “must remain untold.” For Zupančič this paradox
                  speaks to the “vitalism of the death drive. That is to say, the vitalism of the internal
                  <em>contradiction</em> of (human) <em>life</em> itself. Far from referring to something in us that ‘wants to die,’ or that aims at
                  death and destruction, the Lacanian notion of the death drive refers to an excess
                  of life itself . . . the reason that the subject can never be reduced to the horizon
                  of her death” (74). The death drive indicates not “that something of our life will
                  go on living on its own when we die” but rather “that <em>something of our life lives on its own as we speak</em>,” the “logic of <em>constitutive dislocation</em> (as immanent nothing)” (75).</p>
               <p>In the last years before my mother passed away, just shy of 91, she would repeatedly
                  ask me, “Why am I still here?,” as if to rebut Carlotta’s defiant anthem, “I’m Still
                  Here,” from Stephen Sondheim’s <em>Follies</em> (1971), for me one of the most moving and painful evocations of what it means to
                  risk love in response to the nothingness of loss, and thus to risk the nothingness
                  of love itself. My response: “I have no idea.” And at that we would both laugh. She
                  felt—she knew—she was taking up space and time, and witnessing the reduced habits
                  of her daily existence, I could not disagree. On that count we were brutally, fatally,
                  happily frank with one another. I spent her final hours at her bedside in the company
                  of my man, a nurse, her son-in-law, all three of us tacitly agreed on the need for
                  and relief of acute palliation. As she drifted off and away, he clinically, quietly,
                  beautifully mapped out for me the contraction and departure of life and warmth from
                  her withered extremities—sites of impossible contemplation—to a place I imagine reduced
                  to a still point somewhere around her heart and lungs. When the departure was complete,
                  and because through her eyes I learned how film was one of the few ways to transform
                  life’s dull round, I though of the end of <em>Adonais</em> re-imagined as the ending of Spielberg’s <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> (1977) when the spaceship contracts to a still point in the sky, then shoots across
                  the horizon, far beyond the rainbow where suffering, decrepitude, hunger, and intolerance
                  plague what we so quaintly call the human condition. Unable ever to know where life
                  went at that moment, I also experienced what I imagine Shelley imagined in his encounter
                  with what “remained” of Rousseau, or what Meillassoux means by an encounter with the
                  fossil matter of ancestrality, though not as Meillassoux intended it. Living past
                  hope, contemplating an “inability to account for a world outside of us without, paradoxically,
                  accounting for it,” my first thought, which is to say the thought that emerges only
                  once the dust and ash have settled, was: “I’m still here.” That is to say, I felt
                  “the vitalism of the internal <em>contradiction</em> of (human) <em>life</em> itself.”</p>
               <p>When Shelley, who drowned in the Bay of Lerici with <em>The Triumph of Life</em> unfinished, decided to ask, then, “What is life?,” he was asking of a future whose
                  shadows the poem casts upon our present: Why are you here? Why are you doing this?
                  What is the importance, and devastation (again, pace Benjamin) of even asking the
                  question in the first place? Are you reading me? Do you care? Does it matter? Yet
                  to mind the gaps in the representation of historical reality—to miss something another
                  human being said (in this case, a rather capable poet)—might just tell us something
                  about our present (in)capacity <em>to</em> say. When de Man drew our attention to the fact that Shelley’s dead and decaying
                  body, inscribed at the end of Shelley’s last manuscript, was as essential to our understanding
                  of the poem as the poem itself, he reminded us of what still needed to be heard. To
                  which I would add: what needs to be <em>felt</em> about our present state of being, to which Khalip, Fay, Pyle, Washington, and Wang
                  remain exquisitely attuned by turning from spectators to actors in the scene of the
                  poem’s life that is the remainder of nothing. How they express the soul of our intellectual
                  lives feels rather more urgent than it did at the time Khalip and I first libated.
                  Let’s call it a call simply but urgently to indulge in doing what we do: restlessly
                  examine the interpretive possibilities of responding to a great artist’s response
                  to the world, with the understanding that no one might care. As I listen with careful
                  and troubled attention to the question of what <em>should</em> matter in our present climate, I’m compelled to ask, why not this, at this present
                  time? It can’t be any more consequential or inconsequential. And now I leave my contributors
                  to voice the virtual reality of what it might mean and feel like to exist at once
                  within and past the Anthropocene. To them I say and thank God or the gods or whomever
                  or whatever might have orchestrated the situation to which this critical folly responds:
                  I’m glad you’re here – still.</p>
