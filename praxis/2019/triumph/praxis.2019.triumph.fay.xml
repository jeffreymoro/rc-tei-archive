                <p rend="noCount">Focusing on the import of the last four lines of <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title>, <title level="a">Rhymes of Wonder: Otherness without Distortion</title> explores the
                    possible future that lies beyond the horizonal walling off of a triumphal Life that
                    Shelley’s poem describes. Using Deleuze and Guattari to follow the traces of where
                    dizzying speed can get us, the essay suggests that Shelley was headed with full
                    speed toward the post-human, breaking off only with the stumble that inevitably
                    occurs when human language fails to articulate what it cannot imagine. What remains
                    is sound, the aural-oral capacity that tunes us in to life itself, to a living
                    nature that cannot be captured by words yet within which we are thoroughly enmeshed.
                    This is the enlightenment that Shelley’s poem gestures toward, against optically
                    driven scientific knowledge; against the human condition as totalizing knowledge;
                    against the impermanence of the material. Whereas the main part of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                    considers forms of self-willing within the human experience,
                    it’s abandoned final lines suggest that Shelley intended to reread the alienating
                    aspects of that self-willing as the first steps toward an alternate otherness that,
                    in its beyondness, holds out the promise of a freedom from the human as a freedom
                    from the distortions of suffering per se.</p>

            <p> This article is a prolonged meditation on the last four lines of Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, composed between May and June 1822,
                lines which begin to fragment with the occurrence of two ellipses, until the final
                “Of” that begins the fifth, uncompleted line midway though the final stanza Shelley
                wrote, leaving the poem unfinished at his death.<note place="foot" resp="author">All quotations from

                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> asks us to extend,
                extemporize, dwell in the dizzying rapidity of movement of life’s march of time.
                Rather than imagining this “triumph” as a slowed version of suffering and
                humiliation, enslavement to the imperial corporate body, Shelley imagines a vertigo
                of motion, a sweeping up of humanity into the vortex of a fateful present. This
                sense of intense movement begins with the first lines: “Swift as a spirit hastening
                to his task / . . . the Sun sprang forth” (1–2). Even though the imagery is
                apparently bright, it is darkened by the “mask / Of darkness,” which though falling
                with the Sun’s speedy approach, also prevaricates. For far from a mere masking of
                what is essentially bright with the dark, this mask is both the masque of darkness
                that will be the triumphal march of the Poet’s vision as a hideous parody of human
                life controlled by ideological oppressions, and a prelude to the dark imagery of the
                poem throughout. It is not long before the Poet’s vision, “that trance of wondrous
                thought” (41) which is a blind seeing rather than insight (for the Poet-I is
                confused by the spectacle until his guide, Rousseau, provides an interpretive key),
                beholds “a great stream / Of people . . . hurrying to and fro,”

            This is the temporality spaced by Derrida’s différance, the spacing of time best
                articulated through writing (and writing’s necessarily ideological inscription of
                our experience) that wards off the possibility of futurity through infinite
                recursion to the past. Later I will discuss how metalepsis functions in the poem to
                break from this recursive bondage to a blind historicity in which nothing is
                learned, only repeated. What the triumph represents is a veritable negative or
                negating infinity of time that wards off a possible future-to-come, not just
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">l’avenir</foreign> but “the urgency and imminence of an
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">à-venir</foreign>, a to-come. . . inflecting or turning into an
                injunction as well as into messianic waiting the <emph>a</emph> of a
                    différ<emph>a</emph>nce in disjunction” (Derrida,
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title> 108).<note place="foot" resp="author">Although this
                            is Derrida’s formulation of a futurity both imminent and insistently
                            waiting, I believe it is one that haunts Shelley’s late poetics and
                        <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> in
                    particular.</note> The problem the poem poses and begins to attempt to
                resolve is that of breaking the frame created by such a negative spacing, a spacing
                envisioned as an insane flight hemmed in by chaos and fear, so as to stage an
                eventfulness that could usher in a post-Anthropocenic seeing. Such
                seeing-without-distortion would mean a sightedness that is blind to the distortions
                of a self-serving logocentrism.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is this kind of
                    sightedness that I believe Derrida is after in both
                            <title level="m">Memoirs of the Blind</title> and <title level="m">The 
                                Animal That Therefore I Am</title>, and that Shelley
                            is after with his confessional and self-erasing portrait of Rousseau in
                                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>.</note> History,
                Shelley suggests, tells us nothing about the forces that corral us along this
                flightpath that turns back on itself in a temporality that goes nowhere, because we
                do not learn its lessons. But it is this horizon determined by the past—the horizon
                of finitude instantiated by différance and the automaticity of human reaction to
                anything finite&#8212;that Shelley puts in doubt by way of the poem’s dream state. Such
                doubt opens up the Enlightenment frame, with its insistently finite horizon
                developed from the history of western epistemology and political ideologies, to
                other possibilities, and I read Shelley’s unfinished poem as already enmeshed in a
                post-human turn. The poem’s project becomes, in the end, to discover a way out of
                the scientifism that had stalled thought in its seeking of an alternative to the
                negative structure of logical postulates, and to chart a path between Humean
                skepticism and a Kantian walling off of being&#8212;two philosophical attitudes that mark
                Shelley’s intellectual thought thus far, but against which the <title level="m">Triumph</title> 
                finally crashes in its last stanzas. It is in the poem’s
                provisional ending that an overleaping of the two positions begins to manifest.</p>
            <p> Shelley’s visionary poem, in the moment of its apparent crashing against the walls
                of Hume and Kant, wants to, desires to, locate in an epochal terminus an
                un-distortion of otherness. The terminating question Shelley asks in 
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, which the poem itself has asked
                throughout&#8212;“Then, what is Life?”&#8212;suggests the possibility that otherness-in-itself
                lies not on the other side of subjective, anthropocentric limitation and finitude,
                but elsewhere. This is a free-range understanding of Life that absorbs the human
                into it. Such an elsewhere would eschew the need to stage the contest between idea
                and substance, a contest Shelley sedulously avoids in his poetry (except in dark
                works such as <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819), but for a different purpose.
                This elsewhere imagines what Derrida’s democracy-to-come might inscribe anew. Or it
                might imagine this if the poem could be finished, could be differently written, if
                its terms could be thought.</p>
            <p> My interpretation of the question provisionally prompting the poem’s ending&#8212;a poem
                foreshadowed by the Poet asking “And what is this? / Whose shape is that within the
                car?” and Rousseau’s answer, “Life” (177–78, 180)&#8212;rests on a Derridean reading of
                the ghostly presence of its guide. Rousseau is marked by his “disguise” of “an old
                root” of “strange distortion”&#8212;recalling the “mask of darkness” that hides another
                version of what is there at the poem’s beginning (204, 182–83), but also indicating
                his having been marked by the distortions of the Derridean trace, the writing that
                rewrote Rousseau as a misguided corpus. In revisiting Derrida’s reading of Rousseau
                I hope to illuminate why it is this philosopher Shelley finally singles out from
                those he had considered equally as important in earlier drafts.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    In <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured,</title> de Man uses Reiman’s archival work in
                            <title level="m">Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of
                            Life</title></title> to reduce the philosopher-guides to a single one, Rousseau, a
                            significant revision in the poem.</note> Although Rousseau had
                indeed been part “of that deluded crew” following the triumphal car, he asks the
                Poet to “forbear / To join the dance, which I had well forborne” through a “deep
                scorn” (the scars of which he bears on his corpse-corpus) which “Led me and my
                companions” to resist the mad dance of Life (188–89, 191). Or rather, Rousseau and
                his few companions have scorned the machinations of the arche-trace, the insistent
                rewriting of which the poem accuses “those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire, / Frederic,
                and Kant, Catherine, and Leopold, / Chained hoary anarchs, demagogue and sage”
                (235–37). In <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> Derrida is less kind to
                Rousseau, seeing him as being one of the spoilers, but nevertheless granting the
                philosopher pride of place as the middle term between Plato and Hegel for his
                foreseeing analysis of logocentrism as the erasure of presence through writing, the
                animal-machine of reading and rewriting that is our automaticity, our reactive
                blindness. Écriture allies us in our auto-blindness with the four-faced, eye-banded
                charioteer of Shelley’s triumphal car, the figuration of Life itself, since like him
                we cannot see beyond the perimeter of our own insistent spacing and deferrals of any
                possible future.</p>
            <p>Derrida’s reading of Rousseau’s importance rests on a grammatology as all that can be
                thought within the limits of the scientific épistémè; indeed, within the limits of
                the Anthropocene. But I suggest that <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> asks
                Rousseau to help move the dream vision beyond such perimeters, into a different
                plane with a different horizonal potential. In <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                Rousseau acts as the speaker’s Virgil, interpreting the pageant, discovering its
                trace and spectrally pointing a finger to a different horizon unconditioned by
                scientifism’s rejection of passion as way of knowing. But for Derrida, Rousseau is
                always unsettled by his incorporation of the supplement into a theory of human
                nature, always undone by passion’s unsettling priority over need. Despite Rousseau’s
                attempts to settle passion into its place, passion’s prewriting in the business of
                survival and articulation becomes, in Rousseau’s anthropological scheme, inverted
                (articulation as subdivision of sound and meaning, understanding and reason, that is
                “the opening and closure of a cleft” [Johnson 128], according to Derrida, or the
                making of a judgment). The <title level="a">Essay on the Origin of Languages</title> (1743) asserts love’s
                role in the immediacy of touch (versus the mediacy of gesture), and love’s role in
                inventing drawing as well as, plausibly, language (“Love might also have invented
                speech”)&#8212;but if it is need that in general motivates language, “Dissatisfied with
                speech, love disdains it” (Rousseau 240–41). However, pity is the passion more
                befitting Shelley’s Rousseau; pity is the moderation of amour-propre (self-love,
                which is a corruption of amour de soi, love of self) into compassion. If the <title level="a">Essay</title>
                places judgment before pity, the <title level="m">Second Discourse</title> (1754)
                makes pity anterior to reflection. Thus need (in which reflection prompts the
                preservation of the species) follows passion (love of self, self-love, and pity),
                communication displaces sympathetic communion. Shelley’s spectral vision shows the
                detrimental effects of not following this scheme&#8212;of species preservation distorted
                by language’s death-grip, of self-love’s violence absorbed into linguistic warping.
                Rousseau makes this point explicit: “What the ancients said most forcefully they
                expressed not in words, but in signs; they did not say it, they showed it” (<title level="a">Essay</title>
                241). Language as the first social institution, according to Rousseau, is founded as
                a distancing trope, as not just sign but metaphoricity, with the need to communicate
                by gesture logically displacing the passion of an immediate touch and voice,
                following after it (“the needs dictated the first gestures, and the passions wrung
                the first utterings [<foreign xml:lang="fr">voix</foreign>]” [245]). This unsettling, in which
                need overrides passion only to install death into language as distance and metaphor
                rather than touching intimacy, disturbs the provenance and authority of signs
                (articulation and writing are the malady of language, it’s “fatal advantage,”<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">Rousseau uses this phrase to describe writing’s supplementation of both speech and
                            music, quoted in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 199.</note>
                    and if “the most vigorous speech is that in which the Sign has
                said everything before a single word is spoken,” too often symbols lose their
                meaning and power to the condemning inefficacy of “circumlocutions” [241]). Rousseau
                therefore distrusts words as he does not the accentuation of music, and the musical
                intonation of poetic speech, both of which are more originary and less dangerous
                than writing because less destructive of presence (the very thing “Life” robs from
                human being in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>): “The speech of the first men . .
                . were Poet’s languages” (245). But for Shelley, if poetics is grounded in musical
                intonation, <emph>poesis</emph> is grounded in the affiliation of sound
                with metaphoricity, in the sound’s affinity in relation to the sign’s differential
                potency, its gesticulatory capacity&#8212;indeed, in its imaginative intimacy. 
                    <emph>Poesis</emph> as allegory&#8212;as resounding metaphoricity&#8212;provides the
                only recuperation of presentful meaning possible in the face of language’s
                onto-theological death-grip (a fate Shelley sees as written on Rousseau’s
                body/corpus before his conversion by confession).<note

            <p> That Shelley, an astute deconstructionist before the fact, would choose Rousseau to
                interpret life’s pageant puts into question Rousseau’s idealization of love’s power,
                of life’s perverting evil, and of shadows. In Derrida’s terms the first two are
                <emph>eidos</emph> and <emph>ousia</emph>, ideality and
                substantiality; shadows encompass the enfolding of one with the other, the
                space-time of otherness.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    <emph>Ousia</emph> is also translated as <emph>being</emph>, but 
                    Derrida specifies substantiality as Rousseau’s
                    understanding of the term (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>
                            18–26).</note> What is less doubtful than Rousseau’s
                idealizations is his facility with the legible, with locating and reading
                (interpreting rather than deciphering) the trace at the site of supplementarity.
                This is the site for Rousseau, Derrida argues, of unease, suture, inversion, and
                perversion. But Shelley’s Rousseau offers a different instruction; rather than point
                back to origins, his ghostly finger-pointing gestures not 
                <emph>toward</emph> so much as <emph>beyond</emph> current epistemic limits;
                predictive, pre-vocative, provoking an elsewhere as a way out of the metaphysical
                trap of signs and beyond the Anthropocene. If Rousseau himself saw gesture as less
                meaningful than either touching voice or metaphor, it is because it is also less
                immediate, but Shelley’s Rousseau points intimately and tellingly otherwise&#8212;at once
                confessional and prophetic. The lines, “Before the chariot had begun to climb / The
                opposing steep of that mysterious dell, / Behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme”
                (469–71), indicate the nature of this beyondness which is not the supplement but
                rather its abolishment; the wonderment of rhyme is exactly its inscription of
                accentuation, music, and most importantly, passion&#8212;“the wondrous story / How all
                things are transfigured, except Love” (476). Shelley asks us to follow the index of
                this passionate trace as it avoids inversion, perversion, transfiguration, and
                supplementation, since it names the absorptive beyondness that the poem’s breaking
                off cannot or does not yet know how to inscribe, but toward which, with Rousseau’s
                help, it gestures.</p>
            <p> Such a gesticulation is necessary to ward off the blindness, the necessary
                not-seeing, that Derrida takes as the essence of philosophical discourse without
                which the aporias of the metaphysical tradition cannot be overcome, yet it is a
                willful blinding that prevents the leap out of, and beyond, the épistémè. Shelley
                has already understood this in making Rousseau not blind but hollow-eyed, “And that
                the holes it [he] vainly sought to hide / Were or had been eyes” (187–188). The
                philosopher-seer’s eyeless state is precisely what allows him to guide the
                poet-dreamer in “forbear[ing] / To join the dance” of “this sad pageantry” (188,
                176), and in forbearing the Poet might then refuse the auto-machine of a discourse
                that closes down on itself. Derrida’s designation of what he calls the
                animal-machine of reading and rewriting that reacts with automaticity is essential
                to his concept of the trace as the infrastructural articulation of the arche-trace,
                or interdependence of self and Other without which presence cannot be conceived. It
                is the interplay between the self and its objects presumed essential to human
                self-consciousness, but that Shelley might view as essential to an unconditional
                hospitality, an open-door policy with regard to the unconsciousness’ or visionary
                state’s capacity to witness suffering as the condition for the possibility of
                change, and therefore of futurity. In <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> the
                trace of writing does not produce what for Derrida is the double finitude of the
                animal-machine of écriture, but rather creates fault lines and openings in that
                structure, fragmentations and ellipses, open doors as it were. The visionary state,
                which elevates the poet-speaker into what Kant, in one of his rare non-despoiling
                moments, considers the highest stage of beautiful art, enables a poetry in which the
                sublime interacts with the beautiful, moves beyond the unlawful freedom of the
                imagination adjudicated by the lawful restraint of the understanding&#8212;although not
                perhaps beyond the infusion of both with spirit so essential to a lingual art that
                delivers more than it promises, as Kant notes&#8212;making it thus more moral than the
                other arts (<title level="m">Critique of Judgement</title> [1790] §51).</p>
            <p> Shelley’s most moral poem, a quality noted even by Mary Shelley who appeared not to
                like the poem, pushes beyond a mere liminality ordained by the sublime register. Its
                transgressiveness suggests the violence inherent in a sacrificial structure. The
                structural ploy I have in mind is Derrida’s concept of autoimmunity as the
                auto-immunitary function that mediates a supposedly untenable open or unconditional
                hospitality, a welcoming that puts the self at risk. This is not the threat of the
                sublime but that of sacrifice as what holds sovereignty up: sacrificial
                indemnification. The sacrifice of objects and others is what enables the
                auto-immunitary function that closes opened doors and protects the subject and its
                proper/properties. What gets sacrificed in the poem is not just the endless stream
                of suffering humanity hurried on by a frenzied cosmogony, the very essence of a
                sovereignty gone mad with its own immunitary logic; populations are sacrificed so
                that the door to futurity remains firmly closed. </p>
            <p> Shelley’s response, I am arguing, to the free-wheeling auto-machine of
                logocentrically grounded sovereignty is to imagine the advent of the future-to-come.
                His imagining cannot be of an ideal republication state, as is Rousseau’s in 
                <title level="m">The Social Contract</title> (1762), nor may it be of the impossible
                event of an unconditional democracy as the truth of the other, as is Derrida’s in
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title> (2005). Instead, Shelley’s poem prepares for the
                possibility of an unforeseeable future beyond the horizon of state ideology, a
                horizon containing all of western history and epistemology since Plato. To imagine a
                horizonal “beyond” is not to envision a distinct event as such (e.g. revolution),
                nor an “outside” impervious to the auto-immunity of the political machine which
                casts itself as “Life.” It is rather to imagine the leap to a new plane of immanence
                made possible, according to Deleuze and Guattari, by a new idea. This evental idea
                or philosophical concept must go beyond the truth-idea of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> 
                (1820), love as a revolutionary force, since <title level="m">The Triumph</title> 
                announces no program of patient waiting after
                Rousseau has imparted his revelation to the Poet. Indeed, the idea ushering in the
                to-come may not be open to articulation, as the disintegration of language in the
                final lines indicates.</p>
            <p>In the auto-immunitary machine epitomized in the Car of Life, suffering is the
                predominant human experience. Rousseau, hovering in the ectoplasm of
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> and bearing the marks of that
                suffering on his body, represents by his oeuvre the lawfulness of the understanding
                interceding in the unlawful freedom of the imagination. Such remediation is of
                course problematized by the autobiographical Rousseau’s unaccountable outrages of
                taste in his ongoing self-psychoanalysis, but these disappear along with his fleshly
                form in the poem, where his corpus stands in for a Derridean “auto-immune
                auto-indemnification” that authorizes sovereignty at every level (Derrida, 
                <title level="m">Acts of Religion</title> 78).<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">Derrida develops this concept more fully
                            in <title level="m">Acts of Religion</title> as what underlies the
                            doubled-nature of “identity,” which not only includes and excludes, but
                            “ex-propriates” and “re-appropriates,” that is, “ex-appropriates” (78).
                            He analyzes the concept more simply as “auto-immunity” in 
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title>.</note> But dead, ghost-like,
                Rousseau’s role in sacrificial indemnification is revised by way of his own dead
                body marginalized from the multitudes in Shelley’s dream-vision. This vision
                produces an altered state, a poetic possibility in which sovereignty is unveiled as
                a mad careen destined to slam up against the walls of its own horizon; the
                alteration makes possible a different plane in which doors might open, in which an
                unconditional hospitality does not usher others in to the spaces of the proper, but
                rather welcomes the ground of the possibility of a futurity not yet imagined. The
                unlawfulness of the imagination is not, as Kant believed, an ugliness not subject to
                the dictates of taste, but rather the dismissal of a necessary adjudication of
                justice by law. For Shelley, law can only be evil by referring justice to the
                dictates of pragmatism, the proper of the subject self, and sovereignty. How can
                what might only be called an immunitary rationale for limiting the application of
                justice ever ground a futurity at all? We might view this as the difference between
                a marriage that necessarily mediates love by way of pragmatism, and a free love that
                opens the door to an unimagined relation, to a commingling without adjudication, to
                a truth without a past. Such an analogy might indeed sit behind the inexplicable
                poor taste of the poem to Jane probably written before two-thirds of 
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> had been completed.<note place="foot" resp="author">

            <p>The implications of a new plane of immanence&#8212;inaugurated by the evental idea as
                having to do, for Shelley, with freedom, democracy, and the unconditional (perhaps a
                democracy-at-hand),&#8212;and the possibilities for a post-human turn in such a plane;
                this is a prospect at which language falters and poetic sound and metaphor can only
                carry partially inscribed meanings. However, in these falterings I believe Shelley
                is struggling to sound out his vision for a more humane, if less
                logo-onto-anthropocentric, futurity. To think the ending of the poem, I want to
                return to the implications of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>’s maddened
                and dizzying progress. That speed is essential to a new plane of immanence
                developing. One of the ways to speed up while still inhabiting the structures of the
                past is metalepsis, the two-at-once of metaphoric achievement. If metaphor provides
                an analogous relation, a side-by-side correspondence of idea and impression,<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">This is Reiman’s reading of Shelley’s use of metaphor: idea corresponds
                            analogously to impression, but not to object or to thing-in-itself
                            (<title level="m">Shelley’s <title level="m">Triumph</title></title> 10).</note>
                metalepsis imposes an inverted correspondence in which
                logic skews otherwise. The possibility opened up by the dizzying movement of the
                triumph, by way of its reversion to the past, begins to dissolve not into a metonymy
                but into a metalepsis, in which two tropes at once&#8212;a doubled metaphoricity (the
                fading coal <emph>and</emph> the mind’s inconstant wind of the poetic
                imagination in Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> [1821]
                [531])&#8212;oppose the double finitude of écriture by “reconfiguring the relationship
                between a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ an anteriority and what this anteriority makes
                possible or forecloses,” as Kir Kuiken explains, allowing the imagination, or we
                might say the poetic dream state, to be the site-source of “ever-changing future
                alterations” (171). Metalepsis as the poetic device by which the future can open up
                by way of the past&#8212;rather than via metonymy’s side-by-side logic&#8212;becomes in 
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> the condition of the possibility of a new plane
                with a new horizonal opening to the future. I am imagining Shelley imagining Deleuze
                and Guattari’s plane of immanence, wherein the speed of thought is made possible by
                the constellation of the event to come configured in the evental concept.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">For Deleuze the event is epiphenomenal, spoken in the proposition; “The concept
                            speaks the event, not the essence or the thing” (<title level="m">What
                                is Philosophy?</title> 20). See esp. pp. 35–60.</note> It is
                this concept, this eventful thought, which opens the poem’s horizon to a positive
                infinite, to a futurity that can be thought without the trace, albeit not without a
                repurposing of the past and its necessary conceptual contributions. The dizzying
                vision of the pageant is accessible to the speaker-poet as insight, so that “speed
                in the van and blindness in the rear” which brings the suffering multitudes so
                “little profit” offers the speaker a way into an undistorted and thus possible
                futurity (Shelley 101, 100). </p>
            <p>Access to this futurity requires a variant eye, for blindness is the cancellation of
                what makes representation possible. Not blindedness, as in the charioteer, but the
                cancelling of sight, like Rousseau’s hollowed eyes, is the condition of seeing out
                of this world, Life as it is. Although Rousseau gestures toward the past, he is the
                guiding hand in the poem toward an as-yet to be represented future. As Derrida
                notes, portraits of the blind are “prey to <emph>allegory</emph>,” the
                allegory of drawing as a “specular folding” or “withdrawal [<foreign xml:lang="fr">retrait</foreign>] 
                in meaning of itself,” whereas language “always speaks to us 
                <emph>from / of the blindness</emph> that constitutes it” (<title level="m">Memoirs of 
                    the Blind</title> 2–4).<note place="foot" resp="author">David Farrell Krell’s meditation on
                            Derrida’s meditation, <title level="m">The Purest of Bastards</title>, has
                            informed my understanding of blindness as having a different knowledge
                            structure.</note> Shelley makes clear that such
                blindness&#8212;specular folding or blindfoldedness&#8212;is the condition of life as well as of
                language. For Rousseau, as Derrida reads him in <title level="m">Of
                    Grammatology</title>, the contamination of nature’s purity is already enfolded
                within nature; thus, everything associated with the human that Rousseau designates a
                supplement is already enfolded in nature, including the sign. Similarly, the
                possibility of a future, not as a blind acquiescence and error in judgment, but
                rather as the sublime <emph>yes</emph> of an unconditional welcoming of
                the yet-to-come is also enfolded, a <foreign xml:lang="fr">repli</foreign> of the
                outside/future is always folding over into the origin of life. But Shelley does not
                “read” Rousseau: in allowing him to tell his recursive tale of conversion, he
                portrays him allegorically, allowing him the specular folding of seeing otherwise.
                He does so because the problem for Shelley is how to welcome such a future without
                deferral, without supplement&#8212;or at least, with a different relation to the outside
                and otherness. For this, the Rousseau who Shelley depicts is helpful. What Derrida
                calls spacing, or the endless deferral of meaning, is a scuttling back and forth in
                the differentiating machine of language that, if unattended, also blinds us to just
                how non-meaningful a life lived can be; it enables the headlong careen of the
                pageant of Shelley’s allegory of unmeaning life. The differentiating machine can
                only under extraordinary circumstances leverage the scuttling of meaning into the
                dizzy rapidity of thought that energizes a new plan of thought, a plane of
                    immanence.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            The plane of immanence is “the horizon of events,” or evental concepts:
                            “The plane of immanence is not a concept that is or can be thought but
                            rather the image of thought, the image thought gives itself of what it
                            means to think” which stands in contrast to “the slow brain” (Deleuze
                            and Guattari, <title level="m">What is Philosophy?</title> 36–37).</note>
                It is such a plane, such an immanence, that Shelley’s poem invokes but cannot see in
                its last elliptical lines. But it is what Rousseau, by gesturing toward the past,
                helps Shelley’s speaker metaleptically envision, if only in its barest contours, as
                the cliff walls of wondrous rhyme. </p>
            <p>“What is Life?” Shelley’s speaker asks, struggling blindly with the
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">repli</foreign> of death into Life, the supplemental sacrifice that protects and
                indemnifies life.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Ross Wilson, <title level="m">Shelley and the

                origin and life to certain biological forms, while sentience itself has become less
                definable. Shelley’s possible future, predicated on opening the door to a new plane
                of immanence, holds open the possibility that a just world without suffering might
                be possible. Shelley the vegetarian might have embodied such a world with
                non-objectified subjects that, regardless of their species, would not be required to
                supplement the idea of justice with their suffering. Such a world, however, would
                have to be free of the deferral or spacing of writing. Of the endless play of
                differentiation that inscribes the world we know. To depict a different world, one
                not yet visible, would require a new writing without deferral, hierarchy, origin
                fables, distinctions that wound. For Shelley, such a world could not yet be
                written&#8212;but the ellipses, the “. . .” that punctuate the last portion of the poem he
                <emph>did</emph> write, mark where the leaping off
                into a new writing might occur, where a new concept might gather itself for an event
                to come of wondrous rhyme and otherness without distortion.</p>
            <p>It is this last impossible concept, arising from the dismantled self of Shelley’s
                later thought, of the impossible possibility of otherness without distortion (a
                radical otherness against which language falters) which coheres with the
                unspeakablility of an impossible future. A new plane of immanence requires the event
                to come, the unpredictable and thus unspeakable event, which might recall before the
                fact what must not be said (or, what might be too terrible to be said). This is the
                gamble, the leap of blind faith into the future that Shelley’s vision demands.
                Again, it demands it blind-fully, and unvoicedly.</p>
            <p>I want to move in three directions at this point (a point is a departure that permits
                new paths to the horizonal limit&#8212;and it is the limit at which Jean-Luc Nancy says
                that freedom begins in <title level="m">The Experience of Freedom</title>). First,
                blind faith recollects Derrida’s ruminations on allegories of the blind; second,
                unvoicedness resonates with both Plato’s khora and Derrida’s engagement with
                apophasis (the voiceless voice)&#8212;both blind faith and apophasis also have
                associations with Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing and gesticulations; and finally an
                impossible futurity gestures toward Nancy’s and Derrida’s articulations on freedom
                at the limits of experience. I cannot do justice to all of these; rather, I want to
                fold in these more recent mediations with Shelley’s perspicacious, pliable, and
                concise weaving of blindness, faithfulness, unvoicedness, limits, futurity and
                freedom in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>.</p>
            <p>In <title level="m">Rogues</title> Derrida defines the khora politically: meaning
                originally “locality in general,” khora designates “spacing, interval . . . another
                ‘taking-place’” that Plato conceptualizes in the <title level="m">Timaeus</title> (c.
                350 BCE), but also a beforehand, “a spacing from ‘before’ the world . . . from
                ‘before’ any chronophenomenology” (xiv). The irony of our world is that it is
                precisely the khora-interval that allows “anthropotheological dogmatism or
                historicity” to take place without “providing any ground or foundation” (xiv); khora
                “would make or give <emph>place</emph>” (xiv). In this retrospective
                placement of the politico-theological and historicized now, Derrida nevertheless
                posits khora’s relation to the anticipatory function: it is “before everything,”
                part of no-thing while giving rise to what is, “it would give rise or allow to take
                place” (xiv). It is therefore, perhaps metaleptically, the very stuff of what is to
                come, and perforce related to “the unforeseeability of an event that is necessarily
                without horizon, the singular coming of the other, and, as a result, a 
                <emph>weak force</emph>. This vulnerable force, this force without power,
                opens up unconditionally to what or who <emph>comes</emph> and comes to
                affect it” (xiv). Because the khora is fully other in its non-being, in its spatial
                anticipation, it offers a place in which futurity can begin to be thought&#8212;but not
                the space of that futurity, and this is Shelley’s point. It is only at the limits
                that futurity can even be gestured toward. </p>
            <p>Shelley begins that gesture even before Rousseau points his finger. The problem in
                the poem’s opening stages is that of the multitude following the arrogantly
                blind-ful charioteer: suffering as they are in their maddened dance, they are
                themselves “the truth of the other, heterogeneity, . . . disseminal multiplicity,
                the anonymous ‘anyone,’ the ‘no matter who,’ the indeterminate ‘each one’” that is
                the other truth of democracy (or liberality, or freedom) that opposes the autonomy
                and ipseity that we hold dear to democracy (Derrida, <title level="m">Rogues</title>
                14). To see these whirling and convulsed dancers as suffering, and as heteronomic
                rather than a blind and frenzied mob is to begin to distinguish genius (embodied in
                Rousseau, albeit skeletally) from the no-matter-who of a future-to-come. This is the
                gesture already in place by the time Rousseau appears pronouncing “Life,” so that
                the speaker-I must begin again, “But first, who art thou?” (180, 199). First causes
                cannot be the grounds of freedom, and Rousseau’s explanations cause the speaker-I to
                understand that “God made irreconcilable / Good and the means of good” (230–31).
                Kant who himself delved the abyss of freedom is included in “those spoilers
                spoiled,” which also include Voltaire (235), those reasoners and mechanists who have
                brought on the “Sorrow, terror, anguish, despair . . . [that] are often the chosen
                expressions of an approximation to the highest good” (Shelley, 
                    <title level="m">Defence</title> 529). Such a future-to-come must, by the stopping point of
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, open up to the whoever-comes and not just the
                select few and self-chosen. The courage required to welcome such a future is
                wrenching; its unvoicedness both compels, in the sense of the apophatic call, and
                stops short, in the sense of an illegible moment. In both cases language fails, as
                it does for the multitude whose frenzy is all that can be expressed; the future must
                be wrenched from the past at such a point, it must exceed the promise held by all
                pastness and go beyond the breaking point. </p>
            <p>Frenzy, then, must be part of the breaking of the limit, the push beyond the grounds
                of the triumphal careen. That the speaker stands apart from both the multitude and
                the frenzy does not preclude his taking part in futurity, a partaking that may
                already be beginning with the fragmentation of words into ellipses. As Derrida
                notes, “<emph>ellipsis</emph> names not only lack but a curved figure with
                more than one focus. We are thus already tween the ‘minus one’ and the ‘more than
                one’” which is “<emph>the time there is not</emph>” (<title level="m">Rogues</title> 1).
                The time there is not, which may be the escape from finitude
                for Shelley, is at least in terms of <title level="m">The Triumph</title> the
                possibility of an impossible future. Such an impossibility requires dizziness to be
                sure. It also requires blind faith, “Fidelity to come, to the to-come, to the
                future” (Derrida, <title level="m">Rogues</title> 4). There is
                reason for this since the “to-come of democracy is also, although without presence,
                the <foreign xml:lang="la">hic et nunc</foreign> of urgency, of the injunction as absolute
                urgency” (29). Such urgency demands a leap into the to-come, possibly even a new
                now. That is to say, a new plane of immanence that cannot be foreseen or even seen
                at all during its formation: a dizzying something which requires hollow-eyed
                determination without the possibility of prediction. </p>
            <p>Significantly, the Poet’s encounter with Rousseau, and Rousseau’s narrative take up
                the majority of the poem. As the Poet and reader learn about Rousseau’s encounters
                with the “Shape all light” (308–433), we also learn that he has been translated by
                that shape, becoming increasingly hollowed out. He is metamorphosed, in de Man’s
                words, to a state “in which his brain, the center of his consciousness, is
                transformed” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 99). Whereas Rousseau’s recurring focus is on the
                “Shape all light,” de Man reads the Poet as avoiding the shape-light through his
                narrative fragmentation at the unsubstantial end or leaving off of the poem. Such a
                reading suggests the ending might be unsubstantial in the sense of a dissolving
                substance akin to what de Man describes as the light’s “hovering motion” (<title level="a">Shelley
                Disfigured</title> 105), or it might be insubstantial (not a fading dissolve but an
                incorporeality). While both are plausibly true, and the poem itself plausibly
                readable as a problem of the specular fold that enables rather than prohibits
                insight (“Happy those for whom the fold / Of” are the last words of the poem),
                <note place="foot" resp="author">I refer here to Gilles Deleuze’s reading 
                of Leibniz’s system in <title level="m">The Fold</title>.</note> the ending also contains the kernel of
                the whole poem&#8212;not as fragment but as ellipses, as points of departure for a leaping
                out of the spatio-temporal horizon of the poem. De Man is largely concerned with
                language in the poem, both as rhetorical figure and as disfiguration, but as
                Rousseau himself points out in his essays on language, time is the essential medium
                of language creation. De Man recalls Rousseau’s (and Levi-Strauss’s) theories of
                language in writing about the violent linguistic acts that occur in the poem, each
                more damaging than the violence depicted in the triumphal parade itself; the poem is
                eventually revealed to be a “mutilated textual model [that] exposes the wound of a
                fracture” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 120). It is a wound that de Man finds at the heart
                of all texts, although Shelley might want the fracture traced back to the collusion
                of writing and ideology rather than mitigate the potential for poetic language to
                burst its bounds. But Rousseau and Levi-Strauss were more of de Man’s opinion; as
                Derrida notes, what the father of Romanticism and the father of structuralist
                anthropology (who declared himself to be “Rousseau’s modern disciple”) comprehend in
                their fraught relation to writing and presence is that the violence that language
                suffers in writing is not a “disease” inherent in speech and not separable from it
                that precipitates its fall, but rather “the original violence of a language which is
                always already a writing” (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 105–6). But the
                violence is in itself a disease, a genetic self-destruct mechanism and it is this
                disease that Shelley’s poem narrates. Neither Rousseau’s writings nor the voiced
                narrative embedded in the poem remain, or rather count, by <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title>’s end. Counting is how Shelley’s fragmentary ending records
                language’s demise; its self-violence is played out neither as the figure of a
                hollowed-out (diseased) Rousseau nor as his “recapitulative” narrative in which
                logic dissipates,<note place="foot" resp="author">This is de Man’s phrase, <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title>
                    103.</note> but as language’s final failure to capture through
                anything but its own erasure&#8212;its ellipses&#8212;what might speak itself beyond “Life”’s
                horizon. </p>
            <p>This ellipses is related to Rousseau’s hollowing out: diseased by the light’s erasure
                of his self-consciousness, of his presence as writing and as predecessor figure,
                Rousseau himself is reduced to a periodic gesture, like beats in a measure rather
                than Cartesian stopping points (for Descartes, points stop things dead; Shelley’s
                Rousseau continues to move after death). Translated by the light into an ellipsis of
                himself, Rousseau’s hollowing is of his self-presence, his consciousness as center
                of self; he thus sets the stage in the poem for the transfiguration (not
                translation) of the narrative at the end into ellipses. Derrida writes that the
                “other ellipsis of the metaphysics or onto-theology of the logos” is the “effort to
                master absence by reducing metaphor within the absolute parousia of sense”
                (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 106). “Onto-theology” is, importantly, the
                very beast Shelley is trying to eradicate in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>; for
                Shelley this is the real disease of language, subjectivity, self-consciousness, and
                knowledge that creates the horizonal parameters of a “Life” that enslaves us. To
                imagine reducing or dissolving metaphor into sensory presence (absolute parousia) is
                to elide the pronunciative function of language, its rhythms and beats matching the
                rhythms and movement of sensory presence. In the
                <title level="m">Essay</title> Rousseau had pronounced language
                to be the first social institution (219), but as such it is a disfiguration that
                cannot hold in its literalization of meaning, its denial of language’s capacity for
                metaphoricity, for figuring truth. As de Man notes in <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in
                the Lyric,</title> “truth is a trope.”<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, 241.
                    Quoted in Cynthia Chase’s <title level="a">Double-Take.</title> The reference is to
                            truth-statements as philosophemes, but for Shelley truths are poetic
                            tropes, metaphoricity.</note> Rousseau’s translation from
                self-consciousness into a forgotten selfhood is accompanied by metaphors for light
                that offer little narrative reason; their illogic exposes the absence language
                covers over, stripping away the onto-theology Rousseau himself had come to figure
                and revealing another truth.</p>
            <p>Metaphor, Derrida notes in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>, is irreducible
                despite all attempts at mastery (allegory is decidedly metaphoric in this sense)
                (106); de Man proves this irreducibility in his reading of the “Shape all light,”
                and its own narrative logic. More intriguingly, interpreting Rousseau’s history of
                illuminating confessions by way of metalepsis&#8212;as a metaleptic recursiveness&#8212;allows
                for the movement that will transform or curve itself into the new evental idea of a
                possible democracy that is without logocentric, androcentric, and anthropocentric
                distortion, and thus a new paradigm. This movement is the leap to a new plane of
                immanence at the poem’s ending. De Man notes that the question and answer enacted by
                the figures of Rousseau and the Poet (the question of “‘whence I came, and where I
                am, and why&#8212;’” in line 398, accompanied by the same vision) is that of “a question
                whose meaning, as question, is effaced from the moment it is asked,” in the
                structure of a forgetting (98). For de Man, this repeating pattern of question,
                effacement, and forgetting (rather than question and answer) functions like a knot
                that “arrests the process of understanding” (98). For Shelley, Rousseau the writer
                has, “in a sense . . . overcome the discrepancy of action and intention that tears
                apart the historical world, and he has done so because his words have acquired the
                power of actions as well as of the will.” His words “literally, are actions” (de Man
                103). But <title level="m">Triumph</title> undermines this
                understanding of historical intervention, change, and dialectical movement. Rousseau
                is himself faulted for not valuing history’s truths, but not because history must be
                taken as dialectically progressive&#8212;rather, because of its evidentiary and repeating
                truths. If Rousseau’s arrestingly ineffective language in the poem is read
                metaleptically, in which the cause substitutes for the effect, truth may be
                achievable, for in this way history and the future are exchangeable. The question
                cannot have an answer, since the answer can go both forward and backward; more
                importantly, in classical rhetoric metalepsis creates a passage from one context to
                another, effecting a change in terms or of formula that opens up a third way. We
                might say, it is the movement of the energy from one plane of immanence to another,
                that which enables the event that announces change. In <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title>, that event is the chariot careening toward the chasm wall of
                wondrous rhyme; it is announced, but not comprehensibly articulated as an evental
                idea for the rhyme is not legible in the terms that hold sway before the leap it
                announces. Promising everything, like the Shape all light, the wondrous rhyme
                signifies potentiality, both as the power of creative language and as the power of
                significant movement that opposes the recursive forgetting of Rousseau’s and the
                Poet’s “why?” and the enslaving movement of the chariot’s triumph. </p>
            <p>Without making a connection between the effacement of history and of
                self-consciousness and that of counting in language, de Man does suggest that the
                Shape all light is inextricably bound to the natural beats of human consciousness,
                as we know these through the hovering, glimmering intermodal qualities of light and
                water, and the rhythms of measure and poetic language. The first two phenomena
                signify the “birth of form as the interference of light and water passes” (de Man,
                <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 107), whereas the second two signify formalization. Counting
                (or natural rhythm or energy and movement as periodic units) is what is common to
                all four modalities; and counting is a way of signifying without the
                representational limits of signs or a blindness to metaphor. Shelley goes further,
                with measure in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> obliterating thought, as de Man
                notes (114). For Rousseau in the <title level="m">Second Discourse</title>, measure or
                counting functions in both dance and music as a more primary and primitive medium
                than the sight/light medium of the image and sign, which comes later as touching is
                replaced by the distance of gesture and then drawing.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Derrida discusses these ideas in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 229–55.</note>
                Counting comes down to points of measure, of comprehension, of community. In
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> Shelley shows light as the
                scene of what de Man calls “optical confusion” (106), which we might call image
                confusion, in echo of the vision that is delusory for its participants, diffusive
                for community, and difficult for the spectator Poet to interpret. “The thematization
                of language in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> occurs,” de Man
                notes, “when ‘measure’ separates from the phenomenal aspects of signification as a
                specular <emph>representation</emph>, and stresses instead the literal and
                material aspects of language,” adding that “it is precisely these ‘feet’ [of the 
                <foreign xml:lang="it">terza rima</foreign>] which extinguish and bury the poetic and
                philosophical light” (113). This literalization of language that ignores metaphor,
                this death of poetic capacity and of an originary communication, is precisely what
                Rousseau finds to be the history of language as a whole. For Shelley it is the
                history of western political ideology as well.</p>
            <p>In Rousseau’s highly political theory of language’s origins as developed in
                <title level="m">Essay on the Origins of Language</title> (1781), metaphor and
                music were early on prone to instability. He posits a geographical development of
                language, such that in northern regions the passions and desire are substituted and
                repressed by work and the need that provokes it; passion there takes the form of
                violent emotions, of fury, and speech turns toward articulation and away from
                tonality and musical speech. Writing is therefore “at the north” where articulation
                is heightened; writing allows for history, which “hollows out” both vowel accent and
                articulation, “extending the power of writing (Rousseau 226). “Our tongues,”
                Rousseau notes in the <title level="a">Essay,</title> “are better suited to writing than speaking,” an
                observation noteworthy for <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in which Rousseau’s
                writings are metaleptically hollowed out in favor of his spoken recitative, which
                nevertheless has no historical compass. Moreover, the “oriental corpse is in the
                book,” but for the north, “[o]urs is already in our speech” (qtd. in Derrida,
                <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 226). The north, in effect, is death. This
                death, which need and work attempt to evade, accounts for the loss of melodious
                sound, of music from languages of the north where accent signs and punctuation
                replace intonation, that is, they replace the resonance of intoned life and desire
                (227). Nothing more clearly theorizes the living death of Shelley’s Rousseau, whose
                language has been so hollowed out that it is eviscerated of anything but a haunting.
                Even its attempts to capture image and figure, poetry and measure disintegrate
                toward the forgetting that is overtaking him. The warning he represents for the Poet
                prepares us, and him perhaps, for the disintegration of the poem’s integrity at the
                ending, its substitution of stuttering punctuation for poetic imagination, poetic
                imaging, poetic music. What does remain is measure, measure as counting, as beats,
                as what might be a gathering of dissipated energies rather than a dying into itself. </p>
            <p>What is it that can get <title level="m">The Triumph</title> back
                from the edge of a vertiginous loss of meaningful vision (Rousseau’s hollow-eyed
                seeing; the spectacular triumph’s mad careen into meaninglessness)? Hollow-eyed,
                hollowing out, and the root that is no root (of language, of origin<note place="foot" 
                    resp="author">Derrida meditates on the nature of roots and entangled or intertwined roots in
                    language and writing in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> in an
                    early passage in the section on Rousseau (101–2).</note>) but
                rather a man after all (the unrecognizable image of Rousseau when the Poet first
                encounters him), provide spectral figurations for the failure of both sight and
                language in the poem, or rather, for the disfiguration that de Man locates there. </p>
            <p> The problem of the poem is not that it dis-articulates figuration and narrative, or
                that it encapsulates frenzied motion and a kind of centrifugal force so that the
                center empties out&#8212;or is seen to have always been empty, although these are both at
                play. The problem is that the poem is about the struggle between existence and
                control as a drama of the all in all; to convey this, the poem references so many
                ideas that it works rather like a magnet that has attracted little metal bits that
                it allows to disfigure the unity of the whole. In the Preface to 
                <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, De Man says that 
                <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> is “The
                only place where I come close to facing some of these questions about history and
                fragmentation,” which include attempts to aestheticize modes of fragmentation to a
                kind of “unity and substance” that may be what the poem, and the entire period,
                resist (ix). That unity and substance, disenfranchised by the hollowing out Rousseau
                represents, and by the insistence on a messily chaotic history doomed to repeat
                itself represented by the triumph, comes to an end with the elliptical ending. There
                a blind seeing is required in order to see beyond the ending; it is the kind of
                sightedness poets are renown for, but Shelley resists putting such seeing into
                words. What he requires is a different kind of writing capable of resisting the
                death of presence that Rousseau accords to writing by refusing that dichotomizing of
                essence/substance, and of presence/distance encoded in Enlightenment theories of
                language. Such binaries recall one even more pertinent to the origin of language,
                that of nature/culture, which asserts an ideological, onto-theological
                interpretation on history as powerful as that of writing itself. </p>
            <p>Describing Levi-Strauss’ focus on the split between nature and culture, Derrida
                refers to “the originality of a scandalous suture” (<title level="m">Of
                    Grammatogy</title> 105). This might well also describe the chasm wall inscribed
                with hieroglyphs or “rhymes of wonder” in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> (105). The “rhymes of
                wonder” are both the failure of logocentric writing and the eradication of
                presentful voice, already dissimulated by Rousseau’s incoherent narrative. Derrida
                refers to iterability as repetition with a difference;<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">Derrida defines iterability as a
                    concept in <title level="a">Signature Event Context.</title></note> rhymes of wonder
                would then be writing with a difference, writing beyond the trace or after the
                points of departure have been taken. Shelley is envisioning a different kind of
                writing then, one still necessitating an enabling violence against the chasm wall of
                horizonal or spatio-temporal limitation&#8212;but a writing that would not require the
                trace, the play of difference and of arche-writing. This is a writing that cannot be
                said, but can be felt in the beats, the counts of the ellipses that measure out the
                poem’s partial ending. </p>
            <p>I have not yet alluded to <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s allegorical form.
                Despite its clear allegiance to
                Dante’s <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> (1320) and
                Petrarch’s own <title level="m">Triumph</title>, the <title level="m">Trionfi</title>
                (c. 1350-74), another allegory sits behind the poem, Plato’s allegory of the cave.
                Shelley’s Platonism is well known, but I believe that in his last major poem he
                overleaps Plato’s vision just as he does Dante’s. Derrida’s analysis of Plato’s
                allegory in <title level="m">Memoirs of the Blind</title> is helpful here because it
                reveals the difficulty at the heart of the cave analogy: human passivity as the
                condition for seeing differently. Plato describes his allegorical cave as peopled by
                humans chained to the walls by their various kinds of blindness, caused when opinion
                is valued over the logic of ideas. Unable even to move their heads, these prisoners
                mistake shadows for real things. They are passive while chained, but even what frees
                them is not due to their own agency: “A conversion will free them . . . But before
                this dazzling ascent, an <emph>anabasis</emph> that is also an
                <emph>anamensis</emph>,” a journey through previous lives must take place
                (Derrida, <title level="m">Memoirs</title> 15). This “passion
                of memory . . . will turn the soul’s gaze towards the ‘intelligible place’ . . . .”
                Far from being an act of will, however, Plato’s prisoners are represented as
                motionless through this process; Rousseau’s conversion is a rewriting of this
                allegory, his repeated retracings of his life as a philosophe prompted by the “Shape
                all light” rather than by his own initiative, and like the prisoners, the process
                produces a second kind of blindness, as Derrida notes, that Plato attributes to the
                exchange of dark shadows for intelligible light, where otherness might indeed be
                perceived otherwise and without blinding distortion. Thus Rousseau must see through
                eyes hollowed out of their prior blindnesses. Part of what Rousseau, and the Poet
                who he instructs, must forget is the blinding opinions of epistemic
                thought&#8212;constrained by postulates, skepticism, and Kantian critique&#8212;which rejects
                any stretching out to the thing-in-itself. Clearly Rousseau’s finger stretches in
                just such a way to point to the in-itself, the triumphal march as the essence of
                ideologically bound and blinded Life. Derrida notes that Plato’s prisoners never
                stretch their hands even toward the shadows on the cave’s walls, they are motionless
                in their inability even to touch the representations of things, let alone
                things-in-themselves. Shelley rejects such rejection, insisting that Rousseau
                <emph>can</emph> see blindly, <emph>can</emph> point to verities
                and intelligibilities. De Man disagreed with Derrida’s interpretation of Rousseau’s
                blindness, remarking in a letter that “The desire to exempt Rousseau (as you say) at
                all costs from blindness is therefore, for me, a gesture of fidelity to my own
                itinerary . . . that, on the specific question of the rhetoricity of his writing, he
                was not blinded.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Quoted from private correspondence in Andrzej

                truth-tropes of poetic language, for de Man, Derrida and Shelley, were accessible to
                Rousseau under certain conditions: when his metaphors overtook him, as does the
                Shape all light. The intelligible place he points to is off the map, of course, just
                as is Plato’s ideality. </p>
            <p>This is a futurity worth risking the erasure of past histories if those histories are
                only doomed to repeat themselves; Rousseau’s erasure of self points this out. And if
                Shelley evinces anxiety in <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> over the
                distorting mirrors of futurity, surely Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing can overcome
                distortions that would only return us to a recursively recycled history of error and
                suffering. Indeed, “we let ‘<emph>I dare not</emph> wait upon
                <emph>I would,’”</emph> whereas instead “We want the creative faculty to imagine that
                which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine; we want
                    <emph>the poetry of life</emph>” (Shelley, <title level="m">Defence</title> 
                530; emphasis added). Poets have long been able to create a bridge
                from the past into a possible futurity (“The poetry of Dante may be considered as
                the bridge thrown over the stream of time, which unites the modern and antient
                world” [526]), but “poets have been challenged to resign the civic crown to
                reasoners and mechanists” (528), categories to which Rousseau at first capitulated
                in his poetical philosophy. The imagination, action and poetry requisite for a
                futurity without distortion in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> would inaugurate
                the post-Anthropocene, and require, as Shelley’s Rousseau has demonstrated, a giving
                up of past words, memories of self and achievements, and therefore of the Cartesian
                cogito per se. His recursive story-making of self into nonself is a movement towards
                a new temporality in which past histories are forgotten or overwritten so that a new
                time may come into being. Similar to Rousseau’s self-fragmentation,
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s ending ellipses&#8212;which
                might be a cracking or fissuring in the chasmic walls, a positive fragmenting whose
                leaving off opens up the potentiality of poetry rather than a breaking up of
                logocentric linguistic formulations&#8212;gesture toward the possibility of a non-cogito
                realm in which selfhood is spelled differently. This is also the vision of
                philosophers of the non-Anthropocene, such as Cary Wolfe, in arguing that
                nonhumanist thought must not be brought back to a concentrism that still harbors the
                human at its core. The nonhuman must not be a veiled concern about the future of
                human survival; it must not be a practice of care toward other beings and toward the
                environment that restores the primacy of human agency. Both of these orientations
                distort otherness, casting it in logocentric terms that privilege the cogito and
                thus human history, undoing the lessons of the <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s
                allegorical vision. “Rhymes of wonder” foresees this linguistic breakthrough that
                could restore sight’s capacity to see what is there, awaiting a resolution into
                recognizable patterns whose interpretation need not privilege the logos, its
                theology, or its human subjectivity. Just as those currently struggling to envision
                what such a linguistics might entail cannot do more than gesture toward such a
                future, so too does Shelley’s great poem do no more than indicate pointedly
                language’s dissolve in such a futurity. Nevertheless, it is a rhyme of wonder.</p>
