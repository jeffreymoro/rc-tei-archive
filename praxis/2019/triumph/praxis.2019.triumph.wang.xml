        <div type="abstract">
          <p rend="noCount">The Triumph of Life compels us to read it, asserting how much reading,
            Romanticism, and reading Romanticism are all different modalities of compulsion that
            structure our cultural, historical, and material lives. Yet as much as the origins of this
            volume might have been based on this insight, each of the essays collected here alight
            upon a dimension of Shelley’s poem—for Khalip the figure of the last, for Fay the notion
            of the pre-vocative beyond, for Pyle the operations of the minor, and for Washington the
            activity of post-Newtonian light—that eschews the compulsions of visuality for an
            encounter with in Fay a non-optical alterity and in the other three something defined by
            either its own passing, boundedness, or willingness to let go. In doing so, these latest
            readings of Shelley’s work are not so much compelled by the triumph of (human) life as
            energized by the emergence of a Shelleyan queer love defined more by the act of
            non-possession than anything else.</p>

            <p>Inviting me to be the respondent for the MLA panel on <title level="m">The Triumph
                of Life</title> (1822) that evolved into this <title level="j">RC Praxis</title>
                volume, Joel Faflak sent me an email to
                explain how he and Jacques Khalip had discussed “how certain Romantic texts require
                repeated unearthing and burial&#8212;require/compel our productively melancholic
                attachment to them. . . . We just thought it would be cool to devote a whole panel
                to one poem in order to demonstrate precisely its compulsive hold on our critical
                imaginations (a la de Man).”</p>
            <p>I quote Joel in order to identify what I found so compelling about his invitation:
                the equation between reading <title level="m">The Triumph</title> and the fact of
                <emph>compulsion</emph> itself as a main, perhaps necessary component of
                critical thought&#8212;how Romantic texts like <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “compel
                our productively melancholic attachment to them,” how they demonstrate their
                “compulsive hold on our critical imaginations.” Certainly, we become in thrall to
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, just as the captive multitudes are to Life’s
                    chariot. There’s also something viral about the trope of
                compulsion, where reading and writing about compulsion compels, necessitates, our
                attention as well. Anyone coming near Shelley’s poem, along with the meta-commentary
                that accompanies it and, by extension, Romanticism, knows what I mean. Once the
                compulsion of, or about, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> takes hold, it’s hard to
                look away.</p>
            <p>Let’s make no mistake: compulsion might not simply or essentially be a bad thing. If,
                for example, agency is impossible perhaps compulsion will do. If one inhabits a
                post-revolutionary age, like Shelley’s or our own neo-liberal end of history, a
                compulsion to reenact the trauma of radical social change, to refuse to let go of
                the possibility of that event, might be the necessary first breach toward fashioning
                whatever type of art, thought, or politics one wants to carry out next. Likewise,
                the compulsion to read Romanticism, so well allegorized in de Man’s <title level="a">Shelley
                Disfigured,</title> might be of some comfort when market forces have the institution of
                Romantic studies under siege&#8212;when, contrary to my opening observations, so many of
                our academic higher ups, colleagues, and students don’t really seem compelled by
                Romanticism at all. Yet perhaps because of this nexus of compulsion, Romanticism and
                reading still seems so readily available for us to intuit; I’d like to ask if that’s
                really the only existing option open to us with regard to our encounter with
                Romanticism and its texts. And what might it mean, for a poem like <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> and its force field of meanings, if that wasn’t the case?</p>
            <p>Catherine Malabou gets at something like this when she asks whether anything can
                exist truly detached, unattached to anything else, in Hegel (612–24). But I’m
                wondering if we can even talk simply about attachments that don’t immediately
                ratchet themselves up to the affects and intensities of compulsion per se. More
                exactly, is there a way to encounter
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> without seeing its
                attachments as well as our attachments to it as purely compulsive? Amanda Jo
                Goldstein’s recent, agile Lucretian reading of Shelley’s poem, in which senescence
                and the waning of vitalist life are actually privileged over the intensely cathected
                relations of a triumphalist bio-politics, would seem to say yes. Similarly, W. J. T.
                Mitchell gives us a certain language to help think this issue through, which we can
                consider, with a sidelong glance to <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, as the
                question of <emph>history</emph>: is it possible to consider history as
                something besides either a fetish or an idol, the latter of which we must either
                submit to as idolatry or attack iconoclastically? Can we, would we, want to conceive
                of history as instead a totem&#8212;as that term means in the Ojibwa language, a relative
                or friend (175, 184)?</p>
            <p>Mitchell’s options&#8212;fetish, idol, and totem&#8212;are, of course, terms he applies to our
                relationships with images, with objects in the world (188–99). But if Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is about history or history’s disfigurement, that
                history is by and large composed of images and other sensory phenomena. The poem
                brims over with objects that demand or invite a reflection on the question of
                sensation, on our sensory relations with the world, whether they necessarily become
                fetishistic or idolatrous or if they’re able to manage the energies of compulsion
                and remain more modestly totemic instead. De Man for one tried to move his reading
                of <title level="m">The Triumph</title> away from the physical
                aspects of language (59–69), but the role of sensation is still very much an
                unavoidable part of anyone’s engagement, linguistically or phenomenologically, with
                this work. So, the question of compulsion with regard to <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> seems also to be in many ways about how the senses work in this
                poem, how senses might idolize or fetishize, or be idolized or fetishized in turn;
                how they might figure a compulsive relation or become the object of compulsion, and
                how <emph>as</emph> figures the physical senses seem both to define and
                wander aggressively beyond our encounter with the medium of the printed or scripted
                word, the act of reading <emph>qua</emph> reading as well. </p>
            <p>Fredric Jameson’s observation about the inherently pornographic nature of film brings
                much of what I’m trying to articulate together, where film’s pornographic character
                means the visual has “its end in rapt, mindless, fascination,” with film asking us
                to stare at the world “as though it were a naked body” (1). Yet his claim also has
                to be balanced against Rei Terada’s consideration of the meaning of optics in one of
                Keats’s own fragmentary poems, <title level="m">Hyperion</title> (1820), where looking
                seems also to embody the question of the non-phenomenal possibility of cognition
                itself (277), a query that de Man’s reading of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                answers in the negative with a linguistic violence perhaps not that distant from the
                pornographic energies unleashed in Jameson’s characterization of film. The visual
                then, might realize mindless compulsion or complicate the mind’s operation in a way
                not simply or only about sensory experience, insofar as that experience itself is
                also in some way about what cognition should, can, or <emph>can’t</emph>
                do. </p>
            <p>It’s with these questions in mind&#8212;can you approach <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                in a way separate from compulsion? And how does <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                ask this through its multi-layered, formal and thematic sensory overload?&#8212;that I
                looked forward to seeing how the four adventurous readings in this volume might
                encounter Shelley’s poem. I wasn’t disappointed. Jacques Khalip seemed to be reading
                my mind when he references his own haunting attachment to a close-to-last line of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, “as if that look must be the last,” and,
                indeed, to the meme, sensation, or trope of <emph>the last</emph> that for
                Khalip underwrites so much of the poem. But Khalip’s attachment to the last seems in
                fact to be about <emph>detachment</emph>, a
                recognition, oftentimes erotic, as in Rousseau, of the last both as and before the
                moment of letting go. A spectral structure, the last is the impossible end point by
                which the exhaustion of <emph>frisson</emph>, the end of compulsion is
                imaged <emph>as if</emph>, even as that end is imaged as the last image,
                the last look, the last sense of sensation. I take that exquisitely subtle calculus
                to be the point of Khalip’s fabulous close reading of the “coercive logic of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s spectacular visuality,” the poet’s eyes sick
                with the sights of the Triumph and the eye cast by Rousseau’s blind figure towards
                the chariot; what might the last look be after the ontological compulsions of the
                image but the end of the fetish? I say fetish and not idol not only because of the
                story of exhausted commodity culture lurking behind Khalip’s use of Shelley’s
                references to Charles I and the Regent’s consumer excess but also since Khalip’s
                poetics seems to work at the minimal level of the small and absorbing, where the
                fetish operates. Yet, in this poem at least for Khalip (and maybe this is why
                Rousseau, the supposed talisman of fetishes, is so important) we can let the fetish
                go, as if William had in it in him to let Dorothy with her wild eyes wander away
                instead of absorbing her into his <emph>Bildungsroman</emph> of Romantic
                maturity. We let go of our compulsive energies by imagining letting go, of, indeed,
                looking away, because of the nature of the last in our look, which, paradoxically,
                allows us to dwell within a non-fetishized optics precisely through a reflexivity
                that fashions such seeing “as if” it were the last. Whether such reflexivity rises
                to the level of what we might want to call cognition&#8212;I’m eager to hear Khalip’s own
                response to that question.</p>
            <p>Recently he and I had a discussion of what the everyday might be and I wonder if this
                might be it: a history of things, the barely noticed marked desiderata on a
                manuscript, the last kiss or last look before sensory exhaustion, a bundle of low
                level sensations that are gone, or present themselves as going, before we fully
                register them, an everyday life instead of a triumph, defined by not its magnetic
                compulsions but the strange though not malignant sense of a slipping away.
                (Certainly worthy of further exploration would be how such a terrain of behavior
                might compare tonally with what William Galperin has explored in his own recent
                envisioning of the Romantic everyday, <title level="m">The History of Missed
                Opportunities</title>.) If these last objects, like Hujar’s last car, are totems,
                they are such in a way that might help us navigate what a last friendship might be. </p>
            <p>Libby Fay’s key term is not <emph>the last</emph>, but <emph>the beyond</emph>, 
                and I’d love to see how she and Khalip might negotiate how
                these different terms provide the conceptual pivots in each of their readings. I
                found Fay’s essay defiantly Shelleyan in a way that we most traditionally value, a
                courageous embrace of psychic and somatic vertigo that lays us vulnerable before a
                cosmos discovered to be beneficent, in this case a post-human universe still defined
                by its hospitality, an “otherness without distortion,” beyond the ontological and
                epistemological horizons that define perversion as a transgression of the Law. For
                Fay, Shelley’s gesture towards the post-human also vehemently rejects an
                Enlightenment empiricism that defines the triumph of life as human life, the
                catastrophe of the anthropocene. In the gaps and difficulties of the poet’s
                language, its rhymes of wonder, Fay sees
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> pressing against this
                post-human alterity, with Rousseau’s eyeless state actually resisting the
                supplementary double binds of Derridean <emph>écriture</emph>, opening up
                to a new horizon of sensation, an “absorptive beyondness” of the pre-vocal and
                musical.</p>
            <p>One might suggest that the tone of this surge towards this new sensory beyondness has
                a non-compulsive confidence to it that actually echoes the progressive empirical
                scientism that Fay sees Shelley wanting to leave behind. (Derrida’s complicated
                relation to empiricism and science in
                <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> might also indicate Fay
                has more of a fellow traveler in that work’s composition of <emph>techné</emph>
                and <emph>écriture</emph> than she thinks.) I wonder if,
                however, these potential continuities might also simply mean that the science in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is radically more strange, in a generative way,
                than we first suspect&#8212;an Enlightenment science already made more capacious by
                Shelley’s reading of Lucretius, as Goldstein argues, but also a science fiction of
                the post-human lurking within the rave of Enlightenment empiricism that Fay
                identifies, where the root that once was Rousseau exists singularly
                <emph>as a</emph> root, vegetal instead of animal or much less human; and
                where Fay’s wager clarifies itself by considering the extent to which the Shape all
                light is <emph>neither</emph> a figure for the human <emph>nor
                a priori</emph> a human figure, something Chris Washington’s essay takes up as
                well. Indeed, Fay adamantly associates the Shape with the rhyme of wonder, a
                non-compulsive aural alternative to the triumphalist visuality of Shelley’s poem
                that Fay, like Khalip, wants in some way to qualify, circumvent, or resist. Might
                this occupation with sound also be a way to identify and repudiate the link between
                a certain coercive optics with the anthropocene? If so, is the post-human that which
                resists the way compulsion ubiquitously informs <emph>both</emph> human
                idolatry and fetishism <emph>and</emph> animal
                instinct? Arguably, if sight is the sense of the idol and fetish in the human, sound
                is the sense most associated with the aural and tactile triggers (the whistle, the
                snapped twig, the vibratory air) of animal instinctual response. Is Fay’s Shelleyan
                “getting beyond” a musical space beyond this binary, a radical reworking of
                Shelleyan synthesia that helps us understand what we might mean, even or especially
                given the nightmare of history in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, by
                <emph>post-human</emph> freedom? </p>
            <p>Because of her deployment of the pre-vocative I wondered if Fay might turn towards
                Kristeva’s chora, but her movement toward Deleuze and Guattari seems equally apt,
                especially as Deleuze also motors Forrest Pyle’s lushly psycho-tropic evocation of
                the proto-cinematic apparatus in Shelley’s poem. But if attachment to a volatile
                immanence of sensation is Deleuzian, Pyle through Deleuze, Barthes, Benjamin, and
                Julie Andrews works to detach Shelley’s cinematic image <foreign xml:lang="fr">avant la
                lettre</foreign> from the compulsions of history written, or projected, in what Pyle
                describes as the mode of the major, an encounter with aesthetic and cultural forms
                normative in the excessive force of their attractions and bid for the profound, a
                dynamic familiar to every student of Romanticism. Pyle doesn’t quite associate the
                major with the affects of idolatry or the sensorium of an explicitly coercive
                triumphalist optics, eschewing any elaborate critique that might follow from such a
                connection. Yet it’s clear his interests lie elsewhere, even as he wittily reflects
                upon the existence of a favorite poem realized before any opportunity he might have
                had consciously to choose or name it as his favorite. For Pyle, if that work is
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>&#8212;he doesn’t disagree&#8212;the reason for that
                designation doesn’t so much have to do with the major but the occurrences of the
                “minor event” in that work, its own gift of those images in literature and art “that
                seem to arrest us without doing or promising anything more.”</p>
            <p>Resonating with the reflexive moment of Khalip’s as-if-it-were-the-last, Pyle’s minor
                event does compel us, but in so arresting a minor key, it seems to avoid the
                feverish energies of the fetish, where unlike the fetish it exudes a
                self-sufficiency absent of any lure or promise of something more. Neither a wound
                nor a fragment, the minor sidesteps the obsessive logics of wholeness and castration
                exuded by the fetish in a way that gestures toward something like Fay’s beyond, a
                realm delinked from the fear, though maybe not the joy, of perversion. Intriguingly,
                while the minor doesn’t promise anything grandiose beyond itself, Pyle nevertheless
                sees the possibility of a minor history, so different from the spectacle of the
                chariot of Life’s paraded captives. In contrast to that particular triumph, Pyle
                posits a Benjaminian constellation of minor events that coalesces still into
                something like a resource, a place of favorite things, even if the politics or
                policy of such a gathering remains furtive, just on the other side of modernity’s
                stultifying, teenage suburban boredom, so achingly extracted from Todd Haynes’ film,
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, in Pyle’s dreamy reading of that work
                that appears in an extended version of his essay.</p>
            <p>Through the deployment of Haynes, of Joel Faflak’s own heady reading of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> as dizzy Hollywood musical, and of Barthes’s
                filmic still image, “the obtuse,” Pyle appears to lock the minor event solely within
                the cinematic or proto-cinematic apparatus. That doesn’t quite appear to be the
                case, however, with Pyle saying as much. Indeed, I wondered if mapping the tensions
                between minor event and major history onto those between the lyric moment and
                narrative drive in literature might give us a fresh new way to reconsider the
                traditional meanings of the latter dichotomy. More pointedly, there is also Pyle’s
                conclusion, its dwelling with the poetic minor event of several lines in Shelley’s
                poem that simultaneously allegorizes <emph>the coming-to-be</emph> of the
                minor event, “As when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they
                glimmer”&#8212;of, as Pyle describes, “the detached glimmering image of a
                <emph>veil of light drawn</emph> over evening hills.” Eminently readable
                (again and again!) in its unreadability, here for Pyle, in a veil
                of light drawn, is the stuff of what dreams are made of, and on: poetically,
                theatrically, pictorially, photographically, cinematically, if not more.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">Might this misquote by the film <title level="m">The Maltese Falcon</title> of

                            the prepositions <emph>of</emph> and <emph>on</emph>, signal yet
                            another constellation of the minor event that Pyle
                            is trying to describe?</note></p>
            <p>Perhaps because of Pyle I couldn’t help but associate Chris Washington’s quantum
                physics sense of light in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> with the cinema, or
                more exactly, with cinema’s death as a human activity. For if, following Laurent
                Mannoni, we observe that the dream of the pre-cinema and cinema was the interplay of
                light and shadow, what occurs when that light in its post-Newtonian form, something
                Washington asserts Shelley knew of through the scientific experimentation of his
                day, implies a temporal scale that repudiates any notion of that dream’s
                intrinsically anthropocentric character? Independent of, immune to, any human
                reference, such starlight for Washington is non-specular, a “non-figural materiality
                as inter-involved aspect of any figurality.” I might put pressure on Washington’s
                “as” to indicate the unavoidable figural distance, no matter how small, between any
                physical candidate (post-Newtonian light, say) for de Man’s own non-figural
                “materiality without matter” and that latter materiality itself, a distance that one
                might say is precisely, and paradoxically, the effect of de Man’s materiality
                (Derrida 350). But that doesn’t lessen the power of what Washington sees in the
                implications of a post-Newtonian light in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, one
                whose character asserts not our immortality but our non-permanence, while yet also
                enabling new possibilities of entanglement among various subjects and objects in the
                universe, new opportunities for what Karen Barad calls “intra-action,” something
                according to Washington defined by its very resistance to the “transcendental
                temporalities” of an inescapably monumentalized form of human politics,
                revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Light in Shelley’s poem is thus not for
                Washington about its triumph, not about the coercive form of optics that Khalip,
                Fay, and Pyle in their different ways also see
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> resisting. Indeed, while his
                speculative realism perhaps most noticeably matches up with Fay’s reading of a
                post-human sonic “beyond” in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, Washington finds
                the promise of the non-human already displayed in the operation of light in
                Shelley’s work.</p>
            <p>To return to my earlier language, we might say post-Newtonian light is neither
                idolatrous nor fetishistic, insofar as its non-specularity is the cold beautiful
                evidence of the limits of any referential attachment we might slavishly make to our
                sensory (and thus also our non-phenomenal) experience. Such attachments are
                ultimately to our selves as human immortal beings, a hope, desire, or compulsion
                that the physics of light in Washington’s <title level="m">Triumph</title> explicitly
                eschews. We are abandoned by non-Newtonian light and in that fact we find the
                alternate affective possibility of Shelleyan love, one that in its awareness of its
                provisional character signals a horizon of “intra-action,” of non-compulsive,
                impermanent attachments to history and the world, something arguably Mitchell’s
                totemic sensibility as well as Khalip’s “last,” Fay’s “beyond,” and Pyle’s “minor
                event” also endeavor to articulate.<note place="foot" resp="author">In Goldstein’s
                    Lucretian reading of the love for and in old age in <title level="m">The
                    Triumph</title>, we can see a similar movement (136–65).</note> Let me conclude then with a
                thought experiment that tries to build upon these suggested convergences.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this response I qualified its inquiries by noting how compulsion
                shouldn’t necessarily be considered a thing to avoid, especially when as
                professional Romanticists we’re all at the moment suffering from an institutional
                aphanisis, the deadening of desire for Romanticism, the way the study and teaching
                of its texts doesn’t seem to compel attention in the academic marketplace even as we
                embark on a series of two-hundred year commemorative events for those works and the
                authors behind them. Without pretending to know completely how to proceed in this
                brave new world, I will venture the following, using Washington’s categories, by
                which his and the other pieces in this volume gesture toward a series of
                (non-)attachments and sensory encounters in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> that
                model a different language than the compulsive by which we can begin to conceive of
                our relation not only to Shelley’s poem but to Romanticism and literature as well. I
                write this all the while acknowledging my own compulsive attachment to history and
                its nightmarish disfigurements, the possibility of politics and the effects of
                antagonism in and beyond the anthropocene.</p>
            <p>Still, if perhaps the goal is to maintain as Žižek might say, a “parallax view” that
                simultaneously shuttles between the compulsive and non-compulsive (4–13), let me
                suggest another way to consider why we return again and again to
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>. We do so, following Washington, out of a Shelleyan love based
                on something like the sensation of the impermanence of our selves and our readings,
                our cognition and our somatic experience, a love empowered, not disabled by this
                predicament, which is also one of reading not as cultural monumentalization but as
                the physics of intra-action, the momentary coming together or community&#8212;the
                constellation?&#8212;that constitutes each reading as well as the relations among every
                encounter with Shelley’s text and manuscript, with his words and words about his
                drowned body and buried heart. Furthermore: through Khalip’s description of the
                “queerly erotic openness” to the last look, Fay’s imaging of a beyondness defined by
                its detachment from any normative policing of perversion, Pyle’s exuberant
                constellating of Shelley and Haynes’s glam rock, and Washington’s physics of
                starlight delinked from any immortal, pro-creative human story, we might say that
                this love is in some basic way queer. We might then ask: if this is the case for our
                love of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, how might that redound and refract upon
                all our reading habits and motivations in relation to Romanticism, beyond but also,
                importantly, within the universities, colleges, and schools that many of us
                teach?</p>
