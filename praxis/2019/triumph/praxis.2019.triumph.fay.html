            <p class="noCount">Focusing on the import of the last four lines of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, 
               “Rhymes of Wonder: Otherness without Distortion”
               explores the possible future that lies beyond the horizonal walling off of a triumphal
               Life that Shelley’s poem describes. Using Deleuze and Guattari to follow the traces
               of where dizzying speed can get us, the essay suggests that Shelley was headed with
               full speed toward the post-human, breaking off only with the stumble that inevitably
               occurs when human language fails to articulate what it cannot imagine. What remains
               is sound, the aural-oral capacity that tunes us in to life itself, to a living nature
               that cannot be captured by words yet within which we are thoroughly enmeshed. This
               is the enlightenment that Shelley’s poem gestures toward, against optically driven
               scientific knowledge; against the human condition as totalizing knowledge; against
               the impermanence of the material. Whereas the main part of <em>The Triumph</em> considers forms of self-willing within the human experience, it’s abandoned final
               lines suggest that Shelley intended to reread the alienating aspects of that self-willing
               as the first steps toward an alternate otherness that, in its beyondness, holds out
               the promise of a freedom from the human as a freedom from the distortions of suffering
               per se.</p>

               <p>This article is a prolonged meditation on the last four lines of Shelley’s <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, composed between May and June 1822, lines which begin to fragment with the occurrence
                  of two ellipses, until the final “Of” that begins the fifth, uncompleted line midway
                  though the final stanza Shelley wrote, leaving the poem unfinished at his death.

                  </div> <em>The Triumph</em> asks us to extend, extemporize, dwell in the dizzying rapidity of movement of life’s
                  march of time. Rather than imagining this “triumph” as a slowed version of suffering
                  and humiliation, enslavement to the imperial corporate body, Shelley imagines a vertigo
                  of motion, a sweeping up of humanity into the vortex of a fateful present. This sense
                  of intense movement begins with the first lines: “Swift as a spirit hastening to his
                  task / . . . the Sun sprang forth” (1–2). Even though the imagery is apparently bright,
                  it is darkened by the “mask / Of darkness,” which though falling with the Sun’s speedy
                  approach, also prevaricates. For far from a mere masking of what is essentially bright
                  with the dark, this mask is both the masque of darkness that will be the triumphal
                  march of the Poet’s vision as a hideous parody of human life controlled by ideological
                  oppressions, and a prelude to the dark imagery of the poem throughout. It is not long
                  before the Poet’s vision, “that trance of wondrous thought” (41) which is a blind
                  seeing rather than insight (for the Poet-I is confused by the spectacle until his
                  guide, Rousseau, provides an interpretive key), beholds “a great stream / Of people
                  . . . hurrying to and fro,” 
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                  </blockquote> This is the temporality spaced by Derrida’s différance, the spacing of time best articulated
                  through writing (and writing’s necessarily ideological inscription of our experience)
                  that wards off the possibility of futurity through infinite recursion to the past.
                  Later I will discuss how metalepsis functions in the poem to break from this recursive
                  bondage to a blind historicity in which nothing is learned, only repeated. What the
                  triumph represents is a veritable negative or negating infinity of time that wards
                  off a possible future-to-come, not just <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">l’avenir</span> but “the urgency and imminence of an <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">à-venir</span>, a to-come. . . inflecting or turning into an injunction as well as into messianic
                  waiting the <em>a</em> of a différ<em>a</em>nce in disjunction” (Derrida, <em>Rogues</em> 108).

                           Life in particular.</span></div>
                  </div> The problem the poem poses and begins to attempt to resolve is that of breaking the
                  frame created by such a negative spacing, a spacing envisioned as an insane flight
                  hemmed in by chaos and fear, so as to stage an eventfulness that could usher in a
                  post-Anthropocenic seeing. Such seeing-without-distortion would mean a sightedness
                  that is blind to the distortions of a self-serving logocentrism.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                           the Blind and The Animal That Therefore I Am, and that Shelley is after with his confessional
                           and self-erasing portrait of Rousseau in The Triumph.</span></div>
                  </div> History, Shelley suggests, tells us nothing about the forces that corral us along
                  this flightpath that turns back on itself in a temporality that goes nowhere, because
                  we do not learn its lessons. But it is this horizon determined by the past—the horizon
                  of finitude instantiated by différance and the automaticity of human reaction to anything
                  finite—that Shelley puts in doubt by way of the poem’s dream state. Such doubt opens
                  up the Enlightenment frame, with its insistently finite horizon developed from the
                  history of western epistemology and political ideologies, to other possibilities,
                  and I read Shelley’s unfinished poem as already enmeshed in a post-human turn. The
                  poem’s project becomes, in the end, to discover a way out of the scientifism that
                  had stalled thought in its seeking of an alternative to the negative structure of
                  logical postulates, and to chart a path between Humean skepticism and a Kantian walling
                  off of being—two philosophical attitudes that mark Shelley’s intellectual thought
                  thus far, but against which the <em>Triumph</em> finally crashes in its last stanzas. It is in the poem’s provisional ending that an
                  overleaping of the two positions begins to manifest.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Shelley’s visionary poem, in the moment of its apparent crashing against the walls
               of Hume and Kant, wants to, desires to, locate in an epochal terminus an un-distortion
               of otherness. The terminating question Shelley asks in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, which the poem itself has asked throughout—“Then, what is Life?”—suggests the possibility
               that otherness-in-itself lies not on the other side of subjective, anthropocentric
               limitation and finitude, but elsewhere. This is a free-range understanding of Life
               that absorbs the human into it. Such an elsewhere would eschew the need to stage the
               contest between idea and substance, a contest Shelley sedulously avoids in his poetry
               (except in dark works such as <em>The Cenci</em> (1819), but for a different purpose. This elsewhere imagines what Derrida’s democracy-to-come
               might inscribe anew. Or it might imagine this if the poem could be finished, could
               be differently written, if its terms could be thought.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My interpretation of the question provisionally prompting the poem’s ending—a poem
                  foreshadowed by the Poet asking “And what is this? / Whose shape is that within the
                  car?” and Rousseau’s answer, “Life” (177–78, 180)—rests on a Derridean reading of
                  the ghostly presence of its guide. Rousseau is marked by his “disguise” of “an old
                  root” of “strange distortion”—recalling the “mask of darkness” that hides another
                  version of what is there at the poem’s beginning (204, 182–83), but also indicating
                  his having been marked by the distortions of the Derridean trace, the writing that
                  rewrote Rousseau as a misguided corpus. In revisiting Derrida’s reading of Rousseau
                  I hope to illuminate why it is this philosopher Shelley finally singles out from those
                  he had considered equally as important in earlier drafts.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In 
                           “Shelley Disfigured,”
                           de Man uses Reiman’s archival work in Shelley’s The Triumph of Life to reduce the
                           philosopher-guides to a single one, Rousseau, a significant revision in the poem.</span></div>
                  </div> Although Rousseau had indeed been part “of that deluded crew” following the triumphal
                  car, he asks the Poet to “forbear / To join the dance, which I had well forborne”
                  through a “deep scorn” (the scars of which he bears on his corpse-corpus) which “Led
                  me and my companions” to resist the mad dance of Life (188–89, 191). Or rather, Rousseau
                  and his few companions have scorned the machinations of the arche-trace, the insistent
                  rewriting of which the poem accuses “those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire, / Frederic,
                  and Kant, Catherine, and Leopold, / Chained hoary anarchs, demagogue and sage” (235–37).
                  In <em>Of Grammatology</em> Derrida is less kind to Rousseau, seeing him as being one of the spoilers, but nevertheless
                  granting the philosopher pride of place as the middle term between Plato and Hegel
                  for his foreseeing analysis of logocentrism as the erasure of presence through writing,
                  the animal-machine of reading and rewriting that is our automaticity, our reactive
                  blindness. Écriture allies us in our auto-blindness with the four-faced, eye-banded
                  charioteer of Shelley’s triumphal car, the figuration of Life itself, since like him
                  we cannot see beyond the perimeter of our own insistent spacing and deferrals of any
                  possible future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Derrida’s reading of Rousseau’s importance rests on a grammatology as all that can
                  be thought within the limits of the scientific épistémè; indeed, within the limits
                  of the Anthropocene. But I suggest that <em>The Triumph of Life</em> asks Rousseau to help move the dream vision beyond such perimeters, into a different
                  plane with a different horizonal potential. In <em>The Triumph</em> Rousseau acts as the speaker’s Virgil, interpreting the pageant, discovering its trace
                  and spectrally pointing a finger to a different horizon unconditioned by scientifism’s
                  rejection of passion as way of knowing. But for Derrida, Rousseau is always unsettled
                  by his incorporation of the supplement into a theory of human nature, always undone
                  by passion’s unsettling priority over need. Despite Rousseau’s attempts to settle
                  passion into its place, passion’s prewriting in the business of survival and articulation
                  becomes, in Rousseau’s anthropological scheme, inverted (articulation as subdivision
                  of sound and meaning, understanding and reason, that is “the opening and closure of
                  a cleft” [Johnson 128], according to Derrida, or the making of a judgment). The 
                  “Essay on the Origin of Languages”
                   (1743) asserts love’s role in the immediacy of touch (versus the mediacy of gesture),
                  and love’s role in inventing drawing as well as, plausibly, language (“Love might
                  also have invented speech”)—but if it is need that in general motivates language,
                  “Dissatisfied with speech, love disdains it” (Rousseau 240–41). However, pity is the
                  passion more befitting Shelley’s Rousseau; pity is the moderation of amour-propre
                  (self-love, which is a corruption of amour de soi, love of self) into compassion.
                  If the 
                  “Essay”
                   places judgment before pity, the <em>Second Discourse</em> (1754) makes pity anterior to reflection. Thus need (in which reflection prompts the
                  preservation of the species) follows passion (love of self, self-love, and pity),
                  communication displaces sympathetic communion. Shelley’s spectral vision shows the
                  detrimental effects of not following this scheme—of species preservation distorted
                  by language’s death-grip, of self-love’s violence absorbed into linguistic warping.
                  Rousseau makes this point explicit: “What the ancients said most forcefully they expressed
                  not in words, but in signs; they did not say it, they showed it” (
                  “Essay”
                   241). Language as the first social institution, according to Rousseau, is founded
                  as a distancing trope, as not just sign but metaphoricity, with the need to communicate
                  by gesture logically displacing the passion of an immediate touch and voice, following
                  after it (“the needs dictated the first gestures, and the passions wrung the first
                  utterings [<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">voix</span>]” [245]). This unsettling, in which need overrides passion only to install death
                  into language as distance and metaphor rather than touching intimacy, disturbs the
                  provenance and authority of signs (articulation and writing are the malady of language,
                  it’s “fatal advantage,”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Rousseau uses this phrase to describe writing’s supplementation of both speech and
                           music, quoted in Of Grammatology 199.</span></div>
                  </div> and if “the most vigorous speech is that in which the Sign has said everything before
                  a single word is spoken,” too often symbols lose their meaning and power to the condemning
                  inefficacy of “circumlocutions” [241]). Rousseau therefore distrusts words as he does
                  not the accentuation of music, and the musical intonation of poetic speech, both of
                  which are more originary and less dangerous than writing because less destructive
                  of presence (the very thing “Life” robs from human being in <em>The Triumph</em>): “The speech of the first men . . . were Poet’s languages” (245). But for Shelley,
                  if poetics is grounded in musical intonation, <em>poesis</em> is grounded in the affiliation of sound with metaphoricity, in the sound’s affinity
                  in relation to the sign’s differential potency, its gesticulatory capacity—indeed,
                  in its imaginative intimacy. <em>Poesis</em> as allegory—as resounding metaphoricity—provides the only recuperation of presentful
                  meaning possible in the face of language’s onto-theological death-grip (a fate Shelley
                  sees as written on Rousseau’s body/corpus before his conversion by confession).

               <p>That Shelley, an astute deconstructionist before the fact, would choose Rousseau to
                  interpret life’s pageant puts into question Rousseau’s idealization of love’s power,
                  of life’s perverting evil, and of shadows. In Derrida’s terms the first two are <em>eidos</em> and <em>ousia</em>, ideality and substantiality; shadows encompass the enfolding of one with the other,
                  the space-time of otherness.

                  </div> What is less doubtful than Rousseau’s idealizations is his facility with the legible,
                  with locating and reading (interpreting rather than deciphering) the trace at the
                  site of supplementarity. This is the site for Rousseau, Derrida argues, of unease,
                  suture, inversion, and perversion. But Shelley’s Rousseau offers a different instruction;
                  rather than point back to origins, his ghostly finger-pointing gestures not <em>toward</em> so much as <em>beyond</em> current epistemic limits; predictive, pre-vocative, provoking an elsewhere as a way
                  out of the metaphysical trap of signs and beyond the Anthropocene. If Rousseau himself
                  saw gesture as less meaningful than either touching voice or metaphor, it is because
                  it is also less immediate, but Shelley’s Rousseau points intimately and tellingly
                  otherwise—at once confessional and prophetic. The lines, “Before the chariot had begun
                  to climb / The opposing steep of that mysterious dell, / Behold a wonder worthy of
                  the rhyme” (469–71), indicate the nature of this beyondness which is not the supplement
                  but rather its abolishment; the wonderment of rhyme is exactly its inscription of
                  accentuation, music, and most importantly, passion—“the wondrous story / How all things
                  are transfigured, except Love” (476). Shelley asks us to follow the index of this
                  passionate trace as it avoids inversion, perversion, transfiguration, and supplementation,
                  since it names the absorptive beyondness that the poem’s breaking off cannot or does
                  not yet know how to inscribe, but toward which, with Rousseau’s help, it gestures.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Such a gesticulation is necessary to ward off the blindness, the necessary not-seeing,
               that Derrida takes as the essence of philosophical discourse without which the aporias
               of the metaphysical tradition cannot be overcome, yet it is a willful blinding that
               prevents the leap out of, and beyond, the épistémè. Shelley has already understood
               this in making Rousseau not blind but hollow-eyed, “And that the holes it [he] vainly
               sought to hide / Were or had been eyes” (187–188). The philosopher-seer’s eyeless
               state is precisely what allows him to guide the poet-dreamer in “forbear[ing] / To
               join the dance” of “this sad pageantry” (188, 176), and in forbearing the Poet might
               then refuse the auto-machine of a discourse that closes down on itself. Derrida’s
               designation of what he calls the animal-machine of reading and rewriting that reacts
               with automaticity is essential to his concept of the trace as the infrastructural
               articulation of the arche-trace, or interdependence of self and Other without which
               presence cannot be conceived. It is the interplay between the self and its objects
               presumed essential to human self-consciousness, but that Shelley might view as essential
               to an unconditional hospitality, an open-door policy with regard to the unconsciousness’
               or visionary state’s capacity to witness suffering as the condition for the possibility
               of change, and therefore of futurity. In <em>The Triumph of Life</em> the trace of writing does not produce what for Derrida is the double finitude of
               the animal-machine of écriture, but rather creates fault lines and openings in that
               structure, fragmentations and ellipses, open doors as it were. The visionary state,
               which elevates the poet-speaker into what Kant, in one of his rare non-despoiling
               moments, considers the highest stage of beautiful art, enables a poetry in which the
               sublime interacts with the beautiful, moves beyond the unlawful freedom of the imagination
               adjudicated by the lawful restraint of the understanding—although not perhaps beyond
               the infusion of both with spirit so essential to a lingual art that delivers more
               than it promises, as Kant notes—making it thus more moral than the other arts (<em>Critique of Judgement</em> [1790] §51).</p>
            <p>Shelley’s most moral poem, a quality noted even by Mary Shelley who appeared not to
               like the poem, pushes beyond a mere liminality ordained by the sublime register. Its
               transgressiveness suggests the violence inherent in a sacrificial structure. The structural
               ploy I have in mind is Derrida’s concept of autoimmunity as the auto-immunitary function
               that mediates a supposedly untenable open or unconditional hospitality, a welcoming
               that puts the self at risk. This is not the threat of the sublime but that of sacrifice
               as what holds sovereignty up: sacrificial indemnification. The sacrifice of objects
               and others is what enables the auto-immunitary function that closes opened doors and
               protects the subject and its proper/properties. What gets sacrificed in the poem is
               not just the endless stream of suffering humanity hurried on by a frenzied cosmogony,
               the very essence of a sovereignty gone mad with its own immunitary logic; populations
               are sacrificed so that the door to futurity remains firmly closed. </p>
            <p>Shelley’s response, I am arguing, to the free-wheeling auto-machine of logocentrically
               grounded sovereignty is to imagine the advent of the future-to-come. His imagining
               cannot be of an ideal republication state, as is Rousseau’s in <em>The Social Contract</em> (1762), nor may it be of the impossible event of an unconditional democracy as the
               truth of the other, as is Derrida’s in <em>Rogues</em> (2005). Instead, Shelley’s poem prepares for the possibility of an unforeseeable
               future beyond the horizon of state ideology, a horizon containing all of western history
               and epistemology since Plato. To imagine a horizonal “beyond” is not to envision a
               distinct event as such (e.g. revolution), nor an “outside” impervious to the auto-immunity
               of the political machine which casts itself as “Life.” It is rather to imagine the
               leap to a new plane of immanence made possible, according to Deleuze and Guattari,
               by a new idea. This evental idea or philosophical concept must go beyond the truth-idea
               of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), love as a revolutionary force, since <em>The Triumph</em> announces no program of patient waiting after Rousseau has imparted his revelation
               to the Poet. Indeed, the idea ushering in the to-come may not be open to articulation,
               as the disintegration of language in the final lines indicates.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the auto-immunitary machine epitomized in the Car of Life, suffering is the predominant
                  human experience. Rousseau, hovering in the ectoplasm of <em>Triumph</em> and bearing the marks of that suffering on his body, represents by his oeuvre the
                  lawfulness of the understanding interceding in the unlawful freedom of the imagination.
                  Such remediation is of course problematized by the autobiographical Rousseau’s unaccountable
                  outrages of taste in his ongoing self-psychoanalysis, but these disappear along with
                  his fleshly form in the poem, where his corpus stands in for a Derridean “auto-immune
                  auto-indemnification” that authorizes sovereignty at every level (Derrida, <em>Acts of Religion</em> 78).

                           and “re-appropriates,” that is, “ex-appropriates” (78). He analyzes the concept more
                           simply as “auto-immunity” in Rogues.</span></div>
                  </div> But dead, ghost-like, Rousseau’s role in sacrificial indemnification is revised by
                  way of his own dead body marginalized from the multitudes in Shelley’s dream-vision.
                  This vision produces an altered state, a poetic possibility in which sovereignty is
                  unveiled as a mad careen destined to slam up against the walls of its own horizon;
                  the alteration makes possible a different plane in which doors might open, in which
                  an unconditional hospitality does not usher others in to the spaces of the proper,
                  but rather welcomes the ground of the possibility of a futurity not yet imagined.
                  The unlawfulness of the imagination is not, as Kant believed, an ugliness not subject
                  to the dictates of taste, but rather the dismissal of a necessary adjudication of
                  justice by law. For Shelley, law can only be evil by referring justice to the dictates
                  of pragmatism, the proper of the subject self, and sovereignty. How can what might
                  only be called an immunitary rationale for limiting the application of justice ever
                  ground a futurity at all? We might view this as the difference between a marriage
                  that necessarily mediates love by way of pragmatism, and a free love that opens the
                  door to an unimagined relation, to a commingling without adjudication, to a truth
                  without a past. Such an analogy might indeed sit behind the inexplicable poor taste
                  of the poem to Jane probably written before two-thirds of <em>The Triumph</em> had been completed.

               <p>The implications of a new plane of immanence—inaugurated by the evental idea as having
                  to do, for Shelley, with freedom, democracy, and the unconditional (perhaps a democracy-at-hand),—and
                  the possibilities for a post-human turn in such a plane; this is a prospect at which
                  language falters and poetic sound and metaphor can only carry partially inscribed
                  meanings. However, in these falterings I believe Shelley is struggling to sound out
                  his vision for a more humane, if less logo-onto-anthropocentric, futurity. To think
                  the ending of the poem, I want to return to the implications of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>’s maddened and dizzying progress. That speed is essential to a new plane of immanence
                  developing. One of the ways to speed up while still inhabiting the structures of the
                  past is metalepsis, the two-at-once of metaphoric achievement. If metaphor provides
                  an analogous relation, a side-by-side correspondence of idea and impression,

                  </div> metalepsis imposes an inverted correspondence in which logic skews otherwise. The
                  possibility opened up by the dizzying movement of the triumph, by way of its reversion
                  to the past, begins to dissolve not into a metonymy but into a metalepsis, in which
                  two tropes at once—a doubled metaphoricity (the fading coal <em>and</em> the mind’s inconstant wind of the poetic imagination in Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> [1821] [531])—oppose the double finitude of écriture by “reconfiguring the relationship
                  between a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ an anteriority and what this anteriority makes
                  possible or forecloses,” as Kir Kuiken explains, allowing the imagination, or we might
                  say the poetic dream state, to be the site-source of “ever-changing future alterations”
                  (171). Metalepsis as the poetic device by which the future can open up by way of the
                  past—rather than via metonymy’s side-by-side logic—becomes in <em>The Triumph</em> the condition of the possibility of a new plane with a new horizonal opening to the
                  future. I am imagining Shelley imagining Deleuze and Guattari’s plane of immanence,
                  wherein the speed of thought is made possible by the constellation of the event to
                  come configured in the evental concept.

                  </div> It is this concept, this eventful thought, which opens the poem’s horizon to a positive

                  profit” offers the speaker a way into an undistorted and thus possible futurity (Shelley

                  the cancelling of sight, like Rousseau’s hollowed eyes, is the condition of seeing
                  out of this world, Life as it is. Although Rousseau gestures toward the past, he is
                  the guiding hand in the poem toward an as-yet to be represented future. As Derrida
                  notes, portraits of the blind are “prey to <em>allegory</em>,” the allegory of drawing as a “specular folding” or “withdrawal [<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">retrait</span>] in meaning of itself,” whereas language “always speaks to us <em>from / of the blindness</em> that constitutes it” (<em>Memoirs of the Blind</em> 2–4).

                  </div> Shelley makes clear that such blindness—specular folding or blindfoldedness—is the
                  condition of life as well as of language. For Rousseau, as Derrida reads him in <em>Of Grammatology</em>, the contamination of nature’s purity is already enfolded within nature; thus, everything
                  associated with the human that Rousseau designates a supplement is already enfolded
                  in nature, including the sign. Similarly, the possibility of a future, not as a blind
                  acquiescence and error in judgment, but rather as the sublime <em>yes</em> of an unconditional welcoming of the yet-to-come is also enfolded, a <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">repli</span> of the outside/future is always folding over into the origin of life. But Shelley
                  does not “read” Rousseau: in allowing him to tell his recursive tale of conversion,
                  he portrays him allegorically, allowing him the specular folding of seeing otherwise.
                  He does so because the problem for Shelley is how to welcome such a future without
                  deferral, without supplement—or at least, with a different relation to the outside
                  and otherness. For this, the Rousseau who Shelley depicts is helpful. What Derrida
                  calls spacing, or the endless deferral of meaning, is a scuttling back and forth in
                  the differentiating machine of language that, if unattended, also blinds us to just
                  how non-meaningful a life lived can be; it enables the headlong careen of the pageant
                  of Shelley’s allegory of unmeaning life. The differentiating machine can only under
                  extraordinary circumstances leverage the scuttling of meaning into the dizzy rapidity
                  of thought that energizes a new plan of thought, a plane of immanence.

                  but <em>The Triumph</em> asks about a different conception of life: what is <em>Life</em>? This is the question the post-human turn posits, since there is no longer possible
                  an illusory tying of origin and life to certain biological forms, while sentience
                  itself has become less definable. Shelley’s possible future, predicated on opening
                  the door to a new plane of immanence, holds open the possibility that a just world
                  without suffering might be possible. Shelley the vegetarian might have embodied such
                  a world with non-objectified subjects that, regardless of their species, would not
                  be required to supplement the idea of justice with their suffering. Such a world,
                  however, would have to be free of the deferral or spacing of writing. Of the endless
                  play of differentiation that inscribes the world we know. To depict a different world,
                  one not yet visible, would require a new writing without deferral, hierarchy, origin
                  fables, distinctions that wound. For Shelley, such a world could not yet be written—but
                  the ellipses, the “. . .” that punctuate the last portion of the poem he <em>did</em> write, mark where the leaping off into a new writing might occur, where a new concept
                  might gather itself for an event to come of wondrous rhyme and otherness without distortion.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is this last impossible concept, arising from the dismantled self of Shelley’s
               later thought, of the impossible possibility of otherness without distortion (a radical
               otherness against which language falters) which coheres with the unspeakablility of
               an impossible future. A new plane of immanence requires the event to come, the unpredictable
               and thus unspeakable event, which might recall before the fact what must not be said
               (or, what might be too terrible to be said). This is the gamble, the leap of blind
               faith into the future that Shelley’s vision demands. Again, it demands it blind-fully,
               and unvoicedly.</p>
            <p>I want to move in three directions at this point (a point is a departure that permits
               new paths to the horizonal limit—and it is the limit at which Jean-Luc Nancy says
               that freedom begins in <em>The Experience of Freedom</em>). First, blind faith recollects Derrida’s ruminations on allegories of the blind;
               second, unvoicedness resonates with both Plato’s khora and Derrida’s engagement with
               apophasis (the voiceless voice)—both blind faith and apophasis also have associations
               with Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing and gesticulations; and finally an impossible futurity
               gestures toward Nancy’s and Derrida’s articulations on freedom at the limits of experience.
               I cannot do justice to all of these; rather, I want to fold in these more recent mediations
               with Shelley’s perspicacious, pliable, and concise weaving of blindness, faithfulness,
               unvoicedness, limits, futurity and freedom in <em>The Triumph</em>.</p>
            <p>In <em>Rogues</em> Derrida defines the khora politically: meaning originally “locality in general,”
               khora designates “spacing, interval . . . another ‘taking-place’” that Plato conceptualizes
               in the <em>Timaeus</em> (c. 350 BCE), but also a beforehand, “a spacing from ‘before’ the world . . . from
               ‘before’ any chronophenomenology” (xiv). The irony of our world is that it is precisely
               the khora-interval that allows “anthropotheological dogmatism or historicity” to take
               place without “providing any ground or foundation” (xiv); khora “would make or give
               <em>place</em>” (xiv). In this retrospective placement of the politico-theological and historicized
               now, Derrida nevertheless posits khora’s relation to the anticipatory function: it
               is “before everything,” part of no-thing while giving rise to what is, “it would give
               rise or allow to take place” (xiv). It is therefore, perhaps metaleptically, the very
               stuff of what is to come, and perforce related to “the unforeseeability of an event
               that is necessarily without horizon, the singular coming of the other, and, as a result,
               a <em>weak force</em>. This vulnerable force, this force without power, opens up unconditionally to what
               or who <em>comes</em> and comes to affect it” (xiv). Because the khora is fully other in its non-being,
               in its spatial anticipation, it offers a place in which futurity can begin to be thought—but
               not the space of that futurity, and this is Shelley’s point. It is only at the limits
               that futurity can even be gestured toward.</p>
            <p>Shelley begins that gesture even before Rousseau points his finger. The problem in
               the poem’s opening stages is that of the multitude following the arrogantly blind-ful
               charioteer: suffering as they are in their maddened dance, they are themselves “the
               truth of the other, heterogeneity, . . . disseminal multiplicity, the anonymous ‘anyone,’
               the ‘no matter who,’ the indeterminate ‘each one’” that is the other truth of democracy
               (or liberality, or freedom) that opposes the autonomy and ipseity that we hold dear
               to democracy (Derrida, <em>Rogues</em> 14). To see these whirling and convulsed dancers as suffering, and as heteronomic
               rather than a blind and frenzied mob is to begin to distinguish genius (embodied in
               Rousseau, albeit skeletally) from the no-matter-who of a future-to-come. This is the
               gesture already in place by the time Rousseau appears pronouncing “Life,” so that
               the speaker-I must begin again, “But first, who art thou?” (180, 199). First causes
               cannot be the grounds of freedom, and Rousseau’s explanations cause the speaker-I
               to understand that “God made irreconcilable / Good and the means of good” (230–31).
               Kant who himself delved the abyss of freedom is included in “those spoilers spoiled,”
               which also include Voltaire (235), those reasoners and mechanists who have brought
               on the “Sorrow, terror, anguish, despair . . . [that] are often the chosen expressions
               of an approximation to the highest good” (Shelley, <em>Defence</em> 529). Such a future-to-come must, by the stopping point of <em>The Triumph</em>, open up to the whoever-comes and not just the select few and self-chosen. The courage
               required to welcome such a future is wrenching; its unvoicedness both compels, in
               the sense of the apophatic call, and stops short, in the sense of an illegible moment.
               In both cases language fails, as it does for the multitude whose frenzy is all that
               can be expressed; the future must be wrenched from the past at such a point, it must
               exceed the promise held by all pastness and go beyond the breaking point.</p>
            <p>Frenzy, then, must be part of the breaking of the limit, the push beyond the grounds
               of the triumphal careen. That the speaker stands apart from both the multitude and
               the frenzy does not preclude his taking part in futurity, a partaking that may already
               be beginning with the fragmentation of words into ellipses. As Derrida notes, “<em>ellipsis</em> names not only lack but a curved figure with more than one focus. We are thus already
               tween the ‘minus one’ and the ‘more than one’” which is “<em>the time there is not</em>” (<em>Rogues</em> 1). The time there is not, which may be the escape from finitude for Shelley, is
               at least in terms of <em>The Triumph</em> the possibility of an impossible future. Such an impossibility requires dizziness
               to be sure. It also requires blind faith, “Fidelity to come, to the to-come, to the
               future” (Derrida, <em>Rogues</em> 4). There is reason for this since the “to-come of democracy is also, although without
               presence, the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">hic et nunc</span> of urgency, of the injunction as absolute urgency” (29). Such urgency demands a leap
               into the to-come, possibly even a new now. That is to say, a new plane of immanence
               that cannot be foreseen or even seen at all during its formation: a dizzying something
               which requires hollow-eyed determination without the possibility of prediction.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Significantly, the Poet’s encounter with Rousseau, and Rousseau’s narrative take up
                  the majority of the poem. As the Poet and reader learn about Rousseau’s encounters
                  with the “Shape all light” (308–433), we also learn that he has been translated by
                  that shape, becoming increasingly hollowed out. He is metamorphosed, in de Man’s words,
                  to a state “in which his brain, the center of his consciousness, is transformed” (
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                   99). Whereas Rousseau’s recurring focus is on the “Shape all light,” de Man reads
                  the Poet as avoiding the shape-light through his narrative fragmentation at the unsubstantial
                  end or leaving off of the poem. Such a reading suggests the ending might be unsubstantial
                  in the sense of a dissolving substance akin to what de Man describes as the light’s
                  “hovering motion” (
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                   105), or it might be insubstantial (not a fading dissolve but an incorporeality).
                  While both are plausibly true, and the poem itself plausibly readable as a problem
                  of the specular fold that enables rather than prohibits insight (“Happy those for
                  whom the fold / Of” are the last words of the poem),

                  </div> the ending also contains the kernel of the whole poem—not as fragment but as ellipses,
                  as points of departure for a leaping out of the spatio-temporal horizon of the poem.
                  De Man is largely concerned with language in the poem, both as rhetorical figure and
                  as disfiguration, but as Rousseau himself points out in his essays on language, time
                  is the essential medium of language creation. De Man recalls Rousseau’s (and Levi-Strauss’s)
                  theories of language in writing about the violent linguistic acts that occur in the
                  poem, each more damaging than the violence depicted in the triumphal parade itself;
                  the poem is eventually revealed to be a “mutilated textual model [that] exposes the
                  wound of a fracture” (
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                   120). It is a wound that de Man finds at the heart of all texts, although Shelley
                  might want the fracture traced back to the collusion of writing and ideology rather
                  than mitigate the potential for poetic language to burst its bounds. But Rousseau
                  and Levi-Strauss were more of de Man’s opinion; as Derrida notes, what the father
                  of Romanticism and the father of structuralist anthropology (who declared himself
                  to be “Rousseau’s modern disciple”) comprehend in their fraught relation to writing
                  and presence is that the violence that language suffers in writing is not a “disease”
                  inherent in speech and not separable from it that precipitates its fall, but rather
                  “the original violence of a language which is always already a writing” (<em>Of Grammatology</em> 105–6). But the violence is in itself a disease, a genetic self-destruct mechanism
                  and it is this disease that Shelley’s poem narrates. Neither Rousseau’s writings nor
                  the voiced narrative embedded in the poem remain, or rather count, by <em>The Triumph</em>’s end. Counting is how Shelley’s fragmentary ending records language’s demise; its
                  self-violence is played out neither as the figure of a hollowed-out (diseased) Rousseau
                  nor as his “recapitulative” narrative in which logic dissipates,

                  ellipses—what might speak itself beyond “Life”’s horizon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This ellipses is related to Rousseau’s hollowing out: diseased by the light’s erasure
                  of his self-consciousness, of his presence as writing and as predecessor figure, Rousseau
                  himself is reduced to a periodic gesture, like beats in a measure rather than Cartesian
                  stopping points (for Descartes, points stop things dead; Shelley’s Rousseau continues
                  to move after death). Translated by the light into an ellipsis of himself, Rousseau’s
                  hollowing is of his self-presence, his consciousness as center of self; he thus sets
                  the stage in the poem for the transfiguration (not translation) of the narrative at
                  the end into ellipses. Derrida writes that the “other ellipsis of the metaphysics
                  or onto-theology of the logos” is the “effort to master absence by reducing metaphor
                  within the absolute parousia of sense” (<em>Of Grammatology</em> 106). “Onto-theology” is, importantly, the very beast Shelley is trying to eradicate
                  in <em>The Triumph</em>; for Shelley this is the real disease of language, subjectivity, self-consciousness,
                  and knowledge that creates the horizonal parameters of a “Life” that enslaves us.
                  To imagine reducing or dissolving metaphor into sensory presence (absolute parousia)
                  is to elide the pronunciative function of language, its rhythms and beats matching
                  the rhythms and movement of sensory presence. In the <em>Essay</em> Rousseau had pronounced language to be the first social institution (219), but as
                  such it is a disfiguration that cannot hold in its literalization of meaning, its
                  denial of language’s capacity for metaphoricity, for figuring truth. As de Man notes
                  in 
                  “Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric,”
                   “truth is a trope.”

                  </div> Rousseau’s translation from self-consciousness into a forgotten selfhood is accompanied
                  by metaphors for light that offer little narrative reason; their illogic exposes the
                  absence language covers over, stripping away the onto-theology Rousseau himself had
                  come to figure and revealing another truth.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Metaphor, Derrida notes in <em>Of Grammatology</em>, is irreducible despite all attempts at mastery (allegory is decidedly metaphoric
               in this sense) (106); de Man proves this irreducibility in his reading of the “Shape
               all light,” and its own narrative logic. More intriguingly, interpreting Rousseau’s
               history of illuminating confessions by way of metalepsis—as a metaleptic recursiveness—allows
               for the movement that will transform or curve itself into the new evental idea of
               a possible democracy that is without logocentric, androcentric, and anthropocentric
               distortion, and thus a new paradigm. This movement is the leap to a new plane of immanence
               at the poem’s ending. De Man notes that the question and answer enacted by the figures
               of Rousseau and the Poet (the question of “‘whence I came, and where I am, and why—’”
               in line 398, accompanied by the same vision) is that of “a question whose meaning,
               as question, is effaced from the moment it is asked,” in the structure of a forgetting
               (98). For de Man, this repeating pattern of question, effacement, and forgetting (rather
               than question and answer) functions like a knot that “arrests the process of understanding”
               (98). For Shelley, Rousseau the writer has, “in a sense . . . overcome the discrepancy
               of action and intention that tears apart the historical world, and he has done so
               because his words have acquired the power of actions as well as of the will.” His
               words “literally, are actions” (de Man 103). But <em>Triumph</em> undermines this understanding of historical intervention, change, and dialectical
               movement. Rousseau is himself faulted for not valuing history’s truths, but not because
               history must be taken as dialectically progressive—rather, because of its evidentiary
               and repeating truths. If Rousseau’s arrestingly ineffective language in the poem is
               read metaleptically, in which the cause substitutes for the effect, truth may be achievable,
               for in this way history and the future are exchangeable. The question cannot have
               an answer, since the answer can go both forward and backward; more importantly, in
               classical rhetoric metalepsis creates a passage from one context to another, effecting
               a change in terms or of formula that opens up a third way. We might say, it is the
               movement of the energy from one plane of immanence to another, that which enables
               the event that announces change. In <em>The Triumph</em>, that event is the chariot careening toward the chasm wall of wondrous rhyme; it
               is announced, but not comprehensibly articulated as an evental idea for the rhyme
               is not legible in the terms that hold sway before the leap it announces. Promising
               everything, like the Shape all light, the wondrous rhyme signifies potentiality, both
               as the power of creative language and as the power of significant movement that opposes
               the recursive forgetting of Rousseau’s and the Poet’s “why?” and the enslaving movement
               of the chariot’s triumph.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Without making a connection between the effacement of history and of self-consciousness
                  and that of counting in language, de Man does suggest that the Shape all light is
                  inextricably bound to the natural beats of human consciousness, as we know these through
                  the hovering, glimmering intermodal qualities of light and water, and the rhythms
                  of measure and poetic language. The first two phenomena signify the “birth of form
                  as the interference of light and water passes” (de Man, 
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                   107), whereas the second two signify formalization. Counting (or natural rhythm or
                  energy and movement as periodic units) is what is common to all four modalities; and
                  counting is a way of signifying without the representational limits of signs or a
                  blindness to metaphor. Shelley goes further, with measure in <em>The Triumph</em> obliterating thought, as de Man notes (114). For Rousseau in the <em>Second Discourse</em>, measure or counting functions in both dance and music as a more primary and primitive
                  medium than the sight/light medium of the image and sign, which comes later as touching
                  is replaced by the distance of gesture and then drawing.

                  diffusive for community, and difficult for the spectator Poet to interpret. “The thematization
                  of language in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> occurs,” de Man notes, “when ‘measure’ separates from the phenomenal aspects of signification
                  as a specular <em>representation</em>, and stresses instead the literal and material aspects of language,” adding that
                  “it is precisely these ‘feet’ [of the <span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">terza rima</span>] which extinguish and bury the poetic and philosophical light” (113). This literalization
                  of language that ignores metaphor, this death of poetic capacity and of an originary
                  communication, is precisely what Rousseau finds to be the history of language as a
                  whole. For Shelley it is the history of western political ideology as well.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In Rousseau’s highly political theory of language’s origins as developed in <em>Essay on the Origins of Language</em> (1781), metaphor and music were early on prone to instability. He posits a geographical
               development of language, such that in northern regions the passions and desire are
               substituted and repressed by work and the need that provokes it; passion there takes
               the form of violent emotions, of fury, and speech turns toward articulation and away
               from tonality and musical speech. Writing is therefore “at the north” where articulation
               is heightened; writing allows for history, which “hollows out” both vowel accent and
               articulation, “extending the power of writing (Rousseau 226). “Our tongues,” Rousseau
               notes in the 
               “Essay,”
               “are better suited to writing than speaking,” an observation noteworthy for <em>The Triumph</em> in which Rousseau’s writings are metaleptically hollowed out in favor of his spoken
               recitative, which nevertheless has no historical compass. Moreover, the “oriental
               corpse is in the book,” but for the north, “[o]urs is already in our speech” (qtd.
               in Derrida, <em>Of Grammatology</em> 226). The north, in effect, is death. This death, which need and work attempt to
               evade, accounts for the loss of melodious sound, of music from languages of the north
               where accent signs and punctuation replace intonation, that is, they replace the resonance
               of intoned life and desire (227). Nothing more clearly theorizes the living death
               of Shelley’s Rousseau, whose language has been so hollowed out that it is eviscerated
               of anything but a haunting. Even its attempts to capture image and figure, poetry
               and measure disintegrate toward the forgetting that is overtaking him. The warning
               he represents for the Poet prepares us, and him perhaps, for the disintegration of
               the poem’s integrity at the ending, its substitution of stuttering punctuation for
               poetic imagination, poetic imaging, poetic music. What does remain is measure, measure
               as counting, as beats, as what might be a gathering of dissipated energies rather
               than a dying into itself.</p>

                  encounters him), provide spectral figurations for the failure of both sight and language
                  in the poem, or rather, for the disfiguration that de Man locates there.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The problem of the poem is not that it dis-articulates figuration and narrative, or
               that it encapsulates frenzied motion and a kind of centrifugal force so that the center
               empties out—or is seen to have always been empty, although these are both at play.
               The problem is that the poem is about the struggle between existence and control as
               a drama of the all in all; to convey this, the poem references so many ideas that
               it works rather like a magnet that has attracted little metal bits that it allows
               to disfigure the unity of the whole. In the Preface to <em>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</em>, De Man says that 
               “Shelley Disfigured”
               is “The only place where I come close to facing some of these questions about history
               and fragmentation,” which include attempts to aestheticize modes of fragmentation
               to a kind of “unity and substance” that may be what the poem, and the entire period,
               resist (ix). That unity and substance, disenfranchised by the hollowing out Rousseau
               represents, and by the insistence on a messily chaotic history doomed to repeat itself
               represented by the triumph, comes to an end with the elliptical ending. There a blind
               seeing is required in order to see beyond the ending; it is the kind of sightedness
               poets are renown for, but Shelley resists putting such seeing into words. What he
               requires is a different kind of writing capable of resisting the death of presence
               that Rousseau accords to writing by refusing that dichotomizing of essence/substance,
               and of presence/distance encoded in Enlightenment theories of language. Such binaries
               recall one even more pertinent to the origin of language, that of nature/culture,
               which asserts an ideological, onto-theological interpretation on history as powerful
               as that of writing itself.</p>

               <p>Describing Levi-Strauss’ focus on the split between nature and culture, Derrida refers
                  to “the originality of a scandalous suture” (<em>Of Grammatogy</em> 105). This might well also describe the chasm wall inscribed with hieroglyphs or “rhymes
                  of wonder” in <em>The Triumph</em> (105). The “rhymes of wonder” are both the failure of logocentric writing and the
                  eradication of presentful voice, already dissimulated by Rousseau’s incoherent narrative.
                  Derrida refers to iterability as repetition with a difference;

                  </div> rhymes of wonder would then be writing with a difference, writing beyond the trace
                  or after the points of departure have been taken. Shelley is envisioning a different
                  kind of writing then, one still necessitating an enabling violence against the chasm
                  wall of horizonal or spatio-temporal limitation—but a writing that would not require
                  the trace, the play of difference and of arche-writing. This is a writing that cannot
                  be said, but can be felt in the beats, the counts of the ellipses that measure out
                  the poem’s partial ending.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have not yet alluded to <em>The Triumph</em>’s allegorical form. Despite its clear allegiance to Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> (1320) and Petrarch’s own <em>Triumph</em>, the <em>Trionfi</em> (c. 1350-74), another allegory sits behind the poem, Plato’s allegory of the cave.
                  Shelley’s Platonism is well known, but I believe that in his last major poem he overleaps
                  Plato’s vision just as he does Dante’s. Derrida’s analysis of Plato’s allegory in <em>Memoirs of the Blind</em> is helpful here because it reveals the difficulty at the heart of the cave analogy:
                  human passivity as the condition for seeing differently. Plato describes his allegorical
                  cave as peopled by humans chained to the walls by their various kinds of blindness,
                  caused when opinion is valued over the logic of ideas. Unable even to move their heads,
                  these prisoners mistake shadows for real things. They are passive while chained, but
                  even what frees them is not due to their own agency: “A conversion will free them
                  . . . But before this dazzling ascent, an <em>anabasis</em> that is also an <em>anamensis</em>,” a journey through previous lives must take place (Derrida, <em>Memoirs</em> 15). This “passion of memory . . . will turn the soul’s gaze towards the ‘intelligible
                  place’ . . . .” Far from being an act of will, however, Plato’s prisoners are represented
                  as motionless through this process; Rousseau’s conversion is a rewriting of this allegory,
                  his repeated retracings of his life as a philosophe prompted by the “Shape all light”
                  rather than by his own initiative, and like the prisoners, the process produces a
                  second kind of blindness, as Derrida notes, that Plato attributes to the exchange
                  of dark shadows for intelligible light, where otherness might indeed be perceived
                  otherwise and without blinding distortion. Thus Rousseau must see through eyes hollowed
                  out of their prior blindnesses. Part of what Rousseau, and the Poet who he instructs,
                  must forget is the blinding opinions of epistemic thought—constrained by postulates,
                  skepticism, and Kantian critique—which rejects any stretching out to the thing-in-itself.
                  Clearly Rousseau’s finger stretches in just such a way to point to the in-itself,
                  the triumphal march as the essence of ideologically bound and blinded Life. Derrida
                  notes that Plato’s prisoners never stretch their hands even toward the shadows on
                  the cave’s walls, they are motionless in their inability even to touch the representations
                  of things, let alone things-in-themselves. Shelley rejects such rejection, insisting
                  that Rousseau <em>can</em> see blindly, <em>can</em> point to verities and intelligibilities. De Man disagreed with Derrida’s interpretation
                  of Rousseau’s blindness, remarking in a letter that “The desire to exempt Rousseau
                  (as you say) at all costs from blindness is therefore, for me, a gesture of fidelity
                  to my own itinerary . . . that, on the specific question of the rhetoricity of his
                  writing, he was not blinded.”

                  </div> The truth-tropes of poetic language, for de Man, Derrida and Shelley, were accessible
                  to Rousseau under certain conditions: when his metaphors overtook him, as does the
                  Shape all light. The intelligible place he points to is off the map, of course, just
                  as is Plato’s ideality.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is a futurity worth risking the erasure of past histories if those histories
               are only doomed to repeat themselves; Rousseau’s erasure of self points this out.
               And if Shelley evinces anxiety in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> over the distorting mirrors of futurity, surely Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing can
               overcome distortions that would only return us to a recursively recycled history of
               error and suffering. Indeed, “we let ‘<em>I dare not</em> wait upon <em>I would,’”</em> whereas instead “We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want
               the generous impulse to act that which we imagine; we want <em>the poetry of life</em>” (Shelley, <em>Defence</em> 530; emphasis added). Poets have long been able to create a bridge from the past
               into a possible futurity (“The poetry of Dante may be considered as the bridge thrown
               over the stream of time, which unites the modern and antient world” [526]), but “poets
               have been challenged to resign the civic crown to reasoners and mechanists” (528),
               categories to which Rousseau at first capitulated in his poetical philosophy. The
               imagination, action and poetry requisite for a futurity without distortion in <em>The Triumph</em> would inaugurate the post-Anthropocene, and require, as Shelley’s Rousseau has demonstrated,
               a giving up of past words, memories of self and achievements, and therefore of the
               Cartesian cogito per se. His recursive story-making of self into nonself is a movement
               towards a new temporality in which past histories are forgotten or overwritten so
               that a new time may come into being. Similar to Rousseau’s self-fragmentation, <em>The Triumph</em>’s ending ellipses—which might be a cracking or fissuring in the chasmic walls, a
               positive fragmenting whose leaving off opens up the potentiality of poetry rather
               than a breaking up of logocentric linguistic formulations—gesture toward the possibility
               of a non-cogito realm in which selfhood is spelled differently. This is also the vision
               of philosophers of the non-Anthropocene, such as Cary Wolfe, in arguing that nonhumanist
               thought must not be brought back to a concentrism that still harbors the human at
               its core. The nonhuman must not be a veiled concern about the future of human survival;
               it must not be a practice of care toward other beings and toward the environment that
               restores the primacy of human agency. Both of these orientations distort otherness,
               casting it in logocentric terms that privilege the cogito and thus human history,
               undoing the lessons of the <em>The Triumph</em>’s allegorical vision. “Rhymes of wonder” foresees this linguistic breakthrough that
               could restore sight’s capacity to see what is there, awaiting a resolution into recognizable
               patterns whose interpretation need not privilege the logos, its theology, or its human
               subjectivity. Just as those currently struggling to envision what such a linguistics
               might entail cannot do more than gesture toward such a future, so too does Shelley’s
               great poem do no more than indicate pointedly language’s dissolve in such a futurity.
               Nevertheless, it is a rhyme of wonder.</p>
