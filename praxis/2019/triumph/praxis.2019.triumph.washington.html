            <p class="noCount">This essay challenges Paul de Man’s famous reading of figurality in Percy Shelley’s
               <em>The Triumph of Life</em> to show how the poem thinks love as a figural-material quantum entanglement between
               two people that models a new materialist politics. I argue that for Shelley the “shape
               all light” and its interaction with the rainbow evince one instance of this figural-material
               phenomenon. This interaction I read as a form of what Karen Barad calls “quantum entanglement,”
               when the subject and object—as in physics’ double-slit quantum light experiment—emerges
               as a new entity that brings a novel spacetime into being. As Shelley theorizes it
               in the poem, this merger of subject and object, or lover and lover, allows him to
               finally conceive a love that serves as a cornerstone for a radical politics. While
               we tend to see the poem as breaking off into irresolution, Shelley’s poem, on my reading,
               instead envisions how two-person spacetimes are a triumph of love over the nihilistic
               autocratic politics of anarchy that the poem depicts running wild in the pageantry
               of life.</p>

                  “Shelley Disfigured,”
                   he identifies the specular, in the imagery of the sun, the light, the water, and the
                  stars as the tropology around which the poem groups its deconstructive figurality.
                  De Man specifically reads the nebulous “shape all light” (356)

                  connects the sun’s light, obscured stars, and water’s well previous to the light’s
                  transmogrification into a rainbow: <span class="quote">‘“Shape all light” is referentially meaningless since light, the necessary condition
                     of shape, is itself, like water, without shape, and acquires shape only when split
                     in the illusion of a doubleness which is not that of self and other. The sun, in this
                     text, is from the start the figure of this self-contained specularity. But the double
                     of the sun can only be the eye conceived as the mirror of light. “Shape” and “mirror”
                     are inseparable in this scene, just as the sun is inseparable from the shapes it generates
                     and which are, in fact, the eye, and just as the sun is inseparable from itself since
                     it produces the illusion of the self as shape . . . Because the sun is itself a specular
                     structure, the eye can be said to generate a world of natural forms. The otherness
                     of a world that is in fact without order now become, for the eye, a maze made accessible
                     to solar paths, as the eye turns from the blank radiance of the sun to its green and
                     blue reflection in the world, and allows us to be in this world as in a landscape
                     of roads and intents. (109–10) ’</span> Yet, surely this account depends on a classic presupposition of high romanticism partially
                  engendered by de Man himself: the eye as necessary for figurality itself, a doubly
                  odd claim since the eye, evidence of human existence, introduces the ontological (“allows
                  us to be”) into de Man’s otherwise properly figural conceptual space, and the anthropocentric
                  into his rhetorical theory of language’s mad, machine-like nature. For it is precisely
                  its linguistic, or what he calls rhetorical—rather than historical, or physical, or
                  ontological—nature that, for de Man, makes figurality figurative. Whether unconsciously
                  or unwittingly—and here we must think of de Man’s own idea of critical blindness—de
                  Man’s deconstruction would appear to deconstruct itself. But perhaps this is only
                  all too appropriate since auto-deconstruction, according to de Man’s reading of Shelley’s
                  poem, and his readings elsewhere of Rousseau, is how deconstruction works.

                           to aesthetic totality. See Derrida,

                  the subject and any epistemological access and phenomenal relationship the subject
                  might have with those objects and that world. And while we typically view de Manian
                  deconstruction as exclusively embrangled in linguistic and epistemological problems
                  properly belonging to the subject, the figurative-material deconstructive paradox
                  detected above allows us to consider how the linguistic subject of deconstruction
                  and the material objects of speculative realism are much more inter-connected in Shelley’s
                  final poem than we think.</p>

               <p>Shelley’s notes to <em>Queen Mab</em> (1813) address this paradox: light is not simply reflectively specular as de Man presents
                  it; it is also a material, and, as we’ll see, a quantum, speculative, phenomenon.

                           and the speculative. One of Shelley’s early essays is titled 
                           “Speculations on Metaphysics.”
                           </span></div>
                  </div> Shelley, having read Isaac Newton’s <em>Principia</em> (1726) (which he quotes in his notes), and possibly his <em>Optics</em> (1704), writes that, “the equal diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction
                  of the rays by the atmosphere and their reflection from other bodies. Light consists
                  either of vibrations propagated through a subtle medium or of numerous minute particles
                  repelled in all directions from the luminous body” (
                  “Notes”
                   239). This last sentence demonstrates Shelley’s awareness of the corpuscularian debates
                  concerning the nature of light, in which Thomas Young’s 1801 double-slit thought experiment
                  complicated Newton’s theory of light as particles by positing that light, depending
                  on the conditions of the experiment, acts as a wave.

                  </div> Shelley’s careful phrasing, though, investing in neither scientific account, demonstrates
                  a mind determined to speculate on the hither side of known reality, and in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, his cerebrations on starlight moves past Newton and Young into what we now call
                  quantum physics and speculative realism. By yoking together the scientific, the poetic,
                  and the political <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, I argue, produces a radical politics based on love, one that founds communities
                  rather than the state-of-nature chaos and anarchy of two key interlocutors, Hobbes
                  and Rousseau. Love, folding “its healing wings” over the world at the end of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1820), in a defiant gesture against tyranny, it is suggested, nonetheless tumbles
                  back into “woes . . . Hope thinks infinite,” whereas <em>The Triumph of Life</em> sees love escape such transcendental temporalities altogether (4.570). The love Shelley
                  theorizes through the poetics of star- and day-light in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is, I will argue, something similar to quantum feminist Karen Barad’s conceptualization
                  of “intra-action,” which allows Shelley to imagine wholly new worlds that this politics
                  of love both brings into being and is brought into being by.</p>

                  </div> Shelley, too, is familiar with starlight’s easy-does-it temporal travel schedule:
                  “some idea may be gained of the immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed
                  that many years would elapse before light could reach this earth from the nearest
                  of them; yet in one year light travels 5,422,400,000,000 miles, which is at a distance
                  5,707,600 times greater than that of the sun from the earth” (
                  “Notes”
                   239). Readings of <em>The Triumph of Life</em> from de Man’s to more recent quantum readings of light in the poem all reference light
                  in its earthly, and so bounded-down, anthropocentric aspect.

                           Niels Bohr calls “complementarity.” For Plotnitsky, complementarity resembles Derridean

                  </div> But understanding light as discretely deconstructive or materialistic undermines the
                  linguistic-material—and speculative—paradoxical nature of it Shelley develops and
                  deploys in his poem. Indeed, given starlight’s distance from the earth and the human
                  eye, the “I” of both poem and self, need be, and perhaps simply is, of no consequence
                  for what de Man calls, referencing classical antiquity’s theogony, these fallen gods,

                  “Shelley”
                   117). Stars, it turns out, are like Transformers, more than meets the eye. <em>The Triumph of Life</em> thus evokes what contemporary speculative realist philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux,
                  calls the “arche-fossil,” nonhuman material or phenomena that evidences life anterior
                  and ulterior to human life because the lifespans of this material phenomena exceeds
                  that of the human species’ lifespan.

                           are ‘immortal stars,’ ‘eternal,’ ‘deathless,’ ‘sacred’; they are ‘pure’ and dwell
                           in ‘Eternal bowers’” (161). According to Wasserman “he also glimpsed intimations of
                           the eternity of transcendent Being in the fact that the stars are always present,

                  during the day, and its illusory temporal here-ness, suggest an ulteriority beyond
                  the anthropocentric. As I read it, <em>The Triumph of Life</em> thus glimpses the possibility of a post-apocalyptic world existing after we are gone,
                  one glimmering alone, dark, and beautifully desolate in the phosphorescent darkness
                  of starlight.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yet precisely because of its untimely indifference to humanity’s claim to everlastingness,
                  starlight’s evocation of the way in which the world is always already without us,
                  deflates our transcendental beliefs in the human species’s necessity for earthly survival.
                  If starlight is a temporal, flashing on-and-off indicator of a world always already
                  without us, then it is also a cosmic cautionary tale counterintuitively imploring
                  us to find ways to be-with the other in the time we have left. Confronting finitude,
                  the poem’s speaker and his guide, Rousseau, struggle to understand their stupefied
                  bearing witness to life’s unfolding of the mad chaos of individuals bereft of human
                  connection. As we shall see, on this world without us, <em>love, literally, creates this being-with us</em>, and in the process literally creates new worlds, what Barad’s quantum theory calls
                  new “spacetimes.” More specifically, I suggest that Shelley’s last poem resolutely
                  abandons the skepticism, the idealism, and the transcendentalism variously associated

                           apprehension . . . to be the fundamental power of the human mind and a mental counterpart
                           of the primal capacity for self-transcendence he found in love” (22). For…</span></div>
                  </div> Shelley scholarship has sometimes had a tendency to read him within a traditional
                  view of Romanticism as apocalyptic, a drive toward a mythic paradise, sometimes manifesting
                  on earth, sometimes beyond it, in an Elysian after-life.

                  verse; as Jerome McGann noted long ago, “a new and significant impulse was moving
                  his poetry” in this last year of his life (41). But, as I have argued elsewhere, Shelley’s
                  work has never been invested in these apocalyptic fictional fantasies of Paradise.

               <p>To engage this post-apocalyptic reality, Shelley imagines a new affective solidarity
                  whose necessity of love is terrestrial, not transcendent. This affinity is more than
                  the self’s search for its own likeness in a copy of itself, as Shelley puts it in 
                  “On Love”
                   (circa 1818) (itself a text shot through with the vocabulary of “particles” and “vibrations”),
                  a narcissism that merely replays the egocentric self-love of Shelley’s Rousseauvian
                  nightmare parade in this, his last long poem. Instead, the poem theorizes how love
                  works when life, verging on termination, becomes a more-urgent-than-normal process
                  of perpetual self-inquisition with no answers, exemplified by the poem’s final broken-off
                  question, “Then, what is life?” (544), as well as in Rousseau’s haunted, disconsolate
                  pleas to the “shape all light”: “tell me whence I came, and where, and why” (398).

                           of love: “we must . . . read Shelley’s politics as an aspect of his rhetoric of Romantic
                           love” even as Shelley’s love poetics lead to an acceptance of “death as the telos
                           of desire and gravitates[s] increasingly toward a visionary despair” (18).</span></div>
                  </div> Shelley’s poem offers no answers to these desperate implorations because, as the poem
                  dramatizes in its staged pageantry of life’s decline and fall into a masquerade of
                  simulacra, to know life definitively would be to circumscribe life within a field
                  of closed possibility, a life, perversely, of no possible continuance, one without
                  the unpredictability of an unknown future for if the future were known life would
                  be over.

                  </div> This is what Derrida means, in his reading of the poem, by “living on”: life continues
                  only because the future is always here and never here, just like the stars, which
                  have technically not arrived even though we can “see” them (which we really cannot)
                  (
                  “Living”
                   62). Hence, the poem finds its resolution in the irresolution of its necessary non-answer
                  to its final question, instead asking “what is love?,” a triumph then of love rather
                  than life. And so Shelley’s phantasmatic costume ball—Hazlitt referred to the poem
                  as “a new and terrific The Dance of Death” (494)—theorizes love, not as Derrida does,
                  as a love of ruins because everything falls to ruin, but beyond ruin; and not as de
                  Man’s figure for disfiguration, but as an intra-active figural-materiality that is
                  beyond transfiguration when it manifests as true love.

               <p>Shelley’s poem associates light and its shifting configurations with political factions,
                  the sun serving as anarchy’s herald and the stars’ as love’s harbinger. Although for
                  de Man, “it is unimaginable that Shelley’s non-epic, non-religious poem would begin
                  by elegiacally or rebelliously evoking the tragic defeat of the former gods, the stars,
                  at the hands of the sun” (
                  “Shelley”
                  117), what he terms “the unimaginable” is, rather, easily imagined, for the poem’s
                  opening stages this battle precisely by <em>not</em> ascribing mythological god-like significance to the stars. In Shelley’s hands, they
                  become significant framing devices of the poem’s political allegorization, linking
                  patriarchal politics to the poetics of sunrise: </p>

               <p> The immediate opposition of the sun and the stars reverses the teleology of disaster,
                  which derives from the Latin “astar”—which means disaster is literally a fallen star—by
                  equating it to sunlight instead, the wellspring of earthly life, the figural-material
                  alternative to sunlight’s figural masculinist power. Unlike the later feminized “shape
                  all light,” the sun’s light is associated with the law of the father, which thus links
                  it to the parade of “Anarchs old” (285) who signify destructive authoritarianism and
                  tyrannical despotism. Dissociated from the sun, the speaker’s reflective thoughts,
                  “which must remain untold,” stem specifically from “the stars that gem.” Only as the
                  sun tears away the night’s mask does the speaker awaken from his sleepless reverie
                  in the nighttime to the fantastic visions, and ill slumber, of the light of the day.
                  Sunlight thus suggests veil-rending violence and the observationally specular, even
                  as the stars are avatars of a gentle tranquility, a paradoxical sleep so peaceful
                  it requires not the unconsciousness of sleep but hazy wakefulness. This wakefulness
                  is different still from the wakeful sleep of day that brings with it Rousseau’s phantasmagoria
                  of moral, cultural, and physical abominations bombinating in their own Bacchanal,
                  thanatopolitical excess. Nighttime’s wakefulness, in contrast, like the stars, is
                  not specular but speculatively realist, the imagining of some world we cannot envision
                  or comprehend since it seems to exist beyond us, a signal fire guiding us through
                  the dark to the shape all light.</p>
               <p>Whereas for de Man the sun usurps natural, chronological progression—and thus renders
                  historical progress always a matter of absolute contingency through its disfiguration—the
                  sun’s sudden appearance manifests a different, decisively material event. As the editors
                  of the Norton Shelley remind us, the line “the stars . . . gem the cone of night”
                  refers to an actual, rather than figural, shadow that the earth casts as a result
                  of its orbitational locality in relation to the sun. The poem fixes the earth’s physical
                  coordinates, evoking Newton’s own “System of the World,” even as its opening passage
                  works by prosopopoeia, personification, and apostrophe, which figure what de Man calls
                  “the master trope of poetry” (
                  “Hypogram”
                  48). Sun, stars, sky, earth, light and shadows, are all both figural and material.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Later in the poem, this twinning of figurality and materiality becomes more confused
                     and confusing by aligning the sun with the political faction of anarchism, linked
                     to a figurality disconnected from the material world, that Shelley hopes to defeat.

                     the poem opens obscuring and rebuffing the true sun of reality. Caesar and Constantine,
                     Gregory and John, rise like a false eclipse between the world and the Sun even as
                     the Sun, by its very nature, is part of this eclipse. Enacting the end of the world,
                     the sun blots out not just the stars, but itself, the sun, the true son, light of
                     all light, signaling that the world will literally end as a direct result of the sun’s
                     parenting of a political anarchism with heliocentric destruction on its anthropocentric
                     mind. Rousseau’s visions, like the poem itself, therefore figure state-of-nature tales
                     told by Hobbesian warmongers that culminate with humanity’s extinction. Confronted
                     with the spectacle of all these pale-horse death-dealers, it is perhaps no wonder
                     that, as Hugh Roberts remarks, “in the pageant of life it is love, above all, that

                     linguistic turn that understands both the subject and object to be discursive constructs.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Barad borrows Donna Haraway’s use of the term “diffraction” as a helpful way to understand
                  quantum entanglement. She glosses Haraway as follows: “diffraction can serve as a
                  useful counterpoint to reflection: both are optical phenomena, but whereas the metaphor
                  of reflection reflects the themes of mirroring and sameness, diffraction is marked
                  by patterns of difference” (71). Barad emphasizes how diffraction expands the circle
                  of difference away from reflective homologies of self and love that we can see Shelley,
                  for instance, presenting in 
                  “On Love.”
                  The point, for Barad, is to increase difference rather than curtail it, as reflection
                  does. Extending Haraway’s usage, Barad’s diffraction becomes a metaphor for understanding
                  both ontological difference as well as physical phenomena. Barad’s reading of diffraction
                  in Niels Bohrs’ famous restaging of Young’s two-slit experiment, evidences this quantum
                  paradox: a particle of light, when shined through a diffraction pattern grating, presents
                  as either a wave or a particle. According to Newtonian physics, such a result is impossible,
                  since “only waves produce diffraction patterns; particles do not (since they cannot
                  occupy the same place at the same time)” (81). As Barad argues, this diffracted phenomena
                  illustrates quantum entanglement since the production of matter as diffractal waves
                  and particles <em>depends</em> on the entanglement of the subject, the apparatus (the diffracting grate), and matter
                  itself. That is, only this particular intersection of subject (experimenter) and object
                  (matter) produces particle-wave duality. For Barad this phenomenon means “that entanglements
                  are highly specific configurations . . . [that] . . . change with each intra-action.
                  In fact is it not so much that they change from one moment to the next or from one
                  place to another, but that <em>space, time, and matter do not exist</em> prior to the intra-actions that reconstitute entanglements” (74; emphasis added).
                  The consequences of Barad’s development of quantum entanglement are therefore astonishing
                  since they challenge, and even dismiss, contemporary humanistic and scientific accounts
                  of how space, time, and, matter, and hence subjects and objects, exist in reality.
                  By manifesting a new spacetime in each entanglement, <em>different</em> spaces and times, quantum entanglement alters the very ways in which we understand
                  ontology for humans: the world only exists in a non-fixed—indeed non-existent—space
                  and time repeatedly created by the production of new spacetime worlds that are, in
                  turn, created simultaneously by newly created subjects and objects. And since entanglement
                  instantiates space and time new worlds are made with each entanglement even if these
                  are not, properly speaking, between subject and object or subject and subject since
                  all of these terms are now constantly being brought into existence with each iterative
                  entanglement.</p>
               <p>In Barad’s theory, it is only posterior to entanglement—and hence their existence—that
                  manufactured (what she calls) “cuts” occur between intra-active agential subjects
                  and materialities to produce discrete, identifiable “subjects” and “objects.” “Cuts”
                  are thus social constructions that proceed from, rather than precede, the ontological
                  origins of subjects and objects, just like the masks that “fell from the countenance
                  / And form of all” at poem’s end, exemplify how wearing a person suit can falsely
                  fashion oneself as an un-entangled “subject” (536–37). By de-masking the simulacra
                  we don in the world, quantum entanglement undoes notions of the subject and object
                  as independent agencies. Instead, the material world, which on speculative accounts
                  exists apart for us is, actually, always already with us until we enact the artificial
                  cuts that cleave a given entanglement. Similarly, the shape all light, linguistically
                  personifying a quantum materiality, radically confounds our ability to conceive of
                  subjects and objects as originarily distinguishable, a con-fused phenomenon that explicates
                  the narrator’s, and Rousseau’s, own confused reaction to the shape. In proffering
                  Rousseau nepenthe, the shape all light obliterates his mind as sand, which indicates
                  the dissolution of the subject as model of and for human discursive epistemology and
                  ontological prioritization as distinct from nonhuman materiality. Whereas Rousseau
                  viewed himself through the aperture of his subjectivity, rather like being cut out
                  with a cookie cutter, the shape all light illuminates the post-cuts that take place
                  after entanglement. </p>

                     force and the intra-action between subject and object as they are brought into being <em>for the first time in a newly created space and time</em> that is the process of their intra-action. Whereas the poem begins by thinking light

               <p> Mark Lussier and Arkady Plotnitsky have both noted the quantum language rolling through
                  the placidly pillowing water in this passage. But Barad’s reconceptualization of quantum
                  matter as entangling the subject and object in a space and time of their own making
                  in an act of creative simultaneity, reveals a much bolder, and as we’ll see, politically
                  radical Shelley than either Lussier’s or Plotnitsky’s classical quantum accounts allow
                  for. The steady, exact rhyme scheme (“willow,” “billow,” and “pillow”) maintains the
                  rainbow’s illusory essence, an assonance that reflects the reflection of the water
                  and hoodwinks us into reading the passage as an instance of classical quantum mechanics—the
                  water rolls on naturally just like the end sounds in space and time understood as
                  locational end points. But the poem acknowledges the quantum diffraction of the water
                  when the personified shape all light “bend[s] her / Head under the dark boughs, till
                  like a willow / Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream” (363–65). The shape reverse
                  personifies the stream even as the shape all light itself becomes this stream in the
                  emergence from the water of the light’s skyward-arcing rainbow that occurs because
                  of both its <em>reflection and diffraction</em> in that water (since a rainbow can only occur by diffraction). Both material and
                  figurative, the shape all light becomes now something else altogether again as it
                  is entangled with the water in a flowing measure of eddying hair and chromatic illusion.
                  The rainbow thus recalls us to the other side of the specular coin: the human observer
                  who can see what does not exist, a unique form of, to repurpose de Man’s universally
                  explanatory phrase of deconstructive rhetoricity, “blindness and insight.” For Shelley
                  knows that rainbows are both material phenomena and optical illusions that both do
                  and do not exist as tactile material in spatial reality: you both can and cannot touch
                  and see a rainbow. Shelley’s rainbow is a diffraction, then, that makes a difference
                  for in this passage Shelley reminds us that the figural and the material, the subject
                  and object, can only be cleaved after their moment of entangled becoming.</p>
               <p>For despite the rainbow’s illusory nature it does <em>exist</em> even it if cannot be touched by the speaker or seen for what it really is, a chromatic
                  spectrum of moisture and dust fronting the sky. As such, it exemplifies the poem’s
                  speculative ontological paradox since optical illusions require a perceiving subject,
                  whose senses can be deceived by discrete objects (as Rousseau recounts to the speaker,
                  while witnessing this scene, he was baffled and unable to comprehend not only its
                  meaning but even what was actually occurring). So, on one hand, the human subject
                  aestheticizes a material, ontological phenomenon, epistemologically constructing it
                  as one thing understandable to the human mind, when it actually is something more
                  diffractedly unknowable. On the other hand, the rainbow’s very material nature, its
                  optical illusoriness, demonstrates how irrevocably blurred and smeared together the
                  subject and object are. Just as we re-ontologize the rainbow as something it is not,
                  so does the rainbow’s illusoriness re-ontologize humans by pointing out that humans
                  are capable of being fooled by a world we think we command. In this sense, like the
                  speaker and Rousseau, we are anthropocentric Anarchs and must be taught, by the poem’s
                  quantum theory of love, to kick away the ladder of this anarchism we have climbed
                  up. This is another of example of why, as Julie Carlson remarks, “a major impediment
                  to adopting a Shelleyan practice of love is the difficulty of seeing what he is talking
                  about” (76). The rainbow, we might say, is a weird type of material personification:
                  by converting it from dust particles to this thing we call a rainbow, we make what
                  cannot be seen seeable: we remake it in human terms as something that can be seen
                  on human terms. In making the rainbow seeable, and making ourselves see it, the rainbow,
                  a material smattering of particles, comes into discursive being literally in a space
                  and time in which it actually ontologically exists but that also does not exist until
                  it is entangled with the human. In turn, humans’ own subjectivity undergoes a radicalized
                  becoming as the material reality of this optical illusion turns human eyes inside
                  out to see what they cannot see. Reality literally gets made as real precisely because
                  of, paradoxically, both its realness and non-realness—which are both made by the other
                  at the same time. This is the lesson of the rainbow shape all light which makes “all
                  that was [seem] as if it had been not” (385). Beliefs in human deterministic and constructivist
                  powers fall away somewhere over the rainbow, a place and time that, with no fixed
                  locative or temporal junction without this human and nonhuman entanglement, serves
                  as a reminder that we have far surpassed Newtonian mechanical accounts of the world
                  and even contemporary quantum accounts of the world. The rainbow and the human subject
                  intra-act, demonstrating, together, how subjects and objects are entangled in the
                  creation of their own world.</p>

                  agency of the rainbow becomes a type of post-apocalyptic spatio-temporality when Shelley
                  reveals that the rainbow’s shape all light is not just electromagnetic radiation and
                  optical illusion but also starlight. Like starlight, the rainbow shape will turn us

               <p> Although metaphorically like “heaven’s living eyes,” the stars that “reillumine”
                  the darkness, the shape all light is also like the day, only here she functions as
                  the true day, the feminine sun of no father, sun and not a son. She represents, then,
                  a revolutionary, feminized, quantum truth, the light of the stars and true day that
                  can politically rebel against the false sons of false suns. This revolution gets televised
                  when the shape all light, now revealed as a late-arriving star, in an extraordinary
                  gesture of post-apocalyptic power, tramples out human thought in order to remind it
                  of its own mortal brevity in the face of the billions-of-years lifespan of the universe.
                  And the shape joins “Lucifer,” the masculine light bringer, what de Man questionably
                  reads as “metaphor,” to the rainbow’s feminine quantum materialism. This intra-active
                  relational conflux, a marriage of starlight’s optics with the rainbow’s illusory effect,
                  diffracts humans’ self-regard as rulers of the earth, the impolite fiction of an impolitic
                  politics that renders us all anthropocentric anarchs. Like the rainbow, the stars
                  always exist, but only always exist as we “see” them once we do not see them.</p>
               <p>The shape all light opposes the light of the patriarchal sons of anarchy, guiding
                  us, as love guides Dante out of fire and flame into paradise, towards the new forms
                  of being love’s post-apocalyptic politics guarantees. After Rousseau drinks the nepenthe,
                  he experiences, as he says, “a new Vision never seen before” in which the shape all
                  light “waned in the coming light / as veil by veil the silent splendour drops / from
                  Lucifer, amid the chrysolite / of sunrise” (411–20). The Morningstar, Lucifer, evanesces
                  the shape all light, even as the doubling “of that fairest planet,” Venus, doubles
                  Lucifer as the Eveningstar, twinning the morning to the night, to “that star’s smile”
                  (419). Yet this star’s light “is like the scent / Of a jonquil when evening breezes
                  fan it” (420). The simile repurposes morning light’s (Lucifer) and evening light’s
                  (Venus) ethereal early-morning meeting as a meeting of reflection, for the jonquil
                  is also known as “narcissus,” recalling us to Narcissus and the poem’s enemy, self-love.
                  Lucifer, when he looks in the depths of fading night, sees his own face reflected
                  back in the star’s millions-year-long Cheshire smile. The shape all light, however,
                  despite its evanescence, nonetheless remains <em>present</em>, intra-acting with Rousseau’s materialistic speaker-companion, sidestepping the sun’s
                  and the star’s egoistic cybernetic loop of self-love.</p>
               <p>This is what makes this vision so powerfully, diffractedly, different: it is an instance
                  of entanglement between the shape all light and Rousseau, who both now only begin
                  to exist because they journey forward through the darkness that is light, an entangled
                  phenomenon that signals an entire reorientation of how we understand the human in
                  relation to the material. Rousseau, as both a material tree stump and a discursive
                  subject, is already imbricated with the material world but here enters into a new
                  entanglement with light. The word “knew,” which signals epistemology, is undercut
                  by the ontological yoke of the “shape” that “moved, as I moved” combining the human
                  and nonhuman, entangling the material and the figural: “So knew I in that light’s
                  severe excess / The presence of that shape which on the stream / <em>Moved, as I moved</em> along the wilderness” (424–26; emphasis added). A cascade of imagery captures the
                  shape’s “presence”: </p>

               <p> Like the day and night of dream and wakefulness divided by the absent-present stars
                  with which the poem opens, the shape all light seems to exist as both presence and
                  absence, the momentary difference between the time of day’s giving way to night and
                  vice versa—a moment that is “forever sought, forever lost,” pure day separated from
                  pure night, each uninterrupted, exorbitant from its opposite, forever sought and lost
                  because day and night are forever blended in the other. Space and time get remade
                  in the shape all light as neither day nor night, sun nor star, and hence by exceeding
                  the time of day and night the shape creates a non-anthropocentric world since day
                  and night are human inventions. Like the stars that remain in the sky obscured by
                  the sun (77–79), the shape all light appears as both material real shape and its own
                  ghost, just as Rousseau himself lives only partially, neither dead nor alive: “so
                  did that shape its obscure tenour keep” (432). The shape all light, in keeping its
                  musical voice (“tenour”) level yet also obscure, becomes one with Rousseau, his material
                  ghost just as Rousseau is the shape’s material ghost that entangles rather than demarcates.
                  Rousseau and the shape are an “uncut” intra-action: subject and object, figural and
                  material, light and night.</p>
               <p>Rousseau becomes, here, not just the Enlightenment patriarch who Mary Wollstonecraft
                  targets as one of feminism’s arch-villains, but a phenomenon made of and for a new
                  kind of feminist post-social-contract politics. By revealing the intra-action of the
                  shape all light’s feminist critique of Enlightenment patriarchy <em>with</em> a key figure of that patriarchy, Shelley reversions the social contract as forms
                  of intra-action that denude egocentric individualism of its power to cut people into
                  Hobbesian individuals invested in their own welfare and warfare against the communal
                  concerns of others. For Shelley’s carefully-chosen invocation of the Enlightenment
                  via the wraith-like Rousseau, of course also conjures Rousseau’s main antagonist,
                  the even more spectral Hobbes, and with him the attendant fears that life in the post-apocalypse
                  will return us to a war of all against all, which the poem depicts in its (mon)anarchs
                  and Bacchic simulacra chained to Death’s chariot, whose chaos we call variously libertarianism,
                  despotism, or fascism. All such ideologies and factions, if they can even be distinguished,
                  are grounded in <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</span>, Rousseau’s, and Shelley’s, enemy. So whereas Kate Singer rightly remarks that “Rousseau’s
                  dream presents him with nightmare visions of the social contract” (and that only the
                  feminine shape all light can lead Rousseau out of “the nightmare of history”), for
                  Rousseau and Shelley such nightmares are also dreamt because these are actually Hobbesian
                  visions of life (
                  “Stoned”
                  706, 688). In response to these nightmares, <em>The Triumph of Life</em> explodes both monarchical despotism and social-contract anarchic and democratic Enlightenment
                  theories to rethink a viable post-social-contract community, to forge modes of being
                  together on a post-apocalyptic world where governmental, cultural, familial, and religious
                  institutions have all fallen, similar to what Rousseau and Hobbes describe in their
                  differing versions of the originary state of nature.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>As such the shape all light differs from twilight, a diffracted course-change that
                     runs away from the Anarchs’ navel-gazing self-love toward a love that tarries somewhere
                     with the other, just as the material shape does with the nearest human subject, Rousseau.
                     Here Shelley’s choice of Rousseau as Virgilesque guide to the speaker’s Dante culminates
                     in a warning to abjure self-love or it will leave you, like Rousseau at poem’s end,
                     “as one between desire and shame / suspended” (394–95). For it is Rousseau, and not
                     Hobbes or Wollstonecraft, who targets self-love in <em>A Discourse on Inequality</em>(1755) and <em>Reveries of the Solitary Walker</em> (1770), in which humans’ egocentricity in the state of nature must be annihilated
                     for any genuine social-contract politics to overpower human passion for self from
                     self, a foundation for politics the poem lays bare as nothing more than a reset of
                     Hobbesian anarchy disguised in the resulting simulacra of democratic revolutions that
                     must be ruled by social contracts equally laid bare as ineffectively useless. But
                     whereas Rousseau’s solution is the erasure of self completely in <em>Reveries</em>, his last book, Shelley repurposes Rousseau as his guide to checkmate the anthropocentric
                     self-love that operates the Anarchs’ politics.

                     </div> As Orrin Wang argues, Shelley’s Rousseau critiques both the Enlightenment’s failure
                     and a post-Enlightenment, post-Napoleon despair over failed revolutions. That Rousseau
                     the Enlightenment <em>philosophe</em> is most associated with the French Revolution signals this failure even as the poem
                     targets Rousseau’s intense engagement with overcoming his own egocentricism, like
                     an arrow loosed, not by the sun god, Apollo, but by the god of the stars, Hesperus:
                     self-love as the foundation for an anthropocentrism that is killing us. Witness Rousseau
                     throughout the poem, constantly concerned with himself—“Shew whence I came, and where
                     I am, and why” (398)—rather than others since “none seemed to know / Whither he went
                     or whence he came, or why” (47–48).

                     </div> Nepenthe is meant to erase self-love—which is patriarchal and masculine as opposed
                     to the feminist shape all light—through its erasure of the self but it only blots
                     out the Lockean <em>tabula rosa</em> of the mind, blots out the subject as epistemologically constructed. Touching his
                     lips to the cup of self-forgetting recalls the speaker to himself, but only up to
                     the moment of intra-action between Rousseau and the shape all light, which ontologically
                     recreates the self and the other as a new entangled phenomenon. <em>The Triumph of Life</em> therefore illustrates how such an entanglement can overcome, finally, the revolutions
                     that ultimately fail because of self-love: anthropocentric apocalyptic belief in a
                     progressive utopian future brought about by humans acting upon a world that exists <em>for</em> rather than <em>with</em> and <em>without</em> them (since entanglement upends such temporal and spatial coordinates).</p>
               </div>
               <p>The poem thus finds Shelley confronting his own earlier narcissistic theorization
                  of love as well as Rousseau’s <em>Julie</em> (1761), an ur-text for the poem about those, to quote Rihanna, who fall in love in
                  a hopeless place. Drawing on Enlightenment ideas about sympathy, Shelley writes, in
                  
                  “On Love,”
                  that “we are born into the world and there is something within us which from the instant
                  that we live and move thirsts after its likeness” (504). Even while we seek homology
                  in another’s form, an instance of narcissistic externalization, our parched self’s
                  thirst for self-love—like the anarchs whose self-love quenches the sun, which is their
                  mirror—turns inward and “we dimly see within our intellectual nature a miniature as
                  it were of our entire self” (504). Delving into the self is explicitly reflective
                  rather than diffractive physics, “a mirror whose surface reflects only the forms of
                  purity and brightness: a soul within our soul that describes a circle around its proper
                  Paradise which pain and sorrow or evil dare not overlap” (504). In this earlier essay,
                  love, for Shelley, remains grounded in the desire for the apocalyptic, or paradisiacal,
                  unity of perfection within the self, a kind of tunneled-under version of Rousseau’s
                  self-love in <em>Julie</em>: “love is but illusion; it fashions for itself, so to speak, another Universe; it
                  surrounds itself with objects that do not exist, or to which it alone has given being;
                  and as it renders all its sentiments by images, its language is always figurative.
                  […] When passion is at the full . . . [it] . . . can see nothing but Paradise, Angels,
                  the virtues of Saints, the delights of the celestial” (10). For Rousseau in <em>Julie</em>, love’s figurative nature is tethered to its essentially mutable nature: it creates
                  non-real universes, new person suits, constantly transfigurable.</p>
               <p>In contrast, <em>The Triumph</em> theorizes love, not as figuration, but as entanglements that are unadorned by the
                  masks of Rousseauvian self-delusion exhibited by the skeletal trick n’ treaters at
                  poem’s end. Shelley’s Rousseau, in relating his vision of Dante, claims that the world
                  is dumb to love’s music: </p>

               <p> Love is music, a light, a singer, that melodically rhymes to lovers but which the
                  world itself cannot hear because love’s materiality is external to human beings. Love
                  is a feeling between two subjects but also materialist, a “light” or external song
                  that only comes into being as hearable music—apparently the evidence of its existence—between
                  two subjects. In other words, love is a quantum entanglement that can only be heard,
                  to put it paradoxically, <em>once it is heard</em> since its existence appears as the harmonic melody produced through the note-playing
                  of one lover to another. And yet, because the world cannot hear love, this means that
                  love, more paradoxically still, <em>does exist</em> separately, materially from the world dumb to its song. Nonetheless, “the sphere,”
                  or world that cannot hear love, is moved by this very melody it is deaf to. At the
                  syntactic level, the poem runs the world up against the wondrous rhyming of love’s
                  musical melody, the dash shoving in like a trident from the sea against the line as
                  if the world, while deaf to love, peers outward to Dante’s fiery inferno: </p>

               <p> <em>This</em> earth filled with phantoms and dim-form people reminds us that subjects remain shadowy
                  strands of gossamer, black striations on the pattern of the world’s light, a difference,
                  we must recall, between sleep and waking, and waking sleepfulness, and sleepy dreaming.
                  Neither subject nor love exists then, neither in the world nor between lovers prior
                  to their love: it is a thing that is neither object nor subject but an entanglement
                  between the two. Here, life begins and ends as one-to-one.</p>
               <p>Donald Reiman writes that Shelley changed his conception of love between 
                  “On Love”
                  (circa 1818) and <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1821) from “love as a response from others to his nature” to “a pursuit and celebration
                  of the good that he saw in others” (10), one that evokes Humean and Smithian sympathy.
                  But <em>The Triumph of Life</em> revolts against any such notions. As the masks falling from the countenances of the
                  poem’s orgiastic revelers remind us—as indeed does the speaker’s and Rousseau’s phantasmaticity—no
                  autonomous subjects, either in body or mind, exist as yet in the world of the poem,
                  only simulacra, a false impression of a reality suspended by its own naïve beliefs
                  in a division between humans and the world as if they are independent actors irresponsible
                  for their own delusions. What the poem discovers instead is that love is its own material
                  entity, external to the subject, yet also, paradoxically, reliant on its entanglement
                  with the subject for its life. One cannot go outside oneself to love the good in the
                  other because the subject does not exist before love; every iteration of love fashions
                  itself and the subject anew. And, indeed, the great moral of the poem is that such
                  iterations form the architecture and architexture of a social contract after all social
                  contracts can no longer exist in politics-as-usual manifestations, when institutional
                  restraints like those favored by Hobbes and Rousseau are no longer possible, when
                  life can only continue by bravely not knowing what life is, when no answers are any
                  longer possible. To the question “then, what is life?” the poem answers: knowledge
                  of the contour, nature, and time of life are irrelevant. For love is the answer, an
                  entanglement that may fail, like any politics, and fail again, and again, until an
                  entanglement shapes lovers’ light as what love is for real: ontologically beyond transfiguration,
                  true love. And this is where Shelley surpasses Barad because for him a final spacetime
                  of love can emerge between two people.</p>
               <p>By thinking love as non-transfigurational because it only exists as intra-active entanglement
                  (again, space and time do not change they are made), Shelley crafts a vision of future
                  spacetimes wherein love creates its subjects even as they create love for the first
                  time. Seen in this light, the many lights of Shelley’s poem, before the subject and
                  object are entangled in love, no subject, no self, exists, nor, indeed, does love
                  itself. Love, then, <em>is</em> love, in a space and time of its own loving. In <em>Epipsychidion</em> (1821), Shelley remained faithful to the idea of love as a relation between a subject
                  and object, a lover and beloved. But the bonds in such relations dissolve, as they
                  do in that poem, since, like the simulacra in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, subjects cling to the notion that they are human subjects. Shelley realizes that
                  this “cut” between subject and object is itself a delusion. A priori notions of anthropocentric
                  subjects are simply masks humans put on to cut themselves off from the world; in so
                  doing they assume the title of another Napoleon or Frederick or Caesar, anthropocentricism
                  as another form of the narcissism and egocentricity attributed to love that the poem
                  resists and rewrites. Instead, the music of love arrives from outside the human even
                  as it is also arises from the subjects who fall in love, the material drawing humans
                  together into relations even as, in the process, love creates both itself and the
                  subjects-as-lovers.</p>
               <p>Imagining beyond the anthropocentric subject, Shelley’s theory of love suggests not
                  the egoistic chaos of a world lost to political anarchy but rather a radical politics
                  of love that creates worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests new types
                  of life, of living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world without
                  us we could never have possibly anticipated because those worlds do not yet exist
                  (this is why the poem breaks off). The poem wants us to know that this lovely spatiotemporality
                  is like the stars, which, in their ulteriority beyond human life, constantly evince
                  our own end even as this turns us back to consider our own survival since it reminds
                  us that there may be none without love. <em>The Triumph of Life</em> triumphs by knowing that life cannot be defined since each entanglement is of its
                  own making, its own life. While we can never know what life is, Shelley entreats us,
                  we must learn what true love is, and that is all we may know on earth and all we need
                  to know. This is what Shelley knew, sitting on the sands of the Bay of Lerici, writing
                  this poem, gazing at the sea that would soon claim him. In this time of disaster,
                  of fallen stars, the triumph of love means a becoming of ourselves in our entanglement
                  with the other in the darkness of light before the waves carry us away. For the uncertainty
                  of our survival guarantees the paradox both of love’s radical indestructibility and
                  the limited time it has left to live, to love, while we gaze up at the stars.</p>

               reads <em>The Triumph of Life</em> specifically as a showcase for Shelley’s theorizing of what Niels Bohr calls “complementarity.”
               For Plotnitsky, complementarity resembles Derridean <em>différance</em>, the way in which the trace structure defers and differentiates linguistic meaning
               spatiotemporally (264). However, mapping Bohr’s quantum mechanics onto Derridean deconstruction
               is not only a maneuver that oversimplifies quantum complementarity, it also commits
               a phallogocentric gesture Derrida would surely not endorse. It erases feminist science
               studies and eco-feminism from a discourse it has actually been at the forefront of
               for decades.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">Wasserman notes the importance of stars for Shelley: “stars, however, carried a special
               symbolic significance for Shelley that he exploited in a number of poems. To him they
               are ‘immortal stars,’ ‘eternal,’ ‘deathless,’ ‘sacred’; they are ‘pure’ and dwell
               in ‘Eternal bowers’” (161). According to Wasserman “he also glimpsed intimations of
               the eternity of transcendent Being in the fact that the stars are always present,
               obscured in day from earthly vision only by the diffusion of sunlight in the earth’s
               atmosphere. The likening of the flower-world to the star-heaven suggests, then, not
               merely the mutable oscillation of starriness between world and sky but also, paradoxically,
               the immutable eternity of that starrinesss and therefore the possible eternity of
               both Existence, which is equitable with the One Mind, and the totally comprehensive
               and ultimate Being” (161). Wasserman’s valuable insight into Shelley’s symbology deviates
               from my reading of stars in that Wasserman, by returning them to a revelation of transcendence,
               and ultimately an equality with the One Mind and hence the human, construes the stars
               as evidence of a possible future paradise in the anthropocentric mode.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">Ulmer offers a version of Shelley as lusting for transcendence: “The pressure contradiction
               exerts on Shelley’s radicalism ends by diverting love from world mediations to transcendent
               absolutes. The apocalyptic drive of Shelley’s late poetry reflects the continuity
               of his idealism and politics as antitypical facets of a single desire” (24). John
               Wright has a similar view of love and transcendence in Shelley. Wright takes “metaphoric
               apprehension . . . to be the fundamental power of the human mind and a mental counterpart
               of the primal capacity for self-transcendence he found in love” (22). For more on
               love in Shelley see Stovall, Warren, and Baker.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">My reading places me alongside Ullmer’s larger point even as I diverge from him when
               it comes to Shelley’s desire for death through an increasingly highly wrought apotheosizing
               of love: “we must . . . read Shelley’s politics as an aspect of his rhetoric of Romantic
               love” even as Shelley’s love poetics lead to an acceptance of “death as the telos
               of desire and gravitates[s] increasingly toward a visionary despair” (18).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               “Anarchs” stand, for Shelley, as a Hobbesian politics that incorporates all versions
               of self-love represented by Caesar, Frederick, etc.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">17. </span><span class="noteBody">Although discussing 
               “The Sensitive Plant”
               and not <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, Wasserman valuably points out that, for Shelley, “flowers and stars are not only
               analogous but also, as their other occurrences indicate, interchangeable. That flowers
               are the stars of earth is a commonplace that was an important, often central, symbol
               in Shelley’s poetry after he became acquainted in 1819 with the plays of Calderon
               . . . ” (159).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">18. </span><span class="noteBody">For Goldstein, Shelley’s Lucretian materialism can bridge the gaps between the poem’s
               various materialisms: “to the extent that three technical, hard-to-reconcile senses
               of ‘matter’ compete in contemporary materialist criticism—the deconstructive materiality
               of the letter, the Marxian matter of history, and, more recently, the ‘vibrant’ and
               polymorphous material that ‘new’ materialists retrieve from the history of philosophy
               and modern science studies—<span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">De rerum natura</span> still has something to offer” (64). I skew toward what we call “new materialism,”
               although Barad’s work, I hope to show, exceeds all of these formulations to suggest
               something much more radical about how the real and non-real, the discursive and material,
               are mutually constitutive.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
