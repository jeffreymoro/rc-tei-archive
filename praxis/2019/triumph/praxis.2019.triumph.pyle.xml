            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">This is an essay about a minor event in a major poem. I hope to demonstrate how the
                    minor event of a detached poetic image offers us a way of understanding what is
                    <emph>in back of</emph> or
                    <emph>behind</emph> the proto-cinematic energies on
                    display in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (1822). And I am also
                    interested in exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor” lyricism of our own
                    contemporary cinema open a means of beholding the image-event in Shelley’s poem? If
                    this second possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible to discern in these past
                    poetic and present cinematic images a form of historical “circuitry” that reveals
                    something about the agency or “currency” of images. I want to propose that the
                    currency of the poetic image is best understood by what Roland Barthes identified as
                    the <emph>obtus</emph> or “third meaning,” a glimmering residue of the
                    stilled cinematic image that offers the point of contact for the current that
                    circulates between the literary and cinematic modes of image production.</p>

            <p> If every essay we write has a back-story, we usually have the good taste for it to
                “remain untold” even when, as in Percy Shelley’s case, it might keep us “as wakeful
                as the stars that gem / The cone of night” (21–23).<note place="foot" resp="author">All
                    references to Percy Shelley’s
                            poetry are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s Norton edition of
                    <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>. Further references to
                            Shelley’s poetry and prose are to this edition. On the speaker’s
                            withholding of “thoughts,” it’s relevant to invoke Walter Benjamin’s
                            account to Gretel Adorno of his “holding” “certain thoughts” “safe with”
                            himself and “yes, even from” himself until 1940 when the “war and the
                            constellation it brought with it” prompted him to compose them. These
                            “certain thoughts” are his <title level="a">Theses on the Concept of History</title> (cited by
                    David L. Clark in <title level="a">Goya’s Scarcity</title> 86).</note> But given that
                this is an essay that is very much about the “back-story,” I will take the liberty
                of beginning it by telling my own. When Joel Faflak first wrote me about the MLA
                panel for which this essay originated, he asked cryptically if I wanted to revisit
                “our favorite poem.” I was struck by the audacity of the invitation: we are rarely
                asked&#8212;at least in an institutionally authorized setting such as the Modern Language
                Association&#8212;to identify “our favorite poem,” much less to speak about how it strikes
                us and moves us. But my respect for Faflak’s scholarship is such that I agreed
                immediately to the invitation; and that agreement prompted me in turn to reflect on
                how I might extract “my favorite poem” and from what catalogue of favorites it might
                be drawn. I understood Faflak not to be soliciting a talk about a poem that was
                necessarily a significant achievement or a decisive event; rather, I thought he was
                making a less critical and more intimate query into “my favorite things,” something
                like “raindrops on roses,”&#8212;those poems, in other
                words, that whether major or minor become precious to us, even indispensable. Given
                that it was Joel Faflak making this request, I assumed he wanted me to select such a
                poem from English Romanticism. I reflected on my usual romantic suspects, poems that
                I feel are necessary to my being&#8212;those poems about mountains or birds&#8212;before I
                realized what I had long known: my favorite poem was <title level="m">The Triumph
                    of Life</title> (1822). It was only then that I revisited&#8212;and actually read
                carefully&#8212;Faflak’s initial request and realized I never had a choice in the matter
                of favorite: I had been assigned to write about <title level="m">The Triumph
                    of Life</title> because it was already known in advance to be my favorite. I am happy
                to know that there are others quite like me, singled out for the great gift of this
                poem, a gift that can feel every bit a curse.</p>
            <p> Shortly after this recognition, I read Faflak’s astonishing essay on the “vitally
                cinematic” nature of Shelley’s final poem and immediately discovered there the most
                succinct account to date of what is at stake for Shelley’s poetics of the image, one
                that is not merely a reflection of its historical moment but its projection of a
                futurity: “<title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> reflects a society of the
                spectacle still in visual flux. But it predicts a history fascinated by the
                production of images that body forth life, then compromise any return to life
                itself” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168). Faflak’s principal point of reference for his re-reading of
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is Lars von Trier’s <title level="m">Dancer
                    in the Dark</title> (2000), a film which invokes and even inhabits
                <title level="m">The Sound of Music</title> (1965) with the director’s special form of
                lovingly perverse devastation. This constellation of ironies and overdetermined
                coincidences prompted me to wonder how a poem such as
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> can qualify as a
                “favorite”? If <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is the final poetic gift Shelley
                bestowed on futurity, it is most certainly not delivered in a “brown paper package
                tied up with string”; and it certainly has none of the palliative or compensatory
                qualities that singers from Julie Andrews to Bjork have invoked with “my favorite
                things.” Indeed, it’s a poem that seems likely to undo every happy item in that
                song’s catalogue of favorites and would seem one of the <emph>least</emph>
                likely candidates for a favorite poem. I wondered what might make <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title> not only an important poem for Shelley studies, for
                the field, even for the profession, but also my own personal favorite?</p>
            <p> There are many political, theoretical, rhetorical, disciplinary, and biographical
                aspects of this astonishing text that make it such a beacon in Romantic studies: it
                seems to be one of those poems that simply won’t be done with us, a sprawling
                remnant too relentlessly demanding to be answered once and for all, a hallucinatory
                thrill-ride that promises or threatens to take us far beyond its own vanishing
                point. It’s a poem that conveys both the originary fiat of the sun “springing forth”
                and the trippy “perpetual flow” of visions “ever new,” while making the conveyances
                and the conveyed an urgent matter of political and poetic history. In fact I feel
                authorized to read the famous opening lines&#8212;“Swift as a spirit hastening to his task
                / Of glory and of good” (1–2)&#8212;as referring not to the sunrise, which takes its own
                sweet time, but to the poem itself. Still, these features of the poem, however
                exhilarating and exacting, are not the aspects of literature we typically
                characterize as endearing or intimate. And as necessary and demanding as I find
                these defining features of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, they are not
                the qualities that make this daunting and undoing poem so precious to me. The answer
                to the initiating query&#8212;what makes <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> my
                <emph>favorite</emph> poem?&#8212;can be traced to the
                personally arresting effect of an accidental but notable aesthetic event.</p>
            <p> Folded inside one of those sprawling <emph>terza rima</emph> verse
                sentences in the introductory proem to Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> are the following lines: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills they glimmer” (32–33).<note place="foot" resp="author">It’s no accident
                    that <title level="m">The Triumph</title> generates lines that have had this effect on its
                            readers. Jacques Khalip’s beautiful “admission” of his long-standing
                            relationship with the third-to-last line of the poem speaks directly to
                            my own connection to the poem: “I admit that for years, I have been
                            perplexed by the minimal yet arresting power of ‘as if that look must be
                            the last,’ to the point where the whole apparatus of the poem dissolves
                            for me into something like the floaters that Mary saw in the manuscript.
                            The words, however, have never sounded especially elegiac to me but
                            rather quietly withering in their kitschy and clichéd tone, even
                            recalling the countless small disasters of standard torch songs composed
                            in the minor key&#8212;noncatastrophic gestures and affects that explode at
                            micro-levels and dissipate, neither fetishistic nor talismanic. Like
                            Etta James’s <title level="a">At Last,</title> then, this is a love that has ‘come along’”
                            (77).</note> Though I have extracted the lines in the form of a
                grammatically complete sentence, they serve in fact as part of a dependent clause,
                the minor vehicle to a simile which is part of an elaborate phenomenological figure
                and a major interpretive crux of the poem. The extracted lines themselves are not
                obscure. Stuart Sperry has suggested that adding a comma after “hills” makes the
                lines “intelligible,” but I believe that the absence of the comma extends what we
                might call the “glimmer effect” to the demonstrative pronoun: “evening hills
                <emph>they</emph> glimmer” (181).<note place="foot" resp="author">See also Ross Wilson’s treatment of the
                    passage in <title level="a">Poetry and the Life of Theory,</title> his illuminating chapter on
                            <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in his vibrant
                            book on Shelley’s poetics of life: <title level="m">Shelley and the
                                Apprehension of Life</title>, esp. 150–51.</note> Once one
                restores the passage to its grammatical and rhetorical operation in the poem, things
                are&#8212;as always in Shelley&#8212;immediately complicated given that this glimmering
                <emph>veil</emph> of evening light is a figure for transparency. Here is
                the extracted image in its immediate context as well as the opening and conclusion
                of the proem:

            I still find Paul de Man’s rendering of the significance of the passage to be the
                most acute account of the complications of the passage and its implications: the
                “clarity” is “like that of a veil drawn over a darkening surface, a description
                which necessarily connotes covering and hiding, even if the veil is said to be ‘of
                light’” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 106). For de Man this passage is part of a textual
                “knot” that by way of an echoing “glimmer,” repeated by the figure of Rousseau
                almost 400 lines later, “unites the poet-narrator to Rousseau” and establishes a
                principal site of the poem’s treatment of “knowledge, oblivion, and desire” (106,
                105, 107). In fact, the passage can be said to achieve the status of a de Manian
                “allegory of reading”: “Light covers light, trance covers slumber and creates
                conditions of optical confusion that resemble nothing as much as the experience of
                trying to read <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, as its meaning glimmers,
                hovers, and wavers, but refuses to yield the clarity it keeps announcing” (106). </p>
                    <p> I regard this sentence from <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> to
                        be an allegory of what it means
                to read de Man and his own “altogether tantalizing . . . play of veiling and
                unveiling” (106). But though it is as seductively beautiful as the poem it
                interprets, de Man’s account of the early passage in the proem of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> identifies an “optical
                confusion” that seems unwarranted by the lines themselves. The “transparent . . .
                scene” and the “veil of light” both describe the “strange trance” that “grew” over
                the “fancy” of Shelley’s speaker; but what is perhaps most “strange” about the
                “trance” is not the “confusion” it generates but the weird fact that the trance
                changes nothing at all: the speaker merely knows what he had already “felt” (“the
                freshness of that dawn,” “bathed in same cold dew,” etc.). The “scene”&#8212;the very
                scene he is witnessing&#8212;simply “came through” clearly. If the proem begins and ends
                with two major events&#8212;the “springing forth” of the Sun and the “rolling” of “a
                Vision”&#8212;the only occurrence in the final four stanzas is something that doesn’t even
                happen to the speaker in the poem: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills <emph>they</emph> glimmer.” Though the lines may be
                        <emph>positionally</emph> important insofar as they establish the
                phenomenological conditions for the “Vision” to be “rolled” on the speaker’s
                “brain,” they are themselves poetic non-events, especially when measured against the
                scale of the universal history that unfolds in the “Vision” itself, the triumphal
                pageant of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. These first forty lines are,
                after all, mere back story.</p>
            <p> Nothing authorizes me to identify the two special lines I’ve extracted and turn them
                into a complete <emph>sentence-image</emph>, especially given their
                dependent and supportive role in the fragmented passage of a fragmentary
                poem.<note place="foot" resp="author">I take the
                            figure of the <emph>sentence image</emph> from Jacques
                            Rancière’s formulation of that term: “By [the sentence image] I
                            understand something different from the combination of a verbal sequence
                            and a visual form. The power of the sentence-image can be expressed in
                            sentences from a novel, but also in forms of theatrical representations
                            or cinematic montage or the relationship between the said and the unsaid
                            in a photograph” (45–46). If Rancière inaugurates this mode of inter-art
                            “assembling” with his notion of the sentence-image, my own immediate
                            deployment of the term is more directly derived from Orrin N.C. Wang’s
                            important “reworking” of the term as a feature of Coleridge’s
                            “techno-magism,” or the poetic capacity of “making something out of
                            nothing” (<title level="a">Technomagism</title> 300). As Wang characterizes it, “the sentence
                            image, in line with Ranciere’s political vision, asserts an overcoming
                            of parataxis without the subordinate relations that structure the
                            hypotactic clause” (296). In my own “reworking” of the term, I’m
                            interested in an extractability or detachability of the image that
                            allows it to crystallize into something withdrawn and
                        discrete.</note> But perhaps it is the very quality of their
                provisional “completeness”&#8212;a passively rendered action and its effects&#8212;that makes
                the lines obtrude, suspending temporarily the relentless and even delirious movement
                of Shelley’s verse: clauses opening upon new clauses, similes in which vehicle
                overtakes tenor, figures sprawling across stanzas, all breathlessly
                enjambed.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As far as I
                            am aware, no critic has surpassed William Keach’s understanding of
                            Shelley’s versifying, especially the poet’s deployment of
                    <emph>terza rima</emph> in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                            which, according to Keach, displays “a compositional intelligence fully
                            in touch with the arbitrariness of its expressive medium yet capable of
                            shaping that arbitrariness into, as well as according to, precisely
                            provisional ‘constraints of meaning’” (188).</note> That we can
                detach this image from the course of the poem doesn’t substantially affect the
                poem’s interpretation: nothing in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> hinges on these
                two lines. Rather, Shelley’s poem offers this glimmering sentence-image in the
                manner of an arresting if minor detail in a painting, one which has little to do
                with its compositional arrangement or symbolic meaning but upon which we might
                inexplicably dwell, like the delicate stroke of lightning drawn in the corner of
                Giorgione’s <title level="m">The Tempest</title> (circa 1506).
                The sentence-image I’ve extracted from Shelley doesn’t undermine the figure of a
                “transparent” “shade;” and it suits the poem’s tone and tenor. But to me this
                sentence image also seems to <emph>belong elsewhere and on its own</emph>.
                This is the case in part because the image is invoked as something not necessarily
                experienced by the speaker: the feature of the veiled illumination does not belong
                to the speaker’s catalogue of observations but may merely be a recognizable
                aesthetic occurrence, a glimmer that is given or expected to occur under certain
                atmospheric conditions. Withdrawn from the longer passage, the extracted passage
                offers a discrete reflection on the temporality of images, the particular
                “when-ness” of a “veil of light.”<note place="foot" resp="author">I want to
                    acknowledge here my gratitude to Henry
                            Wonham for his generous and exacting reading of this essay and
                            especially for his eloquent and strenuous objections to my critical
                            practice of “image extraction.”</note> There is a compressed
                if passing constative and declarative independence to this sentence-image that
                invites us to take it as something complete and something known: “when a veil of
                light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer.” In any event, I <emph>feel</emph>
                the image’s invitation; and thus it is perhaps less accurate to say
                that I have extracted this image from the poem than it is to acknowledge how the
                image has extracted itself and solicited me in the process, the minor event of an
                image that arrests us without doing anything or promising more.</p>
            <p> This is an essay about a minor event in a major poem; and I hope to demonstrate how
                the minor event of this detached image offers us a way of understanding what is
                <emph>in back of</emph> or <emph>behind</emph> the proto-cinematic energies on
                display in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. But I am also interested in
                exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor” lyricism of our own contemporary
                cinema open a means of beholding the image-event in Shelley’s poem? If this second
                possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible to discern in these past poetic and
                present cinematic images a form of historical “circuitry” that reveals something
                about the agency or “currency” of images. I want to propose that the currency of the
                poetic image is best understood by what Roland Barthes identified as the
                <emph>obtus</emph> or “The Third Meaning,” a glimmering residue of the
                stilled cinematic image that offers the point of contact for the current that
                circulates between the literary and cinematic modes of image production.</p>
            <p> In the following section of my essay, I explore this “minor currency” of the image
                by way of a constellation of critical positions or relays. If Barthes’s account of
                the <emph>obtus</emph> of the image is my point of departure, for my
                sky-map of history I look to Walter Benjamin’s <title level="a">On the Concept of History,</title>
                his final theses about the role of the image for historical constellations.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">All references to Walter Benjamin in the body of my essay are from his
                    theses <title level="a">On the Concept of History,</title> except
                            where noted.</note> For an understanding of the “detachability”
                of the image, I turn to Jean-Luc Nancy’s meditations on <title level="m">The Ground
                    of the Image</title>. However unlikely it may seem, Walter Pater’s notion of
                “appreciations” suggests a mode of discerning the force and mobility of literary and
                visual images. And finally Deleuze and Guattari’s notions of the
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign> and the assemblage in their book on Kafka suggest a way of thinking
                how image-connections work. In the third section of the essay, I turn to
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> (1998), Todd Haynes’s ambitious film about
                “glam rock” as both a consonant cultural text and a methodological guide for how we
                might use the currency of the “stilled” or arrested image to extract Shelley’s
                poetry of the “minor event.” I conclude the essay with a brief thought experiment
                which links the minor cinema of the third meaning to
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in order to ask how this
                circuitry of images, simultaneously vibrant and beyond life, might open itself to
                the Deleuzian <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>.</p>
            <p> My thinking about the poetic and cinematic meditation on the image is made possible
                by this array of theorists and poets and filmmakers who may share nothing more
                methodologically than a keen eye for detail and the apprehension of the minor event.
                If this poetic, cinematic, and theoretical constellation “lights up” for us to
                behold it&#8212;if it “glimmers” or “glitters”&#8212;then it might also offer us what Benjamin
                called a “historical construction”: this would not be another historical narrative,
                and not even a “counter-narrative,” but arrested and extracted dialectical images
                which, behind and beyond any story, offer a new way to think the sky map of “eternal
                history” as the “eternity of its transience” (407).</p>

            <head>II. How to Stay Minor</head>
            <p> It’s harder than one might think. A <emph>minor</emph> event seems like a
                contradiction in terms: the moment a literary or visual image or textual passage
                achieves the status of an <emph>event</emph>, it will have passed from its
                position as minor, lesser, or subordinate to the level of the major or the
                principal. I think we can assert with confidence that the hermeneutic project in
                literary and cultural interpretation is predicated on the achievement of the
                “major.” However divergent in implication or application, every influential critical
                undertaking I know of, belonging to critics as diverse as Auerbach, de Man,
                Greenblatt, Spivak, Žižek, involves some effort to isolate the unsuspecting detail
                or figure, unearth its hidden significance, and thereby move from the minor to the
                major. De Man’s <title level="a">Semiology and Rhetoric</title> offers a paradigmatic example of a critic
                attending to what may have appeared to the many trained and thoughtful readers
                before him to be the most insignificant distinction between a rhetorical and a
                literal question, only to learn that the “innocent-looking” exploration of a minor
                textual undecidabilty results in the “rhetorical suspension of logic and vertiginous
                possibilities of referential aberration.” “It turns out,” as de Man often puts it,
                that in “our” close philological scrutiny of these apparently minor rhetorical
                details, “we are in fact playing for very sizeable stakes” (10).</p>
            <p> But what does it look like if we keep the <emph>stakes</emph> “minor”? My
                thinking about the minor event is prompted by Benjamin’s declaration in his third
                thesis on the concept of history: “The chronicler who narrates events without
                distinguishing between major and minor ones acts in accord with the following truth:
                nothing that has ever happened should be regarded as lost to history” (390). It’s
                easy to overlook the fact that Benjamin is making the
                case <emph>for</emph> the narration of minor events,
                especially since nothing feels <emph>minor</emph> about the <title level="a">Theses on the
                    Concept of History</title> and the “state of emergency” in which they were written: those
                are indeed “very sizeable stakes” (392). And the essay’s major declarations are the
                most memorable and most cited: “there is no document of culture which is not at the
                same time a document of barbarism,” “the historical materialist . . . remains in
                control of his powers, man enough to blast open the continuum of history,” “What we
                call progress is the <emph>storm</emph> (of history),” the “one single
                catastrophe” (396, 392). And for his agents of historical redemption, Benjamin
                invokes major theological figures: the “Angel of History,” the Antichrist and the
                Messiah, Judgment Day. Moreover, for his notion of historical redemption, Benjamin
                uses the theologically charged <foreign xml:lang="de">Erlösung</foreign> rather than the more
                prosaic <foreign xml:lang="de">Einlösung</foreign>, the “cashing in” or redemption value of
                deposits or vouchers. Nevertheless, this minor strain in Benjamin’s theses has not
                gone unnoticed. Elsewhere, Jacques Khalip and I have invoked Werner Hamacher’s
                account of Benjaminian redemption as what Hamacher calls “unactualized possibilities
                of that which is past: the unfinished, the failed, the thwarted” (40). If Benjamin’s
                conception of history is more <emph>kairological</emph> than
                chronological, his object of its redemption is reclaiming the lost currency of the
                minor event. “If the concept of redemption points towards a theology,” Hamacher
                writes, “then this is not a straightforwardly Judeo-Christian theology, but rather a
                theology of the missed or distorted&#8212;hunchbacked&#8212;possibilities, a theology of missed,
                distorted or hunchbacked time” (40).<note place="foot" resp="author">Benjamin’s
                    dissatisfaction with historicism and
                            his interest in the theological notion of a “redeemed” or “fulfilled”
                            time are present throughout his work, as is the careful distance he
                            keeps from the biblical origins of “messianic time.” In one of his
                            earliest writings on the <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>&#8212;an
                            unpublished essay from 1916&#8212;Benjamin treats the Bible not as the source
                            but as a <emph>resource</emph>: “Historical time is infinite
                            in every direction and unfulfilled at every moment. This means we cannot
                            conceive of a single empirical event that bears a necessary relation to
                            the time of its occurrence. . . . [The] idea of fulfilled time is the
                            dominant historical idea of the Bible: it is the idea of messianic time.
                            Moreover, the idea of a fulfilled time is never identical with the idea
                            of an individual time” (55–56).</note></p>
            <p> Here I want to enlist Hamacher’s reading as my prompt to thinking of the theses as
                Benjamin’s effort to “make minor” the notion of redemption and the theological
                structure from which he extracts it. If, as Benjamin continues, “our coming was
                expected on earth,” it is expected “like <emph>every</emph> generation that preceded us”: it
                is both always expected and it may always fail to arrive (390). Moreover, the
                “messianic power” with which we’ve been endowed is, as Michael Levine has stressed
                in his fine book with this title, <title level="m">A Weak Messianic Power</title>
                    [<foreign xml:lang="de">eine schwache messianische Kraft</foreign>]. It is this “weak” or
                minor power&#8212;what with perfect pitch Amanda Jo Goldstein calls a “slight
                susceptibility” (163)&#8212;that allows us to catch what Benjamin calls the “sun rising in
                the sky of history” not at daybreak but by way of the “secret heliotropism” of
                flowers, the most “inconspicuous of all transformations” (390).<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">And perhaps
                            it’s in this spirit of “minorization” that we think of Benjamin’s “angel
                            of history” as it might be routed through the Hebrew, less as a savior
                            and more as a “messenger.”</note> “Every second,” writes
                Benjamin in thesis “B,” is “the small gateway in time” through which this “weak
                messianic power” “might enter” (397). For Levine, the “secret agreement” that is
                always in effect between past generations and the present is not a pact but an
                appointment or a rendezvous, one which may just as easily be missed as kept. The
                <emph>event</emph> for Benjamin is not the historical occurrence, not the
                    <emph>what</emph> that happened but the “image” projected from the
                past that may&#8212;or may not&#8212;be “caught” as it passes through the “sky of history,” both
                when the sun is rising and when it has set and left us with our shifting
                constellations in the night sky. “The true image of the past flits by,” writes
                Benjamin in the fifth thesis: “the past can be seized as an image that flashes up at
                the moment of its recognizability, and is never seen again” (390).<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">Benjamin’s
                            account of the “flitting” and “flashing” of the image appears as
                            something like a refrain in his work, and not only as the “true” form of
                            the past’s historicity. See for instance the 1933 fragment <title level="a">On the
                                Mimetic Faculty</title>: “The mimetic element in language can, like a flame,

                    This bearer is the semiotic element. Thus, the nexus
                            of meaning of words or sentences is the bearer through which, like a
                            flash, similarity appears. For its production by man&#8212;like its perception
                            by him&#8212;is in many cases, and particularly the most important, tied to

                    <emph>truth</emph> of history is its status as an image: fragile,

            <p> Benjamin posits a historian who “ceases to tell the sequence of events like beads of
                a rosary,” who resists the poverty of historicism’s directive to “establish a causal
                nexus” among consecutive events and to tell the past “as it really was” (397); and
                he imagines a “historian” who dispenses with the “idea that history is something
                which can be narrated” (<title level="a">Paralipomena</title> 406). But if the truth of history is not its
                sequential narrative but its composition as images that coalesce in a constellation,
                this implies that images must be independent of any narrative sequence or at least
                extractable from the course of empirical events. Jean-Luc Nancy identifies this
                “extractability” as the “essential” feature of the image: he calls it the image’s
                “distinction” (1). The image, writes Nancy, “must be detached, placed outside and
                before one’s eyes, . . . and it must be different from the thing. The image is a
                thing that is not the thing: it distinguishes itself from it, essentially” (2).
                According to Nancy, the “image is always sacred,” “set aside, removed, cut off” (1).
                Sacred but decisively <emph>not</emph> religious,
                which Nancy <emph>opposes</emph> to the sacred (1).
                For Nancy, the image as “the distinct stands apart from the world of things
                considered as a world of availability” and is “withdrawn” from utility or “has a
                completely different use” (2). In other words, this is the image’s sacred
                “redemption value,” a marking or a stigma which&#8212;withheld from any community of
                faith&#8212;exerts a force: the image “pulls and <emph>draws</emph>, . . . it
                    <emph>extracts</emph> something, an intimacy, a force” (4). The force
                of the image has nothing to do with what it represents; rather, the image for Nancy
                    <emph>is</emph> this force: “this intimate force is not ‘represented’
                by the image, but the image is it, the image activates it, draws it and withdraws
                it, extracts it by withholding it, and it is with this force that the image touches
                us” (5).</p>
            <p> These features of the image&#8212;its extractability, its intimate force, its sacred
                “distinction”&#8212;are not, according to Nancy, limited to its visual properties: “the
                visual image plays the role of a model” for the extractable force of the image; but
                the “image is also musical, poetic, even tactile, olfactory or gustatory,
                kinaesthetic, and so on” (4). Perhaps this is what makes the sentence-image I have
                extracted from <title level="m">The Triumph</title> so “touching” and so definitive:
                withdrawn from the world of events&#8212;the events of the world and the events of the
                    poem&#8212;<emph>my</emph> image is itself a “glimmering” “veil of light”
                    “<emph>drawn</emph>” but not represented or representing, itself a
                force which comes from nowhere or, as Nancy claims for all images, “comes from the
                sky&#8212;not the heavens, which are religious, but from the skies, a term proper to
                painting” (5). “When a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer” is
                a poetic image which invokes the visual as the “model” for its own workings. It is
                the minor event of the image as such, the “order” of the image.</p>
            <p> Once we have grasped the image as something to be drawn and withdrawn, distinct,
                extractable, sacred and redeemable, those of us motivated by Benjamin’s model of
                history must ask how a “constellation” comes into existence or, perhaps more
                precisely, how one beholds a constellation of images which was always present in
                “the eternal lamp” of history. At the most basic level, what connects one image to
                another if not narrative causality or sequentiality? If the relationship between
                images is no longer a matter of causality or sequence or mimesis, why does
                <emph>this</emph> one image connect with <emph>that</emph> one?
                How does something as complex and recognizable as a <emph>constellation</emph>
                of images come to be formed? How might we determine that a
                particular arrangement of images is a genuine constellation and not a mere asterism,
                or conveniently recognizable pattern of images? Benjamin doesn’t seem to imply that
                a constellation of images is solely the fictive projection of a percipient-beholder
                of sheerly random and contingent pulses of light and sensation. Perhaps, then,
                history’s event-images have their own agency or, more precisely, possess their own
                    <emph>currency</emph>?</p>
            <p> A “currency” of the image seems the most appropriate way to understand Benjamin’s
                notion of the constellation and the potential for an historical “redemption” of
                event-images that “may be separated” by “thousands of years.” Perhaps it is no
                accident that, according to the <title level="m">OED</title>, each of the principal
                “current” meanings of the words “currency” and “current” had come into circulation
                by the time of Romanticism’s appearance: 1) currency as the “time during which
                something is current,” something like Benjamin’s “now-time”
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">Jetzeit</foreign>]; 2) currency as the “medium of exchange” or “the circulating
                medium,” that which establishes an object’s “redemption value”; 3) currency as the
                fact or quality of being current; and 4) “current” as “the name given to the
                apparent transmission or ‘flow’ of electrical force through a conducting body.” For
                Benjamin the “the dialectical image is an occurrence of ball lightning
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">Kugelblitz</foreign>] that runs across the whole horizon of the past”
                (403). An image’s currency is that which allows it to pass through and connect to
                another “conducting body” and which makes it susceptible to a “now-time” in which it
                may be redeemed. For Shelley that faculty for redemption is the imagination which in
                    <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (published posthumously in 1844) he
                defines as “the <emph>perception</emph> of value” (510; emphasis added).
                An image’s currency may circulate invisibly for epochs until it is clandestinely
                plugged in to the present with what Shelley, also in <title level="m">Defence</title>,
                calls its “electric life” (535). I’m interested in exploring the currency of images
                for the minor events they offer, the currency of their connections and the minor
                historical “back-ways” they light up, mostly hidden and often obscure, “glimmering”
                “veils of light” “drawn” across the sky.</p>
            <p> If we are not accustomed to thinking of Pater alongside such figures as Benjamin or
                Nancy, the mode of aesthetic criticism Pater undertakes in <title level="m">The
                    Renaissance</title> (1873) offers an example of the kind of force or charge I am
                describing. Pater’s aesthetic critic “regards all the objects with which he has to
                do, all works of art, and the fairer forms of nature and human life, as powers or
                forces producing pleasurable sensations, each of a more or less peculiar or unique
                kind” (xx). Pater devotes himself to identifying and discerning the particular
                “powers or forces” of each image or text he is summoned to examine: his project is
                to locate that “active principle” of a text which has “crystallized” in the painting
                or the poem. “Sometimes fusing and transforming entire compositions” and “sometimes,
                as if at random depositing a fine crystal here or there,” this “active
                principle”&#8212;which is not a theme or a form or a genre&#8212;animates or charges the image
                (xxii). Few would accuse Pater of historicism; and the “studies” in
                <title level="m">The Renaissance</title> “trace” the “active principle” or current in
                an historically and culturally disparate constellation of pictures, stories, poems,
                and criticism that connects Heloise and Abelard to Winckelman and Goethe. </p>
            <p> The currency of the image&#8212;what Pater might identify as its animating principle&#8212;is
                not the primary intended or symbolic meaning of the image but closer to what Barthes
                describes as its “image-residue” or “third meaning.” In his <title level="a">Research Notes on
                    Several Eisenstein Stills,</title> Barthes begins by pointing at an image from
                <title level="m">Ivan the Terrible</title> (1944) &#8212;the young tsar being showered with
                gold&#8212;and immediately distinguishes “three levels of meaning”: first, the level of
                “information” or “<emph>communication</emph>,” amenable to a “primary
                semiotics”; and second, the symbolic level where “referential,” stylistic, iconic,
                historical, and ideological symbolisms can be discerned (42). “This second level, in
                its totality,” writes Barthes, “is that of <emph>signification</emph>. Its
                mode of analysis would be a more highly elaborated semiotics than the first,” the
                mode of semiotic analysis with which he had been most identified and that had he
                done perhaps the most to refine (42). “The third meaning,” then, derives from the
                residue or leftovers of the first two levels, something detachable in that
                particular image that eludes semiotics and something from which Barthes says he
                “cannot detach” (42). <emph>Looking</emph> at the image, Barthes
                <emph>reads</emph> the “third meaning:” “I read, I receive (probably
                straight off, in fact) a third meaning, erratic yet evident and persistent” (42). No
                longer ideological, historical, symbolic, or referential, this third meaning, in
                fact, does not really belong to the domain of meaning at all but is experienced as
                    <emph>passing from</emph> communicative or symbolic or ideological
                meaning on its way to the “<emph>obtuse</emph>” (44). Without abandoning
                what Barthes calls the “good faith” of the referent or the sense of narration, the
                “obtuse” or “third” meaning is that feature or property of <emph>some</emph>
                images that “appears ‘in excess,’” writes Barthes, “as a supplement
                my intellection cannot quite absorb, a meaning both persistent and fugitive,
                apparent and evasive” (44). The third or obtuse meaning generated in these precious
                images elicits what he identifies, in his own quotation marks, as “a poetic
                apprehension” (43).</p>
            <p> It is fascinating to watch Barthes cast about for the best way to describe the
                occasional and fleeting appearance of the third meaning, variously identified as a
                “blurring” of meaning, an “accent,” the emergence of a fold or crease, “a gash from
                which meaning is expunged,” an “anaphoric gesture without significant content” (56).
                It calls to mind the many “likenesses” which Shelley invokes in his <title>Hymn to
                    Intellectual Beauty</title> (1817) in order to signify the apprehension of beauty, as if to
                demonstrate that an infinite likeness and similitude is the very mode of beauty’s
                sensible appearances and its worldly consequences. The “obtuse meaning,” concludes
                Barthes, “inevitably appears as a luxury, an expenditure without exchange” (57). If
                Georges Bataille’s principle of expenditure is invoked here&#8212;and elsewhere in the
                essay Barthes refers explicitly to Bataille&#8212;it is a much gentler variation, one
                without sacrificial mutilation or rhetorical aggression, what we might call “minor
                    Bataille.”<note place="foot" resp="author">“This is just the kind of thing
                        Georges Bataille could have meant,
                            particularly in that text in <title level="m">Documents</title> which for
                            me situates one of the possible regions of the obtuse meaning:
                        <emph>The queen’s big toe</emph> (I don’t remember the exact
                        title)” (Barthes, <title level="a">Research Notes</title> 51).</note> Of course,
                Barthes is not satisfied with discerning occasions of the obtuse and delineating
                them from the levels of communication and symbolism available to semiotic analysis.
                Here as elsewhere, he is prompted to move from an act of apprehension to the
                mobilization of a new “practice”: “a new&#8212;rare&#8212;practice affirmed against a majority
                practice” (56). Though this vision of a practice emerging from the “third” or
                “obtuse” meaning may remain new and rare, Barthes proposes it as the minor route to
                the “flashes” of what he calls the “the founding act of the filmic,” that which
                “paradoxically cannot be grasped in the projected film, the film ‘in movement,’ but
                only, as yet in that <emph>major</emph> artifact which is the still” (59). </p>
            <p> Acknowledging his “lack of cinematic culture,” Barthes wonders early on whether his
                “reading of this third meaning is justified” (43); and yet he insists that the
                “obtuse” is not merely his critical or affective projection but a recognizable
                property of the image itself: “if you look at these images I am talking about,
                <emph>you will see the meaning</emph>: we can understand each other about
                it ‘over the shoulder’ or ‘on the back’ of articulated language: thanks to the image
                (frozen, it is true. . . ), indeed thanks to what <emph>in the image is
                    purely image</emph> (and which to tell the truth, is very little indeed), we do
                without speech yet continue to understand each other” (55; emphasis added). Though
                the “obtuse meaning” “will not enter the critic’s metalanguage,” “you
                <emph>will</emph> see” it, if you look (55). By this point in the essay,
                Barthes has substituted seeing for reading in order to insist on this shared
                “apprehension,” one made possible by “what in the image is purely image” (55). This
                is where the “third meaning” resides: in that <emph>minimal</emph> portion
                of the image that is purely image, its <emph>minor</emph> portion that is
                nonetheless constitutive. We <emph>will</emph> all see it in the stilled
                image, the “freeze-frame” or, to use the name of a website devoted to this form of
                image extraction, the “filmgrab.”<note place="foot" resp="author">“filmgrab.com”

                stilled, frozen, or seized and extracted, offers the prospect of lyrical moments
                that arrest the narrative, bring it to a standstill, in order to gather its own
                currency for future redemptions or dispersals. </p>

                    <p> I feel devoted to <title level="a">The Third Meaning</title>; but I
                        confess that I don’t always recognize
                the instances of the <emph>obtus</emph> that Barthes asserts with
                confidence that I <emph>will</emph> see in the
                stilled images he selects and presents. Given that Roland Barthes issued me the
                invitation, I would have loved nothing more than to have been his imaginary
                interlocutor as we shared these images “over the shoulder” of “articulated
                language,” understanding each other&#8212;perhaps mutely&#8212;and simply pointing at what in
                those particular images is “purely image.” And yet, if I have always wanted to be a
                party to the “poetic apprehension” Barthes is experiencing and describing in that
                essay, in all honesty I find the <emph>idea</emph> of the “third meaning”
                more arresting than the images themselves. This is not the case with the
                complementary notion of the <emph>punctum</emph> that Barthes develops in
                    <title level="m">Camera Lucida</title>, his beautiful meditation on photography,
                in which I do feel and respond to the touch or prick of almost every example (or if
                I don’t yet <emph>feel</emph> it, I see how and why Barthes does).<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">Of the many
                            commentators who have discussed this connection between the
                            <emph>obtus</emph> and the <emph>punctum</emph>, I would stress Derek Attridge’s bracing
                            essay on what he calls Barthes’s “impossible task” of naming and even
                            “codifying” a relationship that remains “singular” (88). Attridge links
                            this “impossibility” to Barthes’s embrace in the last decade of his life
                            to “something as vague as ‘aesthetic experience’” (85).</note>
                But in the earlier essay, I often fail to apprehend what Barthes assures me that I
                will see in those Eisenstein stills. So I seek out on my own a “third meaning” in
                the stilled images extracted from other motion pictures that move me. I feel
                authorized in this undertaking by the belief that for Barthes’s notion of the “third
                meaning” to have genuine analytical purchase or “currency,” we must be able to
                locate convincing examples of this effect outside the films of Eisenstein. </p>
            <p> Cinematic genre is irrelevant to the emergence of the <emph>obtus</emph>:
                the issue of genre and its conventions, its expectations, and even its deviations
                all fall within the purview of Barthes’ “second meaning.” But Faflak’s essay on the
                cinematic aspects of “Shelley’s final spectacle” raises important generic questions
                about <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> when he argues that the poem
                anticipates and “parallels” the genre of the film musical, which it then turns
                inside out. As Faflak puts it, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “parallels von
                Trier’s vision of a musical utopianism violently wagering the stakes of subjectivity
                dreamed by its phantasmatic afflatus” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168). Faflak’s essay prompted me to
                consider what other film genres might be at play with or might “parallel” this poem.
                If the poem’s Italianate mode and structure suggest the “epic,” it would be an epic
                that may have Virgil and Dante as poetic precedents but that has no precedent in
                film history. Perhaps, as James McFarland suggested, we should think of the poem in
                terms of “zombie films,” given the “undead” aspects of the disfigured Rousseau as
                well as the lifeless “crowds” (50) and “multitudes” (49) that greet and accompany
                the triumph as a zombie-apocalypse.<note place="foot" resp="author">When I presented
                    an early version of this essay at
                            Vanderbilt University in 2015, McFarland suggested that “what was once
                            Rousseau” was perhaps best understood as
                    “zombie-Rousseau.”</note></p>
            <p> In this generic vein, the cinematic and thematic aspects of <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title> anticipate what Peter Szendy has called
                “apocalypse-cinema.” Szendy’s genre is a cluster of contemporary films that meditate
                on or project images of the apocalypse: <title level="m">Terminator</title>, <title level="m">Planet
                    of the Apes</title> (and its many sequels), <title level="m">A.I.</title>,
                <title level="m">Blade Runner</title>, <title level="m">Sunshine</title>, <title level="m">The
                    Road</title>, and above all and “after all,” <title level="m">Melancholia</title>,
                Lars von Trier’s 2011 film that for Szendy defines the “apocalyptic genre,” where
                    “<emph>the end of the world is the end of the movie</emph>.” Or, as
                Szendy also suggests, “vice versa (because this terrifying equation of filmic
                eschatology can be reversed without being changed in the slightest):
                <emph>The end of the movie is the end of the world</emph>” (2). Percy
                Shelley’s untimely death by drowning interrupted what we might understand to be the
                inexorable drive to the apocalypse generated by his final poem; but the poem and its
                visions also seem propelled to what Szendy calls the “after all”
                [<foreign xml:lang="fr">après tout</foreign>]: both the minimizing response (“it’s only a movie or a poem,
                after all”) and its excess, the thing that remains after it’s “all over” (2). When
                the screen goes black for a full ten seconds after the annihilation of the earth at
                the end of <title level="m">Melancholia</title>, there “is no longer really cinema any
                more” but rather the “cinema of the after all” (3). And it can certainly feel as if
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is headed in that direction, drawn
                toward the apocalyptic specter of the “after all” or <foreign xml:lang="fr">après
                    tout</foreign>, and not just in terms of the apparently inexorable annihilation of
                everything that appears in the wake of the historical pageant.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">With the end
                            in mind, consider Khalip’s lovely reflection on <title level="m">The
                                Triumph</title>’s “<emph>after-look</emph>”: “What if we took
                    the brief and under-read lastness of the
                            line ‘as if that look must be the last’ as a very particular kind of
                            utterance, stolen ‘as if’ from the poem’s social fabric and effectively
                            pulling it apart like an end of the world? The line would be a last
                            scrap of the poem but, principally, it would also push up against the
                            lastness of the look. What would then happen to the world after the last
                            look? And what is an after-look?”
                            (<title level="m">Last Things</title> 76).</note>
                In one sense, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> projects cinema’s pre-history with
                its own elaborate attention to the apparatus and the effects of cinematic illusions,
                what Faflak calls “the refulgent source of cinema’s illuminations” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168),
                as well as the <emph>end</emph> of cinema, or cinema as the end, in terms
                of the “white-outs” produced by “a shape all light.” But that form of closure or
                finality seems at odds with the vitally eruptive “visions” and skeptical “vacancies”
                of Shelley’s poetics and with the propulsive nature of the poem, one in which the
                perpetual poetic interruption of ever new visions and even the poet’s own death
                forestalls the inexorable pull of the “after all.” More precise to say that
                Shelley’s final spectacle projects its reader-beholders as well its spectator-actors
                to the images <emph>after the end</emph>. And, after all, what attracts me
                to this poem is an image from the prologue where we encounter not the “after-all” of
                a proto-apocalyptic cinema but the <emph>before all</emph> of the
                pre-production, <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s “back story.” </p>
            <p> The film from which I will extract an image that qualifies as a “minor event” and
                which I believe to exhibit the “third meaning” is not an epic, a “zombie-film,” or
                an example of apocalyptic cinema. Haynes’s <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>
                bears no generic relationship to Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title>, unless we consider their mutual lack of stable genre conventions to
                be analogous. Nor is there any implicit or explicit Shelleyan influence on the story
                or the characters of Haynes’s ambitious and delirious 1998 film about a fictitious
                episode in 1970s British “glam rock,” the brief musical and cultural phenomenon that
                even rock music historians, especially in the U.S., typically characterize as its
                own “minor event.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Of course, David Bowie, on whom the character of
                            Brian Slade is “virtually” based, qualifies as the “major star” produced
                            by the fleeting period of glam rock; and, again of course, “glam” was
                            only one of his many personae or poses. Bowie did not permit any of his
                            own music to be used in the film, though <title level="a">Velvet Goldmine</title> is the title
                            of a B-side from a Bowie single.</note>
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, which is in part a musical, also reflects
                and <emph>projects</emph> what Faflak calls vis-à-vis
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “a society of the spectacle
                still in visual flux”; and I think it qualifies as another installment in what he
                elegantly characterizes as a “history fascinated by the production of images that
                body forth life, then compromise any return to life itself” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168).
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> is not so much a glam rock biopic as it as an
                allegory of cultural history in the vein of Benjamin, Wilde, and Shelley.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">I regard Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> and Wilde’s

                    this constellation I would add Greil Marcus’s <title level="m">Lipstick Traces</title>,
                    a book to which Haynes also pays
                            homage as he tracks across a series of glam rock album covers in a
                            record store, and we see one of Slade’s fictional singles bearing the
                            title <title level="m">Lipstick Traces</title>.</note> For
                Haynes, glam rock is a momentary and minimal appearance of a queering spirit that,
                as Faflak puts it, “bodies forth life” as it is represented as erupting from
                London’s underground in the 1970s (168). </p>
            <p> My interest here is something quite minor in every sense, something that rarely
                rises to the level of analytical importance, even for the film’s most attentive
                critics. With Benjamin also in my mind, I want briefly to examine how the film shows
                us something that <emph>never happened</emph>. For this exploration I turn
                to the film’s “back-story,” the four-minute pre-credit “overture” which makes no
                mention of the film’s major characters. The film opens with a shot in the midst of a
                nighttime constellation of stars and an audio sampling of old muffled British radio
                recordings, transmissions beaming through space from distant epochs. The first
                spoken voice is that of the narrator, Janet McTeer, delivering what sounds as if it
                should be the lost fragment of a thesis from Benjamin’s final meditation on history:
                    “<emph>Histories, like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empires.
                    While everything forgotten hangs in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to
                    return.</emph>” I remember acutely the experience of hearing this narration when I
                first saw the film in the theater: I was convinced Haynes had gained access to some
                secret Benjamin archive and had uncovered a new “paralopenomenon” of the
                <title level="a">Theses.</title>
                But the film’s initiating voice-over also conjures the model of history suggested by
                Benjamin in an earlier essay on Kafka: “Everything forgotten mingles with what has
                been forgotten of the pre-historic world, forms countless, uncertain, changing
                compounds, yielding a constant flow of new strange products” (qtd. in Bensmaia
                    xii).<note place="foot" resp="author">Bensmaia’s account of the
                        <title level="a">Kafka Effect</title> offers an illuminating model
                            for the kind of “constellation” I am proposing here. Without conflating
                            Deleuze and Guattari with Benjamin or even suggesting a resemblance
                            between them, Bensmaia posits Kafka as what we might describe as their
                            “nodal” connection. The Kafka that Benjamin shares with Deleuze and
                            Guattari is one resistant to the exegetical modes imposed upon him, the
                            Kafka who rejects symbolic, allegorical, mythical, and theological
                            interpretations in order to allow the “Kafka-universe” to emerge, in
                            Deleuze and Guattari’s case the Kafka who introduces a “minor
                            literature.”</note> Benjamin’s Kafka describes Todd Haynes’s
                cinematic perception of the production/projection of “glam rock”: something from a
                forgotten world that “mingles” with the present and by “changing compounds” yields a
                flow of “new strange products.”</p>
            <p> Following the film’s opening images and lines, and still very much lost in the
                stars, a spaceship that looks as if it has flown straight from a Jules Verne
                inspired B-Movie descends to Earth amid tufts of space clouds, depositing on a
                storybook Dublin doorstep in 1854 a baby swaddled in a blanket pinned with an
                emerald green broach. Bestowed or abandoned, the baby is Oscar Wilde, our first
                “space oddity” or cosmic nomad.<note place="foot" resp="author">In
                    <title level="a">Superstardust,</title> the interview with Oren
                            Moverman which prefaces the published screenplay, Haynes is particularly
                            eloquent on the historical relationship between Wilde and glam rock: “It
                            quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition
                            of camp and applied counter-philosophies about art and culture, which I
                            saw originating from Oscar Wilde. To me Wilde became the perfect
                            manifestation of the glam era. . . . I think glam rock was the first
                            overt alignment of the notion of the alien with the notion of the
                            homosexual&#8212;both of which became this fantastical, galvanizing potential
                            for musical expression, a potential freedom for kids trapped in their
                            dreary lives. The space ship definitely brings in the outsider elements
                            of the period, which I attribute to Wilde and dandyism, but it also
                            refers to feelings of ‘otherness’ confronted at the time of adolescence”
                            (xii–xiii).</note> We watch along with the Wildes and their
                housekeeper as the spaceship returns to the stars; and the film then cuts to a scene
                featuring a classroom of Irish schoolboys, nine to ten years old, who stand one by
                one in a tight tracking shot declaring their aspirations before their prim
                schoolmaster. “I want to be a barrister,” says one; “I want to be a farmer,” and so
                on, until the final boy, labeled “O. Wilde” and wearing the green broach, rises and
                declares, “I want to be a pop idol.” And as if to demonstrate how “Benjaminian”
                constellations are formed, the subsequent scene is separated from Wilde’s arrival by
                “one hundred years.” The film cuts to a scene of a young boy, Jack Fairy, who&#8212;after
                being beaten by a score of bullying schoolmates&#8212;lays face down in the street, his
                lip bloodied, and discovers in the dirt and grime the emerald broach that adorned
                Oscar Wilde. The following scene looks as if it is a hand-drawn page in a children’s
                picture-book, one featuring a little boy in school shorts walking into the sunlight
                as the narrator’s voice-over resumes: “<emph>Childhood, adults always
                    say, is the best time in life. But as long as he could remember, Jack Fairy knew
                    better</emph>.” The narration continues as the film cuts to a series of dark
                interior shots featuring the head of the boy bathed in blue light and poised in
                three different angles before a mirror we never quite see&#8212;“<emph>Until
                    one mysterious day when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others
                    quite like him, singled out for a great gift</emph>.” Jack Fairy meticulously
                draws the blood from his wound as if it were lipstick until his eyes flash on his
                reflection, suddenly smiling directly at the mirror/camera/spectator as the narrator
                concludes her overture: “<emph>and one day the whole stinking world
                    would be theirs</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="author">It’s impossible to resist recognizing in this
                            sequence of shots the initiating “mirror stage” of the Lacanian

                            it’s better to call it a <emph>redemption</emph> of the
                            Lacanian scenario, or at least a redemption fantasy. Spoken but not yet
                            speaking, battered and bullied, Jack Fairy not only delights in the
                            image of his bodily integrity suddenly reflected in the mirror (which
                            the screenplay specifies as his “mother’s vanity”), he&#8212;and we&#8212;recognize
                            his image as both subject and object of desire.</note>

            The title sequence which erupts from this moment takes place in London in 1972 as
                scores of giddy glitter kids pour across the Waterloo Bridge and fill the streets to
                the jubilant guitars in the opening strains of Brian Eno’s <title level="a">Needle
                    in a Camel’s Eye</title>
                in what reminds me of Shelley’s “glorious phantoms” who “burst” from the “graves” of
                “England in 1819” to “illumine our tempestuous day” (13–14).</p>
            <p> Though there are repeated sightings of Jack Fairy, he is not a
                <emph>character</emph> in the film; and his presence is as solitary as it is ephemeral.
                He doesn’t utter a line of dialogue in the movie, although he does deliver a song&#8212;a
                highly stylized version of Roxy Music’s “2HB”&#8212;and recites a few lines of poetry.
                Jack Fairy is just an image, in other words, a transitory image of transit; and his
                function in the film, tangential to the story itself, is to show us the transfer of
                the emerald broach from the stars to Oscar Wilde and Fairy and on to Curt Wild
                before it is deposited with Arthur Stuart near the movie’s end. Jack Fairy is the
                image for what I am calling the currency of images, the film’s “minor event” that
                shows us how to assemble images in constellation. On the other hand, Jack Fairy’s
                recognition scene, his moment of redemption, is the minor event: the bloodied lip
                drawn into lipstick by virtue of the green broach, sent from the heavens, but dug
                out of the grimy street by Jack Fairy. And thus for Jack Fairy and for those “others
                quite like him”: in this fleeting but precious moment of redemption,
                <emph>we</emph> are those others and this moment is
                <emph>ours</emph> as well since <emph>we</emph> behold ourselves in
                <emph>his</emph> reflection and are thus positioned in this fantasy of the
                mirror stage to declare, as does Arthur in another scene, “<emph>that’s
                    me! that’s me!</emph>” Saturated in dazzling blue light, the stilled smile of Jack
                Fairy in the mirror/camera, which is simultaneously our own visual address, produces
                for <emph>me</emph> the “third meaning,” a non-signifying or symbolic
                image that retains its residue and which never returns to the “first” or “second”
                regimes of meaning. If it comes from the film’s overture, it also now belongs to us,

            Lucretius, Spinoza, Hume, Nietzsche, Bergson: These thinkers have few relationships
                with each other . . . and yet they do have them. One might say that something
                happens between them, at different speeds with different intensities, which is not
                in one or other, but truly in an ideal space, which is no longer a part of history,
                still less a dialogue among the dead, but an interstellar conversation, between very
                irregular stars, whose different becomings form a mobile bloc which it would be a
                case of capturing, an inter-flight, light-years. (15–16)

            Wilde, Fairy, Wild-Pop, Slade-Bowie, Cobain: these figures in literary and popular

                “interstellar conversation,” one which achieves its own originating energy with the

            <p>How are constellations formed between poems and films, or between paintings and
                prose? Outside of cultural “influence” or historical development, how do these
                connections occur? What is the nature of their currency? Invoking what Deleuze calls
                the “ideal spaces” of his history of philosophy, I believe that “something happens”
                between Haynes and Shelley, separated by 175 years and at least one artistic medium,
                in the “ideal spaces” of Shelley’s poetry and Haynes’s cinema
                (<title level="m">Dialogues</title> 15). <title level="m">A
                    Defence of Poetry</title> proposes an unprecedented model of cultural history which
                features moments of the eruption of “spirit” (Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Shakespeare,
                Bacon, Milton, Bacon, Rousseau, and the celebrated “spirit” of his own “age”) as
                well as periods of decay and regression and Benjaminian states of emergency, moments
                of spirit’s eruption and extinction (535). For Haynes as for Shelley, cultural and
                artistic history is not an evolutionary development but lyric pulses of
                possibilities throughout time, pulses which find their own connections, regardless
                of theme or genre: for the Shelley of the <title level="m">Defence</title>, they are
                Plato’s dialogues, Dante’s poetry, Milton’s epic, and Bacon’s scientific enquiry.
                For the Haynes of <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, they are Wilde’s origins
                and his poetry, Fairy’s poses, glam’s eruption, the anticipation of Cobain.</p>
            <p> Narrative history in <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> is a recursive and
                filtered account, one that splinters its invocation to <title level="m">Citizen
                    Kane</title>’s (1941) cinematic investigations; and
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> features a similar narrative
                structure as well as the fractured deployment of Dante’s <emph>terza
                    rima</emph>. Both Haynes and Shelley offer us “prologues” or “overtures,” their
                own “back stories” that set the principal narratives in motion. And both artists
                fashion stories constructed by multiple retrospections and looping narratives: back
                stories, “present” narratives, followed by “pre-stories” which often appear as
                arresting “lyric” events. Marcia Landy’s thoughtful characterization of
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>’s narrative “technique” as
                “investigative”&#8212;“what happened?” asks Arthur&#8212;applies to <title level="m">The
                    Triumph</title>: Shelley’s speaker and interlocutor ask the same questions: what
                happened? how have things “been brought to this dread pass” (301–2)? in “this valley
                of perpetual dream / Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why” (397–98). And in
                both film and poem, answers to these questions fail to materialize, replaced instead
                by “savage music, stunning music” (435), “flashing” images and a “shape all light”
                (351–52), what an exhilarated Bowie would much later call <title level="a">Sounds
                and Visions.</title> And in the course of what are by turns lavish and garish spectacles paraded
                in both film and poem, “spectators” “turn” into “actors or victims” (305–6). At the most
                fundamental level, both texts explore the relationship between life and the image,
                the relationship of “fair shapes” or fairy shapes to “light’s severe excess” (411,
                424). “A man’s life is his image,” says Curt Wild near the end of
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>. But the affinities between poem and film aside, my
                primary motivation in this essay has been to learn how to discern the “third
                meaning,” the <emph>obtus</emph> that attaches to the extracted, stilled
                image in poetry and in film.</p>
            <p> Though the particular experience of reading <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> I want to describe has less to do with its narrative dimension than
                with the minor effects of a single atmospheric image, that image’s “minorization”
                produces its effects in relation to the scale and breadth of the story Shelley’s
                poem tells about history. The first forty lines of the poem are devoted to the
                speaker’s physical placement as he lounges outside in the shadow of the Apennines at
                daybreak in the moments before “A vision on his brain is rolled” (40). The next
                section of the poem, roughly 130 lines, depicts the “waking dream” as it unrolls
                before the speaker. It’s a grim “triumphal” pageant of history&#8212;complete with its own
                chariot&#8212;one which celebrates the conquerors. The speaker grows weary and
                disillusioned of this spectacle, the “jubilee” that greets a conqueror’s advance:
                “Struck to the heart by the sad pageantry” of Western history, the speaker asks
                aloud “what is this?” (176–77). He is answered by the disfigured image of “what was
                once Rousseau” which becomes his Virgilian guide and commentator to the unfolding
                spectacle, though “Rousseau’s” commentary only compounds the speaker’s distress when
                he learns that in this version of the “jubilee” the “captive multitude” is chained
                to the “triumphal pageant” of “thoughts empire over thought” (111, 119, 118, 211):
                anarchs, demagogues, <emph>and</emph> sage, even Voltaire and Kant, an
                extensive catalogue of those Bowie called the “men who sold the world.” Only the
                “sacred few,” Christ and Socrates, escape this ideological vision by remaining what
                de Man calls “mere fictions in the writings of others” (97). In the last extant
                section of the poem, Shelley’s speaker turns to this post-Rousseau to ask how of all
                the historical figures on display, his guide became complicit with the “triumph of
                life.” The disfigured Rousseau then relays the nature of his own seduction and
                undoing by a mesmerizing “shape all light,” one that turned his brain to sand. Percy
                Shelley’s drowning brings the poem to an end; but it’s difficult to see how the
                obliterating pull of these repeated visionary disfigurements could be “brushed
                against the grain,” difficult to foresee how any “glorious phantoms” could burst
                from this grave pageantry to “illumine its tempestuous day” given that life and
                death have grown into mirrored images of each other, leaving the speaker/viewer
                “eye-sick”: “mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow” (298). If Shelley’s “cinema”
                is predicated on the hope that it might discover “a trace of light diviner than the
                common sun / Sheds on the common earth” (338–39), it is not to be found in the movie
                we call <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Or at least not in its diegesis:
                I want to conclude my essay by considering how a version of the Deleuzian
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>, might be assembled for Shelley’s last poem from
                Barthes’s critical observation and Haynes’s cinematic thinking about the workings of
                the poetic “still.” Perhaps in that stilled image we might find “a trace of light
                diviner.”</p>
            <p> If <title level="m">The Triumph</title> activates the many philological resources of
                “still,” the effect of all this “stilling” in this most restless and mobile of
                Shelley’s poetry is ironic, as if it should suggest the possibility of an arrest or
                standstill that its propulsive movement forecloses. When, for instance, the “strange
                distortion” called Rousseau describes the effects of the “shape all light,” one of
                those effects is the obliterating of her poetic feet through which “the sweet tune /
                To which they moved, seemed as they moved to blot / The thoughts” of all beholders
                (180, 352, 382–84). Here, the poetic measures of verse, when delivered&#8212;or “flung”&#8212;by
                a “shape all light,” “blot” the “thoughts” of the gazers, a poetic obliteration that
                seems to characterize each successive manifestation of the vision (386). Inscribed,
                however, in these lines is a characteristic Shelleyan pun, which isolated in a sort
                of “poetry grab,” brushes the poetics of obliteration against the grain with the
                urgency of an alarm: “<emph>still</emph> her feet,” demands the poem,
                <emph>arrest</emph> the relentless imposition of the
                “Shape’s” effects.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="a">Living
                    On/Borderlines,</title> Derrida traces “living on as the braiding of triumph
                            and <emph>arret</emph>.” Indeed, his “double-reading” of
                            Blanchot’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">L’arrêt du mort</foreign> with
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> suggests an involution of these figures,
                            one that makes possible “a certain intertranslatability
                            (<emph>triumphant</emph> and <emph>arrested</emph>) of these two texts” (107–08). In her
                            game-changing essay on the Lucretian impulses in Shelley’s last poem,
                            Goldstein outlines a philosophical foundation to the poem’s subterranean
                            arrest or resistance; and she argues that the final and critically
                            “neglected ‘new Vision’ with which Shelley’s poem breaks off . . . urges
                            readers to review the scene of life that <title level="m">The Triumph
                                of Life</title> has been showing all along, but this time under changed
                            philosophical premises about the relation of life, matter, and trope”
                            (138). For Goldstein this “new Vision” is very much a “coming
                            attraction,” one produced by Shelley’s “retrieval”&#8212;or what I might call
                                <emph>redemption</emph>&#8212;of “Lucretius’ (now) astonishing
                            poetics of sensation” (150).</note></p>
            <p> The triumphal pageant exerts a diachronic force generated by its own propulsive
                <emph>terza rima</emph>, its motion accelerated by enjambments that create
                the effect of a perpetually receding horizon line drawn by some unnamed and
                invisible force. As exhilarating as this unrelenting horizontal movement of the poem
                can be for even its most seasoned readers, the repeated sudden “vertical” “bursts”
                of visions and shapes and figures&#8212;like repeatedly pulsed stills&#8212;exert an obtuse
                force on the obvious ideological dimension of the poem’s story. Shelley’s critical
                version of Platonism always conveys a proto-cinematic quality, but
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> realizes it as tenor and vehicle. It is the
                combination of features both obvious and obtuse, both major and minor, that makes
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> a movie. Goldstein has shown
                compellingly how the images that unfold in the poem’s vision&#8212;“like atomies that
                dance / Within a sunbeam” (446–47)&#8212;“signal an emphatic switch to an alternative,
                neo-Lucretian model of sensation and figuration” (155), but the passage has always
                struck me as motes dancing in the projection beam, a sign of what Orrin Wang has
                called the “coming attractions” of Romanticism’s proto-cinematic verse that
                manufactures the opportunity to see “the <emph>in</emph> visible in the
                image, the always social self in projected, kinetic form” (<title level="a">Coming
                    Attractions</title> 500).</p>
            <p> As much as my intellectual orientations and political impulses are engaged by the
                poem’s critique of European history, it is not the poem’s political project that
                compels me to sit down and read it again and again. It is rather to renew the
                experience of the poem’s cascading visions and figures that come from nowhere and
                arrest or dissolve the poem’s narrative movement. And above all it is the strangely
                affecting couple of lines about that evening glimmer on the hills in a poem that
                seems to have galvanized all the formal and rhetorical resources available to
                British poetry. To invoke the famous dictum attributed to Gramsci&#8212;“pessimism of the
                intellect, optimisim of the will”&#8212;those two lines of the poem allow us to see at one
                and the same time the pessimism of the poet, but the optimism of the verse. In other
                words, the poem undertakes a radical negation and performs a radical affirmation.
                This double-movement takes place simultaneously: the corrosively ironic triumphal
                pageant of “universal history” paraded before the speaker-beholder and the eruptive
                    <emph>terza rima</emph> that generates ever new visions that seem to unfold on
                perpetually receding planes of immanence. </p>
            <p> I am availing myself of a Deleuzian idiom, one which activates the politically
                resistant and “optimistic” aspects of the “<foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>” in
                Shelley’s poem. For Deleuze and Guattari a “minor literature”
                <quote>
                finds itself positively charged with the role and function of collective, and even
                revolutionary, enunciation. It is a literature that produces an active solidarity in
                spite of skepticism; and if the writer is in the margins or completely outside his
                or her fragile community, this situation allows the writer all the more the
                possibility to express another possible community and to forge the means for another
                consciousness and another sensibility. (<title level="m">Kafka</title> 17)
                </quote>
            Has there ever been a better way to characterize the Percy Shelley of <title level="m">The
                Triumph of Life</title>: “outside his fragile community,” such as
                it was in 1819 on the Tuscan coast, seeking an “active solidarity in spite of
                skepticism”&#8212;an undying skepticism&#8212;and writing “to forge” in poetry “the means for
                another consciousness and another sensibility”? In spite of his skepticism, Shelley
                would have understood the project of his literature as “positively charged with the
                role and function of collective, and even revolutionary, enunciation,” a
                <emph>currency</emph> of his poetic images he called “electric energy”
                (535): the energy of the poem’s enjambments, the energy of the <emph>terza
                    rima</emph> planes, the energy of a revolutionary impulse in the poem’s
                charged undertaking. “We might as well say,” as do Deleuze and Guattari, “that minor
                no longer designates specific literatures but the revolutionary conditions for every
                literature within the heart of what is called great (or established) literature”
                    (<title level="m">Kafka</title> 18).</p>
            <p> The Deleuzian <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign> helps us to understand how
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, a poem that seems to explore not only
                the events of European history, but how the very “eventness” of the event might
                simultaneously mark the event’s “minorization.” “History,” writes Deleuze in his
                account of Nietzsche’s
                <title level="m">On the Genealogy of Morals</title>, “thus
                appears as the act by which reactive forces take possession of culture or divert its
                course in their favor. The triumph of reactive forces is not an accident in history
                but the principle and meaning of ‘universal history’”
                (<title level="m">Nietzsche</title> 139). If we hear in these
                sentences echoes of Benjamin, there is also no better way to summarize
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s critical impulse toward
                history. Nor can I think of a better way to characterize the effect of Shelley’s
                refusal of a sober revolutionary <emph>ascesis</emph> than the “nomadic”
                Italianate estrangement of English verse forms that characterize his poetic
                intervention, every bit as jubilant as the guitars in a Roxy Music
                song.<note place="foot" resp="author">I know of no

                            poem than Claire Colebrook’s account of the crucial challenge of
                            discovering instances or events of an “art that <emph>is
                                joyous</emph>, that intimates a joy outside humanity and organisms. .
                            . . Canonical literature gives us some indication of an autonomy of
                            created affects that are not those of the organism, as though art could
                            give body to that which exceeds the lived. . . . It is as though these
                            worlds offered affects as such, there <emph>to be
                            lived</emph>, as if they existed as potentialities for all time, even if
                            captured through the depiction of a certain time” (93–94).</note>
                            As Deleuze describes this aspect of poetic
                minorization: “The overload is not a rhetorical figure, a metaphor, or symbolic
                structure; it is a mobile paraphrase bearing witness to the unlocalized presence of
                an indirect discourse at the heart of <emph>every statement. The closer
                    a language gets to this state, the closer it comes . . . to music itself”</emph>
                    (<title level="m">Thousand</title> 104). It’s no accident that this sounds more
                than a little like a “mobile paraphrase” of Walter Pater, since Deleuze’s notion of
                minorization always involves the arresting of poetic representation: in its minor
                mode, “<emph>language stops being representative in order to move toward
                    its extremities or its limits</emph>” (Kafka 23). <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> is a poem that seems to make its devotees&#8212;if not its genuine
                readers&#8212;into Paterian acolytes of one sort or another, whether willingly or not. In
                <title level="a">The School of Giorgione,</title> Pater famously or scandalously invokes the
                <foreign xml:lang="de">Anderstreben</foreign> or “other striving” of each mode of art: “it is
                noticeable,” writes Pater, “that, in its special mode of handling its given
                material, each art may be observed to pass into the condition of some other art, by
                what German critics term an <foreign xml:lang="de">Anderstreben</foreign>&#8212;a partial alienation
                from its own limitations, through which the arts are able . . . to lend each other
                new forces” (105). If cinema is the “as yet unimagined” art, the coming attraction
                that lends Shelley’s poetry its own “new forces,” its Paterian-Lucretian
                constellation of sheer sensations or what Pater calls “a matter of pure perception”
                shows how Shelley’s last poem poses the example to which all of cinema still strives
                (108).</p>
            <p> If <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>is a poem that
                moves toward language’s “extremities” and thus minorizes its relation to European
                history, what “gets” the poem going towards that minor event are the preliminary
                lines, which include a cinematic vision of their own, the majestic procession of a
                sunrise that Derrida describes as “the outpouring of light and solar glory” (<title level="a">Living
                On</title> 131). Oddly in this poem that seems at every turn to explore and deepen the
                problem of spectatorship, the sunrise itself goes entirely unbeheld by our speaker
                or any entity other than the “awakened earth.” But in lines 26–40, we are presented
                with a cinematic projection: a “strange trance” “grows” over the speaker’s fancy
                which in turn “spreads” “a shade” so “transparent” that the <emph>scene</emph>
                came “through / As when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills they glimmer.” Shelley anticipates both the cinematic apparatus and the
                quasi-hypnotic spell it induces, and once we are introduced to the advent of sound,
                “sweet talk in music through the enamoured air,” the “vision” can be “rolled” not
                “in his mind” but by way of this carefully delineated external apparatus,
                “<emph>on his brain</emph>” (40 emphasis added).<note place="foot" resp="author">I
                    am both drawn critically to and
                            dazzled by Shelley’s anticipatory poetic symbolization of the cinematic
                            apparatus and the positioning of the spectator in preparation for the
                            epic film of European history that the poem subsequently unfolds. The
                            proem spells out in advance the kind of demystification of the cinematic
                            illusion-machine that was the project of so much of the 1970s as well as
                            the bedazzling effects&#8212;“the fascination of film”&#8212;that Barthes
                            acknowledges in <title level="a">Leaving the Movie Theatre,</title> “spent visions”
                    <emph>and</emph> “a trace of diviner light” (348).</note></p>
            <p> However much I find this aspect of the poem critically compelling as a poetic figure
                which anticipates the full range of a future medium’s possibility and effects, I
                always feel myself drawn more to the detached glimmering image of a
                <emph>veil of light drawn</emph> over evening hills.
                In this magnetic moment, my critical appreciation of Shelley’s account of the
                cinematic apparatus recedes in the light of this single image: a “drawing” possessed
                of its own agency, an application of its own force that not only pulls a veil over
                the hills but <emph>traces</emph> a line that is extended, lengthened,
                <emph>unfolded</emph>. Shelley animates the various resources of this
                simple word “draw” and in the process galvanizes the effect of this subjectless and
                potentially agentless verb. To draw can mean to carry or convey a vehicle, even if
                that vehicle is the tail end of a simile; or it can mean to represent a picture, to
                draw in words, or to attract, as by a rhetorical force that seems to exude the
                magnetic qualities it generates, a force that draws us to it, “singling us out,” and
                makes it arresting. Most suggestively for me is the meaning of drawing as
                “extraction,” as when one draws a conclusion from an investigation or perhaps as
                when one extracts or draws out an image to which one is drawn. If this veil of light
                is not yet the historical pageant of images that unfolds in Shelley’s cinematic
                vision, it is perhaps what Barthes calls the third meaning of the “stilled” image,
                the “founding act of the filmic,” at least of Shelley’s own poetic cinema, the gift
                of a glimmering lyrical minor event inscribed like a pulse or a broach in the poetic
                and cinematic image, the promise of a currency.</p>
