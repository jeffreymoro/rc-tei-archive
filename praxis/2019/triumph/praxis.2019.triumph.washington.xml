                <p rend="noCount">This essay challenges Paul de Man’s famous reading of figurality in Percy Shelley’s
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> to show how the poem
                    thinks love as a figural-material quantum entanglement between two people that
                    models a new materialist politics. I argue that for Shelley the “shape all light”
                    and its interaction with the rainbow evince one instance of this figural-material
                    phenomenon. This interaction I read as a form of what Karen Barad calls “quantum
                    entanglement,” when the subject and object—as in physics’ double-slit quantum light
                    experiment—emerges as a new entity that brings a novel spacetime into being. As
                    Shelley theorizes it in the poem, this merger of subject and object, or lover and
                    lover, allows him to finally conceive a love that serves as a cornerstone for a
                    radical politics. While we tend to see the poem as breaking off into irresolution,
                    Shelley’s poem, on my reading, instead envisions how two-person spacetimes are a
                    triumph of love over the nihilistic autocratic politics of anarchy that the poem
                    depicts running wild in the pageantry of life.</p>

                water, and the stars as the tropology around which the poem groups its
                deconstructive figurality. De Man specifically reads the nebulous “shape all light”

                            <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, edited
                            by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, 2nd ed, Norton, 2002, pp. 481–502. All

                            this edition, cited by line, act, and/or page number.</note>as “the
                figure for the figurality of all signification” (116), the textual crux that
                connects the sun’s light, obscured stars, and water’s well previous to the light’s
                transmogrification into a rainbow:
                <quote>
            “Shape all light” is referentially meaningless since light, the necessary condition
                of shape, is itself, like water, without shape, and acquires shape only when split
                in the illusion of a doubleness which is not that of self and other. The sun, in
                this text, is from the start the figure of this self-contained specularity. But the
                double of the sun can only be the eye conceived as the mirror of light. “Shape” and
                “mirror” are inseparable in this scene, just as the sun is inseparable from the
                shapes it generates and which are, in fact, the eye, and just as the sun is
                inseparable from itself since it produces the illusion of the self as shape . . .
                Because the sun is itself a specular structure, the eye can be said to generate a
                world of natural forms. The otherness of a world that is in fact without order now
                become, for the eye, a maze made accessible to solar paths, as the eye turns from
                the blank radiance of the sun to its green and blue reflection in the world, and
                allows us to be in this world as in a landscape of roads and intents. (109–10)
                </quote>
            Yet, surely this account depends on a classic presupposition of high romanticism
                partially engendered by de Man himself: the eye as necessary for figurality itself,
                a doubly odd claim since the eye, evidence of human existence, introduces the
                ontological (“allows us to be”) into de Man’s otherwise properly figural conceptual
                space, and the anthropocentric into his rhetorical theory of language’s mad,
                machine-like nature. For it is precisely its linguistic, or what he calls
                rhetorical—rather than historical, or physical, or ontological—nature that, for de
                Man, makes figurality figurative. Whether unconsciously or unwittingly—and here we
                must think of de Man’s own idea of critical blindness—de Man’s deconstruction would
                appear to deconstruct itself. But perhaps this is only all too appropriate since
                auto-deconstruction, according to de Man’s reading of Shelley’s poem, and his
                readings elsewhere of Rousseau, is how deconstruction works.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">See de Man, <title level="m">Blindness and Insight</title> and
                            <title level="m">Allegories of Reading</title>. See
                            also Derrida’s comment that we must consider de Man’s texts as open to
                            his own procedure (<title level="a">Typewriter</title>).</note></p>
            <p> In fact, this auto-deconstruction reveals the speculative realist flipside of de
                Man’s reading of light that we have yet to confront in Shelley’s poem: non-figural,
                material reality as inter-involved aspect of any figurality.<note place="foot"
                    resp="author">On how de Man’s work aligns with
                            speculative realism, see Washington. Much has been written about de
                            Man’s notion of the materiality of the letter as a materiality resistant
                            to aesthetic totality. See Derrida, <title level="a">Typewriter</title> 350. My reading
                            suggests that there is a materiality with matter in de Man.</note> Speculative
                realism posits that a world of material objects
                exists independent of the subject and any epistemological access and phenomenal
                relationship the subject might have with those objects and that world. And while we
                typically view de Manian deconstruction as exclusively embrangled in linguistic and
                epistemological problems properly belonging to the subject, the figurative-material
                deconstructive paradox detected above allows us to consider how the linguistic
                subject of deconstruction and the material objects of speculative realism are much
                more inter-connected in Shelley’s final poem than we think. </p>
            <p>Shelley’s notes to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813)
                address this paradox: light is not simply reflectively specular as de Man presents
                it; it is also a material, and, as we’ll see, a quantum, speculative,
                phenomenon.<note place="foot" resp="author">Paul Hamilton notes that Shelley
                            was always interested in both the epistemological and the speculative.
                            One of Shelley’s early essays is titled <title level="a">Speculations
                            on Metaphysics.</title></note> Shelley, having read Isaac
                Newton’s <title level="m">Principia</title> (1726) (which he quotes in his notes), and possibly his
                <title level="m">Optics</title> (1704), writes that, “the equal
                diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction of the rays by the
                atmosphere and their reflection from other bodies. Light consists either of
                vibrations propagated through a subtle medium or of numerous minute particles
                repelled in all directions from the luminous body” (<title level="a">Notes</title> 239). This last sentence
                demonstrates Shelley’s awareness of the corpuscularian debates concerning the nature
                of light, in which Thomas Young’s 1801 double-slit thought experiment complicated
                Newton’s theory of light as particles by positing that light, depending on the
                conditions of the experiment, acts as a wave.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                    Newton’s <title level="m">Optics</title> (3: 400) and Young (16, 45).</note> Shelley’s
                careful phrasing, though, investing in neither scientific account, demonstrates a
                mind determined to speculate on the hither side of known reality, and in
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, his cerebrations on starlight moves past
                Newton and Young into what we now call quantum physics and speculative realism. By
                yoking together the scientific, the poetic, and the political <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title>, I argue, produces a radical politics based on love, one
                that founds communities rather than the state-of-nature chaos and anarchy of two key
                interlocutors, Hobbes and Rousseau. Love, folding “its healing wings” over the world
                at the end of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), in a defiant gesture
                against tyranny, it is suggested, nonetheless tumbles back into “woes . . . Hope
                thinks infinite,” whereas <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> sees love escape
                such transcendental temporalities altogether (4.570). The love Shelley theorizes
                through the poetics of star- and day-light in
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is, I will argue,
                something similar to quantum feminist Karen Barad’s conceptualization of
                “intra-action,” which allows Shelley to imagine wholly new worlds that this politics
                of love both brings into being and is brought into being by. </p>
            <p>As we know from the spookily Shellyean <title level="m">X-Files</title>, starlight
                travels billions of years to reach the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author">I am referencing the
                episode titled "Closure."</note> Shelley, too, is familiar with
                starlight’s easy-does-it temporal travel schedule: “some idea may be gained of the
                immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse
                before light could reach this earth from the nearest of them; yet in one year light
                travels 5,422,400,000,000 miles, which is at a distance 5,707,600 times greater than
                that of the sun from the earth” (<title level="a">Notes</title> 239). Readings
                of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> from de Man’s to more recent quantum readings of light in
                the poem all reference light in its earthly, and so bounded-down, anthropocentric
                aspect.<note place="foot" resp="author">Mark Lussier provides
                            a thorough overview of Shelley’s use of quantum theory. Plotnitsky reads
                            <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> specifically as a
                            showcase for Shelley’s theorizing of what Niels Bohr calls
                            “complementarity.” For Plotnitsky, complementarity resembles Derridean
                            <emph>différance</emph>, the way in which the trace
                            structure defers and differentiates linguistic meaning spatiotemporally
                            (264). However, mapping Bohr’s quantum mechanics onto Derridean
                            deconstruction is not only a maneuver that oversimplifies quantum
                            complementarity, it also commits a phallogocentric gesture Derrida would
                            surely not endorse. It erases feminist science studies and eco-feminism
                            from a discourse it has actually been at the forefront of for decades.</note> But
                understanding light as discretely deconstructive or
                materialistic undermines the linguistic-material—and speculative—paradoxical nature
                of it Shelley develops and deploys in his poem. Indeed, given starlight’s distance
                from the earth and the human eye, the “I” of both poem and self, need be, and
                perhaps simply is, of no consequence for what de Man calls, referencing classical
                antiquity’s theogony, these fallen gods, the stars (<title level="a">Shelley</title>
                117). Stars, it turns out, are like Transformers, more than meets the eye.
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> thus evokes what contemporary speculative
                realist philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux, calls the “arche-fossil,” nonhuman
                material or phenomena that evidences life anterior and ulterior to human life
                because the lifespans of this material phenomena exceeds that of the human species’
                    lifespan.<note place="foot" resp="author">Meillassoux
                            sometimes uses the term “ancestrality.”</note> As the poem’s
                speaker says, “the moon . . . obscured with [ ] light / the Sun as he the stars”
                    (77–79).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wasserman notes the
                            importance of stars for Shelley: “stars, however, carried a special
                            symbolic significance for Shelley that he exploited in a number of
                            poems. To him they are ‘immortal stars,’ ‘eternal,’ ‘deathless,’
                            ‘sacred’; they are ‘pure’ and dwell in ‘Eternal bowers’” (161).
                            According to Wasserman “he also glimpsed intimations of the eternity of
                            transcendent Being in the fact that the stars are always present,
                            obscured in day from earthly vision only by the diffusion of sunlight in
                            the earth’s atmosphere. The likening of the flower-world to the
                            star-heaven suggests, then, not merely the mutable oscillation of
                            starriness between world and sky but also, paradoxically, the immutable
                            eternity of that starrinesss and therefore the possible eternity of both
                            Existence, which is equitable with the One Mind, and the totally
                            comprehensive and ultimate Being” (161). Wasserman’s valuable insight
                            into Shelley’s symbology deviates from my reading of stars in that
                            Wasserman, by returning them to a revelation of transcendence, and
                            ultimately an equality with the One Mind and hence the human, construes
                            the stars as evidence of a possible future paradise in the
                            anthropocentric mode.</note> Starlight, night after night,
                illustrates the possibility of a world without us even while the next day’s dawning
                suggests the universe’s apathy to humanity’s endurance since the sunlight obscures
                by its diffuse rays the always-present stars whose very eternality recollects us to
                human mortality. Starlight’s apparent spatial absence-as-presence during the day,
                and its illusory temporal here-ness, suggest an ulteriority beyond the
                anthropocentric. As I read it, <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> thus
                glimpses the possibility of a post-apocalyptic world existing after we are gone, one
                glimmering alone, dark, and beautifully desolate in the phosphorescent darkness of
                starlight. </p>
            <p> Yet precisely because of its untimely indifference to humanity’s claim to
                everlastingness, starlight’s evocation of the way in which the world is always
                already without us, deflates our transcendental beliefs in the human species’s
                necessity for earthly survival. If starlight is a temporal, flashing on-and-off
                indicator of a world always already without us, then it is also a cosmic cautionary
                tale counterintuitively imploring us to find ways to be-with the other in the time
                we have left. Confronting finitude, the poem’s speaker and his guide, Rousseau,
                struggle to understand their stupefied bearing witness to life’s unfolding of the
                mad chaos of individuals bereft of human connection. As we shall see, on this world
                without us, <emph>love, literally, creates this being-with us</emph>, and
                in the process literally creates new worlds, what Barad’s quantum theory calls new
                “spacetimes.” More specifically, I suggest that Shelley’s last poem resolutely
                abandons the skepticism, the idealism, and the transcendentalism variously

                            transcendence: “The pressure contradiction exerts on Shelley’s
                            radicalism ends by diverting love from world mediations to transcendent
                            absolutes. The apocalyptic drive of Shelley’s late poetry reflects the
                            continuity of his idealism and politics as antitypical facets of a
                            single desire” (24). John Wright has a similar view of love and
                            transcendence in Shelley. Wright takes “metaphoric apprehension . . . to
                            be the fundamental power of the human mind and a mental counterpart of
                            the primal capacity for self-transcendence he found in love” (22). For
                            more on love in Shelley see Stovall, Warren, and Baker.</note> Shelley
                scholarship has sometimes had a tendency to read him within a traditional
                view of Romanticism as apocalyptic, a drive toward a mythic paradise, sometimes
                manifesting on earth, sometimes beyond it, in an Elysian after-life.<note place="foot"

                same time, many scholars view his later poetry as diverging from his earlier verse;
                as Jerome McGann noted long ago, “a new and significant impulse was moving his
                poetry” in this last year of his life (41). But, as I have argued elsewhere,
                Shelley’s work has never been invested in these apocalyptic fictional fantasies of
                    Paradise.<note place="foot" resp="author">I

                as his guiding light, Shelley turns his attention one last time to what has always
                preoccupied him, post-apocalyptic reality, what happens when the last humans remain
                (perhaps briefly) on
                earth.</p>
            <p>To engage this post-apocalyptic reality, Shelley imagines a new affective solidarity
                whose necessity of love is terrestrial, not transcendent. This affinity is more than
                the self’s search for its own likeness in a copy of itself, as Shelley puts it in
                <title level="a">On Love</title> (circa 1818) (itself a text shot through with the vocabulary of
                “particles” and “vibrations”), a narcissism that merely replays the egocentric
                self-love of Shelley’s Rousseauvian nightmare parade in this, his last long poem.
                Instead, the poem theorizes how love works when life, verging on termination,
                becomes a more-urgent-than-normal process of perpetual self-inquisition with no
                answers, exemplified by the poem’s final broken-off question, “Then, what is life?”
                (544), as well as in Rousseau’s haunted, disconsolate pleas to the “shape all
                light”: “tell me whence I came, and where, and why” (398).<note place="foot" resp="author">My
                    reading places me alongside

                            Shelley’s desire for death through an increasingly highly wrought
                            apotheosizing of love: “we must . . . read Shelley’s politics as an
                            aspect of his rhetoric of Romantic love” even as Shelley’s love poetics
                            lead to an acceptance of “death as the telos of desire and gravitates[s]
                            increasingly toward a visionary despair” (18).</note> Shelley’s
                poem offers no answers to these desperate implorations because, as the
                poem dramatizes in its staged pageantry of life’s decline and fall into a masquerade
                of simulacra, to know life definitively would be to circumscribe life within a field
                of closed possibility, a life, perversely, of no possible continuance, one without
                the unpredictability of an unknown future for if the future were known life would be
                over.<note place="foot" resp="author">For
                            a similar though different reading of life in the poem, see Faflak,
                            54.</note> This is what Derrida means, in his reading of the
                poem, by “living on”: life continues only because the future is always here and
                never here, just like the stars, which have technically not arrived even though we
                can “see” them (which we really cannot) (<title level="a">Living</title> 62). Hence, the poem finds its
                resolution in the irresolution of its necessary non-answer to its final question,
                instead asking “what is love?,” a triumph then of love rather than life. And so
                Shelley’s phantasmatic costume ball—Hazlitt referred to the poem as “a new and
                terrific The Dance of Death” (494)—theorizes love, not as Derrida does, as a love of ruins because everything
                falls to ruin, but beyond ruin; and not as de Man’s figure for disfiguration, but as
                an intra-active figural-materiality that is beyond transfiguration when it manifests
                as true love.<note place="foot" resp="author">For Derrida’s thinking that connects

                    Blind</title>.</note> In its roving disquisition on the quantum nature of
                light, the poem issues a last call to learn to love freely and fully, to feel, for
                someone, since this is all the survival we can ultimately have in the time of the
                present’s apathetic disaster, this time of fallen stars. </p>

            <p>Shelley’s poem associates light and its shifting configurations with political
                factions, the sun serving as anarchy’s herald and the stars’ as love’s harbinger.
                Although for de Man, “it is unimaginable that Shelley’s non-epic, non-religious poem
                would begin by elegiacally or rebelliously evoking the tragic defeat of the former
                gods, the stars, at the hands of the sun” (<title level="a">Shelley</title> 117), what he terms “the
                unimaginable” is, rather, easily imagined, for the poem’s opening stages this battle
                precisely by <emph>not</emph> ascribing mythological
                god-like significance to the stars. In Shelley’s hands, they become significant
                framing devices of the poem’s political allegorization, linking patriarchal politics
                to the poetics of sunrise:

            The immediate opposition of the sun and the stars reverses the teleology of disaster,
                which derives from the Latin “astar”—which means disaster is literally a fallen
                star—by equating it to sunlight instead, the wellspring of earthly life, the
                figural-material alternative to sunlight’s figural masculinist power. Unlike the
                later feminized “shape all light,” the sun’s light is associated with the law of the
                father, which thus links it to the parade of “Anarchs old” (285) who signify
                destructive authoritarianism and tyrannical despotism. Dissociated from the sun, the
                speaker’s reflective thoughts, “which must remain untold,” stem specifically from
                “the stars that gem.” Only as the sun tears away the night’s mask does the speaker
                awaken from his sleepless reverie in the nighttime to the fantastic visions, and ill
                slumber, of the light of the day. Sunlight thus suggests veil-rending violence and
                the observationally specular, even as the stars are avatars of a gentle tranquility,
                a paradoxical sleep so peaceful it requires not the unconsciousness of sleep but
                hazy wakefulness. This wakefulness is different still from the wakeful sleep of day
                that brings with it Rousseau’s phantasmagoria of moral, cultural, and physical
                abominations bombinating in their own Bacchanal, thanatopolitical excess.
                Nighttime’s wakefulness, in contrast, like the stars, is not specular but
                speculatively realist, the imagining of some world we cannot envision or comprehend
                since it seems to exist beyond us, a signal fire guiding us through the dark to the
                shape all light. </p>
            <p> Whereas for de Man the sun usurps natural, chronological progression—and thus
                renders historical progress always a matter of absolute contingency through its
                disfiguration—the sun’s sudden appearance manifests a different, decisively material
                event. As the editors of the Norton Shelley remind us, the line “the stars . . . gem
                the cone of night” refers to an actual, rather than figural, shadow that the earth
                casts as a result of its orbitational locality in relation to the sun. The poem
                fixes the earth’s physical coordinates, evoking Newton’s own “System of the World,”
                even as its opening passage works by prosopopoeia, personification, and apostrophe,
                which figure what de Man calls “the master trope of poetry” (<title level="a">Hypogram</title> 48). Sun,
                stars, sky, earth, light and shadows, are all both figural and material.</p>
            <p> Later in the poem, this twinning of figurality and materiality becomes more confused
                and confusing by aligning the sun with the political faction of anarchism, linked to
                a figurality disconnected from the material world, that Shelley hopes to
                defeat.<note place="foot" resp="author">While it is true, as Greg Kucich
                            says, that Shelley was an anarchist, in this poem, “Anarchs” stand, for
                            Shelley, as a Hobbesian politics that incorporates all versions of
                            self-love represented by Caesar, Frederick, etc.</note> Attempting to
                reassure the ghost of Rousseau, the speaker contrasts the concrete
                (though bloody) results of his revolution-galvinizing works to the pointlessly cruel
                despotism of the Anarchs:

            The passage twists post-apocalyptically, the sun of the law of the father with which
                the poem opens obscuring and rebuffing the true sun of reality. Caesar and
                Constantine, Gregory and John, rise like a false eclipse between the world and the
                Sun even as the Sun, by its very nature, is part of this eclipse. Enacting the end
                of the world, the sun blots out not just the stars, but itself, the sun, the true
                son, light of all light, signaling that the world will literally end as a direct
                result of the sun’s parenting of a political anarchism with heliocentric destruction
                on its anthropocentric mind. Rousseau’s visions, like the poem itself, therefore
                figure state-of-nature tales told by Hobbesian warmongers that culminate with
                humanity’s extinction. Confronted with the spectacle of all these pale-horse
                death-dealers, it is perhaps no wonder that, as Hugh Roberts remarks, “in the
                pageant of life it is love, above all, that the narrator and Rousseau as abstract
                spectators seem least able to comprehend” (403). </p>
            <p> To check the ontological cosmic disaster of the sun’s quenching extinction at its
                own patriarchal hands, Shelley, counterintuitively, reclaims the stars not as
                post-apocalyptic predictors of imminent disaster, as gestured to in his notes
                to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, but instead as love’s material register:

            Shelley’s pun on Plato’s lover, “Aster,” Greek for both “star” and “flower,”
                transforms disaster into life’s flower of heaven that is love.<note place="foot"

                            Wasserman valuably points out that, for Shelley, “flowers and stars are

                            interchangeable. That flowers are the stars of earth is a commonplace
                            that was an important, often central, symbol in Shelley’s poetry after
                            he became acquainted in 1819 with the plays of Calderon . . . ”
                            (159).</note> Similarly, the “shape all light” later sketches,
                via what Dante brings up from the dark with him, a familiar romantic account of
                paradise:

            With the speculative possibility of extinction, and the impending possibility of the
                world’s doom, love emerges as a non-transfigurable element in a political and
                materialist table of potential calamities. The stars, via Aster, and the flowers of
                heaven, imagine love in a post-apocalyptic reality we must grapple with in response
                to these apocalyptic dreams that delude us with hopes of a perfected world. This
                love shows and accepts that these fallen and falling stars of both disaster and
                humankind are neither here nor there but still falling, unlocatable in space or
                time. Hence, the stars, as they appear here, stand as more than a figure for love:
                for love is a figure beyond figuration, and so not
                <emph>just</emph> figural, but something real, both
                figural and material, what Karen Barad calls an “intra-active” phenomenon. </p>
            <p>Kate Singer’s recent turn to feminist quantum theory and its investment in nonhuman
                materiality provides an example of how we can move beyond a singular focus on
                figurality (<title level="a">Limpid Waves</title>). Barad’s theory
                allows us to understand how in the shape all light subject and object are
                mutually constitutive of “quantum entanglement.”<note place="foot" resp="author">For
                            Goldstein, Shelley’s Lucretian materialism can bridge the gaps between
                            the poem’s various materialisms: “to the extent that three technical,
                            hard-to-reconcile senses of ‘matter’ compete in contemporary materialist
                            criticism—the deconstructive materiality of the letter, the Marxian
                            matter of history, and, more recently, the ‘vibrant’ and polymorphous
                            material that ‘new’ materialists retrieve from the history of philosophy
                            and modern science studies—<foreign xml:lang="la">De rerum natura</foreign> still
                            has something to offer” (64). I skew toward what we call “new
                            materialism,” although Barad’s work, I hope to show, exceeds all of
                            these formulations to suggest something much more radical about how the
                            real and non-real, the discursive and material, are mutually
                            constitutive.</note> Crucially, within entanglement relata do
                not precede relations; rather each new intra-action manifests a new relation between
                the discursive and the material, the subject and object. Barad’s development of this
                idea calls into question the up-to-now predominant linguistic turn that understands
                both the subject and object to be discursive constructs. </p>
            <p>Barad borrows Donna Haraway’s use of the term “diffraction” as a helpful way to
                understand quantum entanglement. She glosses Haraway as follows: “diffraction can
                serve as a useful counterpoint to reflection: both are optical phenomena, but
                whereas the metaphor of reflection reflects the themes of mirroring and sameness,
                diffraction is marked by patterns of difference” (71). Barad emphasizes how
                diffraction expands the circle of difference away from reflective homologies of self
                and love that we can see Shelley, for instance, presenting in <title level="a">On
                    Love.</title> The point,
                for Barad, is to increase difference rather than curtail it, as reflection does.
                Extending Haraway’s usage, Barad’s diffraction becomes a metaphor for understanding
                both ontological difference as well as physical phenomena. Barad’s reading of
                diffraction in Niels Bohrs’ famous restaging of Young’s two-slit experiment,
                evidences this quantum paradox: a particle of light, when shined through a
                diffraction pattern grating, presents as either a wave or a particle. According to
                Newtonian physics, such a result is impossible, since “only waves produce
                diffraction patterns; particles do not (since they cannot occupy the same place at
                the same time)” (81). As Barad argues, this diffracted phenomena illustrates quantum
                entanglement since the production of matter as diffractal waves and particles
                <emph>depends</emph> on the entanglement of the subject, the apparatus
                (the diffracting grate), and matter itself. That is, only this particular
                intersection of subject (experimenter) and object (matter) produces particle-wave
                duality. For Barad this phenomenon means “that entanglements are highly specific
                configurations . . . [that] . . . change with each intra-action. In fact is it not
                so much that they change from one moment to the next or from one place to another,
                but that <emph>space, time, and matter do not exist</emph> prior to the
                intra-actions that reconstitute entanglements” (74; emphasis added). The
                consequences of Barad’s development of quantum entanglement are therefore
                astonishing since they challenge, and even dismiss, contemporary humanistic and
                scientific accounts of how space, time, and, matter, and hence subjects and objects,
                exist in reality. By manifesting a new spacetime in each entanglement,
                <emph>different</emph> spaces and times, quantum
                entanglement alters the very ways in which we understand ontology for humans: the
                world only exists in a non-fixed—indeed non-existent—space and time repeatedly
                created by the production of new spacetime worlds that are, in turn, created
                simultaneously by newly created subjects and objects. And since entanglement
                instantiates space and time new worlds are made with each entanglement even if these
                are not, properly speaking, between subject and object or subject and subject since
                all of these terms are now constantly being brought into existence with each
                iterative entanglement.</p>
            <p>In Barad’s theory, it is only posterior to entanglement—and hence their
                existence—that manufactured (what she calls) “cuts” occur between intra-active
                agential subjects and materialities to produce discrete, identifiable “subjects” and
                “objects.” “Cuts” are thus social constructions that proceed from, rather than
                precede, the ontological origins of subjects and objects, just like the masks that
                “fell from the countenance / And form of all” at poem’s end, exemplify how wearing a
                person suit can falsely fashion oneself as an un-entangled “subject” (536–37). By
                de-masking the simulacra we don in the world, quantum entanglement undoes notions of
                the subject and object as independent agencies. Instead, the material world, which
                on speculative accounts exists apart for us is, actually, always already with us
                until we enact the artificial cuts that cleave a given entanglement. Similarly, the
                shape all light, linguistically personifying a quantum materiality, radically
                confounds our ability to conceive of subjects and objects as originarily
                distinguishable, a con-fused phenomenon that explicates the narrator’s, and
                Rousseau’s, own confused reaction to the shape. In proffering Rousseau nepenthe, the
                shape all light obliterates his mind as sand, which indicates the dissolution of the
                subject as model of and for human discursive epistemology and ontological
                prioritization as distinct from nonhuman materiality. Whereas Rousseau viewed
                himself through the aperture of his subjectivity, rather like being cut out with a
                cookie cutter, the shape all light illuminates the post-cuts that take place after
                entanglement. </p>
            <p>The shape all light, an exemplar of discursive-material quantum entanglement, renders
                visible a post-social-contract politics that usurps the normative sociopolitical
                order of “the Anarchs.” In <title level="a">The Mask of Anarchy</title> (1832) for Shelley, such figures
                reveal paradise as an apocalyptic sleight-of-hand that conceals Hobbesian pale
                riders trampling on all life:

            <l>Like Death in the Apocalypse” (30–31).</l>

                </quote>
            In <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, however, love, and not death, nurtures hope
                of a post-apocalyptic life predicated on revealing love as more than ephemeral
                feeling, love as, rather, both the material force and the intra-action between
                subject and object as they are brought into being <emph>for the first
                    time in a newly created space and time</emph> that is the process of their
                intra-action. Whereas the poem begins by thinking light in terms of a cruel politics
                of oppression, the shape all light provides an antidote to this poisonous
                    politics.<note place="foot" resp="author">But this antidote is not the
                        same as Derrida’s <emph>pharmakon</emph> since light and subject enter entirely new
                            entanglements rather than being always already a form of
                        <emph>différance</emph>. See <title level="a">Plato’s Pharmacy.</title></note> Light
                then shifts its subject-object interface yet again to
                position starlight as more than the blinking signal of human extinction, a phenomena
                that entangles humans in material love, refiguring, rather than disfiguring (as for
                de Man), and iterating, ever new entanglements. </p>
            <p>Moving us away from anthropocentric epistemology to posthuman ontology, then, the
                discursive-material figure of the shape all light, differentiating itself from the
                sun, returns us to the quantum and its creation of spacetime, when it becomes a
                rainbow touching, melding with, the forest floor. Rainbows appear in the sky—for a
                rainbow is not, of course, any more than the stars, actually in the sky—when water
                droplets reflect, refract, and disperse in the air. As Barad explains, reflection is
                not merely specular but also occurs by diffraction, which is what happens when one
                type of light “bends” upon encountering another medium thus increasing or decreasing
                its wavelength. Shelley limns quantum reality in the rainbow’s ghostly radiance:

            Mark Lussier and Arkady Plotnitsky have both noted the quantum language rolling
                through the placidly pillowing water in this passage. But Barad’s
                reconceptualization of quantum matter as entangling the subject and object in a
                space and time of their own making in an act of creative simultaneity, reveals a
                much bolder, and as we’ll see, politically radical Shelley than either Lussier’s or
                Plotnitsky’s classical quantum accounts allow for. The steady, exact rhyme scheme
                (“willow,” “billow,” and “pillow”) maintains the rainbow’s illusory essence, an
                assonance that reflects the reflection of the water and hoodwinks us into reading
                the passage as an instance of classical quantum mechanics—the water rolls on
                naturally just like the end sounds in space and time understood as locational end
                points. But the poem acknowledges the quantum diffraction of the water when the
                personified shape all light “bend[s] her / Head under the dark boughs, till like a
                willow / Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream” (363–65). The shape reverse
                personifies the stream even as the shape all light itself becomes this stream in the
                emergence from the water of the light’s skyward-arcing rainbow that occurs because
                of both its <emph>reflection and diffraction</emph> in that water (since a
                rainbow can only occur by diffraction). Both material and figurative, the shape all
                light becomes now something else altogether again as it is entangled with the water
                in a flowing measure of eddying hair and chromatic illusion. The rainbow thus
                recalls us to the other side of the specular coin: the human observer who can see
                what does not exist, a unique form of, to repurpose de Man’s universally explanatory
                phrase of deconstructive rhetoricity, “blindness and insight.” For Shelley knows
                that rainbows are both material phenomena and optical illusions that both do and do
                not exist as tactile material in spatial reality: you both can and cannot touch and
                see a rainbow. Shelley’s rainbow is a diffraction, then, that makes a difference for
                in this passage Shelley reminds us that the figural and the material, the subject
                and object, can only be cleaved after their moment of entangled becoming.</p>
            <p>For despite the rainbow’s illusory nature it does
                <emph>exist</emph> even it if cannot be touched by
                the speaker or seen for what it really is, a chromatic spectrum of moisture and dust
                fronting the sky. As such, it exemplifies the poem’s speculative ontological paradox
                since optical illusions require a perceiving subject, whose senses can be deceived
                by discrete objects (as Rousseau recounts to the speaker, while witnessing this
                scene, he was baffled and unable to comprehend not only its meaning but even what
                was actually occurring). So, on one hand, the human subject aestheticizes a
                material, ontological phenomenon, epistemologically constructing it as one thing
                understandable to the human mind, when it actually is something more diffractedly
                unknowable. On the other hand, the rainbow’s very material nature, its optical
                illusoriness, demonstrates how irrevocably blurred and smeared together the subject
                and object are. Just as we re-ontologize the rainbow as something it is not, so does
                the rainbow’s illusoriness re-ontologize humans by pointing out that humans are
                capable of being fooled by a world we think we command. In this sense, like the
                speaker and Rousseau, we are anthropocentric Anarchs and must be taught, by the
                poem’s quantum theory of love, to kick away the ladder of this anarchism we have
                climbed up. This is another of example of why, as Julie Carlson remarks, “a major
                impediment to adopting a Shelleyan practice of love is the difficulty of seeing what
                he is talking about” (76). The rainbow, we might say, is a weird type of material
                personification: by converting it from dust particles to this thing we call a
                rainbow, we make what cannot be seen seeable: we remake it in human terms as
                something that can be seen on human terms. In making the rainbow seeable, and making
                ourselves see it, the rainbow, a material smattering of particles, comes into
                discursive being literally in a space and time in which it actually ontologically
                exists but that also does not exist until it is entangled with the human. In turn,
                humans’ own subjectivity undergoes a radicalized becoming as the material reality of
                this optical illusion turns human eyes inside out to see what they cannot see.
                Reality literally gets made as real precisely because of, paradoxically, both its
                realness and non-realness—which are both made by the other at the same time. This is
                the lesson of the rainbow shape all light which makes “all that was [seem] as if it
                had been not” (385). Beliefs in human deterministic and constructivist powers fall
                away somewhere over the rainbow, a place and time that, with no fixed locative or
                temporal junction without this human and nonhuman entanglement, serves as a reminder
                that we have far surpassed Newtonian mechanical accounts of the world and even
                contemporary quantum accounts of the world. The rainbow and the human subject
                intra-act, demonstrating, together, how subjects and objects are entangled in the
                creation of their own world. </p>

            <p>Then the poem materializes a new entanglement. The weird intra-active subject-object
                agency of the rainbow becomes a type of post-apocalyptic spatio-temporality when
                Shelley reveals that the rainbow’s shape all light is not just electromagnetic
                radiation and optical illusion but also starlight. Like starlight, the rainbow shape
                will turn us back to love:

            Although metaphorically like “heaven’s living eyes,” the stars that “reillumine” the
                darkness, the shape all light is also like the day, only here she functions as the
                true day, the feminine sun of no father, sun and not a son. She represents, then, a
                revolutionary, feminized, quantum truth, the light of the stars and true day that
                can politically rebel against the false sons of false suns. This revolution gets
                televised when the shape all light, now revealed as a late-arriving star, in an
                extraordinary gesture of post-apocalyptic power, tramples out human thought in order
                to remind it of its own mortal brevity in the face of the billions-of-years lifespan
                of the universe. And the shape joins “Lucifer,” the masculine light bringer, what de
                Man questionably reads as “metaphor,” to the rainbow’s feminine quantum materialism.
                This intra-active relational conflux, a marriage of starlight’s optics with the
                rainbow’s illusory effect, diffracts humans’ self-regard as rulers of the earth, the
                impolite fiction of an impolitic politics that renders us all anthropocentric
                anarchs. Like the rainbow, the stars always exist, but only always exist as we “see”
                them once we do not see them. </p>
            <p>The shape all light opposes the light of the patriarchal sons of anarchy, guiding us,
                as love guides Dante out of fire and flame into paradise, towards the new forms of
                being love’s post-apocalyptic politics guarantees. After Rousseau drinks the
                nepenthe, he experiences, as he says, “a new Vision never seen before” in which the
                shape all light “waned in the coming light / as veil by veil the silent splendour
                drops / from Lucifer, amid the chrysolite / of sunrise” (411–20). The Morningstar,
                Lucifer, evanesces the shape all light, even as the doubling “of that fairest
                planet,” Venus, doubles Lucifer as the Eveningstar, twinning the morning to the
                night, to “that star’s smile” (419). Yet this star’s light “is like the scent / Of a
                jonquil when evening breezes fan it” (420). The simile repurposes morning light’s
                (Lucifer) and evening light’s (Venus) ethereal early-morning meeting as a meeting of
                reflection, for the jonquil is also known as “narcissus,” recalling us to Narcissus
                and the poem’s enemy, self-love. Lucifer, when he looks in the depths of fading
                night, sees his own face reflected back in the star’s millions-year-long Cheshire
                smile. The shape all light, however, despite its evanescence, nonetheless remains
                <emph>present</emph>, intra-acting with Rousseau’s materialistic
                speaker-companion, sidestepping the sun’s and the star’s egoistic cybernetic loop of
                self-love. </p>
            <p>This is what makes this vision so powerfully, diffractedly, different: it is an
                instance of entanglement between the shape all light and Rousseau, who both now only
                begin to exist because they journey forward through the darkness that is light, an
                entangled phenomenon that signals an entire reorientation of how we understand the
                human in relation to the material. Rousseau, as both a material tree stump and a
                discursive subject, is already imbricated with the material world but here enters
                into a new entanglement with light. The word “knew,” which signals epistemology, is
                undercut by the ontological yoke of the “shape” that “moved, as I moved” combining
                the human and nonhuman, entangling the material and the figural: “So knew I in that
                light’s severe excess / The presence of that shape which on the stream / <emph>Moved,
                    as I moved</emph> along the wilderness” (424–26; emphasis
                added). A cascade of imagery captures the shape’s “presence”:

            Like the day and night of dream and wakefulness divided by the absent-present stars
                with which the poem opens, the shape all light seems to exist as both presence and
                absence, the momentary difference between the time of day’s giving way to night and
                vice versa—a moment that is “forever sought, forever lost,” pure day separated from
                pure night, each uninterrupted, exorbitant from its opposite, forever sought and
                lost because day and night are forever blended in the other. Space and time get
                remade in the shape all light as neither day nor night, sun nor star, and hence by
                exceeding the time of day and night the shape creates a non-anthropocentric world
                since day and night are human inventions. Like the stars that remain in the sky
                obscured by the sun (77–79), the shape all light appears as both material real shape
                and its own ghost, just as Rousseau himself lives only partially, neither dead nor
                alive: “so did that shape its obscure tenour keep” (432). The shape all light, in
                keeping its musical voice (“tenour”) level yet also obscure, becomes one with
                Rousseau, his material ghost just as Rousseau is the shape’s material ghost that
                entangles rather than demarcates. Rousseau and the shape are an “uncut”
                intra-action: subject and object, figural and material, light and night. </p>
            <p>Rousseau becomes, here, not just the Enlightenment patriarch who Mary Wollstonecraft
                targets as one of feminism’s arch-villains, but a phenomenon made of and for a new
                kind of feminist post-social-contract politics. By revealing the intra-action of the
                shape all light’s feminist critique of Enlightenment patriarchy
                <emph>with</emph> a key figure of that patriarchy, Shelley reversions the social
                contract as forms of intra-action that denude egocentric individualism of its power
                to cut people into Hobbesian individuals invested in their own welfare and warfare
                against the communal concerns of others. For Shelley’s carefully-chosen invocation
                of the Enlightenment via the wraith-like Rousseau, of course also conjures
                Rousseau’s main antagonist, the even more spectral Hobbes, and with him the
                attendant fears that life in the post-apocalypse will return us to a war of all
                against all, which the poem depicts in its (mon)anarchs and Bacchic simulacra
                chained to Death’s chariot, whose chaos we call variously libertarianism, despotism,
                or fascism. All such ideologies and factions, if they can even be distinguished, are
                grounded in <foreign xml:lang="fr">amour propre</foreign>, Rousseau’s, and Shelley’s, enemy.
                So whereas Kate Singer rightly remarks that “Rousseau’s dream presents him with
                nightmare visions of the social contract” (and that only the feminine shape all
                light can lead Rousseau out of “the nightmare of history”), for Rousseau and Shelley
                such nightmares are also dreamt because these are actually Hobbesian visions of life
                (<title level="a">Stoned</title> 706, 688). In response to these nightmares,
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> explodes both
                monarchical despotism and social-contract anarchic and democratic Enlightenment
                theories to rethink a viable post-social-contract community, to forge modes of being
                together on a post-apocalyptic world where governmental, cultural, familial, and
                religious institutions have all fallen, similar to what Rousseau and Hobbes describe
                in their differing versions of the originary state of nature.</p>
            <p>As such the shape all light differs from twilight, a diffracted course-change that
                runs away from the Anarchs’ navel-gazing self-love toward a love that tarries
                somewhere with the other, just as the material shape does with the nearest human
                subject, Rousseau. Here Shelley’s choice of Rousseau as Virgilesque guide to the
                speaker’s Dante culminates in a warning to abjure self-love or it will leave you,
                like Rousseau at poem’s end, “as one between desire and shame / suspended” (394–95).
                For it is Rousseau, and not Hobbes or Wollstonecraft, who targets self-love in
                <title level="m">A Discourse on Inequality</title>(1755) and
                <title level="m">Reveries of the Solitary Walker</title> (1770), in which humans’
                egocentricity in the state of nature must be annihilated for any genuine
                social-contract politics to overpower human passion for self from self, a foundation
                for politics the poem lays bare as nothing more than a reset of Hobbesian anarchy
                disguised in the resulting simulacra of democratic revolutions that must be ruled by
                social contracts equally laid bare as ineffectively useless. But whereas Rousseau’s
                solution is the erasure of self completely in <title level="m">Reveries</title>, his
                last book, Shelley repurposes Rousseau as his guide to checkmate the anthropocentric
                self-love that operates the Anarchs’ politics.<note
                        place="foot" resp="author">Hamilton (180) has also noticed this
                            link between Shelley and Rousseau’s <title level="m">Reveries</title>. See
                            also Duffy for a historical situating of Rousseau’s work in the period.</note> As
                Orrin Wang argues, Shelley’s Rousseau critiques both the
                Enlightenment’s failure and a post-Enlightenment, post-Napoleon despair over failed
                revolutions. That Rousseau the Enlightenment
                <emph>philosophe</emph> is most associated with the
                French Revolution signals this failure even as the poem targets Rousseau’s intense
                engagement with overcoming his own egocentricism, like an arrow loosed, not by the
                sun god, Apollo, but by the god of the stars, Hesperus: self-love as the foundation
                for an anthropocentrism that is killing us. Witness Rousseau throughout the poem,
                constantly concerned with himself—“Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why”
                (398)—rather than others since “none seemed to know / Whither he went or whence he
                came, or why” (47–48).<note place="foot" resp="author">Earl Schulze also notices that Rousseau’s questions
                            are indicative of self-love (54).</note> Nepenthe is meant to
                erase self-love—which is patriarchal and masculine as opposed to the feminist shape
                all light—through its erasure of the self but it only blots out the Lockean
                <emph>tabula rosa</emph> of the mind, blots out the subject as
                epistemologically constructed. Touching his lips to the cup of self-forgetting
                recalls the speaker to himself, but only up to the moment of intra-action between
                Rousseau and the shape all light, which ontologically recreates the self and the
                other as a new entangled phenomenon. <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
                therefore illustrates how such an entanglement can overcome, finally, the
                revolutions that ultimately fail because of self-love: anthropocentric apocalyptic
                belief in a progressive utopian future brought about by humans acting upon a world
                that exists <emph>for</emph> rather than <emph>with</emph> and
                <emph>without</emph> them (since entanglement upends
                such temporal and spatial coordinates). </p>
            <p>The poem thus finds Shelley confronting his own earlier narcissistic theorization of
                love as well as Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie</title> (1761),
                an ur-text for the poem about those, to quote Rihanna, who fall in love in a
                hopeless place. Drawing on Enlightenment ideas about sympathy, Shelley writes, in
                <title level="a">On Love,</title> that “we are born into the world and there is something within us which
                from the instant that we live and move thirsts after its likeness” (504). Even while
                we seek homology in another’s form, an instance of narcissistic externalization, our
                parched self’s thirst for self-love—like the anarchs whose self-love quenches the
                sun, which is their mirror—turns inward and “we dimly see within our intellectual
                nature a miniature as it were of our entire self” (504). Delving into the self is
                explicitly reflective rather than diffractive physics, “a mirror whose surface
                reflects only the forms of purity and brightness: a soul within our soul that
                describes a circle around its proper Paradise which pain and sorrow or evil dare not
                overlap” (504). In this earlier essay, love, for Shelley, remains grounded in the
                desire for the apocalyptic, or paradisiacal, unity of perfection within the self, a
                kind of tunneled-under version of Rousseau’s self-love in
                <title level="m">Julie</title>: “love is but illusion; it fashions for itself, so to speak, another
                Universe; it surrounds itself with objects that do not exist, or to which it alone
                has given being; and as it renders all its sentiments by images, its language is
                always figurative. […] When passion is at the full . . . [it] . . . can see nothing
                but Paradise, Angels, the virtues of Saints, the delights of the celestial” (10).
                For Rousseau in <title level="m">Julie</title>, love’s figurative nature is tethered
                to its essentially mutable nature: it creates non-real universes, new person suits,
                constantly transfigurable. </p>
            <p>In contrast, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> theorizes love,
                not as figuration, but as entanglements that are unadorned by the masks of
                Rousseauvian self-delusion exhibited by the skeletal trick n’ treaters at poem’s
                end. Shelley’s Rousseau, in relating his vision of Dante, claims that the world is
                dumb to love’s music:

                </quote>
            Love is music, a light, a singer, that melodically rhymes to lovers but which the
                world itself cannot hear because love’s materiality is external to human beings.
                Love is a feeling between two subjects but also materialist, a “light” or external
                song that only comes into being as hearable music—apparently the evidence of its
                existence—between two subjects. In other words, love is a quantum entanglement that
                can only be heard, to put it paradoxically, <emph>once it is heard</emph>
                since its existence appears as the harmonic melody produced through the note-playing
                of one lover to another. And yet, because the world cannot hear love, this means
                that love, more paradoxically still,
                <emph>does exist</emph> separately, materially from
                the world dumb to its song. Nonetheless, “the sphere,” or world that cannot hear
                love, is moved by this very melody it is deaf to. At the syntactic level, the poem
                runs the world up against the wondrous rhyming of love’s musical melody, the dash
                shoving in like a trident from the sea against the line as if the world, while deaf
                to love, peers outward to Dante’s fiery inferno:

            <emph>This</emph> earth filled with phantoms and dim-form people reminds us
                that subjects remain shadowy strands of gossamer, black striations on the pattern of
                the world’s light, a difference, we must recall, between sleep and waking, and
                waking sleepfulness, and sleepy dreaming. Neither subject nor love exists then,
                neither in the world nor between lovers prior to their love: it is a thing that is
                neither object nor subject but an entanglement between the two. Here, life begins
                and ends as one-to-one.</p>
            <p>Donald Reiman writes that Shelley changed his conception of love between
                <title level="a">On Love</title> (circa 1818) and
                <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (1821) from “love as
                a response from others to his nature” to “a pursuit and celebration of the good that
                he saw in others” (10), one that evokes Humean and Smithian sympathy. But
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> revolts against any such notions. As the
                masks falling from the countenances of the poem’s orgiastic revelers remind us—as
                indeed does the speaker’s and Rousseau’s phantasmaticity—no autonomous subjects,
                either in body or mind, exist as yet in the world of the poem, only simulacra, a
                false impression of a reality suspended by its own naïve beliefs in a division
                between humans and the world as if they are independent actors irresponsible for
                their own delusions. What the poem discovers instead is that love is its own
                material entity, external to the subject, yet also, paradoxically, reliant on its
                entanglement with the subject for its life. One cannot go outside oneself to love
                the good in the other because the subject does not exist before love; every
                iteration of love fashions itself and the subject anew. And, indeed, the great moral
                of the poem is that such iterations form the architecture and architexture of a
                social contract after all social contracts can no longer exist in politics-as-usual
                manifestations, when institutional restraints like those favored by Hobbes and
                Rousseau are no longer possible, when life can only continue by bravely not knowing
                what life is, when no answers are any longer possible. To the question “then, what
                is life?” the poem answers: knowledge of the contour, nature, and time of life are
                irrelevant. For love is the answer, an entanglement that may fail, like any
                politics, and fail again, and again, until an entanglement shapes lovers’ light as
                what love is for real: ontologically beyond transfiguration, true love. And this is
                where Shelley surpasses Barad because for him a final spacetime of love can emerge
                between two people. </p>
            <p>By thinking love as non-transfigurational because it only exists as intra-active
                entanglement (again, space and time do not change they are made), Shelley crafts a
                vision of future spacetimes wherein love creates its subjects even as they create
                love for the first time. Seen in this light, the many lights of Shelley’s poem,
                before the subject and object are entangled in love, no subject, no self, exists,
                nor, indeed, does love itself. Love, then, <emph>is</emph> love, in a
                space and time of its own loving. In <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> (1821),
                Shelley remained faithful to the idea of love as a relation between a subject and
                object, a lover and beloved. But the bonds in such relations dissolve, as they do in
                that poem, since, like the simulacra in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
                subjects cling to the notion that they are human subjects. Shelley realizes that
                this “cut” between subject and object is itself a delusion. A priori notions of
                anthropocentric subjects are simply masks humans put on to cut themselves off from
                the world; in so doing they assume the title of another Napoleon or Frederick or
                Caesar, anthropocentricism as another form of the narcissism and egocentricity
                attributed to love that the poem resists and rewrites. Instead, the music of love
                arrives from outside the human even as it is also arises from the subjects who fall
                in love, the material drawing humans together into relations even as, in the
                process, love creates both itself and the subjects-as-lovers. </p>
            <p>Imagining beyond the anthropocentric subject, Shelley’s theory of love suggests not
                the egoistic chaos of a world lost to political anarchy but rather a radical
                politics of love that creates worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests
                new types of life, of living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world
                without us we could never have possibly anticipated because those worlds do not yet
                exist (this is why the poem breaks off). The poem wants us to know that this lovely
                spatiotemporality is like the stars, which, in their ulteriority beyond human life,
                constantly evince our own end even as this turns us back to consider our own
                survival since it reminds us that there may be none without love.
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> triumphs by knowing that life cannot be defined since
                each entanglement is of its own making, its own life. While we can never know what
                life is, Shelley entreats us, we must learn what true love is, and that is all we
                may know on earth and all we need to know. This is what Shelley knew, sitting on the
                sands of the Bay of Lerici, writing this poem, gazing at the sea that would soon
                claim him. In this time of disaster, of fallen stars, the triumph of love means a
                becoming of ourselves in our entanglement with the other in the darkness of light
                before the waves carry us away. For the uncertainty of our survival guarantees the
                paradox both of love’s radical indestructibility and the limited time it has left to
                live, to love, while we gaze up at the stars.</p>
