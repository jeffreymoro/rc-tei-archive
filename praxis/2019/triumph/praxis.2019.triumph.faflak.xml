            <div type="abstract">
                <p rend="noCount">Ever since Paul de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured,” we have come to see
                    Percy Shelley’s final, unfinished poem, “The Triumph of Life,” as a symptom of
                    the end of Romanticism and Romanticism as end. If or once things are over, why
                    bother to re-visit the end? This is one of many questions Shelley’s poem compels
                    its readers to ask, which is in turn to ask why we any longer need to re-visit
                    the poem at this a time when so little apparently rests on our doing so. So, as
                    if to prolong the idea of an end (whatever that might be), this volume is
                    comprised of four essays compelled to return to the same poem, as if to read the
                    poem as a crime scene that leaves a barrage of clues, none of them adding up to
                    a crime, but each lingering differently with Shelley as Shelley lingers with
                    life and history and as we linger (or not) with the shadows his future casts (or
                    not) upon our present moment, which seems more than ever beyond our grasp, if it
                    ever was within our ken. Why even bother? But then again, and just in case: if
                    so little and so much is at stake, why not?</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <p>Orrin Wang recalls one origin of this volume in his wonderfully generous
                        response to its suite of gorgeously searching papers on Shelley’s last poem.
                        Apparently I posed to him the notion that “certain Romantic texts require
                        repeated unearthing and burial&#8212;require/compel our productively
                        melancholic attachment to them. . . . We just thought it would be cool to
                        devote a whole panel to one poem in order to demonstrate precisely its
                        compulsive hold on our critical imaginations (a la de Man).” “We” refers to
                        a conversation over drinks with Jacques Khalip at an earlier NASSR
                        conference (likely Boston 2013), during which I broached the idea of
                        devoting an entire conference panel, maybe even an entire book, to one
                        Romantic text. It would (have to) be a text I felt that one could or should
                        not live without, one that sustained repeated intervention, not just across
                        time, but within the concentrated challenges of our present time. My wish
                        included texts whose monumental (dis)figuration by and through time left
                        them as open wounds within literary history that begged for the
                            <emph>pharmakon</emph> of interpretation. Khalip and I agreed that the
                        most compelling work, very much but not only because of Paul de Man’s
                        seminal reading, was Shelley’s last poem, very much though not only because
                        of the final “fold / Of” the text after it begs the question it cannot
                        answer, “‘Then what is life?’<note place="foot" resp="author">Percy Shelley,
                                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, ll. 547–48, 544, from
                            Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat’s Norton edition of <title level="m"
                                >Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>. All subsequent references to
                            Shelley’s writing, except where otherwise noted, are from this edition,
                            indicated by title and cited by line number for poetry and page number
                            for prose.</note> Like Keats extending his “living hand, now warm and
                        capable / Of earnest grasping” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 1–2), the
                        question makes a return to the poem at once compulsive and compulsory, but
                        it was also our hope to lose ourselves in this final fold “without any
                        irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” (Keats, <title level="m"
                            >Letters</title> 43), not to avoid facts altogether but to stop making
                        sense in ways the world seems increasingly to demand of us. Or as Orrin
                        answers when he asks, in his <title level="a">Response</title> to the
                        following essays, “Why read?,” we do so “out of a Shelleyan love based on
                        something like the sensation of the impermanence of our selves and our
                        readings, our cognition and our somatic experience.”</p>
                    <p>I never thought this idea would go anywhere. Then Sonia Hofkosh, in typically
                        generous fashion, invited me to organize one of the KSAA panels at the 2015
                        MLA, Sonia Hofkosh, thus indulging my fantasy, which resulted in <title
                            level="a">The Futures of Shelley’s Triumph,</title> consisting of Libby
                        Fay, Jacques, Tres Pyle, and Orrin’s response. The conversations that
                        preceded and proceeded from that experience, to which are added those with
                        this volume’s fifth contributor, Chris Washington, are of the kind that, any
                        time I feel jaded or disheartened about the state of our profession and
                        field, reminds me that even the apparently smallest exchange of ideas can
                        recall us to what really matters, which is a matter of our very survival. If
                        that sounds melodramatic, I mean it to. For “We just thought it would be
                        cool” is symptomatic, not of our nonchalance toward our field, profession,
                        or work, but rather of our sense that chances need to be taken. As de Man
                        says of Shelley’s last text, “Questions of origin, of direction, and of
                        identity punctuate the text without ever receiving a clear answer” (95–96).
                        Going for broke in the absence of clear answers may be a sign of desperation
                        (“Why are we any longer doing this??”) that stimulants often help me to
                        quell. It also begs the question of why we debate the interpretation of
                        works that few people might or will or want to read. What could possibly
                        matter? And yet at the same time, why not? <emph>If</emph> the world seems
                        to care less about what we do as scholars, then who cares that we do this as
                        long as there remains a place and time <emph>to</emph> do this, of course.
                        But where at least two are gathered in the name of challenging the world’s
                        premises, there remains, not a dangerously deluded hope for the future, but
                        the queer capacity of an at once posthuman and all-too-human experience that
                        offers a chance to redeem the everyday nature of our lives as a way of
                        addressing the otherworldly stakes of our existence. As Tony Kushner writes
                        in the Afterword to his monumental <title level="m">Angels in
                            America</title> (1995), “Marx was right: The smallest indivisible human
                        unit is two people, not one; one is a fiction. From such nets of souls
                        societies, the social world, human life springs” (158). When Shelley
                        envisioned a maximum of five readers for <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title> (1820), one responds either with, “Poor showing,” or,
                        “Good start.”</p>
                    <p>The compulsion to return to Shelley’s last poem begins, of course, with Mary
                        Shelley, whose editing of <title level="m">Posthumous Poems</title> (1824),
                        partly an act of impossible mourning, included a reading version culled from
                        the manuscript her husband left behind. That version, included largely
                        unchanged in her subsequent edition of <title level="m">The Poetical Works
                            of Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1839), remained authoritative until the
                        early 1960s, when G. M. Matthews and Donald H. Reiman revisited Mary’s
                        version in consultation with the original manuscript, now in the Bodleian,
                        to produce the text we now cite. Given the manuscript’s largely chaotic
                        shape (only the opening stanzas exist in a relatively fair copy state) these
                        were Herculean editing labors. T. S. Eliot called Shelley’s mind “in some
                        ways a very confused one,” but he thought <title level="m">The
                            Triumph</title> (1822) was the “greatest though unfinished” of Shelley’s
                        poems, “evidence not only of better writing than in any previous long poem,
                        but of greater wisdom” (90). Arguing that only finished works can legitimate
                        the apparent trajectory and philosophical system of a poet’s vision, Earl
                        Wasserman ends his monumental <title level="m">Shelley: A Critical
                            Reading</title> (1971) with <title level="m">Adonais</title> (1821),
                        Shelley’s self-proclaimed “highly wrought <emph>piece of art</emph>” (<title
                            level="m">Letters</title> 2: 294). Taking up readings of <title
                            level="m">Triumph</title>’s nod to a Dantesque eschatology (Timothy
                        Webb) and Petrarchan humanism (Desmond King-Hele), Angela Leighton finds in
                        the poem, “in spite of all its pessimism, a renewed confidence in the act of
                        writing as the only means of saving inspiration from that perfection which
                        is the poet’s loss,” a “prognosticated happy ending” (one remembers Robert
                        Browning’s point that Shelley would have found sympathy among the
                        Christians), a redemptive possibility that Harold Bloom or Richard Cronin,
                        also taken up by Leighton, read as a parody or obfuscation, respectively, of
                        any such ideal (Leighton 150–51).</p>
                    <p>The above responses reflect our longstanding habituation, first pushed by
                        Mary, to Percy as a second generation Romantic torn between skepticism and
                        idealism, undecided if he wanted to reform the world or get beyond it, which
                        tension reaches its highest pitch in <title level="m">Adonais</title> and
                        seems to get attenuated differently as Shelley moves on to <title level="m"
                            >The Triumph</title> where, as Balanchandra Rajan argues, Shelley,
                        despite more than likely intending to finish the poem, toys with what Rajan
                        calls the “form of the unfinished,” how the poem “movingly confesses [its]
                        inability to pronounce on its own nature” (209). An earlier study such as C.
                        E. Pulos’s <title level="m">The Deep Truth</title> (1954) mitigates this
                        ambivalence by reading Shelley as what Hugh Roberts calls a “progressively
                        more ‘idealist’ skeptic” (2). This mediation, symptomatic of a post-WWII
                        reclamation of Shelley’s reputation in the wake (for instance) of F. R.
                        Leavis’s attack on Shelley in <title level="m">Revaluation: Tradition and
                            Development in English Poetry</title> (1936), esteemed Shelley’s vatic
                        power and poetic talent, though with a deepening understanding of the
                        dangers and excesses of his political and aesthetic idealism. For Ross
                        Woodman in <title level="m">The Apocalyptic Vision of the Poetry of
                            Shelley</title> (1964), <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
                        presents an “Orphic vision of an annihilated world” (198), a mythopoeia that
                        for Harold Bloom in <title level="m">Shelley’s Mythmaking</title> (1959)
                        achieves its “final aspect” in “that the myth, and the myth’s maker, are
                        fully conscious of the myth’s necessary defeat” (275) by existence itself.
                        This Shelleyan apocalypse without millennium at once haunts and anticipates
                        deconstruction’s influence on Romantic studies, on full display in Bloom’s
                        1979 <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism</title>, which contained
                        Derrida’s and de Man’s landmark essays on <title level="m">The
                            Triumph</title> . De Man’s essay in particular attends to the poem’s
                        fragmented, inchoate form as a sign of how the weave all human endeavor
                        remains frayed by history, a rather telling sign of both Shelley’s and our
                        crisis-ridden times. How and where does one now situate Shelley’s disastrous
                        text as a text both about and <emph>of</emph> disaster, as Chris Washington
                        explores in his essay for this issue? The poem’s incessant questioning of
                        origins and identities, what Tilottama Rajan after de Man calls its
                        attention to “questioning, doubting, and emergent knowledge,” becomes
                        symptomatic of what she calls Shelley’s “purgatorial imagination . . . that
                        derives its power from the very manner in which it finds itself containing
                        the reality that is to deconstruct it” (<title level="m">Dark

                    <p>Deconstruction partly urged a revaluation of the epistemology and ontology of
                        Shelley’s formal strategies. For William Keach in <title level="m">Shelley’s
                            Style</title> (1984), Shelley’s verse, particularly its complex use of
                        rhyme in <title level="m">Triumph</title>, constitutes the productively
                        ambivalent form of his thought, not as philosophical system but as
                        open-ended intellectual (r)evolution. For Ronald Tetreault in <title
                            level="m">The Poetry of Life: Shelley and Literary Form</title> (1987),
                        the poem’s “desire for a reassuring certitude with which anxiety [for a
                        center] can be mastered” necessarily fails, but still with the confidence
                        that “even in an age of deconstruction poetry may still teach us how to
                        live” (257). Perhaps above all, critical responses to the poem thereafter
                        had to contend with what was seen, either generatively or critically, as
                        deconstruction’s missed encounter with history. Reading de Man reading
                        Shelley reading, Orrin Wang (1996) calls <title level="m">Triumph</title> a
                        “disfigured monument” poised at the “limit of its historical and critical
                        consciousness,” unable to “resolve . . . the final form of its narration”
                        (64). For Hugh Roberts in <title level="m">Shelley and the Chaos of
                            History</title> (1997), Lucretian materialism offered Shelley a new
                        model of history and its political rhythms as a ceaseless becoming that
                        reflects the “entropic and negentropic aspects of evolutionary process”
                        (406), which Amanda Jo Goldstein’s <title level="m">Sweet Science</title>
                        (2017) reads in terms of <title level="m">Triumph</title>’s complex
                        reciprocity between life and its symbolic manifestations, thus offering a
                        Shelleyan biopolitics of life. In <title level="m">Shelley and the
                            Revolutionary Sublime</title> (2005) Cian Duffy discusses how the poem’s
                        representation of post-revolutionary change, influenced by aesthetic
                        theories of the sublime, questions the failure and subsequent deadlock of
                        imaginative will in transforming the political and historical landscape. And
                        in what is arguably the most significant single study of Shelley’s writing
                        in the past three decades, <title level="m">Shelley’s Process</title>
                        (1988), Jerrold Hogle reads the conflict of interpretations generated by
                        this ineluctable traversal between art, life, and history as transference,
                        the nomadic principle of Shelley's aesthetics as history’s drive, most
                        powerfully in his final poem. In <title level="m">The Supplement of
                            Reading</title> (1990) Rajan reads this shifting principle of thought
                        and representation in <title level="m">Triumph</title> as neither loss nor
                        recovery: “Fading is not disappearance, but something more haunting: a
                        presence that cannot be located and yet cannot be definitively renamed as
                        absence so that we will cease searching for it” (347). William Ulmer (1990)
                        reads this lost object (that can’t quite be called “lost”) as the force of
                        eros behind Shelley’s politics and its idealism. Stuart Peterfreund (2002)
                        reads this longing for transcendence post-deconstructively as the latent if
                        unfulfilled spirit of Shelleyan verse, a potentiality Leighton targets as a
                        moving acknowledgement and commemoration of loss, which is for her the
                        poem’s “real triumph” (175).</p>
                    <p>History, love, loss: binding this dizzying array of readings is our desire to
                        know what Shelley might have thought, felt, and intended when writing his
                        final poem. Here I imagine what Walter Benjamin might have been thinking and
                        feeling when he wrote his late theses on history, as if to remind a world
                        that wasn’t listening why the very history that could consume us was also,
                        paradoxically, the one that mattered. Benjamin’s survival was rather more
                        precarious than Shelley’s. However, as if trapped within history’s
                        Janus-faced reality, realizing there could be no Archimidean point from
                        which to view and thus gain <emph>some</emph> kind of purchase on its
                        onslaught&#8212; on history itself&#8212;Shelley struggles to see and say
                        his way through to a different materiality of things, which struggle we find
                        ourselves in the midst of. In <title level="m">After Finitude</title>
                        Quentin Meillassoux contemplates the existence of what he terms the
                        “‘arche-fossil’ or ‘fossil-matter,’” which “indicat[es] the traces of past
                        life . . . but [also] materials indicating the existence of an ancestral
                        reality or event” (10), like the luminescence of a star reaching us after
                        billions of years of light travel. Ancestrality indicates a “world devoid of
                        humanity” (127), which for Meillassoux challenges “the idea according to
                        which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and
                        being, and never to either term considered apart from the other” (5), which
                        entails the Kantian idealism that we can think the <foreign xml:lang="de"
                            >Ding an sich</foreign> of being, but only from the perspective of
                        thought. </p>
                    <p>Wrestling thinking from being demands that we think a being beyond our
                        thought of being, on its own terms, as it were, which is to say prior to its
                        own “givenness.” In Meillassoux’s wording, this is to locate “that outside
                        which thought could explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
                        territory – of being entirely elsewhere” (7). Contemplating a thought beyond
                        correlation, and thus after finitude, in Washington’s powerful summation (in
                        another context), “reveals an aporia that exists in both philosophy and
                        science: our inability to account for a world outside of us without,
                        paradoxically, accounting for it” (450). Shelley’s earlier <title level="m"
                            >Queen Mab</title> (1813), attempting to account for the empiricism of
                        this ancestral temporality by taking its reader to the verges of the cosmos
                        and of Shelley’s idealism, tarries with this rift between being and thought,
                        yet remains within the hope of making one commensurate with the other. But
                        in <title level="m">Triumph</title> Shelley finds that being in the midst of
                        the everyday experience of history leaves him on the “foreign territory” of
                        an attempt to exist <emph>within</emph> a history always out of our reach
                        precisely <emph>because</emph> we exist in its midst. Thus abandoned, we are
                        left to express an “inability to account for a world outside of us without,
                        paradoxically, accounting for it.” We are also left with thought
                        alone&#8212;with the being <emph>of</emph> thought, which Shelley expresses
                        enigmatically as “thoughts which must remain untold” (<title level="m"
                            >Triumph</title> 21). To read Meillassoux perhaps somewhat differently,
                        the matter of history is the matter of ancestrality <emph>now</emph>, a
                        being within being that cannot be thought, but also a thought within being
                        that has a being of its own that cannot be thought. History itself
                            <emph>is</emph> the being Shelley needs to think his way into and out
                        of, without ever touching upon its foreign materiality in which he
                        nonetheless finds himself enmeshed. Accounting for this point resonates with
                        the following essays’ various points of entry: the “queerly erotic openness”
                        of Jacques Khalip’s last look, the “beyondness” of Libby Fay’s detached
                        attachment to/attached detachment of the sensuality of verse, the glimmering
                        phenomenality of Tres Pyle’s account of the poem as minor event, Chris
                        Washington’s exploration of the physical immateriality of light and love. </p>
                    <p>To move us toward a future of living on, with, and at the borders of history
                        is to dwell with what Denise Gigante calls Romanticism’s “uncontainable
                        vitality” (6), which at the same time expresses the killing moment of life’s
                        disposal, feeding upon itself as waste product, like the ruins of Saturn’s
                        temple in Keats’s revision of <title level="m">Hyperion</title> (1820) as
                            <title level="m">The Fall of Hyperion</title> (eventually published in
                        1856) and or Shelley’s chariot as it plows on remorselessly, senselessly,
                        irrevocably. At the end of <title level="m">Perestroika</title>, the second
                        half of Kushner’s <title level="m">Angels in America</title>, Prior Walter
                        is offered the Tome of Immobility, the promise of an eternal existence
                        without suffering. The Angel warns Prior that life has become a “habit,” the
                        result of which will be a devastation equal to Byron’s “Darkness.” Having
                        survived the devastation that was dealing with AIDS in Reagan’s newly
                        dawning America, his pre-Trump stab at Making America Great Again, Prior is
                        momentarily enticed. But to move deathwards toward no death is to give into
                        the defeat that the sheer lack of response to the dead and dying demands, or
                        rather quietly, implicitly, assumes. How to respond to the being of death
                        from within the living, a foreign territory that cannot be thought, although
                        death sure has its own thoughts on the matter. Which may be why Prior
                        embraces, however precariously, the promise of more life: <quote>

                        Shelley is momentarily stunned by the creatively melancholic vitality of
                        Keats’s decaying mind&#8212;the necrophagia of life feeding on itself. Left
                        among the living to lament, Shelley is like Urania, who in one of
                        Romanticism’s most freakishly gothic scenes attempts to revive her son’s
                        corpse by, according to the post-Oedipal logic of Shelley’s poem,
                        re-seducing him. Beware of mothers who fetishize life. According to
                        Shelley’s psychoanalysis of the circuit of creative desire, having killed
                        the thing she loved, the mother attempts to re-ingest it in a kiss&#8212;a
                        word, as Khalip’s paper reminds us&#8212;that fills the mouth with desire’s
                        lost object. In this scenario what refuses to cede its desire is not woman,
                        but desire itself, or rather desire minus desire&#8212;sheer drive, the
                        mindlessness of words, which needs no object and instead wanders aimlessly
                        but irrevocably in its aimlessness. Despite its seemingly transcendental
                        trajectory, the poem laments Absolute Spirit, its dark and fearful affect
                        materializing the move past the loss of a history left behind once and for
                        all. In <title level="m">Hellas</title> (1822) when Mahmud describes “This
                        firmament pavilioned upon chaos” (772), we’re taken back to the future of
                            <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, which finds Shelley already unable
                        to resolve the empirical with the transcendental and thus begins a move
                        toward something like a Deleuzian horizon that unfolds the transcendence of
                        empiricism, the restlessly moving still point at which experience at once
                        appears and vanishes.</p>
                    <p>Put another way, the spectacle of <title level="m">Adonais</title>&#8212;
                        which includes a necrophilic muse, a poet acting like St. Sebastian, and a
                        finish that smacks of Busby Berkley, in which the “white radiance of
                        Eternity” (463) smashes the “dome of many-coloured glass” (462)&#8212;is a
                        mere tryout for <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Here the
                        products of history are continually folded into a sheer visuality that at
                        once materializes and dematerializes our lives. Urania as desire becomes the
                        Shape all light and “fire for which all thirst” (485), not as lost object
                        but as sheer drive. Shelley awakens us to the performance of history itself,
                        in which we “pant,” “sink,” “tremble,” and “expire” on a daily basis (<title
                            level="m">Epipsychidion</title> 591). Here <title level="m"

                        fast-forwarded to versions that expose the insidious post-capitalist logic
                        of its visual and aural interpellation of our subjectivities, the endless
                        production and reproduction of perceptual information about the human
                        condition that leads us nowhere except along the infinite horizon of our
                        perpetual demise.<note place="foot" resp="author">I address these issues in

                    <p>In a brief, brilliant analysis of the aesthetic in Freud and Lacan, Alenka
                        Zupančič, addressing the difference between the uncanny and comedy, argues
                        that whereas the uncanny tarries with possibility of the lost object’s
                        return as desire, comedy “point[s] to the irreducible materiality of
                        nothing” (59), by which she means, not the naming of nothing as ‘something’
                        in order to give it symbolic consistency, but rather the
                            “<emph>remainder</emph> of nothing, . . . nothing as insisting/emerging
                        in the real, while being deprived precisely of its symbolic support” (60).
                        This leaves nothing as a “‘mere hole,’ which is to say&#8212;an object. It
                        is a nothing that, literally, remains (there) to be seen” (71). Like the
                        gaze that cannot see itself, as Zupančič notes, thought cannot think itself,
                        hence, perhaps, for Shelley it “must remain untold.” For Zupančič this
                        paradox speaks to the “vitalism of the death drive. That is to say, the
                        vitalism of the internal <emph>contradiction</emph> of (human)
                            <emph>life</emph> itself. Far from referring to something in us that
                        ‘wants to die,’ or that aims at death and destruction, the Lacanian notion
                        of the death drive refers to an excess of life itself . . . the reason that
                        the subject can never be reduced to the horizon of her death” (74). The
                        death drive indicates not “that something of our life will go on living on
                        its own when we die” but rather “that <emph>something of our life lives on
                            its own as we speak</emph>,” the “logic of <emph>constitutive
                            dislocation</emph> (as immanent nothing)” (75).</p>
                    <p>In the last years before my mother passed away, just shy of 91, she would
                        repeatedly ask me, “Why am I still here?,” as if to rebut Carlotta’s defiant
                        anthem, “I’m Still Here,” from Stephen Sondheim’s <title level="m"
                            >Follies</title> (1971), for me one of the most moving and painful
                        evocations of what it means to risk love in response to the nothingness of
                        loss, and thus to risk the nothingness of love itself. My response: “I have
                        no idea.” And at that we would both laugh. She felt&#8212;she knew&#8212;she
                        was taking up space and time, and witnessing the reduced habits of her daily
                        existence, I could not disagree. On that count we were brutally, fatally,
                        happily frank with one another. I spent her final hours at her bedside in
                        the company of my man, a nurse, her son-in-law, all three of us tacitly
                        agreed on the need for and relief of acute palliation. As she drifted off
                        and away, he clinically, quietly, beautifully mapped out for me the
                        contraction and departure of life and warmth from her withered
                        extremities&#8212;sites of impossible contemplation&#8212;to a place I
                        imagine reduced to a still point somewhere around her heart and lungs. When
                        the departure was complete, and because through her eyes I learned how film
                        was one of the few ways to transform life’s dull round, I though of the end
                        of <title level="m">Adonais</title> re-imagined as the ending of Spielberg’s
                            <title level="m">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</title> (1977) when
                        the spaceship contracts to a still point in the sky, then shoots across the
                        horizon, far beyond the rainbow where suffering, decrepitude, hunger, and
                        intolerance plague what we so quaintly call the human condition. Unable ever
                        to know where life went at that moment, I also experienced what I imagine
                        Shelley imagined in his encounter with what “remained” of Rousseau, or what
                        Meillassoux means by an encounter with the fossil matter of ancestrality,
                        though not as Meillassoux intended it. Living past hope, contemplating an
                        “inability to account for a world outside of us without, paradoxically,
                        accounting for it,” my first thought, which is to say the thought that
                        emerges only once the dust and ash have settled, was: “I’m still here.” That
                        is to say, I felt “the vitalism of the internal <emph>contradiction</emph>
                        of (human) <emph>life</emph> itself.”</p>
                    <p>When Shelley, who drowned in the Bay of Lerici with <title level="m">The
                            Triumph of Life</title> unfinished, decided to ask, then, “What is
                        life?,” he was asking of a future whose shadows the poem casts upon our
                        present: Why are you here? Why are you doing this? What is the importance,
                        and devastation (again, pace Benjamin) of even asking the question in the
                        first place? Are you reading me? Do you care? Does it matter? Yet to mind
                        the gaps in the representation of historical reality&#8212;to miss something
                        another human being said (in this case, a rather capable poet)&#8212;might
                        just tell us something about our present (in)capacity <emph>to</emph> say.
                        When de Man drew our attention to the fact that Shelley’s dead and decaying
                        body, inscribed at the end of Shelley’s last manuscript, was as essential to
                        our understanding of the poem as the poem itself, he reminded us of what
                        still needed to be heard. To which I would add: what needs to be
                            <emph>felt</emph> about our present state of being, to which Khalip,
                        Fay, Pyle, Washington, and Wang remain exquisitely attuned by turning from
                        spectators to actors in the scene of the poem’s life that is the remainder
                        of nothing. How they express the soul of our intellectual lives feels rather
                        more urgent than it did at the time Khalip and I first libated. Let’s call
                        it a call simply but urgently to indulge in doing what we do: restlessly
                        examine the interpretive possibilities of responding to a great artist’s
                        response to the world, with the understanding that no one might care. As I
                        listen with careful and troubled attention to the question of what
                            <emph>should</emph> matter in our present climate, I’m compelled to ask,
                        why not this, at this present time? It can’t be any more consequential or
                        inconsequential. And now I leave my contributors to voice the virtual
                        reality of what it might mean and feel like to exist at once within and past
                        the Anthropocene. To them I say and thank God or the gods or whomever or
                        whatever might have orchestrated the situation to which this critical folly
                        responds: I’m glad you’re here – still. </p>
