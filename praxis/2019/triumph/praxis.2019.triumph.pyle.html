            <p class="noCount">This is an essay about a minor event in a major poem. I hope to demonstrate how the
               minor event of a detached poetic image offers us a way of understanding what is <em>in back of</em> or <em>behind</em> the proto-cinematic energies on display in <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (1822). And I am also interested in exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor”
               lyricism of our own contemporary cinema open a means of beholding the image-event
               in Shelley’s poem? If this second possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible
               to discern in these past poetic and present cinematic images a form of historical
               “circuitry” that reveals something about the agency or “currency” of images. I want
               to propose that the currency of the poetic image is best understood by what Roland
               Barthes identified as the <em>obtus</em> or “third meaning,” a glimmering residue of the stilled cinematic image that offers
               the point of contact for the current that circulates between the literary and cinematic
               modes of image production.</p>

                  <p>If every essay we write has a back-story, we usually have the good taste for it to
                     “remain untold” even when, as in Percy Shelley’s case, it might keep us “as wakeful
                     as the stars that gem / The cone of night” (21–23).

                              </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All references to Percy Shelley’s poetry are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s Norton
                              edition of Shelley’s Poetry and Prose. Further references to Shelley’s poetry and
                              prose are to this edition. On the speaker’s withholding of “thoughts,” it’s relevant
                              to invoke Walter Benjamin’s account to Gretel Adorno of his “holding” “certain thoughts”
                              “safe with” himself and “yes, even from” himself until 1940 when the “war and the
                              constellation it brought with it” prompted him to compose them. These “certain thoughts”
                              are his 
                              “Theses on the Concept of History”
                              (cited by David L. Clark in 
                              …</span></div>
                     </div> But given that this is an essay that is very much about the “back-story,” I will take
                     the liberty of beginning it by telling my own. When Joel Faflak first wrote me about
                     the MLA panel for which this essay originated, he asked cryptically if I wanted to
                     revisit “our favorite poem.” I was struck by the audacity of the invitation: we are
                     rarely asked—at least in an institutionally authorized setting such as the Modern
                     Language Association—to identify “our favorite poem,” much less to speak about how
                     it strikes us and moves us. But my respect for Faflak’s scholarship is such that I
                     agreed immediately to the invitation; and that agreement prompted me in turn to reflect
                     on how I might extract “my favorite poem” and from what catalogue of favorites it
                     might be drawn. I understood Faflak not to be soliciting a talk about a poem that
                     was necessarily a significant achievement or a decisive event; rather, I thought he
                     was making a less critical and more intimate query into “my favorite things,” something
                     like “raindrops on roses,”—those poems, in other words, that whether major or minor
                     become precious to us, even indispensable. Given that it was Joel Faflak making this
                     request, I assumed he wanted me to select such a poem from English Romanticism. I
                     reflected on my usual romantic suspects, poems that I feel are necessary to my being—those
                     poems about mountains or birds—before I realized what I had long known: my favorite
                     poem was <em>The Triumph of Life</em> (1822). It was only then that I revisited—and actually read carefully—Faflak’s initial
                     request and realized I never had a choice in the matter of favorite: I had been assigned
                     to write about <em>The Triumph of Life</em> because it was already known in advance to be my favorite. I am happy to know that
                     there are others quite like me, singled out for the great gift of this poem, a gift
                     that can feel every bit a curse.</p>
               </div>
               <p>Shortly after this recognition, I read Faflak’s astonishing essay on the “vitally
                  cinematic” nature of Shelley’s final poem and immediately discovered there the most
                  succinct account to date of what is at stake for Shelley’s poetics of the image, one
                  that is not merely a reflection of its historical moment but its projection of a futurity:
                  “<em>The Triumph of Life</em> reflects a society of the spectacle still in visual flux. But it predicts a history
                  fascinated by the production of images that body forth life, then compromise any return
                  to life itself” (
                  “Dancing”
                  168). Faflak’s principal point of reference for his re-reading of <em>The Triumph</em> is Lars von Trier’s <em>Dancer in the Dark</em> (2000), a film which invokes and even inhabits <em>The Sound of Music</em> (1965) with the director’s special form of lovingly perverse devastation. This constellation
                  of ironies and overdetermined coincidences prompted me to wonder how a poem such as
                  <em>The Triumph of Life</em> can qualify as a “favorite”? If <em>The Triumph</em> is the final poetic gift Shelley bestowed on futurity, it is most certainly not delivered
                  in a “brown paper package tied up with string”; and it certainly has none of the palliative
                  or compensatory qualities that singers from Julie Andrews to Bjork have invoked with
                  “my favorite things.” Indeed, it’s a poem that seems likely to undo every happy item
                  in that song’s catalogue of favorites and would seem one of the <em>least</em> likely candidates for a favorite poem. I wondered what might make <em>The Triumph of Life</em> not only an important poem for Shelley studies, for the field, even for the profession,
                  but also my own personal favorite?</p>
               <p>There are many political, theoretical, rhetorical, disciplinary, and biographical
                  aspects of this astonishing text that make it such a beacon in Romantic studies: it
                  seems to be one of those poems that simply won’t be done with us, a sprawling remnant
                  too relentlessly demanding to be answered once and for all, a hallucinatory thrill-ride
                  that promises or threatens to take us far beyond its own vanishing point. It’s a poem
                  that conveys both the originary fiat of the sun “springing forth” and the trippy “perpetual
                  flow” of visions “ever new,” while making the conveyances and the conveyed an urgent
                  matter of political and poetic history. In fact I feel authorized to read the famous
                  opening lines—“Swift as a spirit hastening to his task / Of glory and of good” (1–2)—as
                  referring not to the sunrise, which takes its own sweet time, but to the poem itself.
                  Still, these features of the poem, however exhilarating and exacting, are not the
                  aspects of literature we typically characterize as endearing or intimate. And as necessary
                  and demanding as I find these defining features of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, they are not the qualities that make this daunting and undoing poem so precious
                  to me. The answer to the initiating query—what makes <em>The Triumph of Life</em> my <em>favorite</em> poem?—can be traced to the personally arresting effect of an accidental but notable
                  aesthetic event.</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Folded inside one of those sprawling <em>terza rima</em> verse sentences in the introductory proem to Shelley’s <em>The Triumph of Life</em> are the following lines: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they
                     glimmer” (32–33).

                              readers. Jacques Khalip’s beautiful “admission” of his long-standing relationship
                              with the third-to-last line of the poem speaks directly to my own connection to the
                              poem: “I admit that for years, I have been perplexed by the minimal yet arresting
                              power of ‘as if that look must be the last,’ to the point where the whole apparatus
                              of the poem dissolves for me into something like the floaters that Mary saw in the
                              manuscript. The words, however, have never sounded especially elegiac to me but rather

                     </div> Though I have extracted the lines in the form of a grammatically complete sentence,
                     they serve in fact as part of a dependent clause, the minor vehicle to a simile which
                     is part of an elaborate phenomenological figure and a major interpretive crux of the
                     poem. The extracted lines themselves are not obscure. Stuart Sperry has suggested
                     that adding a comma after “hills” makes the lines “intelligible,” but I believe that
                     the absence of the comma extends what we might call the “glimmer effect” to the demonstrative
                     pronoun: “evening hills <em>they</em> glimmer” (181).

                     things are—as always in Shelley—immediately complicated given that this glimmering <em>veil</em> of evening light is a figure for transparency. Here is the extracted image in its

                     </blockquote> I still find Paul de Man’s rendering of the significance of the passage to be the
                     most acute account of the complications of the passage and its implications: the “clarity”
                     is “like that of a veil drawn over a darkening surface, a description which necessarily
                     connotes covering and hiding, even if the veil is said to be ‘of light’” (
                     “Shelley Disfigured”
                      106). For de Man this passage is part of a textual “knot” that by way of an echoing
                     “glimmer,” repeated by the figure of Rousseau almost 400 lines later, “unites the
                     poet-narrator to Rousseau” and establishes a principal site of the poem’s treatment
                     of “knowledge, oblivion, and desire” (106, 105, 107). In fact, the passage can be
                     said to achieve the status of a de Manian “allegory of reading”: “Light covers light,
                     trance covers slumber and creates conditions of optical confusion that resemble nothing
                     as much as the experience of trying to read <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, as its meaning glimmers, hovers, and wavers, but refuses to yield the clarity it
                     keeps announcing” (106).</p>
               </div>
               <p>I regard this sentence from 
                  “Shelley Disfigured”
                  to be an allegory of what it means to read de Man and his own “altogether tantalizing
                  . . . play of veiling and unveiling” (106). But though it is as seductively beautiful
                  as the poem it interprets, de Man’s account of the early passage in the proem of <em>The Triumph</em> identifies an “optical confusion” that seems unwarranted by the lines themselves.
                  The “transparent . . . scene” and the “veil of light” both describe the “strange trance”
                  that “grew” over the “fancy” of Shelley’s speaker; but what is perhaps most “strange”
                  about the “trance” is not the “confusion” it generates but the weird fact that the
                  trance changes nothing at all: the speaker merely knows what he had already “felt”
                  (“the freshness of that dawn,” “bathed in same cold dew,” etc.). The “scene”—the very
                  scene he is witnessing—simply “came through” clearly. If the proem begins and ends
                  with two major events—the “springing forth” of the Sun and the “rolling” of “a Vision”—the
                  only occurrence in the final four stanzas is something that doesn’t even happen to
                  the speaker in the poem: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills <em>they</em> glimmer.” Though the lines may be <em>positionally</em> important insofar as they establish the phenomenological conditions for the “Vision”
                  to be “rolled” on the speaker’s “brain,” they are themselves poetic non-events, especially
                  when measured against the scale of the universal history that unfolds in the “Vision”
                  itself, the triumphal pageant of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. These first forty lines are, after all, mere back story.</p>

                              term: “By [the sentence image] I understand something different from the combination
                              of a verbal sequence and a visual form. The power of the sentence-image can be expressed
                              in sentences from a novel, but also in forms of theatrical representations or cinematic
                              montage or the relationship between the said and the unsaid in a photograph” (45–46).
                              If Rancière inaugurates this mode of inter-art “assembling” with his notion of the

                     the relentless and even delirious movement of Shelley’s verse: clauses opening upon
                     new clauses, similes in which vehicle overtakes tenor, figures sprawling across stanzas,
                     all breathlessly enjambed.

                              versifying, especially the poet’s deployment of terza rima in The Triumph which, according
                              to Keach, displays “a compositional intelligence fully in touch with the arbitrariness
                              of its expressive medium yet capable of shaping that arbitrariness into, as well as
                              according to, precisely provisional ‘constraints of meaning’” (188).</span></div>
                     </div> That we can detach this image from the course of the poem doesn’t substantially affect
                     the poem’s interpretation: nothing in <em>The Triumph</em> hinges on these two lines. Rather, Shelley’s poem offers this glimmering sentence-image
                     in the manner of an arresting if minor detail in a painting, one which has little
                     to do with its compositional arrangement or symbolic meaning but upon which we might
                     inexplicably dwell, like the delicate stroke of lightning drawn in the corner of Giorgione’s <em>The Tempest</em> (circa 1506). The sentence-image I’ve extracted from Shelley doesn’t undermine the
                     figure of a “transparent” “shade;” and it suits the poem’s tone and tenor. But to
                     me this sentence image also seems to <em>belong elsewhere and on its own</em>. This is the case in part because the image is invoked as something not necessarily
                     experienced by the speaker: the feature of the veiled illumination does not belong
                     to the speaker’s catalogue of observations but may merely be a recognizable aesthetic
                     occurrence, a glimmer that is given or expected to occur under certain atmospheric
                     conditions. Withdrawn from the longer passage, the extracted passage offers a discrete
                     reflection on the temporality of images, the particular “when-ness” of a “veil of
                     light.”

                     and solicited me in the process, the minor event of an image that arrests us without

                  the minor event of this detached image offers us a way of understanding what is <em>in back of</em> or <em>behind</em> the proto-cinematic energies on display in <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. But I am also interested in exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor” lyricism
                  of our own contemporary cinema open a means of beholding the image-event in Shelley’s
                  poem? If this second possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible to discern in
                  these past poetic and present cinematic images a form of historical “circuitry” that
                  reveals something about the agency or “currency” of images. I want to propose that
                  the currency of the poetic image is best understood by what Roland Barthes identified
                  as the <em>obtus</em> or “The Third Meaning,” a glimmering residue of the stilled cinematic image that
                  offers the point of contact for the current that circulates between the literary and
                  cinematic modes of image production.</p>

                     </div> For an understanding of the “detachability” of the image, I turn to Jean-Luc Nancy’s
                     meditations on <em>The Ground of the Image</em>. However unlikely it may seem, Walter Pater’s notion of “appreciations” suggests
                     a mode of discerning the force and mobility of literary and visual images. And finally
                     Deleuze and Guattari’s notions of the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mineur</span> and the assemblage in their book on Kafka suggest a way of thinking how image-connections
                     work. In the third section of the essay, I turn to <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> (1998), Todd Haynes’s ambitious film about “glam rock” as both a consonant cultural
                     text and a methodological guide for how we might use the currency of the “stilled”
                     or arrested image to extract Shelley’s poetry of the “minor event.” I conclude the
                     essay with a brief thought experiment which links the minor cinema of the third meaning
                     to <em>The Triumph</em> in order to ask how this circuitry of images, simultaneously vibrant and beyond life,
                     might open itself to the Deleuzian <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mineur</span>.</p>

               <p>My thinking about the poetic and cinematic meditation on the image is made possible
                  by this array of theorists and poets and filmmakers who may share nothing more methodologically
                  than a keen eye for detail and the apprehension of the minor event. If this poetic,
                  cinematic, and theoretical constellation “lights up” for us to behold it—if it “glimmers”
                  or “glitters”—then it might also offer us what Benjamin called a “historical construction”:
                  this would not be another historical narrative, and not even a “counter-narrative,”
                  but arrested and extracted dialectical images which, behind and beyond any story,
                  offer a new way to think the sky map of “eternal history” as the “eternity of its
                  transience” (407).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">II. How to Stay Minor</span></h2>
               <p>It’s harder than one might think. A <em>minor</em> event seems like a contradiction in terms: the moment a literary or visual image
                  or textual passage achieves the status of an <em>event</em>, it will have passed from its position as minor, lesser, or subordinate to the level
                  of the major or the principal. I think we can assert with confidence that the hermeneutic
                  project in literary and cultural interpretation is predicated on the achievement of
                  the “major.” However divergent in implication or application, every influential critical
                  undertaking I know of, belonging to critics as diverse as Auerbach, de Man, Greenblatt,
                  Spivak, Žižek, involves some effort to isolate the unsuspecting detail or figure,
                  unearth its hidden significance, and thereby move from the minor to the major. De
                  Man’s 
                  “Semiology and Rhetoric”
                  offers a paradigmatic example of a critic attending to what may have appeared to the
                  many trained and thoughtful readers before him to be the most insignificant distinction
                  between a rhetorical and a literal question, only to learn that the “innocent-looking”
                  exploration of a minor textual undecidabilty results in the “rhetorical suspension
                  of logic and vertiginous possibilities of referential aberration.” “It turns out,”
                  as de Man often puts it, that in “our” close philological scrutiny of these apparently
                  minor rhetorical details, “we are in fact playing for very sizeable stakes” (10).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>But what does it look like if we keep the <em>stakes</em> “minor”? My thinking about the minor event is prompted by Benjamin’s declaration in
                     his third thesis on the concept of history: “The chronicler who narrates events without
                     distinguishing between major and minor ones acts in accord with the following truth:
                     nothing that has ever happened should be regarded as lost to history” (390). It’s
                     easy to overlook the fact that Benjamin is making the case <em>for</em> the narration of minor events, especially since nothing feels <em>minor</em> about the 
                     “Theses on the Concept of History”
                      and the “state of emergency” in which they were written: those are indeed “very sizeable
                     stakes” (392). And the essay’s major declarations are the most memorable and most
                     cited: “there is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of
                     barbarism,” “the historical materialist . . . remains in control of his powers, man
                     enough to blast open the continuum of history,” “What we call progress is the <em>storm</em> (of history),” the “one single catastrophe” (396, 392). And for his agents of historical
                     redemption, Benjamin invokes major theological figures: the “Angel of History,” the
                     Antichrist and the Messiah, Judgment Day. Moreover, for his notion of historical redemption,
                     Benjamin uses the theologically charged <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Erlösung</span> rather than the more prosaic <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Einlösung</span>, the “cashing in” or redemption value of deposits or vouchers. Nevertheless, this
                     minor strain in Benjamin’s theses has not gone unnoticed. Elsewhere, Jacques Khalip
                     and I have invoked Werner Hamacher’s account of Benjaminian redemption as what Hamacher
                     calls “unactualized possibilities of that which is past: the unfinished, the failed,
                     the thwarted” (40). If Benjamin’s conception of history is more <em>kairological</em> than chronological, his object of its redemption is reclaiming the lost currency of
                     the minor event. “If the concept of redemption points towards a theology,” Hamacher
                     writes, “then this is not a straightforwardly Judeo-Christian theology, but rather
                     a theology of the missed or distorted—hunchbacked—possibilities, a theology of missed,
                     distorted or hunchbacked time” (40).

                     Benjamin’s effort to “make minor” the notion of redemption and the theological structure
                     from which he extracts it. If, as Benjamin continues, “our coming was expected on
                     earth,” it is expected “like <em>every</em> generation that preceded us”: it is both always expected and it may always fail to
                     arrive (390). Moreover, the “messianic power” with which we’ve been endowed is, as
                     Michael Levine has stressed in his fine book with this title, <em>A Weak Messianic Power</em> [<span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">eine schwache messianische Kraft</span>]. It is this “weak” or minor power—what with perfect pitch Amanda Jo Goldstein calls
                     a “slight susceptibility” (163)—that allows us to catch what Benjamin calls the “sun
                     rising in the sky of history” not at daybreak but by way of the “secret heliotropism”
                     of flowers, the most “inconspicuous of all transformations” (390).

                              a “messenger.”</span></div>
                     </div> “Every second,” writes Benjamin in thesis “B,” is “the small gateway in time” through
                     which this “weak messianic power” “might enter” (397). For Levine, the “secret agreement”
                     that is always in effect between past generations and the present is not a pact but
                     an appointment or a rendezvous, one which may just as easily be missed as kept. The <em>event</em> for Benjamin is not the historical occurrence, not the <em>what</em> that happened but the “image” projected from the past that may—or may not—be “caught”
                     as it passes through the “sky of history,” both when the sun is rising and when it
                     has set and left us with our shifting constellations in the night sky. “The true image
                     of the past flits by,” writes Benjamin in the fifth thesis: “the past can be seized
                     as an image that flashes up at the moment of its recognizability, and is never seen
                     again” (390).

                  “Paralipomena”
                  406). But if the truth of history is not its sequential narrative but its composition
                  as images that coalesce in a constellation, this implies that images must be independent
                  of any narrative sequence or at least extractable from the course of empirical events.
                  Jean-Luc Nancy identifies this “extractability” as the “essential” feature of the
                  image: he calls it the image’s “distinction” (1). The image, writes Nancy, “must be
                  detached, placed outside and before one’s eyes, . . . and it must be different from
                  the thing. The image is a thing that is not the thing: it distinguishes itself from
                  it, essentially” (2). According to Nancy, the “image is always sacred,” “set aside,
                  removed, cut off” (1). Sacred but decisively <em>not</em> religious, which Nancy <em>opposes</em> to the sacred (1). For Nancy, the image as “the distinct stands apart from the world
                  of things considered as a world of availability” and is “withdrawn” from utility or
                  “has a completely different use” (2). In other words, this is the image’s sacred “redemption
                  value,” a marking or a stigma which—withheld from any community of faith—exerts a
                  force: the image “pulls and <em>draws</em>, . . . it <em>extracts</em> something, an intimacy, a force” (4). The force of the image has nothing to do with
                  what it represents; rather, the image for Nancy <em>is</em> this force: “this intimate force is not ‘represented’ by the image, but the image
                  is it, the image activates it, draws it and withdraws it, extracts it by withholding
                  it, and it is with this force that the image touches us” (5).</p>
               <p>These features of the image—its extractability, its intimate force, its sacred “distinction”—are
                  not, according to Nancy, limited to its visual properties: “the visual image plays
                  the role of a model” for the extractable force of the image; but the “image is also
                  musical, poetic, even tactile, olfactory or gustatory, kinaesthetic, and so on” (4).
                  Perhaps this is what makes the sentence-image I have extracted from <em>The Triumph</em> so “touching” and so definitive: withdrawn from the world of events—the events of
                  the world and the events of the poem—<em>my</em> image is itself a “glimmering” “veil of light” “<em>drawn</em>” but not represented or representing, itself a force which comes from nowhere or,
                  as Nancy claims for all images, “comes from the sky—not the heavens, which are religious,
                  but from the skies, a term proper to painting” (5). “When a veil of light is drawn
                  / O’er evening hills they glimmer” is a poetic image which invokes the visual as the
                  “model” for its own workings. It is the minor event of the image as such, the “order”
                  of the image.</p>
               <p>Once we have grasped the image as something to be drawn and withdrawn, distinct, extractable,
                  sacred and redeemable, those of us motivated by Benjamin’s model of history must ask
                  how a “constellation” comes into existence or, perhaps more precisely, how one beholds
                  a constellation of images which was always present in “the eternal lamp” of history.
                  At the most basic level, what connects one image to another if not narrative causality
                  or sequentiality? If the relationship between images is no longer a matter of causality
                  or sequence or mimesis, why does <em>this</em> one image connect with <em>that</em> one? How does something as complex and recognizable as a <em>constellation</em> of images come to be formed? How might we determine that a particular arrangement
                  of images is a genuine constellation and not a mere asterism, or conveniently recognizable
                  pattern of images? Benjamin doesn’t seem to imply that a constellation of images is
                  solely the fictive projection of a percipient-beholder of sheerly random and contingent
                  pulses of light and sensation. Perhaps, then, history’s event-images have their own
                  agency or, more precisely, possess their own <em>currency</em>?</p>
               <p>A “currency” of the image seems the most appropriate way to understand Benjamin’s
                  notion of the constellation and the potential for an historical “redemption” of event-images
                  that “may be separated” by “thousands of years.” Perhaps it is no accident that, according
                  to the <em>OED</em>, each of the principal “current” meanings of the words “currency” and “current” had
                  come into circulation by the time of Romanticism’s appearance: 1) currency as the
                  “time during which something is current,” something like Benjamin’s “now-time” [<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jetzeit</span>]; 2) currency as the “medium of exchange” or “the circulating medium,” that which
                  establishes an object’s “redemption value”; 3) currency as the fact or quality of
                  being current; and 4) “current” as “the name given to the apparent transmission or
                  ‘flow’ of electrical force through a conducting body.” For Benjamin the “the dialectical
                  image is an occurrence of ball lightning [<span class="foreign" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kugelblitz</span>] that runs across the whole horizon of the past” (403). An image’s currency is that
                  which allows it to pass through and connect to another “conducting body” and which
                  makes it susceptible to a “now-time” in which it may be redeemed. For Shelley that
                  faculty for redemption is the imagination which in <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (published posthumously in 1844) he defines as “the <em>perception</em> of value” (510; emphasis added). An image’s currency may circulate invisibly for
                  epochs until it is clandestinely plugged in to the present with what Shelley, also
                  in <em>Defence</em>, calls its “electric life” (535). I’m interested in exploring the currency of images
                  for the minor events they offer, the currency of their connections and the minor historical
                  “back-ways” they light up, mostly hidden and often obscure, “glimmering” “veils of
                  light” “drawn” across the sky.</p>
               <p>If we are not accustomed to thinking of Pater alongside such figures as Benjamin or
                  Nancy, the mode of aesthetic criticism Pater undertakes in <em>The Renaissance</em> (1873) offers an example of the kind of force or charge I am describing. Pater’s
                  aesthetic critic “regards all the objects with which he has to do, all works of art,
                  and the fairer forms of nature and human life, as powers or forces producing pleasurable
                  sensations, each of a more or less peculiar or unique kind” (xx). Pater devotes himself
                  to identifying and discerning the particular “powers or forces” of each image or text
                  he is summoned to examine: his project is to locate that “active principle” of a text
                  which has “crystallized” in the painting or the poem. “Sometimes fusing and transforming
                  entire compositions” and “sometimes, as if at random depositing a fine crystal here
                  or there,” this “active principle”—which is not a theme or a form or a genre—animates
                  or charges the image (xxii). Few would accuse Pater of historicism; and the “studies”
                  in <em>The Renaissance</em> “trace” the “active principle” or current in an historically and culturally disparate
                  constellation of pictures, stories, poems, and criticism that connects Heloise and
                  Abelard to Winckelman and Goethe.</p>
               <p>The currency of the image—what Pater might identify as its animating principle—is
                  not the primary intended or symbolic meaning of the image but closer to what Barthes
                  describes as its “image-residue” or “third meaning.” In his 
                  “Research Notes on Several Eisenstein Stills,”
                  Barthes begins by pointing at an image from <em>Ivan the Terrible</em> (1944) —the young tsar being showered with gold—and immediately distinguishes “three
                  levels of meaning”: first, the level of “information” or “<em>communication</em>,” amenable to a “primary semiotics”; and second, the symbolic level where “referential,”
                  stylistic, iconic, historical, and ideological symbolisms can be discerned (42). “This
                  second level, in its totality,” writes Barthes, “is that of <em>signification</em>. Its mode of analysis would be a more highly elaborated semiotics than the first,”
                  the mode of semiotic analysis with which he had been most identified and that had
                  he done perhaps the most to refine (42). “The third meaning,” then, derives from the
                  residue or leftovers of the first two levels, something detachable in that particular
                  image that eludes semiotics and something from which Barthes says he “cannot detach”
                  (42). <em>Looking</em> at the image, Barthes <em>reads</em> the “third meaning:” “I read, I receive (probably straight off, in fact) a third
                  meaning, erratic yet evident and persistent” (42). No longer ideological, historical,
                  symbolic, or referential, this third meaning, in fact, does not really belong to the
                  domain of meaning at all but is experienced as <em>passing from</em> communicative or symbolic or ideological meaning on its way to the “<em>obtuse</em>” (44). Without abandoning what Barthes calls the “good faith” of the referent or
                  the sense of narration, the “obtuse” or “third” meaning is that feature or property
                  of <em>some</em> images that “appears ‘in excess,’” writes Barthes, “as a supplement my intellection
                  cannot quite absorb, a meaning both persistent and fugitive, apparent and evasive”
                  (44). The third or obtuse meaning generated in these precious images elicits what
                  he identifies, in his own quotation marks, as “a poetic apprehension” (43).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>It is fascinating to watch Barthes cast about for the best way to describe the occasional
                     and fleeting appearance of the third meaning, variously identified as a “blurring”
                     of meaning, an “accent,” the emergence of a fold or crease, “a gash from which meaning
                     is expunged,” an “anaphoric gesture without significant content” (56). It calls to
                     mind the many “likenesses” which Shelley invokes in his <em>Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</em> (1817) in order to signify the apprehension of beauty, as if to demonstrate that an
                     infinite likeness and similitude is the very mode of beauty’s sensible appearances
                     and its worldly consequences. The “obtuse meaning,” concludes Barthes, “inevitably
                     appears as a luxury, an expenditure without exchange” (57). If Georges Bataille’s
                     principle of expenditure is invoked here—and elsewhere in the essay Barthes refers
                     explicitly to Bataille—it is a much gentler variation, one without sacrificial mutilation
                     or rhetorical aggression, what we might call “minor Bataille.”

                     Here as elsewhere, he is prompted to move from an act of apprehension to the mobilization
                     of a new “practice”: “a new—rare—practice affirmed against a majority practice” (56).
                     Though this vision of a practice emerging from the “third” or “obtuse” meaning may
                     remain new and rare, Barthes proposes it as the minor route to the “flashes” of what
                     he calls the “the founding act of the filmic,” that which “paradoxically cannot be
                     grasped in the projected film, the film ‘in movement,’ but only, as yet in that <em>major</em> artifact which is the still” (59).</p>

               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>Acknowledging his “lack of cinematic culture,” Barthes wonders early on whether his
                     “reading of this third meaning is justified” (43); and yet he insists that the “obtuse”
                     is not merely his critical or affective projection but a recognizable property of
                     the image itself: “if you look at these images I am talking about, <em>you will see the meaning</em>: we can understand each other about it ‘over the shoulder’ or ‘on the back’ of articulated
                     language: thanks to the image (frozen, it is true. . . ), indeed thanks to what <em>in the image is purely image</em> (and which to tell the truth, is very little indeed), we do without speech yet continue
                     to understand each other” (55; emphasis added). Though the “obtuse meaning” “will
                     not enter the critic’s metalanguage,” “you <em>will</em> see” it, if you look (55). By this point in the essay, Barthes has substituted seeing
                     for reading in order to insist on this shared “apprehension,” one made possible by
                     “what in the image is purely image” (55). This is where the “third meaning” resides:
                     in that <em>minimal</em> portion of the image that is purely image, its <em>minor</em> portion that is nonetheless constitutive. We <em>will</em> all see it in the stilled image, the “freeze-frame” or, to use the name of a website
                     devoted to this form of image extraction, the “filmgrab.”

                     apprehension” Barthes is experiencing and describing in that essay, in all honesty
                     I find the <em>idea</em> of the “third meaning” more arresting than the images themselves. This is not the
                     case with the complementary notion of the <em>punctum</em> that Barthes develops in <em>Camera Lucida</em>, his beautiful meditation on photography, in which I do feel and respond to the touch
                     or prick of almost every example (or if I don’t yet <em>feel</em> it, I see how and why Barthes does).

                              “impossible task” of naming and even “codifying” a relationship that remains “singular”
                              (88). Attridge links this “impossibility” to Barthes’s embrace in the last decade

                     in this undertaking by the belief that for Barthes’s notion of the “third meaning”
                     to have genuine analytical purchase or “currency,” we must be able to locate convincing

                  <p>Cinematic genre is irrelevant to the emergence of the <em>obtus</em>: the issue of genre and its conventions, its expectations, and even its deviations
                     all fall within the purview of Barthes’ “second meaning.” But Faflak’s essay on the
                     cinematic aspects of “Shelley’s final spectacle” raises important generic questions
                     about <em>The Triumph of Life</em> when he argues that the poem anticipates and “parallels” the genre of the film musical,
                     which it then turns inside out. As Faflak puts it, <em>The Triumph</em> “parallels von Trier’s vision of a musical utopianism violently wagering the stakes
                     of subjectivity dreamed by its phantasmatic afflatus” (
                     “Dancing”
                      168). Faflak’s essay prompted me to consider what other film genres might be at play
                     with or might “parallel” this poem. If the poem’s Italianate mode and structure suggest
                     the “epic,” it would be an epic that may have Virgil and Dante as poetic precedents
                     but that has no precedent in film history. Perhaps, as James McFarland suggested,
                     we should think of the poem in terms of “zombie films,” given the “undead” aspects
                     of the disfigured Rousseau as well as the lifeless “crowds” (50) and “multitudes”
                     (49) that greet and accompany the triumph as a zombie-apocalypse.

                     of contemporary films that meditate on or project images of the apocalypse: <em>Terminator</em>, <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (and its many sequels), <em>A.I.</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Sunshine</em>, <em>The Road</em>, and above all and “after all,” <em>Melancholia</em>, Lars von Trier’s 2011 film that for Szendy defines the “apocalyptic genre,” where
                     “<em>the end of the world is the end of the movie</em>.” Or, as Szendy also suggests, “vice versa (because this terrifying equation of filmic
                     eschatology can be reversed without being changed in the slightest): <em>The end of the movie is the end of the world</em>” (2). Percy Shelley’s untimely death by drowning interrupted what we might understand
                     to be the inexorable drive to the apocalypse generated by his final poem; but the
                     poem and its visions also seem propelled to what Szendy calls the “after all” [<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">après tout</span>]: both the minimizing response (“it’s only a movie or a poem, after all”) and its
                     excess, the thing that remains after it’s “all over” (2). When the screen goes black
                     for a full ten seconds after the annihilation of the earth at the end of <em>Melancholia</em>, there “is no longer really cinema any more” but rather the “cinema of the after
                     all” (3). And it can certainly feel as if <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is headed in that direction, drawn toward the apocalyptic specter of the “after all”
                     or <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">après tout</span>, and not just in terms of the apparently inexorable annihilation of everything that
                     appears in the wake of the historical pageant.

                              “What if we took the brief and under-read lastness of the line ‘as if that look must
                              be the last’ as a very particular kind of utterance, stolen ‘as if’ from the poem’s
                              social fabric and effectively pulling it apart like an end of the world? The line
                              would be a last scrap of the poem but, principally, it would also push up against
                              the lastness of the look. What would then happen to the world after the last look?
                              And what is an after-look?” (Last Things 76).</span></div>
                     </div> In one sense, <em>The Triumph</em> projects cinema’s pre-history with its own elaborate attention to the apparatus and
                     the effects of cinematic illusions, what Faflak calls “the refulgent source of cinema’s
                     illuminations” (
                     “Dancing”
                      168), as well as the <em>end</em> of cinema, or cinema as the end, in terms of the “white-outs” produced by “a shape
                     all light.” But that form of closure or finality seems at odds with the vitally eruptive
                     “visions” and skeptical “vacancies” of Shelley’s poetics and with the propulsive nature
                     of the poem, one in which the perpetual poetic interruption of ever new visions and
                     even the poet’s own death forestalls the inexorable pull of the “after all.” More
                     precise to say that Shelley’s final spectacle projects its reader-beholders as well
                     its spectator-actors to the images <em>after the end</em>. And, after all, what attracts me to this poem is an image from the prologue where
                     we encounter not the “after-all” of a proto-apocalyptic cinema but the <em>before all</em> of the pre-production, <em>The Triumph</em>’s “back story.”</p>

                     an example of apocalyptic cinema. Haynes’s <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> bears no generic relationship to Shelley’s <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, unless we consider their mutual lack of stable genre conventions to be analogous.
                     Nor is there any implicit or explicit Shelleyan influence on the story or the characters
                     of Haynes’s ambitious and delirious 1998 film about a fictitious episode in 1970s
                     British “glam rock,” the brief musical and cultural phenomenon that even rock music

                              of course, “glam” was only one of his many personae or poses. Bowie did not permit

                     installment in what he elegantly characterizes as a “history fascinated by the production
                     of images that body forth life, then compromise any return to life itself” (
                     “Dancing”
                      168). <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is not so much a glam rock biopic as it as an allegory of cultural history in the
                     vein of Benjamin, Wilde, and Shelley.

                  <p>My interest here is something quite minor in every sense, something that rarely rises
                     to the level of analytical importance, even for the film’s most attentive critics.
                     With Benjamin also in my mind, I want briefly to examine how the film shows us something
                     that <em>never happened</em>. For this exploration I turn to the film’s “back-story,” the four-minute pre-credit
                     “overture” which makes no mention of the film’s major characters. The film opens with
                     a shot in the midst of a nighttime constellation of stars and an audio sampling of
                     old muffled British radio recordings, transmissions beaming through space from distant
                     epochs. The first spoken voice is that of the narrator, Janet McTeer, delivering what
                     sounds as if it should be the lost fragment of a thesis from Benjamin’s final meditation
                     on history: “<em>Histories, like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empires. While everything forgotten
                        hangs in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to return.</em>” I remember acutely the experience of hearing this narration when I first saw the
                     film in the theater: I was convinced Haynes had gained access to some secret Benjamin
                     archive and had uncovered a new “paralopenomenon” of the 
                     “Theses.”
                      But the film’s initiating voice-over also conjures the model of history suggested
                     by Benjamin in an earlier essay on Kafka: “Everything forgotten mingles with what
                     has been forgotten of the pre-historic world, forms countless, uncertain, changing
                     compounds, yielding a constant flow of new strange products” (qtd. in Bensmaia xii).

                              particularly eloquent on the historical relationship between Wilde and glam rock:
                              “It quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition of camp

                     nine to ten years old, who stand one by one in a tight tracking shot declaring their
                     aspirations before their prim schoolmaster. “I want to be a barrister,” says one;
                     “I want to be a farmer,” and so on, until the final boy, labeled “O. Wilde” and wearing
                     the green broach, rises and declares, “I want to be a pop idol.” And as if to demonstrate

                     Wilde’s arrival by “one hundred years.” The film cuts to a scene of a young boy, Jack
                     Fairy, who—after being beaten by a score of bullying schoolmates—lays face down in
                     the street, his lip bloodied, and discovers in the dirt and grime the emerald broach
                     that adorned Oscar Wilde. The following scene looks as if it is a hand-drawn page
                     in a children’s picture-book, one featuring a little boy in school shorts walking
                     into the sunlight as the narrator’s voice-over resumes: “<em>Childhood, adults always say, is the best time in life. But as long as he could remember,
                        Jack Fairy knew better</em>.” The narration continues as the film cuts to a series of dark interior shots featuring

                     a mirror we never quite see—“<em>Until one mysterious day when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others
                        quite like him, singled out for a great gift</em>.” Jack Fairy meticulously draws the blood from his wound as if it were lipstick until
                     his eyes flash on his reflection, suddenly smiling directly at the mirror/camera/spectator
                     as the narrator concludes her overture: “<em>and one day the whole stinking world would be theirs</em>.”

               <p>Though there are repeated sightings of Jack Fairy, he is not a <em>character</em> in the film; and his presence is as solitary as it is ephemeral. He doesn’t utter
                  a line of dialogue in the movie, although he does deliver a song—a highly stylized
                  version of Roxy Music’s “2HB”—and recites a few lines of poetry. Jack Fairy is just
                  an image, in other words, a transitory image of transit; and his function in the film,
                  tangential to the story itself, is to show us the transfer of the emerald broach from
                  the stars to Oscar Wilde and Fairy and on to Curt Wild before it is deposited with
                  Arthur Stuart near the movie’s end. Jack Fairy is the image for what I am calling
                  the currency of images, the film’s “minor event” that shows us how to assemble images
                  in constellation. On the other hand, Jack Fairy’s recognition scene, his moment of
                  redemption, is the minor event: the bloodied lip drawn into lipstick by virtue of
                  the green broach, sent from the heavens, but dug out of the grimy street by Jack Fairy.
                  And thus for Jack Fairy and for those “others quite like him”: in this fleeting but
                  precious moment of redemption, <em>we</em> are those others and this moment is <em>ours</em> as well since <em>we</em> behold ourselves in <em>his</em> reflection and are thus positioned in this fantasy of the mirror stage to declare,
                  as does Arthur in another scene, “<em>that’s me! that’s me!</em>” Saturated in dazzling blue light, the stilled smile of Jack Fairy in the mirror/camera,
                  which is simultaneously our own visual address, produces for <em>me</em> the “third meaning,” a non-signifying or symbolic image that retains its residue
                  and which never returns to the “first” or “second” regimes of meaning. If it comes
                  from the film’s overture, it also now belongs to us, its most current observers.</p>

               <p>How are constellations formed between poems and films, or between paintings and prose?
                  Outside of cultural “influence” or historical development, how do these connections
                  occur? What is the nature of their currency? Invoking what Deleuze calls the “ideal
                  spaces” of his history of philosophy, I believe that “something happens” between Haynes
                  and Shelley, separated by 175 years and at least one artistic medium, in the “ideal
                  spaces” of Shelley’s poetry and Haynes’s cinema (<em>Dialogues</em> 15). <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> proposes an unprecedented model of cultural history which features moments of the
                  eruption of “spirit” (Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Bacon,
                  Rousseau, and the celebrated “spirit” of his own “age”) as well as periods of decay
                  and regression and Benjaminian states of emergency, moments of spirit’s eruption and
                  extinction (535). For Haynes as for Shelley, cultural and artistic history is not
                  an evolutionary development but lyric pulses of possibilities throughout time, pulses
                  which find their own connections, regardless of theme or genre: for the Shelley of
                  the <em>Defence</em>, they are Plato’s dialogues, Dante’s poetry, Milton’s epic, and Bacon’s scientific
                  enquiry. For the Haynes of <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, they are Wilde’s origins and his poetry, Fairy’s poses, glam’s eruption, the anticipation
                  of Cobain.</p>
               <p>Narrative history in <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> is a recursive and filtered account, one that splinters its invocation to <em>Citizen Kane</em>’s (1941) cinematic investigations; and <em>The Triumph</em> features a similar narrative structure as well as the fractured deployment of Dante’s
                  <em>terza rima</em>. Both Haynes and Shelley offer us “prologues” or “overtures,” their own “back stories”
                  that set the principal narratives in motion. And both artists fashion stories constructed
                  by multiple retrospections and looping narratives: back stories, “present” narratives,
                  followed by “pre-stories” which often appear as arresting “lyric” events. Marcia Landy’s
                  thoughtful characterization of <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>’s narrative “technique” as “investigative”—“what happened?” asks Arthur—applies to
                  <em>The Triumph</em>: Shelley’s speaker and interlocutor ask the same questions: what happened? how have
                  things “been brought to this dread pass” (301–2)? in “this valley of perpetual dream
                  / Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why” (397–98). And in both film and poem,
                  answers to these questions fail to materialize, replaced instead by “savage music,
                  stunning music” (435), “flashing” images and a “shape all light” (351–52), what an
                  exhilarated Bowie would much later call 
                  “Sounds and Visions.”
                  And in the course of what are by turns lavish and garish spectacles paraded in both
                  film and poem, “spectators” “turn” into “actors or victims” (305–6). At the most fundamental
                  level, both texts explore the relationship between life and the image, the relationship
                  of “fair shapes” or fairy shapes to “light’s severe excess” (411, 424). “A man’s life
                  is his image,” says Curt Wild near the end of <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>. But the affinities between poem and film aside, my primary motivation in this essay
                  has been to learn how to discern the “third meaning,” the <em>obtus</em> that attaches to the extracted, stilled image in poetry and in film.</p>
               <p>Though the particular experience of reading <em>The Triumph of Life</em> I want to describe has less to do with its narrative dimension than with the minor
                  effects of a single atmospheric image, that image’s “minorization” produces its effects
                  in relation to the scale and breadth of the story Shelley’s poem tells about history.
                  The first forty lines of the poem are devoted to the speaker’s physical placement
                  as he lounges outside in the shadow of the Apennines at daybreak in the moments before
                  “A vision on his brain is rolled” (40). The next section of the poem, roughly 130
                  lines, depicts the “waking dream” as it unrolls before the speaker. It’s a grim “triumphal”
                  pageant of history—complete with its own chariot—one which celebrates the conquerors.
                  The speaker grows weary and disillusioned of this spectacle, the “jubilee” that greets
                  a conqueror’s advance: “Struck to the heart by the sad pageantry” of Western history,
                  the speaker asks aloud “what is this?” (176–77). He is answered by the disfigured
                  image of “what was once Rousseau” which becomes his Virgilian guide and commentator
                  to the unfolding spectacle, though “Rousseau’s” commentary only compounds the speaker’s
                  distress when he learns that in this version of the “jubilee” the “captive multitude”
                  is chained to the “triumphal pageant” of “thoughts empire over thought” (111, 119,
                  118, 211): anarchs, demagogues, <em>and</em> sage, even Voltaire and Kant, an extensive catalogue of those Bowie called the “men
                  who sold the world.” Only the “sacred few,” Christ and Socrates, escape this ideological
                  vision by remaining what de Man calls “mere fictions in the writings of others” (97).
                  In the last extant section of the poem, Shelley’s speaker turns to this post-Rousseau
                  to ask how of all the historical figures on display, his guide became complicit with
                  the “triumph of life.” The disfigured Rousseau then relays the nature of his own seduction
                  and undoing by a mesmerizing “shape all light,” one that turned his brain to sand.
                  Percy Shelley’s drowning brings the poem to an end; but it’s difficult to see how
                  the obliterating pull of these repeated visionary disfigurements could be “brushed
                  against the grain,” difficult to foresee how any “glorious phantoms” could burst from
                  this grave pageantry to “illumine its tempestuous day” given that life and death have
                  grown into mirrored images of each other, leaving the speaker/viewer “eye-sick”: “mine
                  eyes are sick of this perpetual flow” (298). If Shelley’s “cinema” is predicated on
                  the hope that it might discover “a trace of light diviner than the common sun / Sheds
                  on the common earth” (338–39), it is not to be found in the movie we call <em>The Triumph of Life</em>. Or at least not in its diegesis: I want to conclude my essay by considering how
                  a version of the Deleuzian <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mineur</span>, might be assembled for Shelley’s last poem from Barthes’s critical observation and
                  Haynes’s cinematic thinking about the workings of the poetic “still.” Perhaps in that
                  stilled image we might find “a trace of light diviner.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>If <em>The Triumph</em> activates the many philological resources of “still,” the effect of all this “stilling”
                     in this most restless and mobile of Shelley’s poetry is ironic, as if it should suggest
                     the possibility of an arrest or standstill that its propulsive movement forecloses.
                     When, for instance, the “strange distortion” called Rousseau describes the effects
                     of the “shape all light,” one of those effects is the obliterating of her poetic feet
                     through which “the sweet tune / To which they moved, seemed as they moved to blot
                     / The thoughts” of all beholders (180, 352, 382–84). Here, the poetic measures of
                     verse, when delivered—or “flung”—by a “shape all light,” “blot” the “thoughts” of
                     the gazers, a poetic obliteration that seems to characterize each successive manifestation
                     of the vision (386). Inscribed, however, in these lines is a characteristic Shelleyan
                     pun, which isolated in a sort of “poetry grab,” brushes the poetics of obliteration
                     against the grain with the urgency of an alarm: “<em>still</em> her feet,” demands the poem, <em>arrest</em> the relentless imposition of the “Shape’s” effects.

               <p>The triumphal pageant exerts a diachronic force generated by its own propulsive <em>terza rima</em>, its motion accelerated by enjambments that create the effect of a perpetually receding
                  horizon line drawn by some unnamed and invisible force. As exhilarating as this unrelenting
                  horizontal movement of the poem can be for even its most seasoned readers, the repeated
                  sudden “vertical” “bursts” of visions and shapes and figures—like repeatedly pulsed
                  stills—exert an obtuse force on the obvious ideological dimension of the poem’s story.
                  Shelley’s critical version of Platonism always conveys a proto-cinematic quality,
                  but <em>The Triumph of Life</em> realizes it as tenor and vehicle. It is the combination of features both obvious
                  and obtuse, both major and minor, that makes <em>The Triumph of Life</em> a movie. Goldstein has shown compellingly how the images that unfold in the poem’s
                  vision—“like atomies that dance / Within a sunbeam” (446–47)—“signal an emphatic switch
                  to an alternative, neo-Lucretian model of sensation and figuration” (155), but the
                  passage has always struck me as motes dancing in the projection beam, a sign of what
                  Orrin Wang has called the “coming attractions” of Romanticism’s proto-cinematic verse
                  that manufactures the opportunity to see “the <em>in</em> visible in the image, the always social self in projected, kinetic form” (
                  “Coming Attractions”
                  500).</p>
               <p>As much as my intellectual orientations and political impulses are engaged by the
                  poem’s critique of European history, it is not the poem’s political project that compels
                  me to sit down and read it again and again. It is rather to renew the experience of
                  the poem’s cascading visions and figures that come from nowhere and arrest or dissolve
                  the poem’s narrative movement. And above all it is the strangely affecting couple
                  of lines about that evening glimmer on the hills in a poem that seems to have galvanized
                  all the formal and rhetorical resources available to British poetry. To invoke the
                  famous dictum attributed to Gramsci—“pessimism of the intellect, optimisim of the
                  will”—those two lines of the poem allow us to see at one and the same time the pessimism
                  of the poet, but the optimism of the verse. In other words, the poem undertakes a
                  radical negation and performs a radical affirmation. This double-movement takes place
                  simultaneously: the corrosively ironic triumphal pageant of “universal history” paraded
                  before the speaker-beholder and the eruptive <em>terza rima</em> that generates ever new visions that seem to unfold on perpetually receding planes
                  of immanence.</p>
               <p>I am availing myself of a Deleuzian idiom, one which activates the politically resistant
                  and “optimistic” aspects of the “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mineur</span>” in Shelley’s poem. For Deleuze and Guattari a “minor literature” <span class="quote">‘finds itself positively charged with the role and function of collective, and even
                     revolutionary, enunciation. It is a literature that produces an active solidarity
                     in spite of skepticism; and if the writer is in the margins or completely outside
                     his or her fragile community, this situation allows the writer all the more the possibility
                     to express another possible community and to forge the means for another consciousness
                     and another sensibility. (<em>Kafka</em> 17)’</span> Has there ever been a better way to characterize the Percy Shelley of <em>The Triumph of Life</em>: “outside his fragile community,” such as it was in 1819 on the Tuscan coast, seeking
                  an “active solidarity in spite of skepticism”—an undying skepticism—and writing “to
                  forge” in poetry “the means for another consciousness and another sensibility”? In
                  spite of his skepticism, Shelley would have understood the project of his literature
                  as “positively charged with the role and function of collective, and even revolutionary,
                  enunciation,” a <em>currency</em> of his poetic images he called “electric energy” (535): the energy of the poem’s
                  enjambments, the energy of the <em>terza rima</em> planes, the energy of a revolutionary impulse in the poem’s charged undertaking.
                  “We might as well say,” as do Deleuze and Guattari, “that minor no longer designates
                  specific literatures but the revolutionary conditions for every literature within
                  the heart of what is called great (or established) literature” (<em>Kafka</em> 18).</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p>The Deleuzian <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mineur</span> helps us to understand how <em>The Triumph of Life</em>, a poem that seems to explore not only the events of European history, but how the
                     very “eventness” of the event might simultaneously mark the event’s “minorization.”
                     “History,” writes Deleuze in his account of Nietzsche’s <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em>, “thus appears as the act by which reactive forces take possession of culture or
                     divert its course in their favor. The triumph of reactive forces is not an accident
                     in history but the principle and meaning of ‘universal history’” (<em>Nietzsche</em> 139). If we hear in these sentences echoes of Benjamin, there is also no better way
                     to summarize <em>The Triumph</em>’s critical impulse toward history. Nor can I think of a better way to characterize
                     the effect of Shelley’s refusal of a sober revolutionary <em>ascesis</em> than the “nomadic” Italianate estrangement of English verse forms that characterize
                     his poetic intervention, every bit as jubilant as the guitars in a Roxy Music song.

                     </div> As Deleuze describes this aspect of poetic minorization: “The overload is not a rhetorical
                     figure, a metaphor, or symbolic structure; it is a mobile paraphrase bearing witness
                     to the unlocalized presence of an indirect discourse at the heart of <em>every statement. The closer a language gets to this state, the closer it comes . .
                        . to music itself”</em> (<em>Thousand</em> 104). It’s no accident that this sounds more than a little like a “mobile paraphrase”
                     of Walter Pater, since Deleuze’s notion of minorization always involves the arresting
                     of poetic representation: in its minor mode, “<em>language stops being representative in order to move toward its extremities or its
                        limits</em>” (Kafka 23). <em>The Triumph of Life</em> is a poem that seems to make its devotees—if not its genuine readers—into Paterian
                     acolytes of one sort or another, whether willingly or not. In 
                     “The School of Giorgione,”
                      Pater famously or scandalously invokes the <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Anderstreben</span> or “other striving” of each mode of art: “it is noticeable,” writes Pater, “that,
                     in its special mode of handling its given material, each art may be observed to pass
                     into the condition of some other art, by what German critics term an <span xml:lang="de" lang="de" class="foreign">Anderstreben</span>—a partial alienation from its own limitations, through which the arts are able .
                     . . to lend each other new forces” (105). If cinema is the “as yet unimagined” art,
                     the coming attraction that lends Shelley’s poetry its own “new forces,” its Paterian-Lucretian
                     constellation of sheer sensations or what Pater calls “a matter of pure perception”
                     shows how Shelley’s last poem poses the example to which all of cinema still strives
                     (108).</p>

                  <p>If <em>The Triumph of Life</em>is a poem that moves toward language’s “extremities” and thus minorizes its relation
                     to European history, what “gets” the poem going towards that minor event are the preliminary
                     lines, which include a cinematic vision of their own, the majestic procession of a
                     sunrise that Derrida describes as “the outpouring of light and solar glory” (
                     “Living On”
                      131). Oddly in this poem that seems at every turn to explore and deepen the problem
                     of spectatorship, the sunrise itself goes entirely unbeheld by our speaker or any
                     entity other than the “awakened earth.” But in lines 26–40, we are presented with
                     a cinematic projection: a “strange trance” “grows” over the speaker’s fancy which
                     in turn “spreads” “a shade” so “transparent” that the <em>scene</em> came “through / As when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer.”
                     Shelley anticipates both the cinematic apparatus and the quasi-hypnotic spell it induces,
                     and once we are introduced to the advent of sound, “sweet talk in music through the
                     enamoured air,” the “vision” can be “rolled” not “in his mind” but by way of this
                     carefully delineated external apparatus, “<em>on his brain</em>” (40 emphasis added).

                              out in advance the kind of demystification of the cinematic illusion-machine that
                              was the project of so much of the 1970s as well as the bedazzling effects—“the fascination
                              of film”—that Barthes acknowledges in 
                              “Leaving the Movie Theatre,”
                              “spent visions” and “a trace of diviner light” (348).</span></div>

               </div>
               <p>However much I find this aspect of the poem critically compelling as a poetic figure
                  which anticipates the full range of a future medium’s possibility and effects, I always
                  feel myself drawn more to the detached glimmering image of a <em>veil of light drawn</em> over evening hills. In this magnetic moment, my critical appreciation of Shelley’s
                  account of the cinematic apparatus recedes in the light of this single image: a “drawing”
                  possessed of its own agency, an application of its own force that not only pulls a
                  veil over the hills but <em>traces</em> a line that is extended, lengthened, <em>unfolded</em>. Shelley animates the various resources of this simple word “draw” and in the process
                  galvanizes the effect of this subjectless and potentially agentless verb. To draw
                  can mean to carry or convey a vehicle, even if that vehicle is the tail end of a simile;
                  or it can mean to represent a picture, to draw in words, or to attract, as by a rhetorical
                  force that seems to exude the magnetic qualities it generates, a force that draws
                  us to it, “singling us out,” and makes it arresting. Most suggestively for me is the
                  meaning of drawing as “extraction,” as when one draws a conclusion from an investigation
                  or perhaps as when one extracts or draws out an image to which one is drawn. If this
                  veil of light is not yet the historical pageant of images that unfolds in Shelley’s
                  cinematic vision, it is perhaps what Barthes calls the third meaning of the “stilled”
                  image, the “founding act of the filmic,” at least of Shelley’s own poetic cinema,
                  the gift of a glimmering lyrical minor event inscribed like a pulse or a broach in
                  the poetic and cinematic image, the promise of a currency.</p>

               withholding of “thoughts,” it’s relevant to invoke Walter Benjamin’s account to Gretel
               Adorno of his “holding” “certain thoughts” “safe with” himself and “yes, even from”
               himself until 1940 when the “war and the constellation it brought with it” prompted
               him to compose them. These “certain thoughts” are his 
               “Theses on the Concept of History”

               “admission” of his long-standing relationship with the third-to-last line of the poem
               speaks directly to my own connection to the poem: “I admit that for years, I have
               been perplexed by the minimal yet arresting power of ‘as if that look must be the
               last,’ to the point where the whole apparatus of the poem dissolves for me into something
               like the floaters that Mary saw in the manuscript. The words, however, have never
               sounded especially elegiac to me but rather quietly withering in their kitschy and
               clichéd tone, even recalling the countless small disasters of standard torch songs
               composed in the minor key—noncatastrophic gestures and affects that explode at micro-levels
               and dissipate, neither fetishistic nor talismanic. Like Etta James’s 
               “At Last,”
               then, this is a love that has ‘come along’” (77).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">I take the figure of the <em>sentence image</em> from Jacques Rancière’s formulation of that term: “By [the sentence image] I understand
               something different from the combination of a verbal sequence and a visual form. The
               power of the sentence-image can be expressed in sentences from a novel, but also in
               forms of theatrical representations or cinematic montage or the relationship between
               the said and the unsaid in a photograph” (45–46). If Rancière inaugurates this mode
               of inter-art “assembling” with his notion of the sentence-image, my own immediate
               deployment of the term is more directly derived from Orrin N.C. Wang’s important “reworking”
               of the term as a feature of Coleridge’s “techno-magism,” or the poetic capacity of
               “making something out of nothing” (
               “Technomagism”
               300). As Wang characterizes it, “the sentence image, in line with Ranciere’s political
               vision, asserts an overcoming of parataxis without the subordinate relations that
               structure the hypotactic clause” (296). In my own “reworking” of the term, I’m interested
               in an extractability or detachability of the image that allows it to crystallize into
               something withdrawn and discrete.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               versifying, especially the poet’s deployment of <em>terza rima</em> in <em>The Triumph</em> which, according to Keach, displays “a compositional intelligence fully in touch
               with the arbitrariness of its expressive medium yet capable of shaping that arbitrariness
               into, as well as according to, precisely provisional ‘constraints of meaning’” (188).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of a “redeemed” or “fulfilled” time are present throughout his work, as is the careful
               distance he keeps from the biblical origins of “messianic time.” In one of his earliest
               writings on the <em>Trauerspiel</em>—an unpublished essay from 1916—Benjamin treats the Bible not as the source but as
               a <em>resource</em>: “Historical time is infinite in every direction and unfulfilled at every moment.
               This means we cannot conceive of a single empirical event that bears a necessary relation
               to the time of its occurrence. . . . [The] idea of fulfilled time is the dominant
               historical idea of the Bible: it is the idea of messianic time. Moreover, the idea
               of a fulfilled time is never identical with the idea of an individual time” (55–56).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               is the bearer through which, like a flash, similarity appears. For its production
               by man—like its perception by him—is in many cases, and particularly the most important,

               Without conflating Deleuze and Guattari with Benjamin or even suggesting a resemblance
               between them, Bensmaia posits Kafka as what we might describe as their “nodal” connection.
               The Kafka that Benjamin shares with Deleuze and Guattari is one resistant to the exegetical
               modes imposed upon him, the Kafka who rejects symbolic, allegorical, mythical, and
               theological interpretations in order to allow the “Kafka-universe” to emerge, in Deleuze
               and Guattari’s case the Kafka who introduces a “minor literature.”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               the interview with Oren Moverman which prefaces the published screenplay, Haynes is
               particularly eloquent on the historical relationship between Wilde and glam rock:
               “It quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition of camp
               and applied counter-philosophies about art and culture, which I saw originating from
               Oscar Wilde. To me Wilde became the perfect manifestation of the glam era. . . . I
               think glam rock was the first overt alignment of the notion of the alien with the
               notion of the homosexual—both of which became this fantastical, galvanizing potential
               for musical expression, a potential freedom for kids trapped in their dreary lives.
               The space ship definitely brings in the outsider elements of the period, which I attribute
               to Wilde and dandyism, but it also refers to feelings of ‘otherness’ confronted at

               (<em>triumphant</em> and <em>arrested</em>) of these two texts” (107–08). In her game-changing essay on the Lucretian impulses
               in Shelley’s last poem, Goldstein outlines a philosophical foundation to the poem’s
               subterranean arrest or resistance; and she argues that the final and critically “neglected

               scene of life that <em>The Triumph of Life</em> has been showing all along, but this time under changed philosophical premises about
               the relation of life, matter, and trope” (138). For Goldstein this “new Vision” is
