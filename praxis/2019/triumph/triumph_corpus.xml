            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">Ever since Paul de Man’s “Shelley Disfigured,” we have come to see
                    Percy Shelley’s final, unfinished poem, “The Triumph of Life,” as a symptom of
                    the end of Romanticism and Romanticism as end. If or once things are over, why
                    bother to re-visit the end? This is one of many questions Shelley’s poem compels
                    its readers to ask, which is in turn to ask why we any longer need to re-visit
                    the poem at this a time when so little apparently rests on our doing so. So, as
                    if to prolong the idea of an end (whatever that might be), this volume is
                    comprised of four essays compelled to return to the same poem, as if to read the
                    poem as a crime scene that leaves a barrage of clues, none of them adding up to
                    a crime, but each lingering differently with Shelley as Shelley lingers with
                    life and history and as we linger (or not) with the shadows his future casts (or
                    not) upon our present moment, which seems more than ever beyond our grasp, if it
                    ever was within our ken. Why even bother? But then again, and just in case: if
                    so little and so much is at stake, why not?</p>

                  <p>Orrin Wang recalls one origin of this volume in his wonderfully generous
                        response to its suite of gorgeously searching papers on Shelley’s last poem.
                        Apparently I posed to him the notion that “certain Romantic texts require
                        repeated unearthing and burial—require/compel our productively
                        melancholic attachment to them. . . . We just thought it would be cool to
                        devote a whole panel to one poem in order to demonstrate precisely its
                        compulsive hold on our critical imaginations (a la de Man).” “We” refers to
                        a conversation over drinks with Jacques Khalip at an earlier NASSR
                        conference (likely Boston 2013), during which I broached the idea of
                        devoting an entire conference panel, maybe even an entire book, to one
                        Romantic text. It would (have to) be a text I felt that one could or should
                        not live without, one that sustained repeated intervention, not just across
                        time, but within the concentrated challenges of our present time. My wish
                        included texts whose monumental (dis)figuration by and through time left
                        them as open wounds within literary history that begged for the
                            <emph>pharmakon</emph> of interpretation. Khalip and I agreed that the
                        most compelling work, very much but not only because of Paul de Man’s
                        seminal reading, was Shelley’s last poem, very much though not only because
                        of the final “fold / Of” the text after it begs the question it cannot
                        answer, “‘Then what is life?’<note place="foot" resp="author">Percy Shelley,
                                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, ll. 547–48, 544, from
                            Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat’s Norton edition of <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>. All subsequent references to
                            Shelley’s writing, except where otherwise noted, are from this edition,
                            indicated by title and cited by line number for poetry and page number
                            for prose.</note> Like Keats extending his “living hand, now warm and
                        capable / Of earnest grasping” (<title level="m">Poems</title> 1–2), the
                        question makes a return to the poem at once compulsive and compulsory, but
                        it was also our hope to lose ourselves in this final fold “without any
                        irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason” (Keats, <title level="m">Letters</title> 43), not to avoid facts altogether but to stop making
                        sense in ways the world seems increasingly to demand of us. Or as Orrin
                        answers when he asks, in his <title level="a">Response</title> to the
                        following essays, “Why read?,” we do so “out of a Shelleyan love based on
                        something like the sensation of the impermanence of our selves and our
                        readings, our cognition and our somatic experience.”</p>
                  <p>I never thought this idea would go anywhere. Then Sonia Hofkosh, in typically
                        generous fashion, invited me to organize one of the KSAA panels at the 2015
                        MLA, Sonia Hofkosh, thus indulging my fantasy, which resulted in <title level="a">The Futures of Shelley’s Triumph,</title> consisting of Libby
                        Fay, Jacques, Tres Pyle, and Orrin’s response. The conversations that
                        preceded and proceeded from that experience, to which are added those with
                        this volume’s fifth contributor, Chris Washington, are of the kind that, any
                        time I feel jaded or disheartened about the state of our profession and
                        field, reminds me that even the apparently smallest exchange of ideas can
                        recall us to what really matters, which is a matter of our very survival. If
                        that sounds melodramatic, I mean it to. For “We just thought it would be
                        cool” is symptomatic, not of our nonchalance toward our field, profession,
                        or work, but rather of our sense that chances need to be taken. As de Man
                        says of Shelley’s last text, “Questions of origin, of direction, and of
                        identity punctuate the text without ever receiving a clear answer” (95–96).
                        Going for broke in the absence of clear answers may be a sign of desperation
                        (“Why are we any longer doing this??”) that stimulants often help me to
                        quell. It also begs the question of why we debate the interpretation of
                        works that few people might or will or want to read. What could possibly
                        matter? And yet at the same time, why not? <emph>If</emph> the world seems
                        to care less about what we do as scholars, then who cares that we do this as
                        long as there remains a place and time <emph>to</emph> do this, of course.
                        But where at least two are gathered in the name of challenging the world’s
                        premises, there remains, not a dangerously deluded hope for the future, but
                        the queer capacity of an at once posthuman and all-too-human experience that
                        offers a chance to redeem the everyday nature of our lives as a way of
                        addressing the otherworldly stakes of our existence. As Tony Kushner writes
                        in the Afterword to his monumental <title level="m">Angels in
                            America</title> (1995), “Marx was right: The smallest indivisible human
                        unit is two people, not one; one is a fiction. From such nets of souls
                        societies, the social world, human life springs” (158). When Shelley
                        envisioned a maximum of five readers for <title level="m">Prometheus
                            Unbound</title> (1820), one responds either with, “Poor showing,” or,
                        “Good start.”</p>
                  <p>The compulsion to return to Shelley’s last poem begins, of course, with Mary
                        Shelley, whose editing of <title level="m">Posthumous Poems</title> (1824),
                        partly an act of impossible mourning, included a reading version culled from
                        the manuscript her husband left behind. That version, included largely
                        unchanged in her subsequent edition of <title level="m">The Poetical Works
                            of Percy Bysshe Shelley</title> (1839), remained authoritative until the
                        early 1960s, when G. M. Matthews and Donald H. Reiman revisited Mary’s
                        version in consultation with the original manuscript, now in the Bodleian,
                        to produce the text we now cite. Given the manuscript’s largely chaotic
                        shape (only the opening stanzas exist in a relatively fair copy state) these
                        were Herculean editing labors. T. S. Eliot called Shelley’s mind “in some
                        ways a very confused one,” but he thought <title level="m">The
                            Triumph</title> (1822) was the “greatest though unfinished” of Shelley’s
                        poems, “evidence not only of better writing than in any previous long poem,
                        but of greater wisdom” (90). Arguing that only finished works can legitimate
                        the apparent trajectory and philosophical system of a poet’s vision, Earl
                        Wasserman ends his monumental <title level="m">Shelley: A Critical
                            Reading</title> (1971) with <title level="m">Adonais</title> (1821),
                        Shelley’s self-proclaimed “highly wrought <emph>piece of art</emph>” (<title level="m">Letters</title> 2: 294). Taking up readings of <title level="m">Triumph</title>’s nod to a Dantesque eschatology (Timothy
                        Webb) and Petrarchan humanism (Desmond King-Hele), Angela Leighton finds in
                        the poem, “in spite of all its pessimism, a renewed confidence in the act of
                        writing as the only means of saving inspiration from that perfection which
                        is the poet’s loss,” a “prognosticated happy ending” (one remembers Robert
                        Browning’s point that Shelley would have found sympathy among the
                        Christians), a redemptive possibility that Harold Bloom or Richard Cronin,
                        also taken up by Leighton, read as a parody or obfuscation, respectively, of
                        any such ideal (Leighton 150–51).</p>
                  <p>The above responses reflect our longstanding habituation, first pushed by
                        Mary, to Percy as a second generation Romantic torn between skepticism and
                        idealism, undecided if he wanted to reform the world or get beyond it, which
                        tension reaches its highest pitch in <title level="m">Adonais</title> and
                        seems to get attenuated differently as Shelley moves on to <title level="m">The Triumph</title> where, as Balanchandra Rajan argues, Shelley,
                        despite more than likely intending to finish the poem, toys with what Rajan
                        calls the “form of the unfinished,” how the poem “movingly confesses [its]
                        inability to pronounce on its own nature” (209). An earlier study such as C.
                        E. Pulos’s <title level="m">The Deep Truth</title> (1954) mitigates this
                        ambivalence by reading Shelley as what Hugh Roberts calls a “progressively
                        more ‘idealist’ skeptic” (2). This mediation, symptomatic of a post-WWII
                        reclamation of Shelley’s reputation in the wake (for instance) of F. R.
                        Leavis’s attack on Shelley in <title level="m">Revaluation: Tradition and
                            Development in English Poetry</title> (1936), esteemed Shelley’s vatic
                        power and poetic talent, though with a deepening understanding of the
                        dangers and excesses of his political and aesthetic idealism. For Ross
                        Woodman in <title level="m">The Apocalyptic Vision of the Poetry of
                            Shelley</title> (1964), <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
                        presents an “Orphic vision of an annihilated world” (198), a mythopoeia that
                        for Harold Bloom in <title level="m">Shelley’s Mythmaking</title> (1959)
                        achieves its “final aspect” in “that the myth, and the myth’s maker, are
                        fully conscious of the myth’s necessary defeat” (275) by existence itself.
                        This Shelleyan apocalypse without millennium at once haunts and anticipates
                        deconstruction’s influence on Romantic studies, on full display in Bloom’s
                        1979 <title level="m">Deconstruction and Criticism</title>, which contained
                        Derrida’s and de Man’s landmark essays on <title level="m">The
                            Triumph</title> . De Man’s essay in particular attends to the poem’s
                        fragmented, inchoate form as a sign of how the weave all human endeavor
                        remains frayed by history, a rather telling sign of both Shelley’s and our
                        crisis-ridden times. How and where does one now situate Shelley’s disastrous
                        text as a text both about and <emph>of</emph> disaster, as Chris Washington
                        explores in his essay for this issue? The poem’s incessant questioning of
                        origins and identities, what Tilottama Rajan after de Man calls its
                        attention to “questioning, doubting, and emergent knowledge,” becomes
                        symptomatic of what she calls Shelley’s “purgatorial imagination . . . that
                        derives its power from the very manner in which it finds itself containing
                        the reality that is to deconstruct it” (<title level="m">Dark

                  <p>Deconstruction partly urged a revaluation of the epistemology and ontology of
                        Shelley’s formal strategies. For William Keach in <title level="m">Shelley’s
                            Style</title> (1984), Shelley’s verse, particularly its complex use of
                        rhyme in <title level="m">Triumph</title>, constitutes the productively
                        ambivalent form of his thought, not as philosophical system but as
                        open-ended intellectual (r)evolution. For Ronald Tetreault in <title level="m">The Poetry of Life: Shelley and Literary Form</title> (1987),
                        the poem’s “desire for a reassuring certitude with which anxiety [for a
                        center] can be mastered” necessarily fails, but still with the confidence
                        that “even in an age of deconstruction poetry may still teach us how to
                        live” (257). Perhaps above all, critical responses to the poem thereafter
                        had to contend with what was seen, either generatively or critically, as
                        deconstruction’s missed encounter with history. Reading de Man reading
                        Shelley reading, Orrin Wang (1996) calls <title level="m">Triumph</title> a
                        “disfigured monument” poised at the “limit of its historical and critical
                        consciousness,” unable to “resolve . . . the final form of its narration”
                        (64). For Hugh Roberts in <title level="m">Shelley and the Chaos of
                            History</title> (1997), Lucretian materialism offered Shelley a new
                        model of history and its political rhythms as a ceaseless becoming that
                        reflects the “entropic and negentropic aspects of evolutionary process”
                        (406), which Amanda Jo Goldstein’s <title level="m">Sweet Science</title>
                        (2017) reads in terms of <title level="m">Triumph</title>’s complex
                        reciprocity between life and its symbolic manifestations, thus offering a
                        Shelleyan biopolitics of life. In <title level="m">Shelley and the
                            Revolutionary Sublime</title> (2005) Cian Duffy discusses how the poem’s
                        representation of post-revolutionary change, influenced by aesthetic
                        theories of the sublime, questions the failure and subsequent deadlock of
                        imaginative will in transforming the political and historical landscape. And
                        in what is arguably the most significant single study of Shelley’s writing
                        in the past three decades, <title level="m">Shelley’s Process</title>
                        (1988), Jerrold Hogle reads the conflict of interpretations generated by
                        this ineluctable traversal between art, life, and history as transference,
                        the nomadic principle of Shelley's aesthetics as history’s drive, most
                        powerfully in his final poem. In <title level="m">The Supplement of
                            Reading</title> (1990) Rajan reads this shifting principle of thought
                        and representation in <title level="m">Triumph</title> as neither loss nor
                        recovery: “Fading is not disappearance, but something more haunting: a
                        presence that cannot be located and yet cannot be definitively renamed as
                        absence so that we will cease searching for it” (347). William Ulmer (1990)
                        reads this lost object (that can’t quite be called “lost”) as the force of
                        eros behind Shelley’s politics and its idealism. Stuart Peterfreund (2002)
                        reads this longing for transcendence post-deconstructively as the latent if
                        unfulfilled spirit of Shelleyan verse, a potentiality Leighton targets as a
                        moving acknowledgement and commemoration of loss, which is for her the
                        poem’s “real triumph” (175).</p>
                  <p>History, love, loss: binding this dizzying array of readings is our desire to
                        know what Shelley might have thought, felt, and intended when writing his
                        final poem. Here I imagine what Walter Benjamin might have been thinking and
                        feeling when he wrote his late theses on history, as if to remind a world
                        that wasn’t listening why the very history that could consume us was also,
                        paradoxically, the one that mattered. Benjamin’s survival was rather more
                        precarious than Shelley’s. However, as if trapped within history’s
                        Janus-faced reality, realizing there could be no Archimidean point from
                        which to view and thus gain <emph>some</emph> kind of purchase on its
                        onslaught— on history itself—Shelley struggles to see and say
                        his way through to a different materiality of things, which struggle we find
                        ourselves in the midst of. In <title level="m">After Finitude</title>
                        Quentin Meillassoux contemplates the existence of what he terms the
                        “‘arche-fossil’ or ‘fossil-matter,’” which “indicat[es] the traces of past
                        life . . . but [also] materials indicating the existence of an ancestral
                        reality or event” (10), like the luminescence of a star reaching us after
                        billions of years of light travel. Ancestrality indicates a “world devoid of
                        humanity” (127), which for Meillassoux challenges “the idea according to
                        which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and
                        being, and never to either term considered apart from the other” (5), which
                        entails the Kantian idealism that we can think the <foreign xml:lang="de">Ding an sich</foreign> of being, but only from the perspective of
                        thought. </p>
                  <p>Wrestling thinking from being demands that we think a being beyond our
                        thought of being, on its own terms, as it were, which is to say prior to its
                        own “givenness.” In Meillassoux’s wording, this is to locate “that outside
                        which thought could explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
                        territory – of being entirely elsewhere” (7). Contemplating a thought beyond
                        correlation, and thus after finitude, in Washington’s powerful summation (in
                        another context), “reveals an aporia that exists in both philosophy and
                        science: our inability to account for a world outside of us without,
                        paradoxically, accounting for it” (450). Shelley’s earlier <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813), attempting to account for the empiricism of
                        this ancestral temporality by taking its reader to the verges of the cosmos
                        and of Shelley’s idealism, tarries with this rift between being and thought,
                        yet remains within the hope of making one commensurate with the other. But
                        in <title level="m">Triumph</title> Shelley finds that being in the midst of
                        the everyday experience of history leaves him on the “foreign territory” of
                        an attempt to exist <emph>within</emph> a history always out of our reach
                        precisely <emph>because</emph> we exist in its midst. Thus abandoned, we are
                        left to express an “inability to account for a world outside of us without,
                        paradoxically, accounting for it.” We are also left with thought
                        alone—with the being <emph>of</emph> thought, which Shelley expresses
                        enigmatically as “thoughts which must remain untold” (<title level="m">Triumph</title> 21). To read Meillassoux perhaps somewhat differently,
                        the matter of history is the matter of ancestrality <emph>now</emph>, a
                        being within being that cannot be thought, but also a thought within being
                        that has a being of its own that cannot be thought. History itself
                            <emph>is</emph> the being Shelley needs to think his way into and out
                        of, without ever touching upon its foreign materiality in which he
                        nonetheless finds himself enmeshed. Accounting for this point resonates with
                        the following essays’ various points of entry: the “queerly erotic openness”
                        of Jacques Khalip’s last look, the “beyondness” of Libby Fay’s detached
                        attachment to/attached detachment of the sensuality of verse, the glimmering
                        phenomenality of Tres Pyle’s account of the poem as minor event, Chris
                        Washington’s exploration of the physical immateriality of light and love. </p>
                  <p>To move us toward a future of living on, with, and at the borders of history
                        is to dwell with what Denise Gigante calls Romanticism’s “uncontainable
                        vitality” (6), which at the same time expresses the killing moment of life’s
                        disposal, feeding upon itself as waste product, like the ruins of Saturn’s
                        temple in Keats’s revision of <title level="m">Hyperion</title> (1820) as
                            <title level="m">The Fall of Hyperion</title> (eventually published in
                        1856) and or Shelley’s chariot as it plows on remorselessly, senselessly,
                        irrevocably. At the end of <title level="m">Perestroika</title>, the second
                        half of Kushner’s <title level="m">Angels in America</title>, Prior Walter
                        is offered the Tome of Immobility, the promise of an eternal existence
                        without suffering. The Angel warns Prior that life has become a “habit,” the
                        result of which will be a devastation equal to Byron’s “Darkness.” Having
                        survived the devastation that was dealing with AIDS in Reagan’s newly
                        dawning America, his pre-Trump stab at Making America Great Again, Prior is
                        momentarily enticed. But to move deathwards toward no death is to give into
                        the defeat that the sheer lack of response to the dead and dying demands, or
                        rather quietly, implicitly, assumes. How to respond to the being of death
                        from within the living, a foreign territory that cannot be thought, although
                        death sure has its own thoughts on the matter. Which may be why Prior
                        embraces, however precariously, the promise of more life: <quote>

                        Shelley is momentarily stunned by the creatively melancholic vitality of
                        Keats’s decaying mind—the necrophagia of life feeding on itself. Left
                        among the living to lament, Shelley is like Urania, who in one of
                        Romanticism’s most freakishly gothic scenes attempts to revive her son’s
                        corpse by, according to the post-Oedipal logic of Shelley’s poem,
                        re-seducing him. Beware of mothers who fetishize life. According to
                        Shelley’s psychoanalysis of the circuit of creative desire, having killed
                        the thing she loved, the mother attempts to re-ingest it in a kiss—a
                        word, as Khalip’s paper reminds us—that fills the mouth with desire’s
                        lost object. In this scenario what refuses to cede its desire is not woman,
                        but desire itself, or rather desire minus desire—sheer drive, the
                        mindlessness of words, which needs no object and instead wanders aimlessly
                        but irrevocably in its aimlessness. Despite its seemingly transcendental
                        trajectory, the poem laments Absolute Spirit, its dark and fearful affect
                        materializing the move past the loss of a history left behind once and for
                        all. In <title level="m">Hellas</title> (1822) when Mahmud describes “This
                        firmament pavilioned upon chaos” (772), we’re taken back to the future of
                            <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, which finds Shelley already unable
                        to resolve the empirical with the transcendental and thus begins a move
                        toward something like a Deleuzian horizon that unfolds the transcendence of
                        empiricism, the restlessly moving still point at which experience at once
                        appears and vanishes.</p>
                  <p>Put another way, the spectacle of <title level="m">Adonais</title>—
                        which includes a necrophilic muse, a poet acting like St. Sebastian, and a
                        finish that smacks of Busby Berkley, in which the “white radiance of
                        Eternity” (463) smashes the “dome of many-coloured glass” (462)—is a
                        mere tryout for <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Here the
                        products of history are continually folded into a sheer visuality that at
                        once materializes and dematerializes our lives. Urania as desire becomes the
                        Shape all light and “fire for which all thirst” (485), not as lost object
                        but as sheer drive. Shelley awakens us to the performance of history itself,
                        in which we “pant,” “sink,” “tremble,” and “expire” on a daily basis (<title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> 591). Here <title level="m">Triumph</title> anticipates the invention of the film musical form, but
                        fast-forwarded to versions that expose the insidious post-capitalist logic
                        of its visual and aural interpellation of our subjectivities, the endless
                        production and reproduction of perceptual information about the human
                        condition that leads us nowhere except along the infinite horizon of our
                        perpetual demise.<note place="foot" resp="author">I address these issues in

                        rhyme.</p>
                  <p>In a brief, brilliant analysis of the aesthetic in Freud and Lacan, Alenka
                        Zupančič, addressing the difference between the uncanny and comedy, argues
                        that whereas the uncanny tarries with possibility of the lost object’s
                        return as desire, comedy “point[s] to the irreducible materiality of
                        nothing” (59), by which she means, not the naming of nothing as ‘something’
                        in order to give it symbolic consistency, but rather the
                            “<emph>remainder</emph> of nothing, . . . nothing as insisting/emerging
                        in the real, while being deprived precisely of its symbolic support” (60).
                        This leaves nothing as a “‘mere hole,’ which is to say—an object. It
                        is a nothing that, literally, remains (there) to be seen” (71). Like the
                        gaze that cannot see itself, as Zupančič notes, thought cannot think itself,
                        hence, perhaps, for Shelley it “must remain untold.” For Zupančič this
                        paradox speaks to the “vitalism of the death drive. That is to say, the
                        vitalism of the internal <emph>contradiction</emph> of (human)
                            <emph>life</emph> itself. Far from referring to something in us that
                        ‘wants to die,’ or that aims at death and destruction, the Lacanian notion
                        of the death drive refers to an excess of life itself . . . the reason that
                        the subject can never be reduced to the horizon of her death” (74). The
                        death drive indicates not “that something of our life will go on living on
                        its own when we die” but rather “that <emph>something of our life lives on
                            its own as we speak</emph>,” the “logic of <emph>constitutive
                            dislocation</emph> (as immanent nothing)” (75).</p>
                  <p>In the last years before my mother passed away, just shy of 91, she would
                        repeatedly ask me, “Why am I still here?,” as if to rebut Carlotta’s defiant
                        anthem, “I’m Still Here,” from Stephen Sondheim’s <title level="m">Follies</title> (1971), for me one of the most moving and painful
                        evocations of what it means to risk love in response to the nothingness of
                        loss, and thus to risk the nothingness of love itself. My response: “I have
                        no idea.” And at that we would both laugh. She felt—she knew—she
                        was taking up space and time, and witnessing the reduced habits of her daily
                        existence, I could not disagree. On that count we were brutally, fatally,
                        happily frank with one another. I spent her final hours at her bedside in
                        the company of my man, a nurse, her son-in-law, all three of us tacitly
                        agreed on the need for and relief of acute palliation. As she drifted off
                        and away, he clinically, quietly, beautifully mapped out for me the
                        contraction and departure of life and warmth from her withered
                        extremities—sites of impossible contemplation—to a place I
                        imagine reduced to a still point somewhere around her heart and lungs. When
                        the departure was complete, and because through her eyes I learned how film
                        was one of the few ways to transform life’s dull round, I though of the end
                        of <title level="m">Adonais</title> re-imagined as the ending of Spielberg’s
                            <title level="m">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</title> (1977) when
                        the spaceship contracts to a still point in the sky, then shoots across the
                        horizon, far beyond the rainbow where suffering, decrepitude, hunger, and
                        intolerance plague what we so quaintly call the human condition. Unable ever
                        to know where life went at that moment, I also experienced what I imagine
                        Shelley imagined in his encounter with what “remained” of Rousseau, or what
                        Meillassoux means by an encounter with the fossil matter of ancestrality,
                        though not as Meillassoux intended it. Living past hope, contemplating an
                        “inability to account for a world outside of us without, paradoxically,
                        accounting for it,” my first thought, which is to say the thought that
                        emerges only once the dust and ash have settled, was: “I’m still here.” That
                        is to say, I felt “the vitalism of the internal <emph>contradiction</emph>
                        of (human) <emph>life</emph> itself.”</p>
                  <p>When Shelley, who drowned in the Bay of Lerici with <title level="m">The
                            Triumph of Life</title> unfinished, decided to ask, then, “What is
                        life?,” he was asking of a future whose shadows the poem casts upon our
                        present: Why are you here? Why are you doing this? What is the importance,
                        and devastation (again, pace Benjamin) of even asking the question in the
                        first place? Are you reading me? Do you care? Does it matter? Yet to mind
                        the gaps in the representation of historical reality—to miss something
                        another human being said (in this case, a rather capable poet)—might
                        just tell us something about our present (in)capacity <emph>to</emph> say.
                        When de Man drew our attention to the fact that Shelley’s dead and decaying
                        body, inscribed at the end of Shelley’s last manuscript, was as essential to
                        our understanding of the poem as the poem itself, he reminded us of what
                        still needed to be heard. To which I would add: what needs to be
                            <emph>felt</emph> about our present state of being, to which Khalip,
                        Fay, Pyle, Washington, and Wang remain exquisitely attuned by turning from
                        spectators to actors in the scene of the poem’s life that is the remainder
                        of nothing. How they express the soul of our intellectual lives feels rather
                        more urgent than it did at the time Khalip and I first libated. Let’s call
                        it a call simply but urgently to indulge in doing what we do: restlessly
                        examine the interpretive possibilities of responding to a great artist’s
                        response to the world, with the understanding that no one might care. As I
                        listen with careful and troubled attention to the question of what
                            <emph>should</emph> matter in our present climate, I’m compelled to ask,
                        why not this, at this present time? It can’t be any more consequential or
                        inconsequential. And now I leave my contributors to voice the virtual
                        reality of what it might mean and feel like to exist at once within and past
                        the Anthropocene. To them I say and thank God or the gods or whomever or
                        whatever might have orchestrated the situation to which this critical folly
                        responds: I’m glad you’re here – still. </p>

               <p rend="noCount">Focusing on the import of the last four lines of <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title>, <title level="a">Rhymes of Wonder: Otherness without Distortion</title> explores the
                    possible future that lies beyond the horizonal walling off of a triumphal Life that
                    Shelley’s poem describes. Using Deleuze and Guattari to follow the traces of where
                    dizzying speed can get us, the essay suggests that Shelley was headed with full
                    speed toward the post-human, breaking off only with the stumble that inevitably
                    occurs when human language fails to articulate what it cannot imagine. What remains
                    is sound, the aural-oral capacity that tunes us in to life itself, to a living
                    nature that cannot be captured by words yet within which we are thoroughly enmeshed.
                    This is the enlightenment that Shelley’s poem gestures toward, against optically
                    driven scientific knowledge; against the human condition as totalizing knowledge;
                    against the impermanence of the material. Whereas the main part of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                    considers forms of self-willing within the human experience,
                    it’s abandoned final lines suggest that Shelley intended to reread the alienating
                    aspects of that self-willing as the first steps toward an alternate otherness that,
                    in its beyondness, holds out the promise of a freedom from the human as a freedom
                    from the distortions of suffering per se.</p>

               <p> This article is a prolonged meditation on the last four lines of Shelley’s 
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, composed between May and June 1822,
                lines which begin to fragment with the occurrence of two ellipses, until the final
                “Of” that begins the fifth, uncompleted line midway though the final stanza Shelley
                wrote, leaving the poem unfinished at his death.<note place="foot" resp="author">All quotations from
                            <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> and

                  <title level="m">The Triumph</title> asks us to extend,
                extemporize, dwell in the dizzying rapidity of movement of life’s march of time.
                Rather than imagining this “triumph” as a slowed version of suffering and
                humiliation, enslavement to the imperial corporate body, Shelley imagines a vertigo
                of motion, a sweeping up of humanity into the vortex of a fateful present. This
                sense of intense movement begins with the first lines: “Swift as a spirit hastening
                to his task / . . . the Sun sprang forth” (1–2). Even though the imagery is
                apparently bright, it is darkened by the “mask / Of darkness,” which though falling
                with the Sun’s speedy approach, also prevaricates. For far from a mere masking of
                what is essentially bright with the dark, this mask is both the masque of darkness
                that will be the triumphal march of the Poet’s vision as a hideous parody of human
                life controlled by ideological oppressions, and a prelude to the dark imagery of the
                poem throughout. It is not long before the Poet’s vision, “that trance of wondrous
                thought” (41) which is a blind seeing rather than insight (for the Poet-I is
                confused by the spectacle until his guide, Rousseau, provides an interpretive key),
                beholds “a great stream / Of people . . . hurrying to and fro,”

            This is the temporality spaced by Derrida’s différance, the spacing of time best
                articulated through writing (and writing’s necessarily ideological inscription of
                our experience) that wards off the possibility of futurity through infinite
                recursion to the past. Later I will discuss how metalepsis functions in the poem to
                break from this recursive bondage to a blind historicity in which nothing is
                learned, only repeated. What the triumph represents is a veritable negative or
                negating infinity of time that wards off a possible future-to-come, not just
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">l’avenir</foreign> but “the urgency and imminence of an
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">à-venir</foreign>, a to-come. . . inflecting or turning into an
                injunction as well as into messianic waiting the <emph>a</emph> of a
                    différ<emph>a</emph>nce in disjunction” (Derrida,
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title> 108).<note place="foot" resp="author">Although this
                            is Derrida’s formulation of a futurity both imminent and insistently
                            waiting, I believe it is one that haunts Shelley’s late poetics and
                        <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> in
                    particular.</note> The problem the poem poses and begins to attempt to
                resolve is that of breaking the frame created by such a negative spacing, a spacing
                envisioned as an insane flight hemmed in by chaos and fear, so as to stage an
                eventfulness that could usher in a post-Anthropocenic seeing. Such
                seeing-without-distortion would mean a sightedness that is blind to the distortions
                of a self-serving logocentrism.<note place="foot" resp="author">It is this kind of
                    sightedness that I believe Derrida is after in both
                            <title level="m">Memoirs of the Blind</title> and <title level="m">The 
                                Animal That Therefore I Am</title>, and that Shelley
                            is after with his confessional and self-erasing portrait of Rousseau in
                                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>.</note> History,
                Shelley suggests, tells us nothing about the forces that corral us along this
                flightpath that turns back on itself in a temporality that goes nowhere, because we
                do not learn its lessons. But it is this horizon determined by the past—the horizon
                of finitude instantiated by différance and the automaticity of human reaction to
                anything finite—that Shelley puts in doubt by way of the poem’s dream state. Such
                doubt opens up the Enlightenment frame, with its insistently finite horizon
                developed from the history of western epistemology and political ideologies, to
                other possibilities, and I read Shelley’s unfinished poem as already enmeshed in a
                post-human turn. The poem’s project becomes, in the end, to discover a way out of
                the scientifism that had stalled thought in its seeking of an alternative to the
                negative structure of logical postulates, and to chart a path between Humean
                skepticism and a Kantian walling off of being—two philosophical attitudes that mark
                Shelley’s intellectual thought thus far, but against which the <title level="m">Triumph</title> 
                finally crashes in its last stanzas. It is in the poem’s
                provisional ending that an overleaping of the two positions begins to manifest.</p>
               <p> Shelley’s visionary poem, in the moment of its apparent crashing against the walls
                of Hume and Kant, wants to, desires to, locate in an epochal terminus an
                un-distortion of otherness. The terminating question Shelley asks in 
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, which the poem itself has asked
                throughout—“Then, what is Life?”—suggests the possibility that otherness-in-itself
                lies not on the other side of subjective, anthropocentric limitation and finitude,
                but elsewhere. This is a free-range understanding of Life that absorbs the human
                into it. Such an elsewhere would eschew the need to stage the contest between idea
                and substance, a contest Shelley sedulously avoids in his poetry (except in dark
                works such as <title level="m">The Cenci</title> (1819), but for a different purpose.
                This elsewhere imagines what Derrida’s democracy-to-come might inscribe anew. Or it
                might imagine this if the poem could be finished, could be differently written, if
                its terms could be thought.</p>
               <p> My interpretation of the question provisionally prompting the poem’s ending—a poem
                foreshadowed by the Poet asking “And what is this? / Whose shape is that within the
                car?” and Rousseau’s answer, “Life” (177–78, 180)—rests on a Derridean reading of
                the ghostly presence of its guide. Rousseau is marked by his “disguise” of “an old
                root” of “strange distortion”—recalling the “mask of darkness” that hides another
                version of what is there at the poem’s beginning (204, 182–83), but also indicating
                his having been marked by the distortions of the Derridean trace, the writing that
                rewrote Rousseau as a misguided corpus. In revisiting Derrida’s reading of Rousseau
                I hope to illuminate why it is this philosopher Shelley finally singles out from
                those he had considered equally as important in earlier drafts.<note place="foot" resp="author">

                scorn” (the scars of which he bears on his corpse-corpus) which “Led me and my
                companions” to resist the mad dance of Life (188–89, 191). Or rather, Rousseau and
                his few companions have scorned the machinations of the arche-trace, the insistent
                rewriting of which the poem accuses “those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire, / Frederic,
                and Kant, Catherine, and Leopold, / Chained hoary anarchs, demagogue and sage”
                (235–37). In <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> Derrida is less kind to
                Rousseau, seeing him as being one of the spoilers, but nevertheless granting the
                philosopher pride of place as the middle term between Plato and Hegel for his
                foreseeing analysis of logocentrism as the erasure of presence through writing, the
                animal-machine of reading and rewriting that is our automaticity, our reactive
                blindness. Écriture allies us in our auto-blindness with the four-faced, eye-banded
                charioteer of Shelley’s triumphal car, the figuration of Life itself, since like him
                we cannot see beyond the perimeter of our own insistent spacing and deferrals of any
                possible future.</p>
               <p>Derrida’s reading of Rousseau’s importance rests on a grammatology as all that can be
                thought within the limits of the scientific épistémè; indeed, within the limits of
                the Anthropocene. But I suggest that <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> asks
                Rousseau to help move the dream vision beyond such perimeters, into a different
                plane with a different horizonal potential. In <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                Rousseau acts as the speaker’s Virgil, interpreting the pageant, discovering its
                trace and spectrally pointing a finger to a different horizon unconditioned by
                scientifism’s rejection of passion as way of knowing. But for Derrida, Rousseau is
                always unsettled by his incorporation of the supplement into a theory of human
                nature, always undone by passion’s unsettling priority over need. Despite Rousseau’s
                attempts to settle passion into its place, passion’s prewriting in the business of
                survival and articulation becomes, in Rousseau’s anthropological scheme, inverted
                (articulation as subdivision of sound and meaning, understanding and reason, that is
                “the opening and closure of a cleft” [Johnson 128], according to Derrida, or the
                making of a judgment). The <title level="a">Essay on the Origin of Languages</title> (1743) asserts love’s
                role in the immediacy of touch (versus the mediacy of gesture), and love’s role in
                inventing drawing as well as, plausibly, language (“Love might also have invented
                speech”)—but if it is need that in general motivates language, “Dissatisfied with
                speech, love disdains it” (Rousseau 240–41). However, pity is the passion more
                befitting Shelley’s Rousseau; pity is the moderation of amour-propre (self-love,
                which is a corruption of amour de soi, love of self) into compassion. If the <title level="a">Essay</title>
                places judgment before pity, the <title level="m">Second Discourse</title> (1754)
                makes pity anterior to reflection. Thus need (in which reflection prompts the
                preservation of the species) follows passion (love of self, self-love, and pity),
                communication displaces sympathetic communion. Shelley’s spectral vision shows the
                detrimental effects of not following this scheme—of species preservation distorted
                by language’s death-grip, of self-love’s violence absorbed into linguistic warping.
                Rousseau makes this point explicit: “What the ancients said most forcefully they
                expressed not in words, but in signs; they did not say it, they showed it” (<title level="a">Essay</title>
                241). Language as the first social institution, according to Rousseau, is founded as
                a distancing trope, as not just sign but metaphoricity, with the need to communicate
                by gesture logically displacing the passion of an immediate touch and voice,
                following after it (“the needs dictated the first gestures, and the passions wrung
                the first utterings [<foreign xml:lang="fr">voix</foreign>]” [245]). This unsettling, in which
                need overrides passion only to install death into language as distance and metaphor
                rather than touching intimacy, disturbs the provenance and authority of signs
                (articulation and writing are the malady of language, it’s “fatal advantage,”<note place="foot" resp="author">Rousseau uses this phrase to describe writing’s supplementation of both speech and
                            music, quoted in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 199.</note>
                    and if “the most vigorous speech is that in which the Sign has
                said everything before a single word is spoken,” too often symbols lose their
                meaning and power to the condemning inefficacy of “circumlocutions” [241]). Rousseau
                therefore distrusts words as he does not the accentuation of music, and the musical
                intonation of poetic speech, both of which are more originary and less dangerous
                than writing because less destructive of presence (the very thing “Life” robs from
                human being in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>): “The speech of the first men . .
                . were Poet’s languages” (245). But for Shelley, if poetics is grounded in musical
                intonation, <emph>poesis</emph> is grounded in the affiliation of sound
                with metaphoricity, in the sound’s affinity in relation to the sign’s differential
                potency, its gesticulatory capacity—indeed, in its imaginative intimacy. 
                    <emph>Poesis</emph> as allegory—as resounding metaphoricity—provides the
                only recuperation of presentful meaning possible in the face of language’s
                onto-theological death-grip (a fate Shelley sees as written on Rousseau’s
                body/corpus before his conversion by confession).<note place="foot" resp="author">I refer to both Rousseau’s <title level="m">Confessions</title>
                    and to his confessionary narrative
                            that consumes Shelley’s poem. On the intimacy of sound and metaphor, and
                            their relation to the idea, see Reiman’s

               <p> That Shelley, an astute deconstructionist before the fact, would choose Rousseau to
                interpret life’s pageant puts into question Rousseau’s idealization of love’s power,
                of life’s perverting evil, and of shadows. In Derrida’s terms the first two are
                <emph>eidos</emph> and <emph>ousia</emph>, ideality and
                substantiality; shadows encompass the enfolding of one with the other, the
                space-time of otherness.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                     <emph>Ousia</emph> is also translated as <emph>being</emph>, but 
                    Derrida specifies substantiality as Rousseau’s
                    understanding of the term (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>
                            18–26).</note> What is less doubtful than Rousseau’s
                idealizations is his facility with the legible, with locating and reading
                (interpreting rather than deciphering) the trace at the site of supplementarity.
                This is the site for Rousseau, Derrida argues, of unease, suture, inversion, and
                perversion. But Shelley’s Rousseau offers a different instruction; rather than point
                back to origins, his ghostly finger-pointing gestures not 
                <emph>toward</emph> so much as <emph>beyond</emph> current epistemic limits;
                predictive, pre-vocative, provoking an elsewhere as a way out of the metaphysical
                trap of signs and beyond the Anthropocene. If Rousseau himself saw gesture as less
                meaningful than either touching voice or metaphor, it is because it is also less
                immediate, but Shelley’s Rousseau points intimately and tellingly otherwise—at once
                confessional and prophetic. The lines, “Before the chariot had begun to climb / The
                opposing steep of that mysterious dell, / Behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme”
                (469–71), indicate the nature of this beyondness which is not the supplement but
                rather its abolishment; the wonderment of rhyme is exactly its inscription of
                accentuation, music, and most importantly, passion—“the wondrous story / How all
                things are transfigured, except Love” (476). Shelley asks us to follow the index of
                this passionate trace as it avoids inversion, perversion, transfiguration, and
                supplementation, since it names the absorptive beyondness that the poem’s breaking
                off cannot or does not yet know how to inscribe, but toward which, with Rousseau’s
                help, it gestures.</p>
               <p> Such a gesticulation is necessary to ward off the blindness, the necessary
                not-seeing, that Derrida takes as the essence of philosophical discourse without
                which the aporias of the metaphysical tradition cannot be overcome, yet it is a
                willful blinding that prevents the leap out of, and beyond, the épistémè. Shelley
                has already understood this in making Rousseau not blind but hollow-eyed, “And that
                the holes it [he] vainly sought to hide / Were or had been eyes” (187–188). The
                philosopher-seer’s eyeless state is precisely what allows him to guide the
                poet-dreamer in “forbear[ing] / To join the dance” of “this sad pageantry” (188,
                176), and in forbearing the Poet might then refuse the auto-machine of a discourse
                that closes down on itself. Derrida’s designation of what he calls the
                animal-machine of reading and rewriting that reacts with automaticity is essential
                to his concept of the trace as the infrastructural articulation of the arche-trace,
                or interdependence of self and Other without which presence cannot be conceived. It
                is the interplay between the self and its objects presumed essential to human
                self-consciousness, but that Shelley might view as essential to an unconditional
                hospitality, an open-door policy with regard to the unconsciousness’ or visionary
                state’s capacity to witness suffering as the condition for the possibility of
                change, and therefore of futurity. In <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> the
                trace of writing does not produce what for Derrida is the double finitude of the
                animal-machine of écriture, but rather creates fault lines and openings in that
                structure, fragmentations and ellipses, open doors as it were. The visionary state,
                which elevates the poet-speaker into what Kant, in one of his rare non-despoiling
                moments, considers the highest stage of beautiful art, enables a poetry in which the
                sublime interacts with the beautiful, moves beyond the unlawful freedom of the
                imagination adjudicated by the lawful restraint of the understanding—although not
                perhaps beyond the infusion of both with spirit so essential to a lingual art that
                delivers more than it promises, as Kant notes—making it thus more moral than the
                other arts (<title level="m">Critique of Judgement</title> [1790] §51).</p>
               <p> Shelley’s most moral poem, a quality noted even by Mary Shelley who appeared not to
                like the poem, pushes beyond a mere liminality ordained by the sublime register. Its
                transgressiveness suggests the violence inherent in a sacrificial structure. The
                structural ploy I have in mind is Derrida’s concept of autoimmunity as the
                auto-immunitary function that mediates a supposedly untenable open or unconditional
                hospitality, a welcoming that puts the self at risk. This is not the threat of the
                sublime but that of sacrifice as what holds sovereignty up: sacrificial
                indemnification. The sacrifice of objects and others is what enables the
                auto-immunitary function that closes opened doors and protects the subject and its
                proper/properties. What gets sacrificed in the poem is not just the endless stream
                of suffering humanity hurried on by a frenzied cosmogony, the very essence of a
                sovereignty gone mad with its own immunitary logic; populations are sacrificed so
                that the door to futurity remains firmly closed. </p>
               <p> Shelley’s response, I am arguing, to the free-wheeling auto-machine of
                logocentrically grounded sovereignty is to imagine the advent of the future-to-come.
                His imagining cannot be of an ideal republication state, as is Rousseau’s in 
                <title level="m">The Social Contract</title> (1762), nor may it be of the impossible
                event of an unconditional democracy as the truth of the other, as is Derrida’s in
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title> (2005). Instead, Shelley’s poem prepares for the
                possibility of an unforeseeable future beyond the horizon of state ideology, a
                horizon containing all of western history and epistemology since Plato. To imagine a
                horizonal “beyond” is not to envision a distinct event as such (e.g. revolution),
                nor an “outside” impervious to the auto-immunity of the political machine which
                casts itself as “Life.” It is rather to imagine the leap to a new plane of immanence
                made possible, according to Deleuze and Guattari, by a new idea. This evental idea
                or philosophical concept must go beyond the truth-idea of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> 
                (1820), love as a revolutionary force, since <title level="m">The Triumph</title> 
                announces no program of patient waiting after
                Rousseau has imparted his revelation to the Poet. Indeed, the idea ushering in the
                to-come may not be open to articulation, as the disintegration of language in the
                final lines indicates.</p>
               <p>In the auto-immunitary machine epitomized in the Car of Life, suffering is the
                predominant human experience. Rousseau, hovering in the ectoplasm of
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> and bearing the marks of that
                suffering on his body, represents by his oeuvre the lawfulness of the understanding
                interceding in the unlawful freedom of the imagination. Such remediation is of
                course problematized by the autobiographical Rousseau’s unaccountable outrages of
                taste in his ongoing self-psychoanalysis, but these disappear along with his fleshly
                form in the poem, where his corpus stands in for a Derridean “auto-immune
                auto-indemnification” that authorizes sovereignty at every level (Derrida, 
                <title level="m">Acts of Religion</title> 78).<note place="foot" resp="author">Derrida develops this concept more fully
                            in <title level="m">Acts of Religion</title> as what underlies the
                            doubled-nature of “identity,” which not only includes and excludes, but
                            “ex-propriates” and “re-appropriates,” that is, “ex-appropriates” (78).
                            He analyzes the concept more simply as “auto-immunity” in 
                    <title level="m">Rogues</title>.</note> But dead, ghost-like,
                Rousseau’s role in sacrificial indemnification is revised by way of his own dead
                body marginalized from the multitudes in Shelley’s dream-vision. This vision
                produces an altered state, a poetic possibility in which sovereignty is unveiled as
                a mad careen destined to slam up against the walls of its own horizon; the
                alteration makes possible a different plane in which doors might open, in which an
                unconditional hospitality does not usher others in to the spaces of the proper, but
                rather welcomes the ground of the possibility of a futurity not yet imagined. The
                unlawfulness of the imagination is not, as Kant believed, an ugliness not subject to
                the dictates of taste, but rather the dismissal of a necessary adjudication of
                justice by law. For Shelley, law can only be evil by referring justice to the
                dictates of pragmatism, the proper of the subject self, and sovereignty. How can
                what might only be called an immunitary rationale for limiting the application of
                justice ever ground a futurity at all? We might view this as the difference between
                a marriage that necessarily mediates love by way of pragmatism, and a free love that
                opens the door to an unimagined relation, to a commingling without adjudication, to
                a truth without a past. Such an analogy might indeed sit behind the inexplicable
                poor taste of the poem to Jane probably written before two-thirds of 
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> had been completed.<note place="foot" resp="author">

               <p>The implications of a new plane of immanence—inaugurated by the evental idea as
                having to do, for Shelley, with freedom, democracy, and the unconditional (perhaps a
                democracy-at-hand),—and the possibilities for a post-human turn in such a plane;
                this is a prospect at which language falters and poetic sound and metaphor can only
                carry partially inscribed meanings. However, in these falterings I believe Shelley
                is struggling to sound out his vision for a more humane, if less
                logo-onto-anthropocentric, futurity. To think the ending of the poem, I want to
                return to the implications of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>’s maddened
                and dizzying progress. That speed is essential to a new plane of immanence
                developing. One of the ways to speed up while still inhabiting the structures of the
                past is metalepsis, the two-at-once of metaphoric achievement. If metaphor provides
                an analogous relation, a side-by-side correspondence of idea and impression,<note place="foot" resp="author">This is Reiman’s reading of Shelley’s use of metaphor: idea corresponds
                            analogously to impression, but not to object or to thing-in-itself

                metalepsis imposes an inverted correspondence in which
                logic skews otherwise. The possibility opened up by the dizzying movement of the
                triumph, by way of its reversion to the past, begins to dissolve not into a metonymy
                but into a metalepsis, in which two tropes at once—a doubled metaphoricity (the
                fading coal <emph>and</emph> the mind’s inconstant wind of the poetic
                imagination in Shelley’s <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> [1821]
                [531])—oppose the double finitude of écriture by “reconfiguring the relationship
                between a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ an anteriority and what this anteriority makes
                possible or forecloses,” as Kir Kuiken explains, allowing the imagination, or we
                might say the poetic dream state, to be the site-source of “ever-changing future
                alterations” (171). Metalepsis as the poetic device by which the future can open up
                by way of the past—rather than via metonymy’s side-by-side logic—becomes in 
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> the condition of the possibility of a new plane
                with a new horizonal opening to the future. I am imagining Shelley imagining Deleuze
                and Guattari’s plane of immanence, wherein the speed of thought is made possible by
                the constellation of the event to come configured in the evental concept.<note place="foot" resp="author">For Deleuze the event is epiphenomenal, spoken in the proposition; “The concept
                            speaks the event, not the essence or the thing” (<title level="m">What
                                is Philosophy?</title> 20). See esp. pp. 35–60.</note> It is
                this concept, this eventful thought, which opens the poem’s horizon to a positive
                infinite, to a futurity that can be thought without the trace, albeit not without a
                repurposing of the past and its necessary conceptual contributions. The dizzying
                vision of the pageant is accessible to the speaker-poet as insight, so that “speed
                in the van and blindness in the rear” which brings the suffering multitudes so
                “little profit” offers the speaker a way into an undistorted and thus possible
                futurity (Shelley 101, 100). </p>
               <p>Access to this futurity requires a variant eye, for blindness is the cancellation of
                what makes representation possible. Not blindedness, as in the charioteer, but the
                cancelling of sight, like Rousseau’s hollowed eyes, is the condition of seeing out
                of this world, Life as it is. Although Rousseau gestures toward the past, he is the
                guiding hand in the poem toward an as-yet to be represented future. As Derrida
                notes, portraits of the blind are “prey to <emph>allegory</emph>,” the
                allegory of drawing as a “specular folding” or “withdrawal [<foreign xml:lang="fr">retrait</foreign>] 
                in meaning of itself,” whereas language “always speaks to us 
                <emph>from / of the blindness</emph> that constitutes it” (<title level="m">Memoirs of 
                    the Blind</title> 2–4).<note place="foot" resp="author">David Farrell Krell’s meditation on
                            Derrida’s meditation, <title level="m">The Purest of Bastards</title>, has
                            informed my understanding of blindness as having a different knowledge
                            structure.</note> Shelley makes clear that such
                blindness—specular folding or blindfoldedness—is the condition of life as well as of
                language. For Rousseau, as Derrida reads him in <title level="m">Of
                    Grammatology</title>, the contamination of nature’s purity is already enfolded
                within nature; thus, everything associated with the human that Rousseau designates a
                supplement is already enfolded in nature, including the sign. Similarly, the
                possibility of a future, not as a blind acquiescence and error in judgment, but
                rather as the sublime <emph>yes</emph> of an unconditional welcoming of
                the yet-to-come is also enfolded, a <foreign xml:lang="fr">repli</foreign> of the
                outside/future is always folding over into the origin of life. But Shelley does not
                “read” Rousseau: in allowing him to tell his recursive tale of conversion, he
                portrays him allegorically, allowing him the specular folding of seeing otherwise.
                He does so because the problem for Shelley is how to welcome such a future without
                deferral, without supplement—or at least, with a different relation to the outside
                and otherness. For this, the Rousseau who Shelley depicts is helpful. What Derrida
                calls spacing, or the endless deferral of meaning, is a scuttling back and forth in
                the differentiating machine of language that, if unattended, also blinds us to just
                how non-meaningful a life lived can be; it enables the headlong careen of the
                pageant of Shelley’s allegory of unmeaning life. The differentiating machine can
                only under extraordinary circumstances leverage the scuttling of meaning into the
                dizzy rapidity of thought that energizes a new plan of thought, a plane of
                    immanence.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            The plane of immanence is “the horizon of events,” or evental concepts:
                            “The plane of immanence is not a concept that is or can be thought but
                            rather the image of thought, the image thought gives itself of what it
                            means to think” which stands in contrast to “the slow brain” (Deleuze
                            and Guattari, <title level="m">What is Philosophy?</title> 36–37).</note>
                It is such a plane, such an immanence, that Shelley’s poem invokes but cannot see in
                its last elliptical lines. But it is what Rousseau, by gesturing toward the past,
                helps Shelley’s speaker metaleptically envision, if only in its barest contours, as
                the cliff walls of wondrous rhyme. </p>
               <p>“What is Life?” Shelley’s speaker asks, struggling blindly with the
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">repli</foreign> of death into Life, the supplemental sacrifice that protects and
                indemnifies life.<note place="foot" resp="author">See Ross Wilson, <title level="m">Shelley and the
                                Apprehension of Life</title>.</note> Reiman notes that the
                <title level="a">Essay on Life</title> was “perhaps the most important single document of Shelley’s
                intellectual development” (<title level="m">Shelley’s <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title>
                  </title> 12). The essay divides the immutable celestial realm from the terrestrial,
                necessity-driven world; it provides a cosmology to house Shelley’s purposefully
                chosen array of symbols, but <title level="m">The Triumph</title> asks about a different
                conception of life: what is <emph>Life</emph>? This is the question the
                post-human turn posits, since there is no longer possible an illusory tying of
                origin and life to certain biological forms, while sentience itself has become less
                definable. Shelley’s possible future, predicated on opening the door to a new plane
                of immanence, holds open the possibility that a just world without suffering might
                be possible. Shelley the vegetarian might have embodied such a world with
                non-objectified subjects that, regardless of their species, would not be required to
                supplement the idea of justice with their suffering. Such a world, however, would
                have to be free of the deferral or spacing of writing. Of the endless play of
                differentiation that inscribes the world we know. To depict a different world, one
                not yet visible, would require a new writing without deferral, hierarchy, origin
                fables, distinctions that wound. For Shelley, such a world could not yet be
                written—but the ellipses, the “. . .” that punctuate the last portion of the poem he
                <emph>did</emph> write, mark where the leaping off
                into a new writing might occur, where a new concept might gather itself for an event
                to come of wondrous rhyme and otherness without distortion.</p>
               <p>It is this last impossible concept, arising from the dismantled self of Shelley’s
                later thought, of the impossible possibility of otherness without distortion (a
                radical otherness against which language falters) which coheres with the
                unspeakablility of an impossible future. A new plane of immanence requires the event
                to come, the unpredictable and thus unspeakable event, which might recall before the
                fact what must not be said (or, what might be too terrible to be said). This is the
                gamble, the leap of blind faith into the future that Shelley’s vision demands.
                Again, it demands it blind-fully, and unvoicedly.</p>
               <p>I want to move in three directions at this point (a point is a departure that permits
                new paths to the horizonal limit—and it is the limit at which Jean-Luc Nancy says
                that freedom begins in <title level="m">The Experience of Freedom</title>). First,
                blind faith recollects Derrida’s ruminations on allegories of the blind; second,
                unvoicedness resonates with both Plato’s khora and Derrida’s engagement with
                apophasis (the voiceless voice)—both blind faith and apophasis also have
                associations with Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing and gesticulations; and finally an
                impossible futurity gestures toward Nancy’s and Derrida’s articulations on freedom
                at the limits of experience. I cannot do justice to all of these; rather, I want to
                fold in these more recent mediations with Shelley’s perspicacious, pliable, and
                concise weaving of blindness, faithfulness, unvoicedness, limits, futurity and
                freedom in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>.</p>
               <p>In <title level="m">Rogues</title> Derrida defines the khora politically: meaning
                originally “locality in general,” khora designates “spacing, interval . . . another
                ‘taking-place’” that Plato conceptualizes in the <title level="m">Timaeus</title> (c.
                350 BCE), but also a beforehand, “a spacing from ‘before’ the world . . . from
                ‘before’ any chronophenomenology” (xiv). The irony of our world is that it is
                precisely the khora-interval that allows “anthropotheological dogmatism or
                historicity” to take place without “providing any ground or foundation” (xiv); khora
                “would make or give <emph>place</emph>” (xiv). In this retrospective
                placement of the politico-theological and historicized now, Derrida nevertheless
                posits khora’s relation to the anticipatory function: it is “before everything,”
                part of no-thing while giving rise to what is, “it would give rise or allow to take
                place” (xiv). It is therefore, perhaps metaleptically, the very stuff of what is to
                come, and perforce related to “the unforeseeability of an event that is necessarily
                without horizon, the singular coming of the other, and, as a result, a 
                <emph>weak force</emph>. This vulnerable force, this force without power,
                opens up unconditionally to what or who <emph>comes</emph> and comes to
                affect it” (xiv). Because the khora is fully other in its non-being, in its spatial
                anticipation, it offers a place in which futurity can begin to be thought—but not
                the space of that futurity, and this is Shelley’s point. It is only at the limits
                that futurity can even be gestured toward. </p>
               <p>Shelley begins that gesture even before Rousseau points his finger. The problem in
                the poem’s opening stages is that of the multitude following the arrogantly
                blind-ful charioteer: suffering as they are in their maddened dance, they are
                themselves “the truth of the other, heterogeneity, . . . disseminal multiplicity,
                the anonymous ‘anyone,’ the ‘no matter who,’ the indeterminate ‘each one’” that is
                the other truth of democracy (or liberality, or freedom) that opposes the autonomy
                and ipseity that we hold dear to democracy (Derrida, <title level="m">Rogues</title>
                14). To see these whirling and convulsed dancers as suffering, and as heteronomic
                rather than a blind and frenzied mob is to begin to distinguish genius (embodied in
                Rousseau, albeit skeletally) from the no-matter-who of a future-to-come. This is the
                gesture already in place by the time Rousseau appears pronouncing “Life,” so that
                the speaker-I must begin again, “But first, who art thou?” (180, 199). First causes
                cannot be the grounds of freedom, and Rousseau’s explanations cause the speaker-I to
                understand that “God made irreconcilable / Good and the means of good” (230–31).
                Kant who himself delved the abyss of freedom is included in “those spoilers
                spoiled,” which also include Voltaire (235), those reasoners and mechanists who have
                brought on the “Sorrow, terror, anguish, despair . . . [that] are often the chosen
                expressions of an approximation to the highest good” (Shelley, 
                    <title level="m">Defence</title> 529). Such a future-to-come must, by the stopping point of
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, open up to the whoever-comes and not just the
                select few and self-chosen. The courage required to welcome such a future is
                wrenching; its unvoicedness both compels, in the sense of the apophatic call, and
                stops short, in the sense of an illegible moment. In both cases language fails, as
                it does for the multitude whose frenzy is all that can be expressed; the future must
                be wrenched from the past at such a point, it must exceed the promise held by all
                pastness and go beyond the breaking point. </p>
               <p>Frenzy, then, must be part of the breaking of the limit, the push beyond the grounds
                of the triumphal careen. That the speaker stands apart from both the multitude and
                the frenzy does not preclude his taking part in futurity, a partaking that may
                already be beginning with the fragmentation of words into ellipses. As Derrida
                notes, “<emph>ellipsis</emph> names not only lack but a curved figure with
                more than one focus. We are thus already tween the ‘minus one’ and the ‘more than
                one’” which is “<emph>the time there is not</emph>” (<title level="m">Rogues</title> 1).
                The time there is not, which may be the escape from finitude
                for Shelley, is at least in terms of <title level="m">The Triumph</title> the
                possibility of an impossible future. Such an impossibility requires dizziness to be
                sure. It also requires blind faith, “Fidelity to come, to the to-come, to the
                future” (Derrida, <title level="m">Rogues</title> 4). There is
                reason for this since the “to-come of democracy is also, although without presence,
                the <foreign xml:lang="la">hic et nunc</foreign> of urgency, of the injunction as absolute
                urgency” (29). Such urgency demands a leap into the to-come, possibly even a new
                now. That is to say, a new plane of immanence that cannot be foreseen or even seen
                at all during its formation: a dizzying something which requires hollow-eyed
                determination without the possibility of prediction. </p>
               <p>Significantly, the Poet’s encounter with Rousseau, and Rousseau’s narrative take up
                the majority of the poem. As the Poet and reader learn about Rousseau’s encounters
                with the “Shape all light” (308–433), we also learn that he has been translated by
                that shape, becoming increasingly hollowed out. He is metamorphosed, in de Man’s
                words, to a state “in which his brain, the center of his consciousness, is
                transformed” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 99). Whereas Rousseau’s recurring focus is on the
                “Shape all light,” de Man reads the Poet as avoiding the shape-light through his
                narrative fragmentation at the unsubstantial end or leaving off of the poem. Such a
                reading suggests the ending might be unsubstantial in the sense of a dissolving
                substance akin to what de Man describes as the light’s “hovering motion” (<title level="a">Shelley
                Disfigured</title> 105), or it might be insubstantial (not a fading dissolve but an
                incorporeality). While both are plausibly true, and the poem itself plausibly
                readable as a problem of the specular fold that enables rather than prohibits
                insight (“Happy those for whom the fold / Of” are the last words of the poem),
                <note place="foot" resp="author">I refer here to Gilles Deleuze’s reading 
                of Leibniz’s system in <title level="m">The Fold</title>.</note> the ending also contains the kernel of
                the whole poem—not as fragment but as ellipses, as points of departure for a leaping
                out of the spatio-temporal horizon of the poem. De Man is largely concerned with
                language in the poem, both as rhetorical figure and as disfiguration, but as
                Rousseau himself points out in his essays on language, time is the essential medium
                of language creation. De Man recalls Rousseau’s (and Levi-Strauss’s) theories of
                language in writing about the violent linguistic acts that occur in the poem, each
                more damaging than the violence depicted in the triumphal parade itself; the poem is
                eventually revealed to be a “mutilated textual model [that] exposes the wound of a
                fracture” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 120). It is a wound that de Man finds at the heart
                of all texts, although Shelley might want the fracture traced back to the collusion
                of writing and ideology rather than mitigate the potential for poetic language to
                burst its bounds. But Rousseau and Levi-Strauss were more of de Man’s opinion; as
                Derrida notes, what the father of Romanticism and the father of structuralist
                anthropology (who declared himself to be “Rousseau’s modern disciple”) comprehend in
                their fraught relation to writing and presence is that the violence that language
                suffers in writing is not a “disease” inherent in speech and not separable from it
                that precipitates its fall, but rather “the original violence of a language which is
                always already a writing” (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 105–6). But the
                violence is in itself a disease, a genetic self-destruct mechanism and it is this
                disease that Shelley’s poem narrates. Neither Rousseau’s writings nor the voiced
                narrative embedded in the poem remain, or rather count, by <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title>’s end. Counting is how Shelley’s fragmentary ending records
                language’s demise; its self-violence is played out neither as the figure of a
                hollowed-out (diseased) Rousseau nor as his “recapitulative” narrative in which
                logic dissipates,<note place="foot" resp="author">This is de Man’s phrase, <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title>
                    103.</note> but as language’s final failure to capture through
                anything but its own erasure—its ellipses—what might speak itself beyond “Life”’s
                horizon. </p>
               <p>This ellipses is related to Rousseau’s hollowing out: diseased by the light’s erasure
                of his self-consciousness, of his presence as writing and as predecessor figure,
                Rousseau himself is reduced to a periodic gesture, like beats in a measure rather
                than Cartesian stopping points (for Descartes, points stop things dead; Shelley’s
                Rousseau continues to move after death). Translated by the light into an ellipsis of
                himself, Rousseau’s hollowing is of his self-presence, his consciousness as center
                of self; he thus sets the stage in the poem for the transfiguration (not
                translation) of the narrative at the end into ellipses. Derrida writes that the
                “other ellipsis of the metaphysics or onto-theology of the logos” is the “effort to
                master absence by reducing metaphor within the absolute parousia of sense”
                (<title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 106). “Onto-theology” is, importantly, the
                very beast Shelley is trying to eradicate in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>; for
                Shelley this is the real disease of language, subjectivity, self-consciousness, and
                knowledge that creates the horizonal parameters of a “Life” that enslaves us. To
                imagine reducing or dissolving metaphor into sensory presence (absolute parousia) is
                to elide the pronunciative function of language, its rhythms and beats matching the
                rhythms and movement of sensory presence. In the
                <title level="m">Essay</title> Rousseau had pronounced language
                to be the first social institution (219), but as such it is a disfiguration that
                cannot hold in its literalization of meaning, its denial of language’s capacity for
                metaphoricity, for figuring truth. As de Man notes in <title level="a">Anthropomorphism and Trope in
                the Lyric,</title> “truth is a trope.”<note place="foot" resp="author">

                    Quoted in Cynthia Chase’s <title level="a">Double-Take.</title> The reference is to
                            truth-statements as philosophemes, but for Shelley truths are poetic
                            tropes, metaphoricity.</note> Rousseau’s translation from
                self-consciousness into a forgotten selfhood is accompanied by metaphors for light
                that offer little narrative reason; their illogic exposes the absence language
                covers over, stripping away the onto-theology Rousseau himself had come to figure
                and revealing another truth.</p>
               <p>Metaphor, Derrida notes in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title>, is irreducible
                despite all attempts at mastery (allegory is decidedly metaphoric in this sense)
                (106); de Man proves this irreducibility in his reading of the “Shape all light,”
                and its own narrative logic. More intriguingly, interpreting Rousseau’s history of
                illuminating confessions by way of metalepsis—as a metaleptic recursiveness—allows
                for the movement that will transform or curve itself into the new evental idea of a
                possible democracy that is without logocentric, androcentric, and anthropocentric
                distortion, and thus a new paradigm. This movement is the leap to a new plane of
                immanence at the poem’s ending. De Man notes that the question and answer enacted by
                the figures of Rousseau and the Poet (the question of “‘whence I came, and where I
                am, and why—’” in line 398, accompanied by the same vision) is that of “a question
                whose meaning, as question, is effaced from the moment it is asked,” in the
                structure of a forgetting (98). For de Man, this repeating pattern of question,
                effacement, and forgetting (rather than question and answer) functions like a knot
                that “arrests the process of understanding” (98). For Shelley, Rousseau the writer
                has, “in a sense . . . overcome the discrepancy of action and intention that tears
                apart the historical world, and he has done so because his words have acquired the
                power of actions as well as of the will.” His words “literally, are actions” (de Man
                103). But <title level="m">Triumph</title> undermines this
                understanding of historical intervention, change, and dialectical movement. Rousseau
                is himself faulted for not valuing history’s truths, but not because history must be
                taken as dialectically progressive—rather, because of its evidentiary and repeating
                truths. If Rousseau’s arrestingly ineffective language in the poem is read
                metaleptically, in which the cause substitutes for the effect, truth may be
                achievable, for in this way history and the future are exchangeable. The question
                cannot have an answer, since the answer can go both forward and backward; more
                importantly, in classical rhetoric metalepsis creates a passage from one context to
                another, effecting a change in terms or of formula that opens up a third way. We
                might say, it is the movement of the energy from one plane of immanence to another,
                that which enables the event that announces change. In <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title>, that event is the chariot careening toward the chasm wall of
                wondrous rhyme; it is announced, but not comprehensibly articulated as an evental
                idea for the rhyme is not legible in the terms that hold sway before the leap it
                announces. Promising everything, like the Shape all light, the wondrous rhyme
                signifies potentiality, both as the power of creative language and as the power of
                significant movement that opposes the recursive forgetting of Rousseau’s and the
                Poet’s “why?” and the enslaving movement of the chariot’s triumph. </p>
               <p>Without making a connection between the effacement of history and of
                self-consciousness and that of counting in language, de Man does suggest that the
                Shape all light is inextricably bound to the natural beats of human consciousness,
                as we know these through the hovering, glimmering intermodal qualities of light and
                water, and the rhythms of measure and poetic language. The first two phenomena
                signify the “birth of form as the interference of light and water passes” (de Man,
                <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 107), whereas the second two signify formalization. Counting
                (or natural rhythm or energy and movement as periodic units) is what is common to
                all four modalities; and counting is a way of signifying without the
                representational limits of signs or a blindness to metaphor. Shelley goes further,
                with measure in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> obliterating thought, as de Man
                notes (114). For Rousseau in the <title level="m">Second Discourse</title>, measure or
                counting functions in both dance and music as a more primary and primitive medium
                than the sight/light medium of the image and sign, which comes later as touching is
                replaced by the distance of gesture and then drawing.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    Derrida discusses these ideas in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 229–55.</note>
                Counting comes down to points of measure, of comprehension, of community. In
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> Shelley shows light as the
                scene of what de Man calls “optical confusion” (106), which we might call image
                confusion, in echo of the vision that is delusory for its participants, diffusive
                for community, and difficult for the spectator Poet to interpret. “The thematization
                of language in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> occurs,” de Man
                notes, “when ‘measure’ separates from the phenomenal aspects of signification as a
                specular <emph>representation</emph>, and stresses instead the literal and
                material aspects of language,” adding that “it is precisely these ‘feet’ [of the 
                <foreign xml:lang="it">terza rima</foreign>] which extinguish and bury the poetic and
                philosophical light” (113). This literalization of language that ignores metaphor,
                this death of poetic capacity and of an originary communication, is precisely what
                Rousseau finds to be the history of language as a whole. For Shelley it is the
                history of western political ideology as well.</p>
               <p>In Rousseau’s highly political theory of language’s origins as developed in
                <title level="m">Essay on the Origins of Language</title> (1781), metaphor and
                music were early on prone to instability. He posits a geographical development of
                language, such that in northern regions the passions and desire are substituted and
                repressed by work and the need that provokes it; passion there takes the form of
                violent emotions, of fury, and speech turns toward articulation and away from
                tonality and musical speech. Writing is therefore “at the north” where articulation
                is heightened; writing allows for history, which “hollows out” both vowel accent and
                articulation, “extending the power of writing (Rousseau 226). “Our tongues,”
                Rousseau notes in the <title level="a">Essay,</title> “are better suited to writing than speaking,” an
                observation noteworthy for <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in which Rousseau’s
                writings are metaleptically hollowed out in favor of his spoken recitative, which
                nevertheless has no historical compass. Moreover, the “oriental corpse is in the
                book,” but for the north, “[o]urs is already in our speech” (qtd. in Derrida,
                <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> 226). The north, in effect, is death. This
                death, which need and work attempt to evade, accounts for the loss of melodious
                sound, of music from languages of the north where accent signs and punctuation
                replace intonation, that is, they replace the resonance of intoned life and desire
                (227). Nothing more clearly theorizes the living death of Shelley’s Rousseau, whose
                language has been so hollowed out that it is eviscerated of anything but a haunting.
                Even its attempts to capture image and figure, poetry and measure disintegrate
                toward the forgetting that is overtaking him. The warning he represents for the Poet
                prepares us, and him perhaps, for the disintegration of the poem’s integrity at the
                ending, its substitution of stuttering punctuation for poetic imagination, poetic
                imaging, poetic music. What does remain is measure, measure as counting, as beats,
                as what might be a gathering of dissipated energies rather than a dying into itself. </p>
               <p>What is it that can get <title level="m">The Triumph</title> back
                from the edge of a vertiginous loss of meaningful vision (Rousseau’s hollow-eyed
                seeing; the spectacular triumph’s mad careen into meaninglessness)? Hollow-eyed,
                hollowing out, and the root that is no root (of language, of origin<note place="foot" resp="author">Derrida meditates on the nature of roots and entangled or intertwined roots in
                    language and writing in <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> in an
                    early passage in the section on Rousseau (101–2).</note>) but
                rather a man after all (the unrecognizable image of Rousseau when the Poet first
                encounters him), provide spectral figurations for the failure of both sight and
                language in the poem, or rather, for the disfiguration that de Man locates there. </p>
               <p> The problem of the poem is not that it dis-articulates figuration and narrative, or
                that it encapsulates frenzied motion and a kind of centrifugal force so that the
                center empties out—or is seen to have always been empty, although these are both at
                play. The problem is that the poem is about the struggle between existence and
                control as a drama of the all in all; to convey this, the poem references so many
                ideas that it works rather like a magnet that has attracted little metal bits that
                it allows to disfigure the unity of the whole. In the Preface to 
                <title level="m">The Rhetoric of Romanticism</title>, De Man says that 
                <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> is “The
                only place where I come close to facing some of these questions about history and
                fragmentation,” which include attempts to aestheticize modes of fragmentation to a
                kind of “unity and substance” that may be what the poem, and the entire period,
                resist (ix). That unity and substance, disenfranchised by the hollowing out Rousseau
                represents, and by the insistence on a messily chaotic history doomed to repeat
                itself represented by the triumph, comes to an end with the elliptical ending. There
                a blind seeing is required in order to see beyond the ending; it is the kind of
                sightedness poets are renown for, but Shelley resists putting such seeing into
                words. What he requires is a different kind of writing capable of resisting the
                death of presence that Rousseau accords to writing by refusing that dichotomizing of
                essence/substance, and of presence/distance encoded in Enlightenment theories of
                language. Such binaries recall one even more pertinent to the origin of language,
                that of nature/culture, which asserts an ideological, onto-theological
                interpretation on history as powerful as that of writing itself. </p>
               <p>Describing Levi-Strauss’ focus on the split between nature and culture, Derrida
                refers to “the originality of a scandalous suture” (<title level="m">Of
                    Grammatogy</title> 105). This might well also describe the chasm wall inscribed
                with hieroglyphs or “rhymes of wonder” in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> (105). The “rhymes of
                wonder” are both the failure of logocentric writing and the eradication of
                presentful voice, already dissimulated by Rousseau’s incoherent narrative. Derrida
                refers to iterability as repetition with a difference;<note place="foot" resp="author">Derrida defines iterability as a
                    concept in <title level="a">Signature Event Context.</title>
                  </note> rhymes of wonder
                would then be writing with a difference, writing beyond the trace or after the
                points of departure have been taken. Shelley is envisioning a different kind of
                writing then, one still necessitating an enabling violence against the chasm wall of
                horizonal or spatio-temporal limitation—but a writing that would not require the
                trace, the play of difference and of arche-writing. This is a writing that cannot be
                said, but can be felt in the beats, the counts of the ellipses that measure out the
                poem’s partial ending. </p>
               <p>I have not yet alluded to <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s allegorical form.
                Despite its clear allegiance to
                Dante’s <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> (1320) and
                Petrarch’s own <title level="m">Triumph</title>, the <title level="m">Trionfi</title>
                (c. 1350-74), another allegory sits behind the poem, Plato’s allegory of the cave.
                Shelley’s Platonism is well known, but I believe that in his last major poem he
                overleaps Plato’s vision just as he does Dante’s. Derrida’s analysis of Plato’s
                allegory in <title level="m">Memoirs of the Blind</title> is helpful here because it
                reveals the difficulty at the heart of the cave analogy: human passivity as the
                condition for seeing differently. Plato describes his allegorical cave as peopled by
                humans chained to the walls by their various kinds of blindness, caused when opinion
                is valued over the logic of ideas. Unable even to move their heads, these prisoners
                mistake shadows for real things. They are passive while chained, but even what frees
                them is not due to their own agency: “A conversion will free them . . . But before
                this dazzling ascent, an <emph>anabasis</emph> that is also an
                <emph>anamensis</emph>,” a journey through previous lives must take place
                (Derrida, <title level="m">Memoirs</title> 15). This “passion
                of memory . . . will turn the soul’s gaze towards the ‘intelligible place’ . . . .”
                Far from being an act of will, however, Plato’s prisoners are represented as
                motionless through this process; Rousseau’s conversion is a rewriting of this
                allegory, his repeated retracings of his life as a philosophe prompted by the “Shape
                all light” rather than by his own initiative, and like the prisoners, the process
                produces a second kind of blindness, as Derrida notes, that Plato attributes to the
                exchange of dark shadows for intelligible light, where otherness might indeed be
                perceived otherwise and without blinding distortion. Thus Rousseau must see through
                eyes hollowed out of their prior blindnesses. Part of what Rousseau, and the Poet
                who he instructs, must forget is the blinding opinions of epistemic
                thought—constrained by postulates, skepticism, and Kantian critique—which rejects
                any stretching out to the thing-in-itself. Clearly Rousseau’s finger stretches in
                just such a way to point to the in-itself, the triumphal march as the essence of
                ideologically bound and blinded Life. Derrida notes that Plato’s prisoners never
                stretch their hands even toward the shadows on the cave’s walls, they are motionless
                in their inability even to touch the representations of things, let alone
                things-in-themselves. Shelley rejects such rejection, insisting that Rousseau
                <emph>can</emph> see blindly, <emph>can</emph> point to verities
                and intelligibilities. De Man disagreed with Derrida’s interpretation of Rousseau’s
                blindness, remarking in a letter that “The desire to exempt Rousseau (as you say) at
                all costs from blindness is therefore, for me, a gesture of fidelity to my own
                itinerary . . . that, on the specific question of the rhetoricity of his writing, he
                was not blinded.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Quoted from private correspondence in Andrzej

                  </note> The
                truth-tropes of poetic language, for de Man, Derrida and Shelley, were accessible to
                Rousseau under certain conditions: when his metaphors overtook him, as does the
                Shape all light. The intelligible place he points to is off the map, of course, just
                as is Plato’s ideality. </p>
               <p>This is a futurity worth risking the erasure of past histories if those histories are
                only doomed to repeat themselves; Rousseau’s erasure of self points this out. And if
                Shelley evinces anxiety in <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> over the
                distorting mirrors of futurity, surely Rousseau’s hollow-eyed seeing can overcome
                distortions that would only return us to a recursively recycled history of error and
                suffering. Indeed, “we let ‘<emph>I dare not</emph> wait upon
                <emph>I would,’”</emph> whereas instead “We want the creative faculty to imagine that
                which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine; we want
                    <emph>the poetry of life</emph>” (Shelley, <title level="m">Defence</title> 
                530; emphasis added). Poets have long been able to create a bridge
                from the past into a possible futurity (“The poetry of Dante may be considered as
                the bridge thrown over the stream of time, which unites the modern and antient
                world” [526]), but “poets have been challenged to resign the civic crown to
                reasoners and mechanists” (528), categories to which Rousseau at first capitulated
                in his poetical philosophy. The imagination, action and poetry requisite for a
                futurity without distortion in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> would inaugurate
                the post-Anthropocene, and require, as Shelley’s Rousseau has demonstrated, a giving
                up of past words, memories of self and achievements, and therefore of the Cartesian
                cogito per se. His recursive story-making of self into nonself is a movement towards
                a new temporality in which past histories are forgotten or overwritten so that a new
                time may come into being. Similar to Rousseau’s self-fragmentation,
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s ending ellipses—which
                might be a cracking or fissuring in the chasmic walls, a positive fragmenting whose
                leaving off opens up the potentiality of poetry rather than a breaking up of
                logocentric linguistic formulations—gesture toward the possibility of a non-cogito
                realm in which selfhood is spelled differently. This is also the vision of
                philosophers of the non-Anthropocene, such as Cary Wolfe, in arguing that
                nonhumanist thought must not be brought back to a concentrism that still harbors the
                human at its core. The nonhuman must not be a veiled concern about the future of
                human survival; it must not be a practice of care toward other beings and toward the
                environment that restores the primacy of human agency. Both of these orientations
                distort otherness, casting it in logocentric terms that privilege the cogito and
                thus human history, undoing the lessons of the <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s
                allegorical vision. “Rhymes of wonder” foresees this linguistic breakthrough that
                could restore sight’s capacity to see what is there, awaiting a resolution into
                recognizable patterns whose interpretation need not privilege the logos, its
                theology, or its human subjectivity. Just as those currently struggling to envision
                what such a linguistics might entail cannot do more than gesture toward such a
                future, so too does Shelley’s great poem do no more than indicate pointedly
                language’s dissolve in such a futurity. Nevertheless, it is a rhyme of wonder.</p>

                Life</hi>, “as if that look must be the last,” as an aside that asks what occurs
                after that last look. In a post-Waterloo poem that imagines a hallucinatory
                end-of-the-world scenario amidst several last things, including a kiss, Shelley
                explores the adjacencies opened up by his unfinished late piece. It also turns to
                disparate works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Peter Hujar that serve as further
                instantiations of the kind of lastness that the poem complexly meditates on.</p>

                  <p>In his essay <title level="a">The End of All Things,</title> Immanuel Kant zeroes in on what he
                    calls “the last thought, the last feeling in the thinking subject [who] will then remain forever
                    the same without any change” (227). This congealed and apocalyptic condition, in which “all alteration . . . ceases”
                    and “outrages the imagination,” is an unblinking nightmare for the philosopher: “For then the whole of nature will
                    be rigid and as it were petrified” (227). With some ambivalence, Kant puzzles over what it would mean for a subject
                    “to think itself into such a state,” which, as you might expect, he says is impossible, for it would mean that the
                    subject who thinks its own non-existence craves destitution, or a life “equivalent to annihilation” (227). And yet,
                    Kant gets at something obscure here, as if reluctantly putting his finger on something he would otherwise not like
                    to touch, but still does. What does it mean to come as close as possible to a last thought or a last feeling
                    <emph>as if</emph> it were the last? And how does one dwell with the “end of the world” otherwise?</p>
                  <p>This essay begins with another kind of very last thing:<note place="foot" resp="author">My thanks to

                last.” Looking at the Bodleian manuscript,<note place="foot" resp="author">

                     </note>
                I am reminded of Mary Shelley’s sense of helpless fascination while editing the <title level="m">Posthumous 
                Poems</title>: “Did any one see the papers from which I
                drew that volume, the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of
                extracting it from so confused a mass, interlined and broken into fragments, so that
                the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses” (Reiman 119). Scanning the
                guesswork of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s last page (if seeing is even
                possible here), another opaque desideratum appears: the faint notation of the words
                “Alas I kiss you Julie” just above the dangling deletion of “<emph>from whose limbs the</emph>.”
                What does one make of the
                barely marked errancies of a last look and a last kiss? Both are minor affects that
                equivocally fall “by the way side” of a poem that remains unfinished, materially
                illegible, and an echo-text of other writings that ghost it.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> 541. All citations of
                            Shelley’s writings come from this text unless otherwise noted. Line
                            numbers will be given parenthetically.</note> Shelley seems to
                conjure a virtual and diffuse infrastructure that traffics at all limits between a
                “public way” and a “way side” (43, 541)—two ways that conceptualize the poem’s
                silent inscriptions and render it discontinuous with its own borders. </p>
                  <p>In his study of the manuscript, Donald Reiman lists its “contents”: financial
                calculations; the poems “Lines Written in the Bay of Lerici” and “To Jane”;
                drawings, doodles, and sketches; various “apocrypha” or texts deleted from the final
                version; aborted openings, tryouts, and fragments (226–27). Additionally, we know
                that <title level="m">The Triumph</title> bears complex
                subterranean traces of the drama Shelley was researching since 1819:
                <title level="m">Charles the First</title>, a work he abandoned
                in 1822 in order to write the poem. It is worth pondering how these jottings, inter-texts, or graffiti also tug at
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> like a cog in the editorial
                wheel of the car itself, as if to delay any kind of last take or last look cast upon
                it. This elemental mass constitutes the poem’s “hidden transcript,” a concept James
                C. Scott uses in his book
                <title level="m">Domination and The Arts of Resistance</title> to
                describe “a critique of power spoken behind the back of the dominant” as a strategy
                of covert, unavowable resistance from within power relations (xii). Thus Shelley’s
                hidden transcript isn’t just the shapeless sum of all other texts within the poem’s
                folios, nor is it something to be excavated and interpreted exclusively through
                recourse to social or political lenses. Rather, the transcript gestates through its
                own mute, virtual resistances and underperformances that operate from within and in
                excess of the boundaries that inform it, disturbing them while simultaneously
                remaining below the radar of capture. The hiddenness of the transcript refuses and
                exhausts a text—it amounts to a negativity or <foreign xml:lang="fr">désoeuvrement</foreign>
                that, with varying nuances, stops and starts, ends and begins the “Life” that the
                triumph burdensomely bears along: “little profit brings / Speed in the van and
                blindness in the rear” (100–1). </p>
                  <p>Tilottama Rajan writes that to look at <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> in
                its pre-published state is “to experience an enormous gulf between its chaos and the
                iconic clarity of the printed text . . . That
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> survives only in manuscript
                may be an accident. But the accident is part of the text’s history and produces that
                history as a kind of mirror-stage on which the identity of editing, of philology,
                and of reading is projected and broken” (341). “The iconic clarity of the printed
                text” brilliantly evokes how a drive for perceptual coherence vainly repairs the
                messy “broken” gulf of the poem in its two states, or its two worlds. Within the
                context of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, it isn’t hard to hear how that rift
                becomes the mirror stage for all the scholarship that has followed the poem: writing
                over thirty years ago, Paul de Man famously asked how reading <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> required us to wonder what we should do with the scene of the
                unburied body “within” the text:
            <quote>
                This defaced body [Shelley’s drowning] is present in the margin of the last
                manuscript page and has become an inseparable part of the poem. At this point,
                figuration and cognition are actually interrupted by an event which shapes the text
                but which is not present in its represented or articulated meaning . . . The final
                test of reading, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, depends on how one
                reads the textuality of this event, how one disposes of Shelley’s body. (120, 121)
            </quote>
                The question of disposal might be juxtaposed with Derrida’s remark in a reading of
                Paul Celan: “When the world is no more, when it is on the way to being no longer
                <emph>here but over there</emph>, when the world is no longer near…then I
                must carry <emph>you</emph>, you alone, you alone in
                me or on me alone” (<title level="a">Rams</title> 158). What Derrida emphasizes is the recession of that
                rift, the intervallic indeterminacy that turns the end of the world into a kind of
                “epistemological therapeutics”:<note place="foot" resp="author">I borrow this term

                For each time, and each time singularly, each time irreplaceably, each time
                infinitely, death is nothing less than an end of
                <emph>the</emph> world. Not <emph>only one</emph> end among others, the end of
                someone or something <emph>in the world</emph>, the end of a life or of a
                living being. Death puts an end neither to someone in the world nor to
                <emph>one</emph> world among others. Death marks each
                time, each time in defiance of arithmetic, the absolute end of the one and only
                world, of that which each opens as a lone and only world, the end of the unique
                world, the end of the totality of what is or can be presented as the origin of the
                world for any unique living being, be it human or not. (<title level="a">Rams</title> 140)
            </quote>
                For Derrida, death generically enacts this apocalyptic end, again and again, as an
                ethical injunction: attend to the end of the world as the Other’s end, but do not
                make it your own, even as “the end” occurs throughout life at the risk of always
                cannibalizing the other in our thoughts. In what follows, I read the end of the
                world for its form, which is to say as a <emph>non-catastrophic</emph>
                structure or formula that performs extinguishments at micro-levels. Turning to the
                line “as if that look must be the last,” I want to consider this comparatively brief
                and under-read textual moment as opening up an ethico-aesthetics that emerges for
                Shelley out of a formal quandary: what happens in the poem <emph>after</emph> the 
                last look has been drained? And what is an <emph>after-look</emph>? I admit that for years, I have been perplexed by the minimal
                yet arresting force of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s last words, to the point
                where the whole apparatus of the poem dissolves for me like a stone in a river. The
                line has also been so powerful to me because of its resonance with an earlier moment
                where the poet deplores the coercive logic of <title level="m">The Triumph’s</title>
                spectacular visuality: “Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow / Of people, and
                my heart of one sad thought” (298–99). One might call this “ideological fatigue,”
                Siegfried Kracauer’s term for what he diagnosed as the profound “apathy” and
                “insensitivity” of American culture reflected in postwar Hollywood cinema, where
                confrontations with historical trauma expose a lack in values and total social and
                political paralysis (79). The sick eyes of the poet, like Mary Shelley’s, become
                passive precipitates of a fatigue that succumbs to the imperatives of ocular reason,
                but at the same time, the poem counters this passivity with a queerly erotic
                openness to disabling and world-ending encounters that flash up with last looks and
                last kisses. In these non-appropriating and partial moments, lifeless bodies and
                things approach each other as seductive “evidence” of pleasures that blur the lines
                between seeing, reading, and looking at last sight. </p>
                  <p> For a poem that frenetically begins (as Faflak has described it) like the musical
                <title level="m">42nd Street</title> and “works like hell to
                bring the world prosopopoeically to life” (“Dancing” 168), the springing forth of
                the sun and the subsequent “unclosing” of all things in the proem are no sooner
                choreographed than everything soon disappears in an end of the world that overworks
                its own resources (9). The poet experiences a “scene . . . / As clear as when a veil
                of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer” (31–33), one which gives way to
                a “trance of wondrous thought” (41). In turn, it effects a “Vision . . . rolled” on
                [the poet’s] brain (40)—a mechanized rolling that prefigures the last roll of the
                chariot of Life itself (“the car which now had rolled / Onward”), and annuls his
                gaze which is trained at the unclosing world. William Jewett notes that “Shelley’s
                daemonized <emph>aubade</emph> explicitly revises a
                topos of revolution poetry: the appearance of the day’s new light as an emblem of a
                new age abruptly dissociated from the time of an ancien régime” (225). If we are
                confronting something like the revolutionary unclosing of the first eyes of the
                world—“All flowers in field or forest which unclose / Their trembling eyelids to the
                kiss of day” (9–10)—the proem introduces seeing as not only an originating way of
                being, but as a forced act of unblocking an opening, an unclosing that rearranges
                perceptions. It recalls Schopenhauer’s puzzling reflection in <title level="m">The
                World as Will and Representation</title> (1818) that
                <quote>
            the existence of the whole world remains forever dependent on that first eye that
                opened, were it even that of an insect. For such an eye necessarily brings about
                knowledge, for which and in which alone the whole world is, and without which it is
                not even conceivable . . . This world is the succession of the representations of
                this consciousness, the form of its knowing, and apart from this loses all meaning,
                and is nothing at all. (1: 30)
                </quote>
            Even though the world precedes the first eye, for Schopenhauer it can only exist as
                something a priori insofar as it occurs as a world by virtue of and for that first
                eye. In this way, the eye’s <emph>aubade</emph> is
                also, generically speaking, its address of the lover through a song of separation
                and farewell: to wake is to part at the limit of dawn. </p>
                  <p>What kind of world is left after the last eye goes misty? Is it the “world after the
                end of the world” (Derrida, <title level="a">Rams</title> 140)? For Shelley, there is never the opening of
                one eye, but multiple eyes, disconnected from any autonomous entity; in their
                multiplicity, no one line of sight predominates. And at this point, “unclosing”
                suggests something else: not another kind of opening nor a deprivation of closure,
                but a seeing with and through negativity, one that proceeds to veil things just as
                they glimmer. If a “poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth”
                as Shelley claims in
                <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (515), his ontology
                of the image is essentially not amenable to the visible. The “wondrous trance” opens
                onto a topology of things seen <emph>as unseen</emph>—stanzas (or rooms)
                unfurnished, not so much noumenal as absent, forgotten, unmade, and emptied out. For
                example, later on in the <title level="m">Defence</title> he states the following:
                <quote>
            All things exist as they are perceived: at least in relation to the percipient. ‘The
                mind is its own place, and of itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.’
                But poetry defeats the curse which binds us to be subject to the accident of
                surrounding impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain or withdraws
                life’s dark veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a being
                within our being. It makes us inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is
                a chaos. It reproduces the common universe of which we are portions and percipients,
                and it purges from our inward sight the film of familiarity which obscures from us
                the wonder of our being. It compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to
                imagine that which we know. It creates anew the universe after it has been
                annihilated in our minds by the recurrence of impressions blunted by reiteration.

            William Keach reminds us that Shelley’s post-Lockean formulation of the image staked
                its ground on its non-picturable possibilities: delinked from sense-perception,
                Shelley’s images are often produced by an inside/outside mode of perception that
                (re)creates what the world does or does not give—what it ostensibly closes. The line
                between giving and not giving, like the one between opening and unclosing, is
                impossible to firmly draw (42–78). For example, in the preface to <title level="m">Prometheus
                Unbound</title>: “Imagery which I have employed will be found in many
                instances to have been drawn from the operations of mind, or from those external
                actions by which they are expressed” (207). Poetry is other to itself: on the one
                hand, if it is an ostensibly equalizing medium, one which “creates a being within
                our being” and “reproduces the common universe,” it has a power of apprehension
                which seizes the common—it “purges . . . the film of familiarity” and renews the
                universe after its “annihilation” by the everyday. But for poetry to make something
                happen as a faculty, it operates by way of cuts and endings—it “defeats” and
                “purges,” as if overcoming or deleting the very concepts it endlessly generates into
                legibility. As an image of life and a faculty for seeing such a life, poetry closes
                and uncloses the aperture towards a life that is discontinuous with it, a poetic
                life that “poetry” can never wholly see because, like a camera, it always sees for
                others and sees things <emph>as</emph> other—a look without a seer.
                Shelley’s poetry is on the cusp of what one sees and doesn’t see—a limit or
                borderline that takes time to unclose. It has a long exposure—like the undetermined
                route of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, there is no end in sight to life/Life.
                When it uncloses, things and places patiently open up but not for our eyes only. And
                because we can only see or read through another, we submit or yield ourselves to the
                insistence of a life beside itself that has become so vividly absent at its edges.</p>

                  <p>When Rousseau casts an eye at the car, what does he look at? Is it a
                defensive response, an automated reflex? Between “What is Life?” and “Happy are
                those for whom the fold / Of,” these two units bookend the last look as something
                that transpires imperceptibly in the middle of things. From one point of view, the
                unfinished conversation between Rousseau and the poet takes place in the poem’s
                foreground while all other actions and events outside the quotes fall into the
                background noise. But if we recall that the manuscript of <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> did not have quotation marks (a posthumous editorial add-on by Mary
                Shelley), looking and speaking blend into one another like a queerly textual
                assemblage or melée. In a poem of extraordinary light imagery and various instances
                of vision, looking, beholding, and seeing, this small moment is confounding. The
                word <emph>eye</emph> appears in the text more than any other figure for
                visualization: at my count, it appears ten times, whereas “gaze”=3; “vision”=4; and
                “look”=2. Thus the casting out of the eye, or its de-eyeing, becomes a significant
                topos for Shelley in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> and in its parallel
                text, <title level="m">Charles The First</title>. Jewett has
                shown how in the drama, the figure of the Sun “is a tyrannical Sun King, modelled
                not, as critics have suggested, after Louis XIV, but after Charles I rejoicing in
                his courtly spectacles” (227). The assault, moreover, on “courtly spectacles” like
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Peace</title> (performed in
                1633), which “arose out of a wish by City lawyers to defend the court’s spectacles
                from the antitheatrical attacks of Puritan iconoclasts like their colleague William
                Prynne” (232), would not have been lost on Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="authors">Jewett surmises that
                            <title level="m">The Triumph of Peace</title> at the
                            court of Charles I would have brought to mind the contemporary excesses
                            of the Prince Regent.</note> When Charles the First imagines
                himself as the “golden sun” of the court while “[t]he wild million / Strike at the
                eye that guides them” (<title level="m">Poetical Works</title> 144–45), he conceives
                of the body politic “like Oedipus . . . [which] strikes out its own eye” (Jewett
                244). The line echoes “the million with fierce song and maniac dance/Raging around”
                in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> (110–11), or “the throng
                of Life that not only obscures but permanently extinguishes the illumination
                Rousseau might have shed” (Jewett 244). Jewett underscores this parallel in order to
                argue that Shelley’s mobile imagery of light and obscurity depicts history not as
                traditionally successional but “as a nontemporal repetition of obscurings that blot
                a light shining from a realm beyond time” (231–32). If the poem works to forget what
                the past remembers, then the abandonment of the play for the poem was, in Jewett’s
                estimate, Shelley’s anxious “political dilemma,” or the question of how to think
                beyond the embodiment of history on stage (253) even as the poem “engenders an
                unquenchable nostalgia for the doings and sufferings that once could be found in
                history” (252). </p>
                  <p>I want to suggest, however, that Shelley’s casting out of the eye enacts another
                gesture, one that ends a world but in a manner that is involuntary and
                intentionless—an <emph>abjecting</emph> or throwing out of what comes to configure itself
                as what Kristeva terms the “in-between, the ambiguous, the composite” (4). Rousseau
                throws out the eye like a futile apostrophe or address, abjuring or discarding the
                very organ associated with the possibility of perception (hence his eyelessness).
                Additionally, the line allows for the thought that the eye throws and attaches
                itself <emph>to</emph> the moving triumphal car, as if to let the car
                carry the eye “onward” and put an end to the look while also absorbing its expulsion
                into the engine of the car. The million that strike the “eye that guides them” might
                be like Hegel’s work of art, a “thousand-eyed Argus, whereby the inner soul and the
                spirit is seen at every point” (1: 153–54). And like the heart which manifests its
                inner workings all over the human body, art must “convert every shape in all points
                of its visible surface into an eye” in order to confirm and see such affects as
                revelations of the spirit (1: 153). But for Shelley, the heterogeneity of the
                million that “rage around” the chariot disturb the work of art’s spectatorial
                privilege. Rather than convert and homogenize, the throng explodes around Life as
                “in-between” and “composite,” at once fascinated and bound to it but also
                <emph>called</emph> to it as a situation waiting for its event, implicitly
                displacing it as a source or center of attention.<note place="foot" resp="author">I draw 
                here on Alain Badiou’s definition of the event in <title level="m">Being and Event</title>.</note>
                It isn’t that there are more lines of sight that open up; instead, Shelley’s
                weariness with <title level="m">The Triumph</title> imitates the depleting movements
                of figures within it that challenge spectatorship as a world-making project. Indeed,
                this reversal of the eye’s observational capacities is what Michel Foucault locates
                in Georges Bataille’s work—rather than persist as the (Romantic) figure of a “mirror
                and lamp,” the eye works differently: “Sight carries it away in this luminous stream
                (an outpouring fountain, streaming tears and, shortly, blood), hurls the eye outside
                of itself, conducts it to the limit” (81). The eye is removed from its own
                operations <emph>by</emph> sight just as “the philosophizing subject has
                been dispossessed and pursued to its limit” (82). Visualization becomes a cutting
                force, a non-reactive limit-experience achieved via abjection and eyelessness: “And
                in the place from which sight had once passed, only a cranial cavity remains”
                (81–82). </p>
                  <p>The hegemony of that project proves catastrophic for Shelley; to reject it becomes a
                speculative pursuit for him, and he evokes it with the words “as if”: raising a
                possibility one might dwell with, but not conclusively put down. In a reading of
                Kant’s own <emph>as ifs</emph>, David L. Clark reminds us that the
                philosophic form of the <foreign xml:lang="de">als ob</foreign> appears throughout Kant’s
                writings as a regulatory principle supposing an action outside of actual experience.
                This capacity Kant calls abstraction, or “negative attentiveness” in
                <title level="m">Anthropology From A Pragmatic Point of View</title> (1798): “Either
                the <emph>paying attention to (attention)</emph> or the <emph>turning away from</emph> an idea of which I
                am conscious (<emph>abstraction</emph>).—The latter is not the mere
                failure and omission of the former . . . but rather a real act of the cognitive
                faculty of stopping a representation of which I am conscious from being in
                connection with other representations in one consciousness” (19). Clark notes that
                “a turning <emph>from</emph> that is also always a
                turning <emph>to</emph>, and that works to separate worlds without making
                them inaccessible to each other . . . [“negative attentiveness” 
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">negative Aufmerksamkeit</foreign>]] means never having finally to say
                <emph>no</emph> to no” (266). Here we are asked to
                imagine how looking away from something—the “misfortune of others, yes, even from
                our own good fortune” (20)—is at once affirming and negating. It isn’t a
                dialectical movement per se, but a way of seeing and acting upon things
                simultaneously and differently, as if spinning possibilities both against and with
                each other. The <emph>as if</emph> thus lets one thing stand with another
                without relation; it turns things to address themselves under conditions where
                ordinarily such an address would be impossible. And it does so to suggest that the
                turn, if it happens <emph>there</emph> in the moment of the
                <emph>as if</emph>, will also happen again. The last
                look might suggest a way of never perceiving the last look as the last—never
                thinking we could see the last world and the last look—but also never entirely
                saying <emph>no</emph> to lastness outright because in each case, lastness
                must happen one more time beyond itself. And to further emphasize the severity of
                that movement, the look <emph>must</emph> be the last: it is <emph>as if</emph> it must be
                so. The <emph>must</emph>
                insists and requests with all the austerity of a sovereign imperative, although in
                this case, it occurs without sovereign authority—an obligation to be the last in the
                absence of knowing from where such a decree is summoned. It must be and it ought to
                be. And as one adjusts oneself to that must-ness, one looks upon and reads the last
                look as an unreal symptom of that obligating statement. One looks just as one is
                told to stop looking—the last look on the world here is infinitely repeatable—one
                does not look, one does not look, one <emph>does</emph> look, etc. </p>
                  <p>I have made the argument elsewhere that one question which goes unnoticed and
                unspoken in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> concerns the untranslateable
                “language” spoken or translated between the English poet and the Swiss philosopher
                (Khalip 184). In the context of this chapter, I rephrase my observation: what do the
                poet and Rousseau <emph>see</emph> when they look at each other? If the
                language of poetry is, according to the <title level="m">Defence</title>, already
                foreign in the sense of being a medium of “evanescent visitations . . . always
                arising unforeseen and departing unbidden” and derived from “words which express
                what they understand not,” then there is also an
                    untranslateability or an “unapprehended inspiration” in looking (534, 535). To
                    look is to perceive something from a position where we have not made ourselves
                    available to be looked at. We cannot but fail under such conditions of looking.
                    “Vision can only proceed,” notes Faflak, “on the basis of what it cannot
                see, what is unavailable to or left out of perception” (“Difficult” 59), which is to
                say that looking proceeds through an inhibition that looks at what is imperceptible
                to it, or an unclosing intrinsic to the look; otherwise, there would be no reason to
                look at all. When Rousseau looks upon the car, in that interval nothing is seen, or rather, what
                <emph>is</emph> seen does not solely pertain to the image of the car. Remember: where “the
                holes it vainly sought to hide / Were or had been eyes” (187-88). Rousseau’s
                <emph>disfigurement</emph> is also (to extend the trope) <emph>uncorrected</emph>,
                incorrigible, and impenitent (“as one between desire and
                shame / Suspended” [394–95]. In the non-capacity to see, looking occurs in spite of
                itself, <emph>as if</emph> in this interval. And with all the quickness of a
                    photographic shot, an image appears just as it abstains from visibility.<note place="foot" resp="author">I

                     </note> In
                <title level="m">Specters of Marx</title>, Derrida reminds us that while it is difficult
                “<emph>to make or to let</emph> a spirit <emph>speak</emph>,” it is also the case that “the last one to whom a
                specter can appear, address itself, or pay attention is a spectator as such . . . As
                theoreticians or witnesses, spectators, observers, and intellectuals, scholars
                believe that looking is sufficient. Therefore, they are not always in the most
                competent position to do what is necessary: speak to the specter” (11). A sufficient
                looking is one that is content with mutuality, recognition, and likeness. It
                respects the boundaries in things drawn together and apart, like the difference
                between a human and a ghost, death and life. Such a looking is sufficient insofar as
                it thinks it is <emph>just enough</emph> and nothing more, as if looking
                were directed by the teleology of an address that has reached what it wants to know.
                I look and see the other and <emph>no other</emph>: “And for despair / I
                half disdained mine eye’s desire to fill / With the spent vision of the times that
                were / And scarce have ceased to be” (231–34).</p>
                  <p>One comes to believe that figures of speech are somewhat inadequate here for reading
                the materiality of a look as if it “must be the last,” precisely because Shelley is
                tending towards something inexpressive and non-phenomenological, a refusal of the
                communicable contract of words themselves. In an essay entitled “The Look of the
                Portrait” (and which in part reads Miguel Barceló’s 1994 painting
                <title level="m">Double Portrait</title>) Jean-Luc Nancy cites Wittgenstein’s statement that “We
                don’t see the human eye as a receiver . . . When you see the eye, you see something
                go out from it. You see the blink of an eye [<foreign xml:lang="de">Blick des
                Auges</foreign>].” Nancy continues:
                <quote>
            The look, Wittgenstein’s <foreign xml:lang="de">Blick</foreign>, is the
                thing that leaves or takes its leave, the thing of leaving. More precisely, the look
                is nothing phenomenal; on the contrary, it is the
                <emph>thing in itself</emph> of a departure from the
                self through which alone the subject becomes a subject . . . In truth, it is no
                longer even a look <emph>upon</emph> but a look as a whole, open not <emph>on</emph> but
                <emph>through</emph> the evidence of the world . . . it is nothing less than
                the presentation of a world rising up into its own vision, into its own evidence. (245)
                </quote>
            The look, as a thing in the world, a “thing of leaving,” dispenses itself
                <emph>as the world</emph> and <emph>of the world</emph>,
                an unclosing of the world as both affirmation and dismissal. It “happens”
                separately, away from any spectator or subject. This “departure from the self” marks
                the irruption of the very thing we cannot see because the look uncloses a world in
                the absence of our perspective, after the last. It hints at a genre of the
                non-apocalyptic that frees itself over and over, a “thing that leaves or takes its
                leave”—a <emph>poetry of the after-all</emph>, to adapt a term by Peter
                    Szendy.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="m">Apocalypse-Cinema</title>, Szendy
                            describes the disaster at the end of Lars von Trier’s film
                            <title level="m">Melancholia</title> thus: “<emph>The end of the movie 
                                is the end of the world</emph> . . . [it answers the demand that] the last image be the very last image,
                            that is, the last <emph>of them all</emph>—of all past,
                            present, or future images” (2). In this way, the film presents us with
                                “<emph>a cinema of the after-all</emph>” (3), a cinema
                            that doesn’t merely survive after the annihilation of the planet, but
                            rather a cinema that incinerates itself—a negativity at the very center
                            of the medium’s own aspiration to show, to represent the
                        world.</note> The last look ends the world, and a compulsion to
                have a certain kind of life with that world. Such a look is less a means for sight
                than it is an end unto itself, retreating from the “self” to present a world in its
                departure. </p>
                  <p>Thus the impossible gazes of the poet and Rousseau are less about solidarity than
                about their irreconcilability, an asymmetry of desires that confounds the
                pedagogical relationship between the two. For Shelley, learning painfully emerges as
                “thought’s empire over thought” (211). If “what was once Rousseau” (204) is the
                philosopher of the poem’s last word for Shelley—indeed, its Virgilian
                representative—he is also quite strikingly an actor and spectator
                <emph>of</emph>the last look—the so-called “first”
                or <emph>radical</emph> Romantic (again, “an old root”), now become its
                last and eyeless spectator—the last Romantic of the triumph, as well as implicitly
                the last of “Life” itself. “Whence I came, partly I seem to know . . . / Whither the
                conqueror hurries me still less” (300, 304). The poet, upon lamenting that he is
                “sick of this perpetual flow / Of people,” turns to Rousseau, who goes on to
                stand-in for the poet by seeing and thinking for him. His <emph>re-</emph>presentation
                of looking, however, implicitly hands over pedagogic vision as
                a void or abyss—an inaccessible and unlearned knowledge that uncloses between the
                two of them: “And what thou wouldst be taught,” says Rousseau to the poet, “I then
                may learn / From thee” (307–8). Rousseau counsels the poet, however, to “from
                spectator turn / Actor or victim in this wretchedness” (305–6), and accept a painful
                vulnerability that renders indiscernible acting and not acting. The poet disdains
                his own desire to see because that desire cannot
                <emph>not</emph> look away from the “spent vision” of
                a stale and cumulative history of all those that have “ceased to be”—Voltaire,
                Frederick II, Kant, Catherine the Great, and Leopold II. The eye fills with a
                half-full history that must come to an end. Thus when the poet cries out “Let them
                pass” (243), his wish to let the figures move along becomes interchangeable with the
                hint that they (and their historical narratives) might die a second time and
                disappear from sight altogether. </p>

                replaces the chariot with the actual British
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> as the vehicle of the last
                look—a spectral, postwar commodity on one of the nighttime streets of New York City
                that Hujar cruised and captured on film in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> in the photograph is a
                conspicuously older model, a last thought and last feeling that appears
                anachronistically out of place in a place of desertion. With exemplary force,
                Hujar’s car illustrates the kind of object of desire that subtends Walter Benjamin’s
                notion of “love—not at first sight, but at last sight,” the love that waves “a
                farewell forever” through its commodified look, fleetingly glimpsed by Baudelaire’s
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">flâneur</foreign> in the urban crowd (169). Like a drag on the
                surface of the photograph’s visual field, the car tarries or brakes with a last look
                that is somehow there but <emph>not</emph> quite
                there. What kind of demand does such a farewell make? And is this a portrait, an
                urban landscape, or something infinitely more inarticulable? In what way is a
                farewell endlessly performed here—a wish to leave that expresses itself
                <emph>as a wish</emph> and not a resolution, an adieu that repeats itself
                with each end? The photograph almost suggests that these questions are the car’s
                own: it timelessly sits on a street without traffic or persons. It might move
                onward, but it doesn’t; parked close to the curb, it is suspended somewhere between
                movement and stasis—a suspension, moreover, accented by several markers that
                conspire to tie together its holding environment: the curb’s parallel lines, the
                elevated railway above, the piece of wood or cardboard on the ground by the tires,
                and the three white stripes around the central column that bisect the photograph.
                These stripes, in turn, are offset by the pale verticality of the columns on which a
                one-way sign in the background points to something beyond the frame. The
                crisscrossing parallel and perpendicular lines in the photograph stall a movement of
                relations that it wants to invalidate. It is as if Hujar wants to nullify the
                implied vehicular pressure of all elements within his plane, and in so doing, he
                shoots a photograph that requires no agents at all. Nor does he secure the car as an
                object of anyone’s interpretative desire—in other words, he has us think it
                <emph>as</emph> a figure for the <emph>asubjectivity</emph> of desire itself. Like Keats’ Grecian urn which depicts a
                “little town . . . emptied of [its] folk,” and whose “streets for evermore / Will
                silent be” (Keats 462), Hujar’s car is embedded in a site of relational
                desolation—without drivers or passengers,
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> depicts a last world with one
                last car left in it after driving and riding have been eliminated.<note place="foot" resp="author">This

                  </p>
                  <p>In this photograph, <foreign xml:lang="fr">désoeuvrement</foreign> shades into driverlessness
                and riderlessness. The darkened, underexposed tones of the photograph compose a
                field where the car seems bathed in an exacting and precise light, drawing the
                spectator towards something that enigmatically correlates with the eye’s longing for
                focus. But only the front part of the car is lit whereas the rest of the body is
                dappled or brushed with shadows that hold it down in the swathe of black that blots
                the car’s right front and rear tires. In Hujar’s monochromatic
                chiaroscuro, the wheels kiss the road,
                pooling downward in what appears to be a rectangular, box-like void between the
                tires and the curb. And as if to further emphasize a light that cannot
                <emph>not</emph> look away, <title level="m">Triumph</title> visualizes the suspension of a
                suspension in the small blot of illumination caught in its upper left-hand corner—an
                overexposed shot of a train signal (possibly a yellow light) that flashes
                permanently between “go” and “stop.” The light is marginal in the sense that it is
                literally to the side of the foregrounded car, but it also doesn’t light (or
                enlighten) it. In a certain sense, it is as if the substance of Hujar’s photograph
                is like the “tain of the mirror”—Rodolphe Gasché’s term for a mirror’s “silver
                lining, lusterless back” that negatively enables a mode of thinking that is not
                reflective but the “systematic exploration of that dull surface without which no
                reflection and no specular and speculative activity would be possible” (6). At once
                holding back and pulling the <title level="m">Triumph</title> in
                several directions, Hujar’s tain-like night evokes an ethical and epistemological
                quandary that one hears in Maurice Blanchot’s reading of the myth of Orpheus: by
                turning back towards Eurydice, Orpheus’s “forbidden gaze destines [him] to lose
                everything: not only himself, not only day’s reality, but night’s essence” (174).
                Orpheus’s relation to his work depends on
                <emph>not</emph> turning back to Eurydice in order to
                keep to the work implied in his gaze; but, so that he can “carry the work beyond
                what assures it,” the look must be broken or forgotten. “In this gaze, the work is
                lost . . . Thus it is only in that look that the work can surpass itself, be united
                with its origin and consecrated in impossibility” (174). </p>
                  <p>Hujar presents this impossibility of the look—its loss
                <emph>with</emph> the work—just as Shelley presents
                Rousseau’s “new Vision”: this is not an alternate life, but an encounter with and a
                greeting of bodies and pleasures that are late to arrival, already realized after
                they have come to term—negatives without positive prints. It is for this reason that
                Giorgio Agamben, in his little essay “Judgment Day,” describes photography as
                “represent[ing] the world as it appears on the last day, the Day of Wrath . . . the
                judgment concerns a single person, a single life: precisely this one and no other . . . In 
                the supreme instant, man, each man, is given over forever to his smallest,
                most everyday gesture . . . A good photographer knows how to grasp the
                eschatological nature of the gesture” (23, 24, 25). The last day of the photograph
                is, however, also its “demand for redemption” (26), as if the last day can never be
                the last, can never give up on a future rescue of the petrified last thought or last
                feeling that the photograph eschatologically captures. But Hujar’s 
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is irredeemable: it doesn’t presume a world where the relation
                between the photograph and the person can be confirmed. Experimenting with a
                photography without life or a life after New York (un)closes its last queer eye,
                Hujar roams the city like the poetic scavenger Shelley evokes looking at the
                “charnel” of the earth. His photograph receives or addresses phenomena that are
                there and not there, as if “‘waiting for the person to come to him and just being
                very present’” (Carr, <title level="m">Fire In the Belly</title> 188). Such presence
                insists on being <emph>here</emph> amidst a queer world that bears a right
                to exist and not exist in the sense of abjuring legibility, rights, and
                documentation. <title level="m">Triumph</title> is not a portrait of a car, nor is it
                a last look given by it. It is an image rent by a marginality that tears at the
                image, and queerly loiters around its multiple lines of force. </p>
                  <p>For me, light and dark smear Hujar’s <title level="m">Triumph</title> with the same
                spellbinding effect that I read in the handwriting that ripples Shelley’s illegible
                manuscript pages. And as one instant of the erotically intervallic or minor in that
                poem, the phrase “Alas I kiss you Julie” has stayed with me as something at once
                unfinished and discreet, erotically unreleased into the edited life of the published
                text. As a standalone, this last kiss appears (as Reiman describes it) between “And
                <del rend="crossout">sank</del> fell, as I have by the” and “Those soonest,
                <del rend="crossout">from whose limbs the,</del>” written “in an extremely
                fine hand after the quill had been sharpened (probably after
                ‘<emph>limbs the</emph>’ below); the word [G.M. Matthews’s 1960 article on the poem and
                its various discarded passages in the <title level="j">Times Literary
                    Supplement</title>] reads as ‘Jane’ I believe to be “Julie”: At least there seems
                to me to be five rather than four letters, two of which rise above the level of the
                others” (Reiman 211). What would it mean to read this line as an afterthought, a
                superfluous addition, or a commentary without a speaker or an addressee, all of
                which “happen” after the deletion of other words and phrases on the page? Think of
                “Alas I kiss thee Julie” as a written speech act of a kiss—or more plainly, the act
                of a kiss—that is planted after a word or a poetic line,
                something <emph>after-all</emph> or after an
                infinitesimal world ends (erases, deletes) with the last drop of ink before the
                quill is sharpened. Like the rest of the “dialogue” in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, the kiss is unbound from
                quotation marks in the Bodleian manuscript, a kind of silent non-speech; like
                Hujar’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, it is caught in-between
                the margins of various intersecting lines of sight. The fact that “Julie” could have
                been also “Jane” hints that any name could be an anonymous or neutral placeholder
                within the phrase’s ghostly, blank address. And if “Alas I kiss you Julie” resembles
                on the surface a speech act, the resemblance is very much short-lived: tucked in
                almost unseen as something small and tactfully noted, it comes
                <emph>after</emph> the quill, quietly deposited
                between <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s lines. The phrase is not much of
                anything: it doesn’t need publicity at all. </p>
                  <p>But how does the last look <emph>look</emph> at the last kiss, or how does
                the last kiss <emph>kiss</emph> the last look? To think this, the key
                remains Rousseau: Reiman helpfully excavates elements of <title level="m">Julie, ou
                    la nouvelle Héloïse</title> (1761) in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>,
                especially the paralleling of Julie’s garden in Clarens with Shelley’s depiction of
                the visionary world where Rousseau encounters the “shape all light.” “Alas I kiss
                you Julie,” however, explicitly cites Letter XIV where Saint-Preux, Julie’s
                tormented tutor and lover, mourns the “fatal kiss” he shared with her in the
                garden:
                <quote>
                What have you done, ah! what have you done, my Julie? You meant to reward me and you
                have undone me. I am drunk, or rather insane. My senses are impaired, all my
                faculties are deranged by that fatal kiss. You meant to alleviate my sufferings?
                Cruel woman, you make them sharper. It is poison I have culled from your lips; it
                festers, it sets my blood afire, it kills me, and your pity is the death of me.
                (51)
                </quote>
               In this memory “of illusion, of delirium and enchantment” (51), Saint-Preux writes to
                her recalling the triangulated “fatal moment” of their kiss: having gone to the
                garden with Julie and her cousin Claire at sundown, Saint-Preux is at first taken
                aback by Claire’s own request for a kiss. Sensing Julie’s “signals of complicity”
                (52), he is possessed by a more overpowering desire that comes after—an
                <emph>after-kiss</emph>: “But what became of me a moment later, when I
                felt . . . my hand is shaking . . . a gentle tremor . . . your rosy lips . . .
                Julie’s lips… alighting on mine, pressing mine, and my body clasped in your arms?. .
                . Every part of me came together under that delightful touch. Our burning lips
                breathed out fire with our sights” (52). For Rousseau, Saint-Preux’s kiss is the
                emblem of a ruptured intensity of thinking, an intimacy of shared separation. In a
                novel that begins with the line, “Il faut vous fuire, Mademoiselle, je le sens bien”
                (“I must flee you Mademoiselle, that I can see”) a certain world ends with the first
                kiss: “tu m’as perdu” (“you have undone me”) writes Saint-Preux as he is consumed by
                a devastating perdition that puts him beyond death. As an emblem of romantic love,
                <title level="m">Julie</title> has to reinvent itself as a novel
                by going back to the romance of Abelard and Héloïse in order to explore the kiss as
                just this kind of truth of betrayed knowledge—a betrayal, moreover, whose errors
                split the self in language, elegizing it and its mistaken desires through fiction.
                The novel thus cannot be read as a fiction in the service of decipherment, but as a
                betrayed form whose “old world” has ended. Saint-Preux’s punishing “alas”
                affectively imparts just this kind of philosophy of the last kiss, as fatal as it is
                pleasurable: “Thus alarm extinguished pleasure, and my happiness was no more than a
                flash” (52). To read and to desire, Rousseau suggests, is to elegize a look and a
                kiss as the last signifiers of a world that is now no more. Saint-Preux’s flash,
                like Hujar’s camera and Rousseau’s cast out eye, is a love at last sight that hovers
                over its own self-extinction in a last world where things like
                <title level="m">Julie</title>, “Julie,” or “Jane” bleed into
                each other. </p>
                  <p>In one of his fragments, Novalis cryptically muses: “One must never confess to
                oneself that one loves oneself. The secret of this confession is the life principle
                of the one true and eternal love. The first kiss in this understanding is the
                principle of philosophy—the origin of a new world—the beginning of absolute
                chronology—the completion of an infinitely growing bond with the self. Who would not
                like a philosophy whose germ is a first kiss?” (58–59). This first kiss, like
                Schopenhauer’s first eye, opens a world of difference that discovers the self in its
                “confession” to the other. In Nicolas-André Monsiau’s engraving of the novel’s first
                    kiss,<note place="foot" resp="author">
                        <ref target="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The-First-Kiss-of-Love-La-Nouvelle-Heloise.jpeg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The-First-Kiss-of-Love-La-Nouvelle-Heloise.jpeg</ref>
                     </note>
                this “germ” is starkly depicted: the central, oval-like
                entwining of the couple excludes Claire just as they require her to witness the
                crystallized heteronormative bond that seals the selves of Saint-Preux and Julie
                into the reproductive “beginning of absolute chronology” inaugurated by the kiss.
                What Saint-Preux actually finds, as we have seen, is a darker betrayal, a mistaken
                and negative philosophy that derealizes itself through the kiss: “I no longer see
                you the same” (52). Parceled out in an epistolary form where sender and receiver,
                addresser and addressee try to exchange conversation, the kiss comes to be disposed
                or cast out within the form of letter-writing where the return of an address becomes
                indistinguishable from its revocation—something Julie, in her response to
                Saint-Preux in Letter XV, herself stresses: “It is important, my friend, that we
                separate for some time” (52). </p>
                  <p>Thus the queerness of Saint-Preux and Julie’s “fatal” love turns on first and last
                looks and kisses that traverse each other in the evening. In <title level="a">Typewriter Ribbon,</title>
                Derrida writes: “forgiveness or pardon, the excuse, and the remission of sin,
                absolute absolution, are always proposed in the figure, so to speak, of the ‘last
                word.’” The pardon’s “disturbing proximity . . . to the last judgment” evinces the
                impossibility of a forgiveness so total that it annihilates the world in which it
                takes places (100). A pardon that only forgives what it knows, what it sees, what it
                sympathizes with, is ineffective. It is as if pardoning were the gesture through
                which one could, in some way, speak the last word or see the last look in such a way
                that an end impossibly <emph>happens</emph>. Both Shelley and Hujar’s
                works, I suggest, <emph>forgive life—</emph> life as the unforgiveable
                which is always already there, incessantly, at once seen and not seen, kissed and
                not kissed, known and unknown. The absence of any kiss in Hujar’s
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is the sign of it not only being everywhere, but rather that we
                should <emph>expect</emph> it everywhere, like the light of the train
                signal or the ubiquitous light in Shelley’s poem. The last is unforgiveable because,
                like life, it is always the last, and thus impossible to conclusively,
                catastrophically, forgive. Hujar instructs us not try to capture it with the camera,
                but to receive it. Shelley, writing after Rousseau, would have understood this: to
                greet life, to anonymously kiss and be non-fatally consumed by what we cannot look
                at, and to look at what we cannot kiss.</p>

            <div type="abstract">
               <p rend="noCount">This is an essay about a minor event in a major poem. I hope to demonstrate how the
                    minor event of a detached poetic image offers us a way of understanding what is
                    <emph>in back of</emph> or
                    <emph>behind</emph> the proto-cinematic energies on
                    display in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> (1822). And I am also
                    interested in exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor” lyricism of our own
                    contemporary cinema open a means of beholding the image-event in Shelley’s poem? If
                    this second possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible to discern in these past
                    poetic and present cinematic images a form of historical “circuitry” that reveals
                    something about the agency or “currency” of images. I want to propose that the
                    currency of the poetic image is best understood by what Roland Barthes identified as
                    the <emph>obtus</emph> or “third meaning,” a glimmering residue of the
                    stilled cinematic image that offers the point of contact for the current that
                    circulates between the literary and cinematic modes of image production.</p>

                  <p> If every essay we write has a back-story, we usually have the good taste for it to
                “remain untold” even when, as in Percy Shelley’s case, it might keep us “as wakeful
                as the stars that gem / The cone of night” (21–23).<note place="foot" resp="author">All
                    references to Percy Shelley’s
                            poetry are taken from Reiman and Fraistat’s Norton edition of
                    <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>. Further references to
                            Shelley’s poetry and prose are to this edition. On the speaker’s
                            withholding of “thoughts,” it’s relevant to invoke Walter Benjamin’s
                            account to Gretel Adorno of his “holding” “certain thoughts” “safe with”
                            himself and “yes, even from” himself until 1940 when the “war and the
                            constellation it brought with it” prompted him to compose them. These
                            “certain thoughts” are his <title level="a">Theses on the Concept of History</title> (cited by
                    David L. Clark in <title level="a">Goya’s Scarcity</title> 86).</note> But given that
                this is an essay that is very much about the “back-story,” I will take the liberty
                of beginning it by telling my own. When Joel Faflak first wrote me about the MLA
                panel for which this essay originated, he asked cryptically if I wanted to revisit
                “our favorite poem.” I was struck by the audacity of the invitation: we are rarely
                asked—at least in an institutionally authorized setting such as the Modern Language
                Association—to identify “our favorite poem,” much less to speak about how it strikes
                us and moves us. But my respect for Faflak’s scholarship is such that I agreed
                immediately to the invitation; and that agreement prompted me in turn to reflect on
                how I might extract “my favorite poem” and from what catalogue of favorites it might
                be drawn. I understood Faflak not to be soliciting a talk about a poem that was
                necessarily a significant achievement or a decisive event; rather, I thought he was
                making a less critical and more intimate query into “my favorite things,” something
                like “raindrops on roses,”—those poems, in other
                words, that whether major or minor become precious to us, even indispensable. Given
                that it was Joel Faflak making this request, I assumed he wanted me to select such a
                poem from English Romanticism. I reflected on my usual romantic suspects, poems that
                I feel are necessary to my being—those poems about mountains or birds—before I
                realized what I had long known: my favorite poem was <title level="m">The Triumph
                    of Life</title> (1822). It was only then that I revisited—and actually read
                carefully—Faflak’s initial request and realized I never had a choice in the matter
                of favorite: I had been assigned to write about <title level="m">The Triumph
                    of Life</title> because it was already known in advance to be my favorite. I am happy
                to know that there are others quite like me, singled out for the great gift of this
                poem, a gift that can feel every bit a curse.</p>
                  <p> Shortly after this recognition, I read Faflak’s astonishing essay on the “vitally
                cinematic” nature of Shelley’s final poem and immediately discovered there the most
                succinct account to date of what is at stake for Shelley’s poetics of the image, one
                that is not merely a reflection of its historical moment but its projection of a
                futurity: “<title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> reflects a society of the
                spectacle still in visual flux. But it predicts a history fascinated by the
                production of images that body forth life, then compromise any return to life
                itself” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168). Faflak’s principal point of reference for his re-reading of
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is Lars von Trier’s <title level="m">Dancer
                    in the Dark</title> (2000), a film which invokes and even inhabits
                <title level="m">The Sound of Music</title> (1965) with the director’s special form of
                lovingly perverse devastation. This constellation of ironies and overdetermined
                coincidences prompted me to wonder how a poem such as
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> can qualify as a
                “favorite”? If <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is the final poetic gift Shelley
                bestowed on futurity, it is most certainly not delivered in a “brown paper package
                tied up with string”; and it certainly has none of the palliative or compensatory
                qualities that singers from Julie Andrews to Bjork have invoked with “my favorite
                things.” Indeed, it’s a poem that seems likely to undo every happy item in that
                song’s catalogue of favorites and would seem one of the <emph>least</emph>
                likely candidates for a favorite poem. I wondered what might make <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title> not only an important poem for Shelley studies, for
                the field, even for the profession, but also my own personal favorite?</p>
                  <p> There are many political, theoretical, rhetorical, disciplinary, and biographical
                aspects of this astonishing text that make it such a beacon in Romantic studies: it
                seems to be one of those poems that simply won’t be done with us, a sprawling
                remnant too relentlessly demanding to be answered once and for all, a hallucinatory
                thrill-ride that promises or threatens to take us far beyond its own vanishing
                point. It’s a poem that conveys both the originary fiat of the sun “springing forth”
                and the trippy “perpetual flow” of visions “ever new,” while making the conveyances
                and the conveyed an urgent matter of political and poetic history. In fact I feel
                authorized to read the famous opening lines—“Swift as a spirit hastening to his task
                / Of glory and of good” (1–2)—as referring not to the sunrise, which takes its own
                sweet time, but to the poem itself. Still, these features of the poem, however
                exhilarating and exacting, are not the aspects of literature we typically
                characterize as endearing or intimate. And as necessary and demanding as I find
                these defining features of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, they are not
                the qualities that make this daunting and undoing poem so precious to me. The answer
                to the initiating query—what makes <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> my
                <emph>favorite</emph> poem?—can be traced to the
                personally arresting effect of an accidental but notable aesthetic event.</p>
                  <p> Folded inside one of those sprawling <emph>terza rima</emph> verse
                sentences in the introductory proem to Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> are the following lines: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills they glimmer” (32–33).<note place="foot" resp="author">It’s no accident
                    that <title level="m">The Triumph</title> generates lines that have had this effect on its
                            readers. Jacques Khalip’s beautiful “admission” of his long-standing
                            relationship with the third-to-last line of the poem speaks directly to
                            my own connection to the poem: “I admit that for years, I have been
                            perplexed by the minimal yet arresting power of ‘as if that look must be
                            the last,’ to the point where the whole apparatus of the poem dissolves
                            for me into something like the floaters that Mary saw in the manuscript.
                            The words, however, have never sounded especially elegiac to me but
                            rather quietly withering in their kitschy and clichéd tone, even
                            recalling the countless small disasters of standard torch songs composed
                            in the minor key—noncatastrophic gestures and affects that explode at
                            micro-levels and dissipate, neither fetishistic nor talismanic. Like
                            Etta James’s <title level="a">At Last,</title> then, this is a love that has ‘come along’”
                            (77).</note> Though I have extracted the lines in the form of a
                grammatically complete sentence, they serve in fact as part of a dependent clause,
                the minor vehicle to a simile which is part of an elaborate phenomenological figure
                and a major interpretive crux of the poem. The extracted lines themselves are not
                obscure. Stuart Sperry has suggested that adding a comma after “hills” makes the
                lines “intelligible,” but I believe that the absence of the comma extends what we
                might call the “glimmer effect” to the demonstrative pronoun: “evening hills
                <emph>they</emph> glimmer” (181).<note place="foot" resp="author">See also Ross Wilson’s treatment of the
                    passage in <title level="a">Poetry and the Life of Theory,</title> his illuminating chapter on
                            <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in his vibrant
                            book on Shelley’s poetics of life: <title level="m">Shelley and the
                                Apprehension of Life</title>, esp. 150–51.</note> Once one
                restores the passage to its grammatical and rhetorical operation in the poem, things
                are—as always in Shelley—immediately complicated given that this glimmering
                <emph>veil</emph> of evening light is a figure for transparency. Here is
                the extracted image in its immediate context as well as the opening and conclusion
                of the proem:

            I still find Paul de Man’s rendering of the significance of the passage to be the
                most acute account of the complications of the passage and its implications: the
                “clarity” is “like that of a veil drawn over a darkening surface, a description
                which necessarily connotes covering and hiding, even if the veil is said to be ‘of
                light’” (<title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> 106). For de Man this passage is part of a textual
                “knot” that by way of an echoing “glimmer,” repeated by the figure of Rousseau
                almost 400 lines later, “unites the poet-narrator to Rousseau” and establishes a
                principal site of the poem’s treatment of “knowledge, oblivion, and desire” (106,
                105, 107). In fact, the passage can be said to achieve the status of a de Manian
                “allegory of reading”: “Light covers light, trance covers slumber and creates
                conditions of optical confusion that resemble nothing as much as the experience of
                trying to read <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, as its meaning glimmers,
                hovers, and wavers, but refuses to yield the clarity it keeps announcing” (106). </p>
                  <p> I regard this sentence from <title level="a">Shelley Disfigured</title> to
                        be an allegory of what it means
                to read de Man and his own “altogether tantalizing . . . play of veiling and
                unveiling” (106). But though it is as seductively beautiful as the poem it
                interprets, de Man’s account of the early passage in the proem of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> identifies an “optical
                confusion” that seems unwarranted by the lines themselves. The “transparent . . .
                scene” and the “veil of light” both describe the “strange trance” that “grew” over
                the “fancy” of Shelley’s speaker; but what is perhaps most “strange” about the
                “trance” is not the “confusion” it generates but the weird fact that the trance
                changes nothing at all: the speaker merely knows what he had already “felt” (“the
                freshness of that dawn,” “bathed in same cold dew,” etc.). The “scene”—the very
                scene he is witnessing—simply “came through” clearly. If the proem begins and ends
                with two major events—the “springing forth” of the Sun and the “rolling” of “a
                Vision”—the only occurrence in the final four stanzas is something that doesn’t even
                happen to the speaker in the poem: “when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills <emph>they</emph> glimmer.” Though the lines may be
                        <emph>positionally</emph> important insofar as they establish the
                phenomenological conditions for the “Vision” to be “rolled” on the speaker’s
                “brain,” they are themselves poetic non-events, especially when measured against the
                scale of the universal history that unfolds in the “Vision” itself, the triumphal
                pageant of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. These first forty lines are,
                after all, mere back story.</p>
                  <p> Nothing authorizes me to identify the two special lines I’ve extracted and turn them
                into a complete <emph>sentence-image</emph>, especially given their
                dependent and supportive role in the fragmented passage of a fragmentary
                poem.<note place="foot" resp="author">I take the
                            figure of the <emph>sentence image</emph> from Jacques
                            Rancière’s formulation of that term: “By [the sentence image] I
                            understand something different from the combination of a verbal sequence
                            and a visual form. The power of the sentence-image can be expressed in
                            sentences from a novel, but also in forms of theatrical representations
                            or cinematic montage or the relationship between the said and the unsaid
                            in a photograph” (45–46). If Rancière inaugurates this mode of inter-art
                            “assembling” with his notion of the sentence-image, my own immediate
                            deployment of the term is more directly derived from Orrin N.C. Wang’s
                            important “reworking” of the term as a feature of Coleridge’s
                            “techno-magism,” or the poetic capacity of “making something out of
                            nothing” (<title level="a">Technomagism</title> 300). As Wang characterizes it, “the sentence
                            image, in line with Ranciere’s political vision, asserts an overcoming
                            of parataxis without the subordinate relations that structure the
                            hypotactic clause” (296). In my own “reworking” of the term, I’m
                            interested in an extractability or detachability of the image that
                            allows it to crystallize into something withdrawn and
                        discrete.</note> But perhaps it is the very quality of their
                provisional “completeness”—a passively rendered action and its effects—that makes
                the lines obtrude, suspending temporarily the relentless and even delirious movement
                of Shelley’s verse: clauses opening upon new clauses, similes in which vehicle
                overtakes tenor, figures sprawling across stanzas, all breathlessly
                enjambed.<note place="foot" resp="author"> As far as I
                            am aware, no critic has surpassed William Keach’s understanding of
                            Shelley’s versifying, especially the poet’s deployment of
                    <emph>terza rima</emph> in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                            which, according to Keach, displays “a compositional intelligence fully
                            in touch with the arbitrariness of its expressive medium yet capable of
                            shaping that arbitrariness into, as well as according to, precisely
                            provisional ‘constraints of meaning’” (188).</note> That we can
                detach this image from the course of the poem doesn’t substantially affect the
                poem’s interpretation: nothing in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> hinges on these
                two lines. Rather, Shelley’s poem offers this glimmering sentence-image in the
                manner of an arresting if minor detail in a painting, one which has little to do
                with its compositional arrangement or symbolic meaning but upon which we might
                inexplicably dwell, like the delicate stroke of lightning drawn in the corner of
                Giorgione’s <title level="m">The Tempest</title> (circa 1506).
                The sentence-image I’ve extracted from Shelley doesn’t undermine the figure of a
                “transparent” “shade;” and it suits the poem’s tone and tenor. But to me this
                sentence image also seems to <emph>belong elsewhere and on its own</emph>.
                This is the case in part because the image is invoked as something not necessarily
                experienced by the speaker: the feature of the veiled illumination does not belong
                to the speaker’s catalogue of observations but may merely be a recognizable
                aesthetic occurrence, a glimmer that is given or expected to occur under certain
                atmospheric conditions. Withdrawn from the longer passage, the extracted passage
                offers a discrete reflection on the temporality of images, the particular
                “when-ness” of a “veil of light.”<note place="foot" resp="author">I want to
                    acknowledge here my gratitude to Henry
                            Wonham for his generous and exacting reading of this essay and
                            especially for his eloquent and strenuous objections to my critical
                            practice of “image extraction.”</note> There is a compressed
                if passing constative and declarative independence to this sentence-image that
                invites us to take it as something complete and something known: “when a veil of
                light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer.” In any event, I <emph>feel</emph>
                the image’s invitation; and thus it is perhaps less accurate to say
                that I have extracted this image from the poem than it is to acknowledge how the
                image has extracted itself and solicited me in the process, the minor event of an
                image that arrests us without doing anything or promising more.</p>
                  <p> This is an essay about a minor event in a major poem; and I hope to demonstrate how
                the minor event of this detached image offers us a way of understanding what is
                <emph>in back of</emph> or <emph>behind</emph> the proto-cinematic energies on
                display in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. But I am also interested in
                exploring the inverse proposition: can the “minor” lyricism of our own contemporary
                cinema open a means of beholding the image-event in Shelley’s poem? If this second
                possibility is realized, perhaps it is possible to discern in these past poetic and
                present cinematic images a form of historical “circuitry” that reveals something
                about the agency or “currency” of images. I want to propose that the currency of the
                poetic image is best understood by what Roland Barthes identified as the
                <emph>obtus</emph> or “The Third Meaning,” a glimmering residue of the
                stilled cinematic image that offers the point of contact for the current that
                circulates between the literary and cinematic modes of image production.</p>
                  <p> In the following section of my essay, I explore this “minor currency” of the image
                by way of a constellation of critical positions or relays. If Barthes’s account of
                the <emph>obtus</emph> of the image is my point of departure, for my
                sky-map of history I look to Walter Benjamin’s <title level="a">On the Concept of History,</title>
                his final theses about the role of the image for historical constellations.<note place="foot" resp="author">All references to Walter Benjamin in the body of my essay are from his
                    theses <title level="a">On the Concept of History,</title> except
                            where noted.</note> For an understanding of the “detachability”
                of the image, I turn to Jean-Luc Nancy’s meditations on <title level="m">The Ground
                    of the Image</title>. However unlikely it may seem, Walter Pater’s notion of
                “appreciations” suggests a mode of discerning the force and mobility of literary and
                visual images. And finally Deleuze and Guattari’s notions of the
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign> and the assemblage in their book on Kafka suggest a way of thinking
                how image-connections work. In the third section of the essay, I turn to
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> (1998), Todd Haynes’s ambitious film about
                “glam rock” as both a consonant cultural text and a methodological guide for how we
                might use the currency of the “stilled” or arrested image to extract Shelley’s
                poetry of the “minor event.” I conclude the essay with a brief thought experiment
                which links the minor cinema of the third meaning to
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> in order to ask how this
                circuitry of images, simultaneously vibrant and beyond life, might open itself to
                the Deleuzian <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>.</p>
                  <p> My thinking about the poetic and cinematic meditation on the image is made possible
                by this array of theorists and poets and filmmakers who may share nothing more
                methodologically than a keen eye for detail and the apprehension of the minor event.
                If this poetic, cinematic, and theoretical constellation “lights up” for us to
                behold it—if it “glimmers” or “glitters”—then it might also offer us what Benjamin
                called a “historical construction”: this would not be another historical narrative,
                and not even a “counter-narrative,” but arrested and extracted dialectical images
                which, behind and beyond any story, offer a new way to think the sky map of “eternal
                history” as the “eternity of its transience” (407).</p>

                  <head>II. How to Stay Minor</head>
                  <p> It’s harder than one might think. A <emph>minor</emph> event seems like a
                contradiction in terms: the moment a literary or visual image or textual passage
                achieves the status of an <emph>event</emph>, it will have passed from its
                position as minor, lesser, or subordinate to the level of the major or the
                principal. I think we can assert with confidence that the hermeneutic project in
                literary and cultural interpretation is predicated on the achievement of the
                “major.” However divergent in implication or application, every influential critical
                undertaking I know of, belonging to critics as diverse as Auerbach, de Man,
                Greenblatt, Spivak, Žižek, involves some effort to isolate the unsuspecting detail
                or figure, unearth its hidden significance, and thereby move from the minor to the
                major. De Man’s <title level="a">Semiology and Rhetoric</title> offers a paradigmatic example of a critic
                attending to what may have appeared to the many trained and thoughtful readers
                before him to be the most insignificant distinction between a rhetorical and a
                literal question, only to learn that the “innocent-looking” exploration of a minor
                textual undecidabilty results in the “rhetorical suspension of logic and vertiginous
                possibilities of referential aberration.” “It turns out,” as de Man often puts it,
                that in “our” close philological scrutiny of these apparently minor rhetorical
                details, “we are in fact playing for very sizeable stakes” (10).</p>
                  <p> But what does it look like if we keep the <emph>stakes</emph> “minor”? My
                thinking about the minor event is prompted by Benjamin’s declaration in his third
                thesis on the concept of history: “The chronicler who narrates events without
                distinguishing between major and minor ones acts in accord with the following truth:
                nothing that has ever happened should be regarded as lost to history” (390). It’s
                easy to overlook the fact that Benjamin is making the
                case <emph>for</emph> the narration of minor events,
                especially since nothing feels <emph>minor</emph> about the <title level="a">Theses on the
                    Concept of History</title> and the “state of emergency” in which they were written: those
                are indeed “very sizeable stakes” (392). And the essay’s major declarations are the
                most memorable and most cited: “there is no document of culture which is not at the
                same time a document of barbarism,” “the historical materialist . . . remains in
                control of his powers, man enough to blast open the continuum of history,” “What we
                call progress is the <emph>storm</emph> (of history),” the “one single
                catastrophe” (396, 392). And for his agents of historical redemption, Benjamin
                invokes major theological figures: the “Angel of History,” the Antichrist and the
                Messiah, Judgment Day. Moreover, for his notion of historical redemption, Benjamin
                uses the theologically charged <foreign xml:lang="de">Erlösung</foreign> rather than the more
                prosaic <foreign xml:lang="de">Einlösung</foreign>, the “cashing in” or redemption value of
                deposits or vouchers. Nevertheless, this minor strain in Benjamin’s theses has not
                gone unnoticed. Elsewhere, Jacques Khalip and I have invoked Werner Hamacher’s
                account of Benjaminian redemption as what Hamacher calls “unactualized possibilities
                of that which is past: the unfinished, the failed, the thwarted” (40). If Benjamin’s
                conception of history is more <emph>kairological</emph> than
                chronological, his object of its redemption is reclaiming the lost currency of the
                minor event. “If the concept of redemption points towards a theology,” Hamacher
                writes, “then this is not a straightforwardly Judeo-Christian theology, but rather a
                theology of the missed or distorted—hunchbacked—possibilities, a theology of missed,
                distorted or hunchbacked time” (40).<note place="foot" resp="author">Benjamin’s
                    dissatisfaction with historicism and
                            his interest in the theological notion of a “redeemed” or “fulfilled”
                            time are present throughout his work, as is the careful distance he
                            keeps from the biblical origins of “messianic time.” In one of his
                            earliest writings on the <title level="m">Trauerspiel</title>—an
                            unpublished essay from 1916—Benjamin treats the Bible not as the source
                            but as a <emph>resource</emph>: “Historical time is infinite
                            in every direction and unfulfilled at every moment. This means we cannot
                            conceive of a single empirical event that bears a necessary relation to
                            the time of its occurrence. . . . [The] idea of fulfilled time is the
                            dominant historical idea of the Bible: it is the idea of messianic time.
                            Moreover, the idea of a fulfilled time is never identical with the idea
                            of an individual time” (55–56).</note>

                  <p> Here I want to enlist Hamacher’s reading as my prompt to thinking of the theses as
                Benjamin’s effort to “make minor” the notion of redemption and the theological
                structure from which he extracts it. If, as Benjamin continues, “our coming was
                expected on earth,” it is expected “like <emph>every</emph> generation that preceded us”: it
                is both always expected and it may always fail to arrive (390). Moreover, the
                “messianic power” with which we’ve been endowed is, as Michael Levine has stressed
                in his fine book with this title, <title level="m">A Weak Messianic Power</title>
                    [<foreign xml:lang="de">eine schwache messianische Kraft</foreign>]. It is this “weak” or
                minor power—what with perfect pitch Amanda Jo Goldstein calls a “slight
                susceptibility” (163)—that allows us to catch what Benjamin calls the “sun rising in
                the sky of history” not at daybreak but by way of the “secret heliotropism” of
                flowers, the most “inconspicuous of all transformations” (390).<note place="foot" resp="author">And perhaps
                            it’s in this spirit of “minorization” that we think of Benjamin’s “angel
                            of history” as it might be routed through the Hebrew, less as a savior
                            and more as a “messenger.”</note> “Every second,” writes
                Benjamin in thesis “B,” is “the small gateway in time” through which this “weak
                messianic power” “might enter” (397). For Levine, the “secret agreement” that is
                always in effect between past generations and the present is not a pact but an
                appointment or a rendezvous, one which may just as easily be missed as kept. The
                <emph>event</emph> for Benjamin is not the historical occurrence, not the
                    <emph>what</emph> that happened but the “image” projected from the
                past that may—or may not—be “caught” as it passes through the “sky of history,” both
                when the sun is rising and when it has set and left us with our shifting
                constellations in the night sky. “The true image of the past flits by,” writes
                Benjamin in the fifth thesis: “the past can be seized as an image that flashes up at
                the moment of its recognizability, and is never seen again” (390).<note place="foot" resp="author">Benjamin’s
                            account of the “flitting” and “flashing” of the image appears as
                            something like a refrain in his work, and not only as the “true” form of
                            the past’s historicity. See for instance the 1933 fragment <title level="a">On the
                                Mimetic Faculty</title>: “The mimetic element in language can, like a flame,
                            manifest itself only through a kind of bearer [<foreign xml:lang="de">Trager</foreign>].
                    This bearer is the semiotic element. Thus, the nexus
                            of meaning of words or sentences is the bearer through which, like a
                            flash, similarity appears. For its production by man—like its perception
                            by him—is in many cases, and particularly the most important, tied to
                            its flashing up. It flits past [<foreign xml:lang="de">Sie huscht
                            vorbei</foreign>]” (722).</note> For the Benjamin of the theses, the
                    <emph>truth</emph> of history is its status as an image: fragile,
                contingent, fugitive.</p>
                  <p> Benjamin posits a historian who “ceases to tell the sequence of events like beads of
                a rosary,” who resists the poverty of historicism’s directive to “establish a causal
                nexus” among consecutive events and to tell the past “as it really was” (397); and
                he imagines a “historian” who dispenses with the “idea that history is something
                which can be narrated” (<title level="a">Paralipomena</title> 406). But if the truth of history is not its
                sequential narrative but its composition as images that coalesce in a constellation,
                this implies that images must be independent of any narrative sequence or at least
                extractable from the course of empirical events. Jean-Luc Nancy identifies this
                “extractability” as the “essential” feature of the image: he calls it the image’s
                “distinction” (1). The image, writes Nancy, “must be detached, placed outside and
                before one’s eyes, . . . and it must be different from the thing. The image is a
                thing that is not the thing: it distinguishes itself from it, essentially” (2).
                According to Nancy, the “image is always sacred,” “set aside, removed, cut off” (1).
                Sacred but decisively <emph>not</emph> religious,
                which Nancy <emph>opposes</emph> to the sacred (1).
                For Nancy, the image as “the distinct stands apart from the world of things
                considered as a world of availability” and is “withdrawn” from utility or “has a
                completely different use” (2). In other words, this is the image’s sacred
                “redemption value,” a marking or a stigma which—withheld from any community of
                faith—exerts a force: the image “pulls and <emph>draws</emph>, . . . it
                    <emph>extracts</emph> something, an intimacy, a force” (4). The force
                of the image has nothing to do with what it represents; rather, the image for Nancy
                    <emph>is</emph> this force: “this intimate force is not ‘represented’
                by the image, but the image is it, the image activates it, draws it and withdraws
                it, extracts it by withholding it, and it is with this force that the image touches
                us” (5).</p>
                  <p> These features of the image—its extractability, its intimate force, its sacred
                “distinction”—are not, according to Nancy, limited to its visual properties: “the
                visual image plays the role of a model” for the extractable force of the image; but
                the “image is also musical, poetic, even tactile, olfactory or gustatory,
                kinaesthetic, and so on” (4). Perhaps this is what makes the sentence-image I have
                extracted from <title level="m">The Triumph</title> so “touching” and so definitive:
                withdrawn from the world of events—the events of the world and the events of the
                    poem—<emph>my</emph> image is itself a “glimmering” “veil of light”
                    “<emph>drawn</emph>” but not represented or representing, itself a
                force which comes from nowhere or, as Nancy claims for all images, “comes from the
                sky—not the heavens, which are religious, but from the skies, a term proper to
                painting” (5). “When a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer” is
                a poetic image which invokes the visual as the “model” for its own workings. It is
                the minor event of the image as such, the “order” of the image.</p>
                  <p> Once we have grasped the image as something to be drawn and withdrawn, distinct,
                extractable, sacred and redeemable, those of us motivated by Benjamin’s model of
                history must ask how a “constellation” comes into existence or, perhaps more
                precisely, how one beholds a constellation of images which was always present in
                “the eternal lamp” of history. At the most basic level, what connects one image to
                another if not narrative causality or sequentiality? If the relationship between
                images is no longer a matter of causality or sequence or mimesis, why does
                <emph>this</emph> one image connect with <emph>that</emph> one?
                How does something as complex and recognizable as a <emph>constellation</emph>
                of images come to be formed? How might we determine that a
                particular arrangement of images is a genuine constellation and not a mere asterism,
                or conveniently recognizable pattern of images? Benjamin doesn’t seem to imply that
                a constellation of images is solely the fictive projection of a percipient-beholder
                of sheerly random and contingent pulses of light and sensation. Perhaps, then,
                history’s event-images have their own agency or, more precisely, possess their own
                    <emph>currency</emph>?</p>
                  <p> A “currency” of the image seems the most appropriate way to understand Benjamin’s
                notion of the constellation and the potential for an historical “redemption” of
                event-images that “may be separated” by “thousands of years.” Perhaps it is no
                accident that, according to the <title level="m">OED</title>, each of the principal
                “current” meanings of the words “currency” and “current” had come into circulation
                by the time of Romanticism’s appearance: 1) currency as the “time during which
                something is current,” something like Benjamin’s “now-time”
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">Jetzeit</foreign>]; 2) currency as the “medium of exchange” or “the circulating
                medium,” that which establishes an object’s “redemption value”; 3) currency as the
                fact or quality of being current; and 4) “current” as “the name given to the
                apparent transmission or ‘flow’ of electrical force through a conducting body.” For
                Benjamin the “the dialectical image is an occurrence of ball lightning
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">Kugelblitz</foreign>] that runs across the whole horizon of the past”
                (403). An image’s currency is that which allows it to pass through and connect to
                another “conducting body” and which makes it susceptible to a “now-time” in which it
                may be redeemed. For Shelley that faculty for redemption is the imagination which in
                    <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (published posthumously in 1844) he
                defines as “the <emph>perception</emph> of value” (510; emphasis added).
                An image’s currency may circulate invisibly for epochs until it is clandestinely
                plugged in to the present with what Shelley, also in <title level="m">Defence</title>,
                calls its “electric life” (535). I’m interested in exploring the currency of images
                for the minor events they offer, the currency of their connections and the minor
                historical “back-ways” they light up, mostly hidden and often obscure, “glimmering”
                “veils of light” “drawn” across the sky.</p>
                  <p> If we are not accustomed to thinking of Pater alongside such figures as Benjamin or
                Nancy, the mode of aesthetic criticism Pater undertakes in <title level="m">The
                    Renaissance</title> (1873) offers an example of the kind of force or charge I am
                describing. Pater’s aesthetic critic “regards all the objects with which he has to
                do, all works of art, and the fairer forms of nature and human life, as powers or
                forces producing pleasurable sensations, each of a more or less peculiar or unique
                kind” (xx). Pater devotes himself to identifying and discerning the particular
                “powers or forces” of each image or text he is summoned to examine: his project is
                to locate that “active principle” of a text which has “crystallized” in the painting
                or the poem. “Sometimes fusing and transforming entire compositions” and “sometimes,
                as if at random depositing a fine crystal here or there,” this “active
                principle”—which is not a theme or a form or a genre—animates or charges the image
                (xxii). Few would accuse Pater of historicism; and the “studies” in
                <title level="m">The Renaissance</title> “trace” the “active principle” or current in
                an historically and culturally disparate constellation of pictures, stories, poems,
                and criticism that connects Heloise and Abelard to Winckelman and Goethe. </p>
                  <p> The currency of the image—what Pater might identify as its animating principle—is
                not the primary intended or symbolic meaning of the image but closer to what Barthes
                describes as its “image-residue” or “third meaning.” In his <title level="a">Research Notes on
                    Several Eisenstein Stills,</title> Barthes begins by pointing at an image from
                <title level="m">Ivan the Terrible</title> (1944) —the young tsar being showered with
                gold—and immediately distinguishes “three levels of meaning”: first, the level of
                “information” or “<emph>communication</emph>,” amenable to a “primary
                semiotics”; and second, the symbolic level where “referential,” stylistic, iconic,
                historical, and ideological symbolisms can be discerned (42). “This second level, in
                its totality,” writes Barthes, “is that of <emph>signification</emph>. Its
                mode of analysis would be a more highly elaborated semiotics than the first,” the
                mode of semiotic analysis with which he had been most identified and that had he
                done perhaps the most to refine (42). “The third meaning,” then, derives from the
                residue or leftovers of the first two levels, something detachable in that
                particular image that eludes semiotics and something from which Barthes says he
                “cannot detach” (42). <emph>Looking</emph> at the image, Barthes
                <emph>reads</emph> the “third meaning:” “I read, I receive (probably
                straight off, in fact) a third meaning, erratic yet evident and persistent” (42). No
                longer ideological, historical, symbolic, or referential, this third meaning, in
                fact, does not really belong to the domain of meaning at all but is experienced as
                    <emph>passing from</emph> communicative or symbolic or ideological
                meaning on its way to the “<emph>obtuse</emph>” (44). Without abandoning
                what Barthes calls the “good faith” of the referent or the sense of narration, the
                “obtuse” or “third” meaning is that feature or property of <emph>some</emph>
                images that “appears ‘in excess,’” writes Barthes, “as a supplement
                my intellection cannot quite absorb, a meaning both persistent and fugitive,
                apparent and evasive” (44). The third or obtuse meaning generated in these precious
                images elicits what he identifies, in his own quotation marks, as “a poetic
                apprehension” (43).</p>
                  <p> It is fascinating to watch Barthes cast about for the best way to describe the
                occasional and fleeting appearance of the third meaning, variously identified as a
                “blurring” of meaning, an “accent,” the emergence of a fold or crease, “a gash from
                which meaning is expunged,” an “anaphoric gesture without significant content” (56).
                It calls to mind the many “likenesses” which Shelley invokes in his <title>Hymn to
                    Intellectual Beauty</title> (1817) in order to signify the apprehension of beauty, as if to
                demonstrate that an infinite likeness and similitude is the very mode of beauty’s
                sensible appearances and its worldly consequences. The “obtuse meaning,” concludes
                Barthes, “inevitably appears as a luxury, an expenditure without exchange” (57). If
                Georges Bataille’s principle of expenditure is invoked here—and elsewhere in the
                essay Barthes refers explicitly to Bataille—it is a much gentler variation, one
                without sacrificial mutilation or rhetorical aggression, what we might call “minor
                    Bataille.”<note place="foot" resp="author">“This is just the kind of thing
                        Georges Bataille could have meant,
                            particularly in that text in <title level="m">Documents</title> which for
                            me situates one of the possible regions of the obtuse meaning:
                        <emph>The queen’s big toe</emph> (I don’t remember the exact
                        title)” (Barthes, <title level="a">Research Notes</title> 51).</note> Of course,
                Barthes is not satisfied with discerning occasions of the obtuse and delineating
                them from the levels of communication and symbolism available to semiotic analysis.
                Here as elsewhere, he is prompted to move from an act of apprehension to the
                mobilization of a new “practice”: “a new—rare—practice affirmed against a majority
                practice” (56). Though this vision of a practice emerging from the “third” or
                “obtuse” meaning may remain new and rare, Barthes proposes it as the minor route to
                the “flashes” of what he calls the “the founding act of the filmic,” that which
                “paradoxically cannot be grasped in the projected film, the film ‘in movement,’ but
                only, as yet in that <emph>major</emph> artifact which is the still” (59). </p>
                  <p> Acknowledging his “lack of cinematic culture,” Barthes wonders early on whether his
                “reading of this third meaning is justified” (43); and yet he insists that the
                “obtuse” is not merely his critical or affective projection but a recognizable
                property of the image itself: “if you look at these images I am talking about,
                <emph>you will see the meaning</emph>: we can understand each other about
                it ‘over the shoulder’ or ‘on the back’ of articulated language: thanks to the image
                (frozen, it is true. . . ), indeed thanks to what <emph>in the image is
                    purely image</emph> (and which to tell the truth, is very little indeed), we do
                without speech yet continue to understand each other” (55; emphasis added). Though
                the “obtuse meaning” “will not enter the critic’s metalanguage,” “you
                <emph>will</emph> see” it, if you look (55). By this point in the essay,
                Barthes has substituted seeing for reading in order to insist on this shared
                “apprehension,” one made possible by “what in the image is purely image” (55). This
                is where the “third meaning” resides: in that <emph>minimal</emph> portion
                of the image that is purely image, its <emph>minor</emph> portion that is
                nonetheless constitutive. We <emph>will</emph> all see it in the stilled
                image, the “freeze-frame” or, to use the name of a website devoted to this form of
                image extraction, the “filmgrab.”<note place="foot" resp="author">“filmgrab.com”
                    is an ongoing archive of thousands
                            of cinematic stills from canonical films, including
                    <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>.</note> The cinematic image, whether
                stilled, frozen, or seized and extracted, offers the prospect of lyrical moments
                that arrest the narrative, bring it to a standstill, in order to gather its own
                currency for future redemptions or dispersals. </p>

                invitation, I would have loved nothing more than to have been his imaginary
                interlocutor as we shared these images “over the shoulder” of “articulated
                language,” understanding each other—perhaps mutely—and simply pointing at what in
                those particular images is “purely image.” And yet, if I have always wanted to be a
                party to the “poetic apprehension” Barthes is experiencing and describing in that
                essay, in all honesty I find the <emph>idea</emph> of the “third meaning”
                more arresting than the images themselves. This is not the case with the
                complementary notion of the <emph>punctum</emph> that Barthes develops in
                    <title level="m">Camera Lucida</title>, his beautiful meditation on photography,
                in which I do feel and respond to the touch or prick of almost every example (or if
                I don’t yet <emph>feel</emph> it, I see how and why Barthes does).<note place="foot" resp="author">Of the many
                            commentators who have discussed this connection between the
                            <emph>obtus</emph> and the <emph>punctum</emph>, I would stress Derek Attridge’s bracing
                            essay on what he calls Barthes’s “impossible task” of naming and even
                            “codifying” a relationship that remains “singular” (88). Attridge links
                            this “impossibility” to Barthes’s embrace in the last decade of his life
                            to “something as vague as ‘aesthetic experience’” (85).</note>
                But in the earlier essay, I often fail to apprehend what Barthes assures me that I
                will see in those Eisenstein stills. So I seek out on my own a “third meaning” in
                the stilled images extracted from other motion pictures that move me. I feel
                authorized in this undertaking by the belief that for Barthes’s notion of the “third
                meaning” to have genuine analytical purchase or “currency,” we must be able to
                locate convincing examples of this effect outside the films of Eisenstein. </p>
                  <p> Cinematic genre is irrelevant to the emergence of the <emph>obtus</emph>:
                the issue of genre and its conventions, its expectations, and even its deviations
                all fall within the purview of Barthes’ “second meaning.” But Faflak’s essay on the
                cinematic aspects of “Shelley’s final spectacle” raises important generic questions
                about <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> when he argues that the poem
                anticipates and “parallels” the genre of the film musical, which it then turns
                inside out. As Faflak puts it, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “parallels von
                Trier’s vision of a musical utopianism violently wagering the stakes of subjectivity
                dreamed by its phantasmatic afflatus” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168). Faflak’s essay prompted me to
                consider what other film genres might be at play with or might “parallel” this poem.
                If the poem’s Italianate mode and structure suggest the “epic,” it would be an epic
                that may have Virgil and Dante as poetic precedents but that has no precedent in
                film history. Perhaps, as James McFarland suggested, we should think of the poem in
                terms of “zombie films,” given the “undead” aspects of the disfigured Rousseau as
                well as the lifeless “crowds” (50) and “multitudes” (49) that greet and accompany
                the triumph as a zombie-apocalypse.<note place="foot" resp="author">When I presented
                    an early version of this essay at
                            Vanderbilt University in 2015, McFarland suggested that “what was once
                            Rousseau” was perhaps best understood as
                    “zombie-Rousseau.”</note>

                  <p> In this generic vein, the cinematic and thematic aspects of <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title> anticipate what Peter Szendy has called
                “apocalypse-cinema.” Szendy’s genre is a cluster of contemporary films that meditate
                on or project images of the apocalypse: <title level="m">Terminator</title>, <title level="m">Planet
                    of the Apes</title> (and its many sequels), <title level="m">A.I.</title>,
                <title level="m">Blade Runner</title>, <title level="m">Sunshine</title>, <title level="m">The
                    Road</title>, and above all and “after all,” <title level="m">Melancholia</title>,
                Lars von Trier’s 2011 film that for Szendy defines the “apocalyptic genre,” where
                    “<emph>the end of the world is the end of the movie</emph>.” Or, as
                Szendy also suggests, “vice versa (because this terrifying equation of filmic
                eschatology can be reversed without being changed in the slightest):
                <emph>The end of the movie is the end of the world</emph>” (2). Percy
                Shelley’s untimely death by drowning interrupted what we might understand to be the
                inexorable drive to the apocalypse generated by his final poem; but the poem and its
                visions also seem propelled to what Szendy calls the “after all”
                [<foreign xml:lang="fr">après tout</foreign>]: both the minimizing response (“it’s only a movie or a poem,
                after all”) and its excess, the thing that remains after it’s “all over” (2). When
                the screen goes black for a full ten seconds after the annihilation of the earth at
                the end of <title level="m">Melancholia</title>, there “is no longer really cinema any
                more” but rather the “cinema of the after all” (3). And it can certainly feel as if
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is headed in that direction, drawn
                toward the apocalyptic specter of the “after all” or <foreign xml:lang="fr">après
                    tout</foreign>, and not just in terms of the apparently inexorable annihilation of
                everything that appears in the wake of the historical pageant.<note place="foot" resp="author">With the end
                            in mind, consider Khalip’s lovely reflection on <title level="m">The
                                Triumph</title>’s “<emph>after-look</emph>”: “What if we took
                    the brief and under-read lastness of the
                            line ‘as if that look must be the last’ as a very particular kind of
                            utterance, stolen ‘as if’ from the poem’s social fabric and effectively
                            pulling it apart like an end of the world? The line would be a last
                            scrap of the poem but, principally, it would also push up against the
                            lastness of the look. What would then happen to the world after the last
                            look? And what is an after-look?”
                            (<title level="m">Last Things</title> 76).</note>
                In one sense, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> projects cinema’s pre-history with
                its own elaborate attention to the apparatus and the effects of cinematic illusions,
                what Faflak calls “the refulgent source of cinema’s illuminations” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168),
                as well as the <emph>end</emph> of cinema, or cinema as the end, in terms
                of the “white-outs” produced by “a shape all light.” But that form of closure or
                finality seems at odds with the vitally eruptive “visions” and skeptical “vacancies”
                of Shelley’s poetics and with the propulsive nature of the poem, one in which the
                perpetual poetic interruption of ever new visions and even the poet’s own death
                forestalls the inexorable pull of the “after all.” More precise to say that
                Shelley’s final spectacle projects its reader-beholders as well its spectator-actors
                to the images <emph>after the end</emph>. And, after all, what attracts me
                to this poem is an image from the prologue where we encounter not the “after-all” of
                a proto-apocalyptic cinema but the <emph>before all</emph> of the
                pre-production, <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s “back story.” </p>
                  <p> The film from which I will extract an image that qualifies as a “minor event” and
                which I believe to exhibit the “third meaning” is not an epic, a “zombie-film,” or
                an example of apocalyptic cinema. Haynes’s <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>
                bears no generic relationship to Shelley’s <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title>, unless we consider their mutual lack of stable genre conventions to
                be analogous. Nor is there any implicit or explicit Shelleyan influence on the story
                or the characters of Haynes’s ambitious and delirious 1998 film about a fictitious
                episode in 1970s British “glam rock,” the brief musical and cultural phenomenon that
                even rock music historians, especially in the U.S., typically characterize as its
                own “minor event.”<note place="foot" resp="author">Of course, David Bowie, on whom the character of
                            Brian Slade is “virtually” based, qualifies as the “major star” produced
                            by the fleeting period of glam rock; and, again of course, “glam” was
                            only one of his many personae or poses. Bowie did not permit any of his
                            own music to be used in the film, though <title level="a">Velvet Goldmine</title> is the title
                            of a B-side from a Bowie single.</note>
                     <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, which is in part a musical, also reflects
                and <emph>projects</emph> what Faflak calls vis-à-vis
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “a society of the spectacle
                still in visual flux”; and I think it qualifies as another installment in what he
                elegantly characterizes as a “history fascinated by the production of images that
                body forth life, then compromise any return to life itself” (<title level="a">Dancing</title> 168).
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> is not so much a glam rock biopic as it as an
                allegory of cultural history in the vein of Benjamin, Wilde, and Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="author">I regard Shelley’s <title level="m">Defence</title> and Wilde’s

                            examples of the mode of cultural history Benjamin develops in his

                    this constellation I would add Greil Marcus’s <title level="m">Lipstick Traces</title>,
                    a book to which Haynes also pays
                            homage as he tracks across a series of glam rock album covers in a
                            record store, and we see one of Slade’s fictional singles bearing the
                            title <title level="m">Lipstick Traces</title>.</note> For
                Haynes, glam rock is a momentary and minimal appearance of a queering spirit that,
                as Faflak puts it, “bodies forth life” as it is represented as erupting from
                London’s underground in the 1970s (168). </p>
                  <p> My interest here is something quite minor in every sense, something that rarely
                rises to the level of analytical importance, even for the film’s most attentive
                critics. With Benjamin also in my mind, I want briefly to examine how the film shows
                us something that <emph>never happened</emph>. For this exploration I turn
                to the film’s “back-story,” the four-minute pre-credit “overture” which makes no
                mention of the film’s major characters. The film opens with a shot in the midst of a
                nighttime constellation of stars and an audio sampling of old muffled British radio
                recordings, transmissions beaming through space from distant epochs. The first
                spoken voice is that of the narrator, Janet McTeer, delivering what sounds as if it
                should be the lost fragment of a thesis from Benjamin’s final meditation on history:
                    “<emph>Histories, like ancient ruins, are the fictions of empires.
                    While everything forgotten hangs in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to
                    return.</emph>” I remember acutely the experience of hearing this narration when I
                first saw the film in the theater: I was convinced Haynes had gained access to some
                secret Benjamin archive and had uncovered a new “paralopenomenon” of the
                <title level="a">Theses.</title>
                But the film’s initiating voice-over also conjures the model of history suggested by
                Benjamin in an earlier essay on Kafka: “Everything forgotten mingles with what has
                been forgotten of the pre-historic world, forms countless, uncertain, changing
                compounds, yielding a constant flow of new strange products” (qtd. in Bensmaia
                    xii).<note place="foot" resp="author">Bensmaia’s account of the
                        <title level="a">Kafka Effect</title> offers an illuminating model
                            for the kind of “constellation” I am proposing here. Without conflating
                            Deleuze and Guattari with Benjamin or even suggesting a resemblance
                            between them, Bensmaia posits Kafka as what we might describe as their
                            “nodal” connection. The Kafka that Benjamin shares with Deleuze and
                            Guattari is one resistant to the exegetical modes imposed upon him, the
                            Kafka who rejects symbolic, allegorical, mythical, and theological
                            interpretations in order to allow the “Kafka-universe” to emerge, in
                            Deleuze and Guattari’s case the Kafka who introduces a “minor
                            literature.”</note> Benjamin’s Kafka describes Todd Haynes’s
                cinematic perception of the production/projection of “glam rock”: something from a
                forgotten world that “mingles” with the present and by “changing compounds” yields a
                flow of “new strange products.”</p>
                  <p> Following the film’s opening images and lines, and still very much lost in the
                stars, a spaceship that looks as if it has flown straight from a Jules Verne
                inspired B-Movie descends to Earth amid tufts of space clouds, depositing on a
                storybook Dublin doorstep in 1854 a baby swaddled in a blanket pinned with an
                emerald green broach. Bestowed or abandoned, the baby is Oscar Wilde, our first
                “space oddity” or cosmic nomad.<note place="foot" resp="author">In
                    <title level="a">Superstardust,</title> the interview with Oren
                            Moverman which prefaces the published screenplay, Haynes is particularly
                            eloquent on the historical relationship between Wilde and glam rock: “It
                            quickly became clear to me that glam came out of the English tradition
                            of camp and applied counter-philosophies about art and culture, which I
                            saw originating from Oscar Wilde. To me Wilde became the perfect
                            manifestation of the glam era. . . . I think glam rock was the first
                            overt alignment of the notion of the alien with the notion of the
                            homosexual—both of which became this fantastical, galvanizing potential
                            for musical expression, a potential freedom for kids trapped in their
                            dreary lives. The space ship definitely brings in the outsider elements
                            of the period, which I attribute to Wilde and dandyism, but it also
                            refers to feelings of ‘otherness’ confronted at the time of adolescence”
                            (xii–xiii).</note> We watch along with the Wildes and their
                housekeeper as the spaceship returns to the stars; and the film then cuts to a scene
                featuring a classroom of Irish schoolboys, nine to ten years old, who stand one by
                one in a tight tracking shot declaring their aspirations before their prim
                schoolmaster. “I want to be a barrister,” says one; “I want to be a farmer,” and so
                on, until the final boy, labeled “O. Wilde” and wearing the green broach, rises and
                declares, “I want to be a pop idol.” And as if to demonstrate how “Benjaminian”
                constellations are formed, the subsequent scene is separated from Wilde’s arrival by
                “one hundred years.” The film cuts to a scene of a young boy, Jack Fairy, who—after
                being beaten by a score of bullying schoolmates—lays face down in the street, his
                lip bloodied, and discovers in the dirt and grime the emerald broach that adorned
                Oscar Wilde. The following scene looks as if it is a hand-drawn page in a children’s
                picture-book, one featuring a little boy in school shorts walking into the sunlight
                as the narrator’s voice-over resumes: “<emph>Childhood, adults always
                    say, is the best time in life. But as long as he could remember, Jack Fairy knew
                    better</emph>.” The narration continues as the film cuts to a series of dark
                interior shots featuring the head of the boy bathed in blue light and poised in
                three different angles before a mirror we never quite see—“<emph>Until
                    one mysterious day when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others
                    quite like him, singled out for a great gift</emph>.” Jack Fairy meticulously
                draws the blood from his wound as if it were lipstick until his eyes flash on his
                reflection, suddenly smiling directly at the mirror/camera/spectator as the narrator
                concludes her overture: “<emph>and one day the whole stinking world
                    would be theirs</emph>.”<note place="foot" resp="author">It’s impossible to resist recognizing in this

                            the screenplay specifies as his “mother’s vanity”), he—and we—recognize
                            his image as both subject and object of desire.</note>

            The title sequence which erupts from this moment takes place in London in 1972 as
                scores of giddy glitter kids pour across the Waterloo Bridge and fill the streets to
                the jubilant guitars in the opening strains of Brian Eno’s <title level="a">Needle
                    in a Camel’s Eye</title>
                in what reminds me of Shelley’s “glorious phantoms” who “burst” from the “graves” of
                “England in 1819” to “illumine our tempestuous day” (13–14).</p>
                  <p> Though there are repeated sightings of Jack Fairy, he is not a
                <emph>character</emph> in the film; and his presence is as solitary as it is ephemeral.
                He doesn’t utter a line of dialogue in the movie, although he does deliver a song—a
                highly stylized version of Roxy Music’s “2HB”—and recites a few lines of poetry.
                Jack Fairy is just an image, in other words, a transitory image of transit; and his
                function in the film, tangential to the story itself, is to show us the transfer of
                the emerald broach from the stars to Oscar Wilde and Fairy and on to Curt Wild
                before it is deposited with Arthur Stuart near the movie’s end. Jack Fairy is the
                image for what I am calling the currency of images, the film’s “minor event” that
                shows us how to assemble images in constellation. On the other hand, Jack Fairy’s
                recognition scene, his moment of redemption, is the minor event: the bloodied lip
                drawn into lipstick by virtue of the green broach, sent from the heavens, but dug
                out of the grimy street by Jack Fairy. And thus for Jack Fairy and for those “others
                quite like him”: in this fleeting but precious moment of redemption,
                <emph>we</emph> are those others and this moment is
                <emph>ours</emph> as well since <emph>we</emph> behold ourselves in
                <emph>his</emph> reflection and are thus positioned in this fantasy of the
                mirror stage to declare, as does Arthur in another scene, “<emph>that’s
                    me! that’s me!</emph>” Saturated in dazzling blue light, the stilled smile of Jack
                Fairy in the mirror/camera, which is simultaneously our own visual address, produces
                for <emph>me</emph> the “third meaning,” a non-signifying or symbolic
                image that retains its residue and which never returns to the “first” or “second”
                regimes of meaning. If it comes from the film’s overture, it also now belongs to us,
                its most current observers. </p>
                  <p> In his <title level="m">Dialogues</title> with Claire Parnet, Gilles Deleuze offers a
                beautiful account of the constellation of philosophers that “singled him out” and
                his construction of this “sky-map” of philosophers conveys the sense of the
                relationships I am suggesting, one that exists in the “ideal space” of
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>:

            Lucretius, Spinoza, Hume, Nietzsche, Bergson: These thinkers have few relationships
                with each other . . . and yet they do have them. One might say that something
                happens between them, at different speeds with different intensities, which is not
                in one or other, but truly in an ideal space, which is no longer a part of history,
                still less a dialogue among the dead, but an interstellar conversation, between very
                irregular stars, whose different becomings form a mobile bloc which it would be a
                case of capturing, an inter-flight, light-years. (15–16)

            Wilde, Fairy, Wild-Pop, Slade-Bowie, Cobain: these figures in literary and popular

                currency between these very “irregular stars” constitutes its own sort of pop
                “interstellar conversation,” one which achieves its own originating energy with the
                third meaning of a special but minor image.</p>

                  <p>How are constellations formed between poems and films, or between paintings and
                prose? Outside of cultural “influence” or historical development, how do these
                connections occur? What is the nature of their currency? Invoking what Deleuze calls
                the “ideal spaces” of his history of philosophy, I believe that “something happens”
                between Haynes and Shelley, separated by 175 years and at least one artistic medium,
                in the “ideal spaces” of Shelley’s poetry and Haynes’s cinema
                (<title level="m">Dialogues</title> 15). <title level="m">A
                    Defence of Poetry</title> proposes an unprecedented model of cultural history which
                features moments of the eruption of “spirit” (Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Shakespeare,
                Bacon, Milton, Bacon, Rousseau, and the celebrated “spirit” of his own “age”) as
                well as periods of decay and regression and Benjaminian states of emergency, moments
                of spirit’s eruption and extinction (535). For Haynes as for Shelley, cultural and
                artistic history is not an evolutionary development but lyric pulses of
                possibilities throughout time, pulses which find their own connections, regardless
                of theme or genre: for the Shelley of the <title level="m">Defence</title>, they are
                Plato’s dialogues, Dante’s poetry, Milton’s epic, and Bacon’s scientific enquiry.
                For the Haynes of <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, they are Wilde’s origins
                and his poetry, Fairy’s poses, glam’s eruption, the anticipation of Cobain.</p>
                  <p> Narrative history in <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title> is a recursive and
                filtered account, one that splinters its invocation to <title level="m">Citizen
                    Kane</title>’s (1941) cinematic investigations; and
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> features a similar narrative
                structure as well as the fractured deployment of Dante’s <emph>terza
                    rima</emph>. Both Haynes and Shelley offer us “prologues” or “overtures,” their
                own “back stories” that set the principal narratives in motion. And both artists
                fashion stories constructed by multiple retrospections and looping narratives: back
                stories, “present” narratives, followed by “pre-stories” which often appear as
                arresting “lyric” events. Marcia Landy’s thoughtful characterization of
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>’s narrative “technique” as
                “investigative”—“what happened?” asks Arthur—applies to <title level="m">The
                    Triumph</title>: Shelley’s speaker and interlocutor ask the same questions: what
                happened? how have things “been brought to this dread pass” (301–2)? in “this valley
                of perpetual dream / Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why” (397–98). And in
                both film and poem, answers to these questions fail to materialize, replaced instead
                by “savage music, stunning music” (435), “flashing” images and a “shape all light”
                (351–52), what an exhilarated Bowie would much later call <title level="a">Sounds
                and Visions.</title> And in the course of what are by turns lavish and garish spectacles paraded
                in both film and poem, “spectators” “turn” into “actors or victims” (305–6). At the most
                fundamental level, both texts explore the relationship between life and the image,
                the relationship of “fair shapes” or fairy shapes to “light’s severe excess” (411,
                424). “A man’s life is his image,” says Curt Wild near the end of
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>. But the affinities between poem and film aside, my
                primary motivation in this essay has been to learn how to discern the “third
                meaning,” the <emph>obtus</emph> that attaches to the extracted, stilled
                image in poetry and in film.</p>
                  <p> Though the particular experience of reading <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> I want to describe has less to do with its narrative dimension than
                with the minor effects of a single atmospheric image, that image’s “minorization”
                produces its effects in relation to the scale and breadth of the story Shelley’s
                poem tells about history. The first forty lines of the poem are devoted to the
                speaker’s physical placement as he lounges outside in the shadow of the Apennines at
                daybreak in the moments before “A vision on his brain is rolled” (40). The next
                section of the poem, roughly 130 lines, depicts the “waking dream” as it unrolls
                before the speaker. It’s a grim “triumphal” pageant of history—complete with its own
                chariot—one which celebrates the conquerors. The speaker grows weary and
                disillusioned of this spectacle, the “jubilee” that greets a conqueror’s advance:
                “Struck to the heart by the sad pageantry” of Western history, the speaker asks
                aloud “what is this?” (176–77). He is answered by the disfigured image of “what was
                once Rousseau” which becomes his Virgilian guide and commentator to the unfolding
                spectacle, though “Rousseau’s” commentary only compounds the speaker’s distress when
                he learns that in this version of the “jubilee” the “captive multitude” is chained
                to the “triumphal pageant” of “thoughts empire over thought” (111, 119, 118, 211):
                anarchs, demagogues, <emph>and</emph> sage, even Voltaire and Kant, an
                extensive catalogue of those Bowie called the “men who sold the world.” Only the
                “sacred few,” Christ and Socrates, escape this ideological vision by remaining what
                de Man calls “mere fictions in the writings of others” (97). In the last extant
                section of the poem, Shelley’s speaker turns to this post-Rousseau to ask how of all
                the historical figures on display, his guide became complicit with the “triumph of
                life.” The disfigured Rousseau then relays the nature of his own seduction and
                undoing by a mesmerizing “shape all light,” one that turned his brain to sand. Percy
                Shelley’s drowning brings the poem to an end; but it’s difficult to see how the
                obliterating pull of these repeated visionary disfigurements could be “brushed
                against the grain,” difficult to foresee how any “glorious phantoms” could burst
                from this grave pageantry to “illumine its tempestuous day” given that life and
                death have grown into mirrored images of each other, leaving the speaker/viewer
                “eye-sick”: “mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow” (298). If Shelley’s “cinema”
                is predicated on the hope that it might discover “a trace of light diviner than the
                common sun / Sheds on the common earth” (338–39), it is not to be found in the movie
                we call <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>. Or at least not in its diegesis:
                I want to conclude my essay by considering how a version of the Deleuzian
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>, might be assembled for Shelley’s last poem from
                Barthes’s critical observation and Haynes’s cinematic thinking about the workings of
                the poetic “still.” Perhaps in that stilled image we might find “a trace of light
                diviner.”</p>
                  <p> If <title level="m">The Triumph</title> activates the many philological resources of
                “still,” the effect of all this “stilling” in this most restless and mobile of
                Shelley’s poetry is ironic, as if it should suggest the possibility of an arrest or
                standstill that its propulsive movement forecloses. When, for instance, the “strange
                distortion” called Rousseau describes the effects of the “shape all light,” one of
                those effects is the obliterating of her poetic feet through which “the sweet tune /
                To which they moved, seemed as they moved to blot / The thoughts” of all beholders
                (180, 352, 382–84). Here, the poetic measures of verse, when delivered—or “flung”—by
                a “shape all light,” “blot” the “thoughts” of the gazers, a poetic obliteration that
                seems to characterize each successive manifestation of the vision (386). Inscribed,
                however, in these lines is a characteristic Shelleyan pun, which isolated in a sort
                of “poetry grab,” brushes the poetics of obliteration against the grain with the
                urgency of an alarm: “<emph>still</emph> her feet,” demands the poem,
                <emph>arrest</emph> the relentless imposition of the
                “Shape’s” effects.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="a">Living
                    On/Borderlines,</title> Derrida traces “living on as the braiding of triumph
                            and <emph>arret</emph>.” Indeed, his “double-reading” of
                            Blanchot’s <foreign xml:lang="fr">L’arrêt du mort</foreign> with
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> suggests an involution of these figures,
                            one that makes possible “a certain intertranslatability
                            (<emph>triumphant</emph> and <emph>arrested</emph>) of these two texts” (107–08). In her
                            game-changing essay on the Lucretian impulses in Shelley’s last poem,
                            Goldstein outlines a philosophical foundation to the poem’s subterranean
                            arrest or resistance; and she argues that the final and critically
                            “neglected ‘new Vision’ with which Shelley’s poem breaks off . . . urges
                            readers to review the scene of life that <title level="m">The Triumph
                                of Life</title> has been showing all along, but this time under changed
                            philosophical premises about the relation of life, matter, and trope”
                            (138). For Goldstein this “new Vision” is very much a “coming
                            attraction,” one produced by Shelley’s “retrieval”—or what I might call
                                <emph>redemption</emph>—of “Lucretius’ (now) astonishing
                            poetics of sensation” (150).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> The triumphal pageant exerts a diachronic force generated by its own propulsive
                <emph>terza rima</emph>, its motion accelerated by enjambments that create
                the effect of a perpetually receding horizon line drawn by some unnamed and
                invisible force. As exhilarating as this unrelenting horizontal movement of the poem
                can be for even its most seasoned readers, the repeated sudden “vertical” “bursts”
                of visions and shapes and figures—like repeatedly pulsed stills—exert an obtuse
                force on the obvious ideological dimension of the poem’s story. Shelley’s critical
                version of Platonism always conveys a proto-cinematic quality, but
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> realizes it as tenor and vehicle. It is the
                combination of features both obvious and obtuse, both major and minor, that makes
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> a movie. Goldstein has shown
                compellingly how the images that unfold in the poem’s vision—“like atomies that
                dance / Within a sunbeam” (446–47)—“signal an emphatic switch to an alternative,
                neo-Lucretian model of sensation and figuration” (155), but the passage has always
                struck me as motes dancing in the projection beam, a sign of what Orrin Wang has
                called the “coming attractions” of Romanticism’s proto-cinematic verse that
                manufactures the opportunity to see “the <emph>in</emph> visible in the
                image, the always social self in projected, kinetic form” (<title level="a">Coming
                    Attractions</title> 500).</p>
                  <p> As much as my intellectual orientations and political impulses are engaged by the
                poem’s critique of European history, it is not the poem’s political project that
                compels me to sit down and read it again and again. It is rather to renew the
                experience of the poem’s cascading visions and figures that come from nowhere and
                arrest or dissolve the poem’s narrative movement. And above all it is the strangely
                affecting couple of lines about that evening glimmer on the hills in a poem that
                seems to have galvanized all the formal and rhetorical resources available to
                British poetry. To invoke the famous dictum attributed to Gramsci—“pessimism of the
                intellect, optimisim of the will”—those two lines of the poem allow us to see at one
                and the same time the pessimism of the poet, but the optimism of the verse. In other
                words, the poem undertakes a radical negation and performs a radical affirmation.
                This double-movement takes place simultaneously: the corrosively ironic triumphal
                pageant of “universal history” paraded before the speaker-beholder and the eruptive
                    <emph>terza rima</emph> that generates ever new visions that seem to unfold on
                perpetually receding planes of immanence. </p>
                  <p> I am availing myself of a Deleuzian idiom, one which activates the politically
                resistant and “optimistic” aspects of the “<foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign>” in
                Shelley’s poem. For Deleuze and Guattari a “minor literature”
                <quote>
                finds itself positively charged with the role and function of collective, and even
                revolutionary, enunciation. It is a literature that produces an active solidarity in
                spite of skepticism; and if the writer is in the margins or completely outside his
                or her fragile community, this situation allows the writer all the more the
                possibility to express another possible community and to forge the means for another
                consciousness and another sensibility. (<title level="m">Kafka</title> 17)
                </quote>
            Has there ever been a better way to characterize the Percy Shelley of <title level="m">The
                Triumph of Life</title>: “outside his fragile community,” such as
                it was in 1819 on the Tuscan coast, seeking an “active solidarity in spite of
                skepticism”—an undying skepticism—and writing “to forge” in poetry “the means for
                another consciousness and another sensibility”? In spite of his skepticism, Shelley
                would have understood the project of his literature as “positively charged with the
                role and function of collective, and even revolutionary, enunciation,” a
                <emph>currency</emph> of his poetic images he called “electric energy”
                (535): the energy of the poem’s enjambments, the energy of the <emph>terza
                    rima</emph> planes, the energy of a revolutionary impulse in the poem’s
                charged undertaking. “We might as well say,” as do Deleuze and Guattari, “that minor
                no longer designates specific literatures but the revolutionary conditions for every
                literature within the heart of what is called great (or established) literature”
                    (<title level="m">Kafka</title> 18).</p>
                  <p> The Deleuzian <foreign xml:lang="fr">mineur</foreign> helps us to understand how
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, a poem that seems to explore not only
                the events of European history, but how the very “eventness” of the event might
                simultaneously mark the event’s “minorization.” “History,” writes Deleuze in his
                account of Nietzsche’s
                <title level="m">On the Genealogy of Morals</title>, “thus
                appears as the act by which reactive forces take possession of culture or divert its
                course in their favor. The triumph of reactive forces is not an accident in history
                but the principle and meaning of ‘universal history’”
                (<title level="m">Nietzsche</title> 139). If we hear in these
                sentences echoes of Benjamin, there is also no better way to summarize
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s critical impulse toward
                history. Nor can I think of a better way to characterize the effect of Shelley’s
                refusal of a sober revolutionary <emph>ascesis</emph> than the “nomadic”
                Italianate estrangement of English verse forms that characterize his poetic
                intervention, every bit as jubilant as the guitars in a Roxy Music
                song.<note place="foot" resp="author">I know of no
                            better way of describing the <emph>jubilance</emph> of the
                            poem than Claire Colebrook’s account of the crucial challenge of
                            discovering instances or events of an “art that <emph>is
                                joyous</emph>, that intimates a joy outside humanity and organisms. .
                            . . Canonical literature gives us some indication of an autonomy of
                            created affects that are not those of the organism, as though art could
                            give body to that which exceeds the lived. . . . It is as though these
                            worlds offered affects as such, there <emph>to be
                            lived</emph>, as if they existed as potentialities for all time, even if
                            captured through the depiction of a certain time” (93–94).</note>
                            As Deleuze describes this aspect of poetic
                minorization: “The overload is not a rhetorical figure, a metaphor, or symbolic
                structure; it is a mobile paraphrase bearing witness to the unlocalized presence of
                an indirect discourse at the heart of <emph>every statement. The closer
                    a language gets to this state, the closer it comes . . . to music itself”</emph>
                    (<title level="m">Thousand</title> 104). It’s no accident that this sounds more
                than a little like a “mobile paraphrase” of Walter Pater, since Deleuze’s notion of
                minorization always involves the arresting of poetic representation: in its minor
                mode, “<emph>language stops being representative in order to move toward
                    its extremities or its limits</emph>” (Kafka 23). <title level="m">The Triumph of
                    Life</title> is a poem that seems to make its devotees—if not its genuine
                readers—into Paterian acolytes of one sort or another, whether willingly or not. In
                <title level="a">The School of Giorgione,</title> Pater famously or scandalously invokes the
                <foreign xml:lang="de">Anderstreben</foreign> or “other striving” of each mode of art: “it is
                noticeable,” writes Pater, “that, in its special mode of handling its given
                material, each art may be observed to pass into the condition of some other art, by
                what German critics term an <foreign xml:lang="de">Anderstreben</foreign>—a partial alienation
                from its own limitations, through which the arts are able . . . to lend each other
                new forces” (105). If cinema is the “as yet unimagined” art, the coming attraction
                that lends Shelley’s poetry its own “new forces,” its Paterian-Lucretian
                constellation of sheer sensations or what Pater calls “a matter of pure perception”
                shows how Shelley’s last poem poses the example to which all of cinema still strives
                (108).</p>
                  <p> If <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>is a poem that
                moves toward language’s “extremities” and thus minorizes its relation to European
                history, what “gets” the poem going towards that minor event are the preliminary
                lines, which include a cinematic vision of their own, the majestic procession of a
                sunrise that Derrida describes as “the outpouring of light and solar glory” (<title level="a">Living
                On</title> 131). Oddly in this poem that seems at every turn to explore and deepen the
                problem of spectatorship, the sunrise itself goes entirely unbeheld by our speaker
                or any entity other than the “awakened earth.” But in lines 26–40, we are presented
                with a cinematic projection: a “strange trance” “grows” over the speaker’s fancy
                which in turn “spreads” “a shade” so “transparent” that the <emph>scene</emph>
                came “through / As when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening
                hills they glimmer.” Shelley anticipates both the cinematic apparatus and the
                quasi-hypnotic spell it induces, and once we are introduced to the advent of sound,
                “sweet talk in music through the enamoured air,” the “vision” can be “rolled” not
                “in his mind” but by way of this carefully delineated external apparatus,
                “<emph>on his brain</emph>” (40 emphasis added).<note place="foot" resp="author">I
                    am both drawn critically to and
                            dazzled by Shelley’s anticipatory poetic symbolization of the cinematic
                            apparatus and the positioning of the spectator in preparation for the
                            epic film of European history that the poem subsequently unfolds. The
                            proem spells out in advance the kind of demystification of the cinematic
                            illusion-machine that was the project of so much of the 1970s as well as
                            the bedazzling effects—“the fascination of film”—that Barthes
                            acknowledges in <title level="a">Leaving the Movie Theatre,</title> “spent visions”
                    <emph>and</emph> “a trace of diviner light” (348).</note>
                  </p>
                  <p> However much I find this aspect of the poem critically compelling as a poetic figure
                which anticipates the full range of a future medium’s possibility and effects, I
                always feel myself drawn more to the detached glimmering image of a
                <emph>veil of light drawn</emph> over evening hills.
                In this magnetic moment, my critical appreciation of Shelley’s account of the
                cinematic apparatus recedes in the light of this single image: a “drawing” possessed
                of its own agency, an application of its own force that not only pulls a veil over
                the hills but <emph>traces</emph> a line that is extended, lengthened,
                <emph>unfolded</emph>. Shelley animates the various resources of this
                simple word “draw” and in the process galvanizes the effect of this subjectless and
                potentially agentless verb. To draw can mean to carry or convey a vehicle, even if
                that vehicle is the tail end of a simile; or it can mean to represent a picture, to
                draw in words, or to attract, as by a rhetorical force that seems to exude the
                magnetic qualities it generates, a force that draws us to it, “singling us out,” and
                makes it arresting. Most suggestively for me is the meaning of drawing as
                “extraction,” as when one draws a conclusion from an investigation or perhaps as
                when one extracts or draws out an image to which one is drawn. If this veil of light
                is not yet the historical pageant of images that unfolds in Shelley’s cinematic
                vision, it is perhaps what Barthes calls the third meaning of the “stilled” image,
                the “founding act of the filmic,” at least of Shelley’s own poetic cinema, the gift
                of a glimmering lyrical minor event inscribed like a pulse or a broach in the poetic
                and cinematic image, the promise of a currency.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">The Triumph of Life compels us to read it, asserting how much reading,
            Romanticism, and reading Romanticism are all different modalities of compulsion that
            structure our cultural, historical, and material lives. Yet as much as the origins of this
            volume might have been based on this insight, each of the essays collected here alight
            upon a dimension of Shelley’s poem—for Khalip the figure of the last, for Fay the notion
            of the pre-vocative beyond, for Pyle the operations of the minor, and for Washington the
            activity of post-Newtonian light—that eschews the compulsions of visuality for an
            encounter with in Fay a non-optical alterity and in the other three something defined by
            either its own passing, boundedness, or willingness to let go. In doing so, these latest
            readings of Shelley’s work are not so much compelled by the triumph of (human) life as
            energized by the emergence of a Shelleyan queer love defined more by the act of
            non-possession than anything else.</p>

               <p>Inviting me to be the respondent for the MLA panel on <title level="m">The Triumph
                of Life</title> (1822) that evolved into this <title level="j">RC Praxis</title>
                volume, Joel Faflak sent me an email to
                explain how he and Jacques Khalip had discussed “how certain Romantic texts require
                repeated unearthing and burial—require/compel our productively melancholic
                attachment to them. . . . We just thought it would be cool to devote a whole panel
                to one poem in order to demonstrate precisely its compulsive hold on our critical
                imaginations (a la de Man).”</p>
               <p>I quote Joel in order to identify what I found so compelling about his invitation:
                the equation between reading <title level="m">The Triumph</title> and the fact of
                <emph>compulsion</emph> itself as a main, perhaps necessary component of
                critical thought—how Romantic texts like <title level="m">The Triumph</title> “compel
                our productively melancholic attachment to them,” how they demonstrate their
                “compulsive hold on our critical imaginations.” Certainly, we become in thrall to
                    <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, just as the captive multitudes are to Life’s
                    chariot. There’s also something viral about the trope of
                compulsion, where reading and writing about compulsion compels, necessitates, our
                attention as well. Anyone coming near Shelley’s poem, along with the meta-commentary
                that accompanies it and, by extension, Romanticism, knows what I mean. Once the
                compulsion of, or about, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> takes hold, it’s hard to
                look away.</p>
               <p>Let’s make no mistake: compulsion might not simply or essentially be a bad thing. If,
                for example, agency is impossible perhaps compulsion will do. If one inhabits a
                post-revolutionary age, like Shelley’s or our own neo-liberal end of history, a
                compulsion to reenact the trauma of radical social change, to refuse to let go of
                the possibility of that event, might be the necessary first breach toward fashioning
                whatever type of art, thought, or politics one wants to carry out next. Likewise,
                the compulsion to read Romanticism, so well allegorized in de Man’s <title level="a">Shelley
                Disfigured,</title> might be of some comfort when market forces have the institution of
                Romantic studies under siege—when, contrary to my opening observations, so many of
                our academic higher ups, colleagues, and students don’t really seem compelled by
                Romanticism at all. Yet perhaps because of this nexus of compulsion, Romanticism and
                reading still seems so readily available for us to intuit; I’d like to ask if that’s
                really the only existing option open to us with regard to our encounter with
                Romanticism and its texts. And what might it mean, for a poem like <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> and its force field of meanings, if that wasn’t the case?</p>
               <p>Catherine Malabou gets at something like this when she asks whether anything can
                exist truly detached, unattached to anything else, in Hegel (612–24). But I’m
                wondering if we can even talk simply about attachments that don’t immediately
                ratchet themselves up to the affects and intensities of compulsion per se. More
                exactly, is there a way to encounter
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> without seeing its
                attachments as well as our attachments to it as purely compulsive? Amanda Jo
                Goldstein’s recent, agile Lucretian reading of Shelley’s poem, in which senescence
                and the waning of vitalist life are actually privileged over the intensely cathected
                relations of a triumphalist bio-politics, would seem to say yes. Similarly, W. J. T.
                Mitchell gives us a certain language to help think this issue through, which we can
                consider, with a sidelong glance to <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, as the
                question of <emph>history</emph>: is it possible to consider history as
                something besides either a fetish or an idol, the latter of which we must either
                submit to as idolatry or attack iconoclastically? Can we, would we, want to conceive
                of history as instead a totem—as that term means in the Ojibwa language, a relative
                or friend (175, 184)?</p>
               <p>Mitchell’s options—fetish, idol, and totem—are, of course, terms he applies to our
                relationships with images, with objects in the world (188–99). But if Shelley’s
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is about history or history’s disfigurement, that
                history is by and large composed of images and other sensory phenomena. The poem
                brims over with objects that demand or invite a reflection on the question of
                sensation, on our sensory relations with the world, whether they necessarily become
                fetishistic or idolatrous or if they’re able to manage the energies of compulsion
                and remain more modestly totemic instead. De Man for one tried to move his reading
                of <title level="m">The Triumph</title> away from the physical
                aspects of language (59–69), but the role of sensation is still very much an
                unavoidable part of anyone’s engagement, linguistically or phenomenologically, with
                this work. So, the question of compulsion with regard to <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> seems also to be in many ways about how the senses work in this
                poem, how senses might idolize or fetishize, or be idolized or fetishized in turn;
                how they might figure a compulsive relation or become the object of compulsion, and
                how <emph>as</emph> figures the physical senses seem both to define and
                wander aggressively beyond our encounter with the medium of the printed or scripted
                word, the act of reading <emph>qua</emph> reading as well. </p>
               <p>Fredric Jameson’s observation about the inherently pornographic nature of film brings
                much of what I’m trying to articulate together, where film’s pornographic character
                means the visual has “its end in rapt, mindless, fascination,” with film asking us
                to stare at the world “as though it were a naked body” (1). Yet his claim also has
                to be balanced against Rei Terada’s consideration of the meaning of optics in one of
                Keats’s own fragmentary poems, <title level="m">Hyperion</title> (1820), where looking
                seems also to embody the question of the non-phenomenal possibility of cognition
                itself (277), a query that de Man’s reading of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                answers in the negative with a linguistic violence perhaps not that distant from the
                pornographic energies unleashed in Jameson’s characterization of film. The visual
                then, might realize mindless compulsion or complicate the mind’s operation in a way
                not simply or only about sensory experience, insofar as that experience itself is
                also in some way about what cognition should, can, or <emph>can’t</emph>
                do. </p>
               <p>It’s with these questions in mind—can you approach <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                in a way separate from compulsion? And how does <title level="m">The Triumph</title>
                ask this through its multi-layered, formal and thematic sensory overload?—that I
                looked forward to seeing how the four adventurous readings in this volume might
                encounter Shelley’s poem. I wasn’t disappointed. Jacques Khalip seemed to be reading
                my mind when he references his own haunting attachment to a close-to-last line of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, “as if that look must be the last,” and,
                indeed, to the meme, sensation, or trope of <emph>the last</emph> that for
                Khalip underwrites so much of the poem. But Khalip’s attachment to the last seems in
                fact to be about <emph>detachment</emph>, a
                recognition, oftentimes erotic, as in Rousseau, of the last both as and before the
                moment of letting go. A spectral structure, the last is the impossible end point by
                which the exhaustion of <emph>frisson</emph>, the end of compulsion is
                imaged <emph>as if</emph>, even as that end is imaged as the last image,
                the last look, the last sense of sensation. I take that exquisitely subtle calculus
                to be the point of Khalip’s fabulous close reading of the “coercive logic of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s spectacular visuality,” the poet’s eyes sick
                with the sights of the Triumph and the eye cast by Rousseau’s blind figure towards
                the chariot; what might the last look be after the ontological compulsions of the
                image but the end of the fetish? I say fetish and not idol not only because of the
                story of exhausted commodity culture lurking behind Khalip’s use of Shelley’s
                references to Charles I and the Regent’s consumer excess but also since Khalip’s
                poetics seems to work at the minimal level of the small and absorbing, where the
                fetish operates. Yet, in this poem at least for Khalip (and maybe this is why
                Rousseau, the supposed talisman of fetishes, is so important) we can let the fetish
                go, as if William had in it in him to let Dorothy with her wild eyes wander away
                instead of absorbing her into his <emph>Bildungsroman</emph> of Romantic
                maturity. We let go of our compulsive energies by imagining letting go, of, indeed,
                looking away, because of the nature of the last in our look, which, paradoxically,
                allows us to dwell within a non-fetishized optics precisely through a reflexivity
                that fashions such seeing “as if” it were the last. Whether such reflexivity rises
                to the level of what we might want to call cognition—I’m eager to hear Khalip’s own
                response to that question.</p>
               <p>Recently he and I had a discussion of what the everyday might be and I wonder if this
                might be it: a history of things, the barely noticed marked desiderata on a
                manuscript, the last kiss or last look before sensory exhaustion, a bundle of low
                level sensations that are gone, or present themselves as going, before we fully
                register them, an everyday life instead of a triumph, defined by not its magnetic
                compulsions but the strange though not malignant sense of a slipping away.
                (Certainly worthy of further exploration would be how such a terrain of behavior
                might compare tonally with what William Galperin has explored in his own recent
                envisioning of the Romantic everyday, <title level="m">The History of Missed
                Opportunities</title>.) If these last objects, like Hujar’s last car, are totems,
                they are such in a way that might help us navigate what a last friendship might be. </p>
               <p>Libby Fay’s key term is not <emph>the last</emph>, but <emph>the beyond</emph>, 
                and I’d love to see how she and Khalip might negotiate how
                these different terms provide the conceptual pivots in each of their readings. I
                found Fay’s essay defiantly Shelleyan in a way that we most traditionally value, a
                courageous embrace of psychic and somatic vertigo that lays us vulnerable before a
                cosmos discovered to be beneficent, in this case a post-human universe still defined
                by its hospitality, an “otherness without distortion,” beyond the ontological and
                epistemological horizons that define perversion as a transgression of the Law. For
                Fay, Shelley’s gesture towards the post-human also vehemently rejects an
                Enlightenment empiricism that defines the triumph of life as human life, the
                catastrophe of the anthropocene. In the gaps and difficulties of the poet’s
                language, its rhymes of wonder, Fay sees
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> pressing against this
                post-human alterity, with Rousseau’s eyeless state actually resisting the
                supplementary double binds of Derridean <emph>écriture</emph>, opening up
                to a new horizon of sensation, an “absorptive beyondness” of the pre-vocal and
                musical.</p>
               <p>One might suggest that the tone of this surge towards this new sensory beyondness has
                a non-compulsive confidence to it that actually echoes the progressive empirical
                scientism that Fay sees Shelley wanting to leave behind. (Derrida’s complicated
                relation to empiricism and science in
                <title level="m">Of Grammatology</title> might also indicate Fay
                has more of a fellow traveler in that work’s composition of <emph>techné</emph>
                and <emph>écriture</emph> than she thinks.) I wonder if,
                however, these potential continuities might also simply mean that the science in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> is radically more strange, in a generative way,
                than we first suspect—an Enlightenment science already made more capacious by
                Shelley’s reading of Lucretius, as Goldstein argues, but also a science fiction of
                the post-human lurking within the rave of Enlightenment empiricism that Fay
                identifies, where the root that once was Rousseau exists singularly
                <emph>as a</emph> root, vegetal instead of animal or much less human; and
                where Fay’s wager clarifies itself by considering the extent to which the Shape all
                light is <emph>neither</emph> a figure for the human <emph>nor
                a priori</emph> a human figure, something Chris Washington’s essay takes up as
                well. Indeed, Fay adamantly associates the Shape with the rhyme of wonder, a
                non-compulsive aural alternative to the triumphalist visuality of Shelley’s poem
                that Fay, like Khalip, wants in some way to qualify, circumvent, or resist. Might
                this occupation with sound also be a way to identify and repudiate the link between
                a certain coercive optics with the anthropocene? If so, is the post-human that which
                resists the way compulsion ubiquitously informs <emph>both</emph> human
                idolatry and fetishism <emph>and</emph> animal
                instinct? Arguably, if sight is the sense of the idol and fetish in the human, sound
                is the sense most associated with the aural and tactile triggers (the whistle, the
                snapped twig, the vibratory air) of animal instinctual response. Is Fay’s Shelleyan
                “getting beyond” a musical space beyond this binary, a radical reworking of
                Shelleyan synthesia that helps us understand what we might mean, even or especially
                given the nightmare of history in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, by
                <emph>post-human</emph> freedom? </p>
               <p>Because of her deployment of the pre-vocative I wondered if Fay might turn towards
                Kristeva’s chora, but her movement toward Deleuze and Guattari seems equally apt,
                especially as Deleuze also motors Forrest Pyle’s lushly psycho-tropic evocation of
                the proto-cinematic apparatus in Shelley’s poem. But if attachment to a volatile
                immanence of sensation is Deleuzian, Pyle through Deleuze, Barthes, Benjamin, and
                Julie Andrews works to detach Shelley’s cinematic image <foreign xml:lang="fr">avant la
                lettre</foreign> from the compulsions of history written, or projected, in what Pyle
                describes as the mode of the major, an encounter with aesthetic and cultural forms
                normative in the excessive force of their attractions and bid for the profound, a
                dynamic familiar to every student of Romanticism. Pyle doesn’t quite associate the
                major with the affects of idolatry or the sensorium of an explicitly coercive
                triumphalist optics, eschewing any elaborate critique that might follow from such a
                connection. Yet it’s clear his interests lie elsewhere, even as he wittily reflects
                upon the existence of a favorite poem realized before any opportunity he might have
                had consciously to choose or name it as his favorite. For Pyle, if that work is
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>—he doesn’t disagree—the reason for that
                designation doesn’t so much have to do with the major but the occurrences of the
                “minor event” in that work, its own gift of those images in literature and art “that
                seem to arrest us without doing or promising anything more.”</p>
               <p>Resonating with the reflexive moment of Khalip’s as-if-it-were-the-last, Pyle’s minor
                event does compel us, but in so arresting a minor key, it seems to avoid the
                feverish energies of the fetish, where unlike the fetish it exudes a
                self-sufficiency absent of any lure or promise of something more. Neither a wound
                nor a fragment, the minor sidesteps the obsessive logics of wholeness and castration
                exuded by the fetish in a way that gestures toward something like Fay’s beyond, a
                realm delinked from the fear, though maybe not the joy, of perversion. Intriguingly,
                while the minor doesn’t promise anything grandiose beyond itself, Pyle nevertheless
                sees the possibility of a minor history, so different from the spectacle of the
                chariot of Life’s paraded captives. In contrast to that particular triumph, Pyle
                posits a Benjaminian constellation of minor events that coalesces still into
                something like a resource, a place of favorite things, even if the politics or
                policy of such a gathering remains furtive, just on the other side of modernity’s
                stultifying, teenage suburban boredom, so achingly extracted from Todd Haynes’ film,
                <title level="m">Velvet Goldmine</title>, in Pyle’s dreamy reading of that work
                that appears in an extended version of his essay.</p>
               <p>Through the deployment of Haynes, of Joel Faflak’s own heady reading of
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> as dizzy Hollywood musical, and of Barthes’s
                filmic still image, “the obtuse,” Pyle appears to lock the minor event solely within
                the cinematic or proto-cinematic apparatus. That doesn’t quite appear to be the
                case, however, with Pyle saying as much. Indeed, I wondered if mapping the tensions
                between minor event and major history onto those between the lyric moment and
                narrative drive in literature might give us a fresh new way to reconsider the
                traditional meanings of the latter dichotomy. More pointedly, there is also Pyle’s
                conclusion, its dwelling with the poetic minor event of several lines in Shelley’s
                poem that simultaneously allegorizes <emph>the coming-to-be</emph> of the
                minor event, “As when a veil of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they
                glimmer”—of, as Pyle describes, “the detached glimmering image of a
                <emph>veil of light drawn</emph> over evening hills.” Eminently readable
                (again and again!) in its unreadability, here for Pyle, in a veil
                of light drawn, is the stuff of what dreams are made of, and on: poetically,
                theatrically, pictorially, photographically, cinematically, if not more.<note place="foot" resp="author">Might this misquote by the film <title level="m">The Maltese Falcon</title> of
                            Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Tempest</title>, the distance between
                            the prepositions <emph>of</emph> and <emph>on</emph>, signal yet
                            another constellation of the minor event that Pyle
                            is trying to describe?</note>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps because of Pyle I couldn’t help but associate Chris Washington’s quantum
                physics sense of light in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> with the cinema, or
                more exactly, with cinema’s death as a human activity. For if, following Laurent
                Mannoni, we observe that the dream of the pre-cinema and cinema was the interplay of
                light and shadow, what occurs when that light in its post-Newtonian form, something
                Washington asserts Shelley knew of through the scientific experimentation of his
                day, implies a temporal scale that repudiates any notion of that dream’s
                intrinsically anthropocentric character? Independent of, immune to, any human
                reference, such starlight for Washington is non-specular, a “non-figural materiality
                as inter-involved aspect of any figurality.” I might put pressure on Washington’s
                “as” to indicate the unavoidable figural distance, no matter how small, between any
                physical candidate (post-Newtonian light, say) for de Man’s own non-figural
                “materiality without matter” and that latter materiality itself, a distance that one
                might say is precisely, and paradoxically, the effect of de Man’s materiality
                (Derrida 350). But that doesn’t lessen the power of what Washington sees in the
                implications of a post-Newtonian light in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, one
                whose character asserts not our immortality but our non-permanence, while yet also
                enabling new possibilities of entanglement among various subjects and objects in the
                universe, new opportunities for what Karen Barad calls “intra-action,” something
                according to Washington defined by its very resistance to the “transcendental
                temporalities” of an inescapably monumentalized form of human politics,
                revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Light in Shelley’s poem is thus not for
                Washington about its triumph, not about the coercive form of optics that Khalip,
                Fay, and Pyle in their different ways also see
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> resisting. Indeed, while his
                speculative realism perhaps most noticeably matches up with Fay’s reading of a
                post-human sonic “beyond” in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, Washington finds
                the promise of the non-human already displayed in the operation of light in
                Shelley’s work.</p>
               <p>To return to my earlier language, we might say post-Newtonian light is neither
                idolatrous nor fetishistic, insofar as its non-specularity is the cold beautiful
                evidence of the limits of any referential attachment we might slavishly make to our
                sensory (and thus also our non-phenomenal) experience. Such attachments are
                ultimately to our selves as human immortal beings, a hope, desire, or compulsion
                that the physics of light in Washington’s <title level="m">Triumph</title> explicitly
                eschews. We are abandoned by non-Newtonian light and in that fact we find the
                alternate affective possibility of Shelleyan love, one that in its awareness of its
                provisional character signals a horizon of “intra-action,” of non-compulsive,
                impermanent attachments to history and the world, something arguably Mitchell’s
                totemic sensibility as well as Khalip’s “last,” Fay’s “beyond,” and Pyle’s “minor
                event” also endeavor to articulate.<note place="foot" resp="author">In Goldstein’s
                    Lucretian reading of the love for and in old age in <title level="m">The
                    Triumph</title>, we can see a similar movement (136–65).</note> Let me conclude then with a
                thought experiment that tries to build upon these suggested convergences.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of this response I qualified its inquiries by noting how compulsion
                shouldn’t necessarily be considered a thing to avoid, especially when as
                professional Romanticists we’re all at the moment suffering from an institutional
                aphanisis, the deadening of desire for Romanticism, the way the study and teaching
                of its texts doesn’t seem to compel attention in the academic marketplace even as we
                embark on a series of two-hundred year commemorative events for those works and the
                authors behind them. Without pretending to know completely how to proceed in this
                brave new world, I will venture the following, using Washington’s categories, by
                which his and the other pieces in this volume gesture toward a series of
                (non-)attachments and sensory encounters in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> that
                model a different language than the compulsive by which we can begin to conceive of
                our relation not only to Shelley’s poem but to Romanticism and literature as well. I
                write this all the while acknowledging my own compulsive attachment to history and
                its nightmarish disfigurements, the possibility of politics and the effects of
                antagonism in and beyond the anthropocene.</p>
               <p>Still, if perhaps the goal is to maintain as Žižek might say, a “parallax view” that
                simultaneously shuttles between the compulsive and non-compulsive (4–13), let me
                suggest another way to consider why we return again and again to
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>. We do so, following Washington, out of a Shelleyan love based
                on something like the sensation of the impermanence of our selves and our readings,
                our cognition and our somatic experience, a love empowered, not disabled by this
                predicament, which is also one of reading not as cultural monumentalization but as
                the physics of intra-action, the momentary coming together or community—the
                constellation?—that constitutes each reading as well as the relations among every
                encounter with Shelley’s text and manuscript, with his words and words about his
                drowned body and buried heart. Furthermore: through Khalip’s description of the
                “queerly erotic openness” to the last look, Fay’s imaging of a beyondness defined by
                its detachment from any normative policing of perversion, Pyle’s exuberant
                constellating of Shelley and Haynes’s glam rock, and Washington’s physics of
                starlight delinked from any immortal, pro-creative human story, we might say that
                this love is in some basic way queer. We might then ask: if this is the case for our
                love of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, how might that redound and refract upon
                all our reading habits and motivations in relation to Romanticism, beyond but also,
                importantly, within the universities, colleges, and schools that many of us
                teach?</p>

               <p rend="noCount">This essay challenges Paul de Man’s famous reading of figurality in Percy Shelley’s
                    <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> to show how the poem
                    thinks love as a figural-material quantum entanglement between two people that
                    models a new materialist politics. I argue that for Shelley the “shape all light”
                    and its interaction with the rainbow evince one instance of this figural-material
                    phenomenon. This interaction I read as a form of what Karen Barad calls “quantum
                    entanglement,” when the subject and object—as in physics’ double-slit quantum light
                    experiment—emerges as a new entity that brings a novel spacetime into being. As
                    Shelley theorizes it in the poem, this merger of subject and object, or lover and
                    lover, allows him to finally conceive a love that serves as a cornerstone for a
                    radical politics. While we tend to see the poem as breaking off into irresolution,
                    Shelley’s poem, on my reading, instead envisions how two-person spacetimes are a
                    triumph of love over the nihilistic autocratic politics of anarchy that the poem
                    depicts running wild in the pageantry of life.</p>

                water, and the stars as the tropology around which the poem groups its
                deconstructive figurality. De Man specifically reads the nebulous “shape all light”

                            <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title>, edited
                            by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, 2nd ed, Norton, 2002, pp. 481–502. All
                            references to Shelley’s poetry and prose, unless otherwise noted, are to
                            this edition, cited by line, act, and/or page number.</note>as “the
                figure for the figurality of all signification” (116), the textual crux that
                connects the sun’s light, obscured stars, and water’s well previous to the light’s
                transmogrification into a rainbow:
                <quote>
            “Shape all light” is referentially meaningless since light, the necessary condition
                of shape, is itself, like water, without shape, and acquires shape only when split
                in the illusion of a doubleness which is not that of self and other. The sun, in
                this text, is from the start the figure of this self-contained specularity. But the
                double of the sun can only be the eye conceived as the mirror of light. “Shape” and
                “mirror” are inseparable in this scene, just as the sun is inseparable from the
                shapes it generates and which are, in fact, the eye, and just as the sun is
                inseparable from itself since it produces the illusion of the self as shape . . .
                Because the sun is itself a specular structure, the eye can be said to generate a
                world of natural forms. The otherness of a world that is in fact without order now
                become, for the eye, a maze made accessible to solar paths, as the eye turns from
                the blank radiance of the sun to its green and blue reflection in the world, and
                allows us to be in this world as in a landscape of roads and intents. (109–10)
                </quote>
            Yet, surely this account depends on a classic presupposition of high romanticism
                partially engendered by de Man himself: the eye as necessary for figurality itself,
                a doubly odd claim since the eye, evidence of human existence, introduces the
                ontological (“allows us to be”) into de Man’s otherwise properly figural conceptual
                space, and the anthropocentric into his rhetorical theory of language’s mad,
                machine-like nature. For it is precisely its linguistic, or what he calls
                rhetorical—rather than historical, or physical, or ontological—nature that, for de
                Man, makes figurality figurative. Whether unconsciously or unwittingly—and here we
                must think of de Man’s own idea of critical blindness—de Man’s deconstruction would
                appear to deconstruct itself. But perhaps this is only all too appropriate since
                auto-deconstruction, according to de Man’s reading of Shelley’s poem, and his
                readings elsewhere of Rousseau, is how deconstruction works.<note place="foot" resp="author">See de Man, <title level="m">Blindness and Insight</title> and
                            <title level="m">Allegories of Reading</title>. See
                            also Derrida’s comment that we must consider de Man’s texts as open to
                            his own procedure (<title level="a">Typewriter</title>).</note>
               </p>
               <p> In fact, this auto-deconstruction reveals the speculative realist flipside of de
                Man’s reading of light that we have yet to confront in Shelley’s poem: non-figural,
                material reality as inter-involved aspect of any figurality.<note place="foot" resp="author">On how de Man’s work aligns with
                            speculative realism, see Washington. Much has been written about de
                            Man’s notion of the materiality of the letter as a materiality resistant
                            to aesthetic totality. See Derrida, <title level="a">Typewriter</title> 350. My reading
                            suggests that there is a materiality with matter in de Man.</note> Speculative
                realism posits that a world of material objects
                exists independent of the subject and any epistemological access and phenomenal
                relationship the subject might have with those objects and that world. And while we
                typically view de Manian deconstruction as exclusively embrangled in linguistic and
                epistemological problems properly belonging to the subject, the figurative-material
                deconstructive paradox detected above allows us to consider how the linguistic
                subject of deconstruction and the material objects of speculative realism are much
                more inter-connected in Shelley’s final poem than we think. </p>
               <p>Shelley’s notes to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title> (1813)
                address this paradox: light is not simply reflectively specular as de Man presents
                it; it is also a material, and, as we’ll see, a quantum, speculative,
                phenomenon.<note place="foot" resp="author">Paul Hamilton notes that Shelley
                            was always interested in both the epistemological and the speculative.
                            One of Shelley’s early essays is titled <title level="a">Speculations
                            on Metaphysics.</title>
                  </note> Shelley, having read Isaac
                Newton’s <title level="m">Principia</title> (1726) (which he quotes in his notes), and possibly his
                <title level="m">Optics</title> (1704), writes that, “the equal
                diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction of the rays by the
                atmosphere and their reflection from other bodies. Light consists either of
                vibrations propagated through a subtle medium or of numerous minute particles
                repelled in all directions from the luminous body” (<title level="a">Notes</title> 239). This last sentence
                demonstrates Shelley’s awareness of the corpuscularian debates concerning the nature
                of light, in which Thomas Young’s 1801 double-slit thought experiment complicated
                Newton’s theory of light as particles by positing that light, depending on the
                conditions of the experiment, acts as a wave.<note place="foot" resp="author"> See
                    Newton’s <title level="m">Optics</title> (3: 400) and Young (16, 45).</note> Shelley’s
                careful phrasing, though, investing in neither scientific account, demonstrates a
                mind determined to speculate on the hither side of known reality, and in
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, his cerebrations on starlight moves past
                Newton and Young into what we now call quantum physics and speculative realism. By
                yoking together the scientific, the poetic, and the political <title level="m">The
                    Triumph of Life</title>, I argue, produces a radical politics based on love, one
                that founds communities rather than the state-of-nature chaos and anarchy of two key
                interlocutors, Hobbes and Rousseau. Love, folding “its healing wings” over the world
                at the end of <title level="m">Prometheus Unbound</title> (1820), in a defiant gesture
                against tyranny, it is suggested, nonetheless tumbles back into “woes . . . Hope
                thinks infinite,” whereas <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> sees love escape
                such transcendental temporalities altogether (4.570). The love Shelley theorizes
                through the poetics of star- and day-light in
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> is, I will argue,
                something similar to quantum feminist Karen Barad’s conceptualization of
                “intra-action,” which allows Shelley to imagine wholly new worlds that this politics
                of love both brings into being and is brought into being by. </p>
               <p>As we know from the spookily Shellyean <title level="m">X-Files</title>, starlight
                travels billions of years to reach the earth.<note place="foot" resp="author">I am referencing the
                episode titled "Closure."</note> Shelley, too, is familiar with
                starlight’s easy-does-it temporal travel schedule: “some idea may be gained of the
                immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse
                before light could reach this earth from the nearest of them; yet in one year light
                travels 5,422,400,000,000 miles, which is at a distance 5,707,600 times greater than
                that of the sun from the earth” (<title level="a">Notes</title> 239). Readings
                of <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> from de Man’s to more recent quantum readings of light in
                the poem all reference light in its earthly, and so bounded-down, anthropocentric
                aspect.<note place="foot" resp="author">Mark Lussier provides
                            a thorough overview of Shelley’s use of quantum theory. Plotnitsky reads
                            <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> specifically as a
                            showcase for Shelley’s theorizing of what Niels Bohr calls
                            “complementarity.” For Plotnitsky, complementarity resembles Derridean
                            <emph>différance</emph>, the way in which the trace
                            structure defers and differentiates linguistic meaning spatiotemporally
                            (264). However, mapping Bohr’s quantum mechanics onto Derridean
                            deconstruction is not only a maneuver that oversimplifies quantum
                            complementarity, it also commits a phallogocentric gesture Derrida would
                            surely not endorse. It erases feminist science studies and eco-feminism
                            from a discourse it has actually been at the forefront of for decades.</note> But
                understanding light as discretely deconstructive or
                materialistic undermines the linguistic-material—and speculative—paradoxical nature
                of it Shelley develops and deploys in his poem. Indeed, given starlight’s distance
                from the earth and the human eye, the “I” of both poem and self, need be, and
                perhaps simply is, of no consequence for what de Man calls, referencing classical
                antiquity’s theogony, these fallen gods, the stars (<title level="a">Shelley</title>
                117). Stars, it turns out, are like Transformers, more than meets the eye.
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> thus evokes what contemporary speculative
                realist philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux, calls the “arche-fossil,” nonhuman
                material or phenomena that evidences life anterior and ulterior to human life
                because the lifespans of this material phenomena exceeds that of the human species’
                    lifespan.<note place="foot" resp="author">Meillassoux
                            sometimes uses the term “ancestrality.”</note> As the poem’s
                speaker says, “the moon . . . obscured with [ ] light / the Sun as he the stars”
                    (77–79).<note place="foot" resp="author"> Wasserman notes the
                            importance of stars for Shelley: “stars, however, carried a special
                            symbolic significance for Shelley that he exploited in a number of
                            poems. To him they are ‘immortal stars,’ ‘eternal,’ ‘deathless,’
                            ‘sacred’; they are ‘pure’ and dwell in ‘Eternal bowers’” (161).
                            According to Wasserman “he also glimpsed intimations of the eternity of
                            transcendent Being in the fact that the stars are always present,
                            obscured in day from earthly vision only by the diffusion of sunlight in
                            the earth’s atmosphere. The likening of the flower-world to the
                            star-heaven suggests, then, not merely the mutable oscillation of
                            starriness between world and sky but also, paradoxically, the immutable
                            eternity of that starrinesss and therefore the possible eternity of both
                            Existence, which is equitable with the One Mind, and the totally
                            comprehensive and ultimate Being” (161). Wasserman’s valuable insight
                            into Shelley’s symbology deviates from my reading of stars in that
                            Wasserman, by returning them to a revelation of transcendence, and
                            ultimately an equality with the One Mind and hence the human, construes
                            the stars as evidence of a possible future paradise in the
                            anthropocentric mode.</note> Starlight, night after night,
                illustrates the possibility of a world without us even while the next day’s dawning
                suggests the universe’s apathy to humanity’s endurance since the sunlight obscures
                by its diffuse rays the always-present stars whose very eternality recollects us to
                human mortality. Starlight’s apparent spatial absence-as-presence during the day,
                and its illusory temporal here-ness, suggest an ulteriority beyond the
                anthropocentric. As I read it, <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> thus
                glimpses the possibility of a post-apocalyptic world existing after we are gone, one
                glimmering alone, dark, and beautifully desolate in the phosphorescent darkness of
                starlight. </p>
               <p> Yet precisely because of its untimely indifference to humanity’s claim to
                everlastingness, starlight’s evocation of the way in which the world is always
                already without us, deflates our transcendental beliefs in the human species’s
                necessity for earthly survival. If starlight is a temporal, flashing on-and-off
                indicator of a world always already without us, then it is also a cosmic cautionary
                tale counterintuitively imploring us to find ways to be-with the other in the time
                we have left. Confronting finitude, the poem’s speaker and his guide, Rousseau,
                struggle to understand their stupefied bearing witness to life’s unfolding of the
                mad chaos of individuals bereft of human connection. As we shall see, on this world
                without us, <emph>love, literally, creates this being-with us</emph>, and
                in the process literally creates new worlds, what Barad’s quantum theory calls new
                “spacetimes.” More specifically, I suggest that Shelley’s last poem resolutely
                abandons the skepticism, the idealism, and the transcendentalism variously
                associated with his poetry and politics.<note place="foot" resp="author"> Ulmer
                    offers a version of Shelley as lusting for
                            transcendence: “The pressure contradiction exerts on Shelley’s
                            radicalism ends by diverting love from world mediations to transcendent
                            absolutes. The apocalyptic drive of Shelley’s late poetry reflects the
                            continuity of his idealism and politics as antitypical facets of a
                            single desire” (24). John Wright has a similar view of love and
                            transcendence in Shelley. Wright takes “metaphoric apprehension . . . to
                            be the fundamental power of the human mind and a mental counterpart of
                            the primal capacity for self-transcendence he found in love” (22). For
                            more on love in Shelley see Stovall, Warren, and Baker.</note> Shelley
                scholarship has sometimes had a tendency to read him within a traditional
                view of Romanticism as apocalyptic, a drive toward a mythic paradise, sometimes
                manifesting on earth, sometimes beyond it, in an Elysian after-life.<note place="foot" resp="author">For excellent readings of the
                            apocalyptic in Shelley see Woodman, Abbey, and Wasserman. For the vexed

                same time, many scholars view his later poetry as diverging from his earlier verse;
                as Jerome McGann noted long ago, “a new and significant impulse was moving his
                poetry” in this last year of his life (41). But, as I have argued elsewhere,
                Shelley’s work has never been invested in these apocalyptic fictional fantasies of
                    Paradise.<note place="foot" resp="author">I

                  </note> With the stars
                as his guiding light, Shelley turns his attention one last time to what has always
                preoccupied him, post-apocalyptic reality, what happens when the last humans remain
                (perhaps briefly) on
                earth.</p>
               <p>To engage this post-apocalyptic reality, Shelley imagines a new affective solidarity
                whose necessity of love is terrestrial, not transcendent. This affinity is more than
                the self’s search for its own likeness in a copy of itself, as Shelley puts it in
                <title level="a">On Love</title> (circa 1818) (itself a text shot through with the vocabulary of
                “particles” and “vibrations”), a narcissism that merely replays the egocentric
                self-love of Shelley’s Rousseauvian nightmare parade in this, his last long poem.
                Instead, the poem theorizes how love works when life, verging on termination,
                becomes a more-urgent-than-normal process of perpetual self-inquisition with no
                answers, exemplified by the poem’s final broken-off question, “Then, what is life?”
                (544), as well as in Rousseau’s haunted, disconsolate pleas to the “shape all
                light”: “tell me whence I came, and where, and why” (398).<note place="foot" resp="author">My
                    reading places me alongside

                            Shelley’s desire for death through an increasingly highly wrought
                            apotheosizing of love: “we must . . . read Shelley’s politics as an
                            aspect of his rhetoric of Romantic love” even as Shelley’s love poetics
                            lead to an acceptance of “death as the telos of desire and gravitates[s]
                            increasingly toward a visionary despair” (18).</note> Shelley’s
                poem offers no answers to these desperate implorations because, as the
                poem dramatizes in its staged pageantry of life’s decline and fall into a masquerade
                of simulacra, to know life definitively would be to circumscribe life within a field
                of closed possibility, a life, perversely, of no possible continuance, one without
                the unpredictability of an unknown future for if the future were known life would be
                over.<note place="foot" resp="author">For
                            a similar though different reading of life in the poem, see Faflak,
                            54.</note> This is what Derrida means, in his reading of the
                poem, by “living on”: life continues only because the future is always here and
                never here, just like the stars, which have technically not arrived even though we
                can “see” them (which we really cannot) (<title level="a">Living</title> 62). Hence, the poem finds its
                resolution in the irresolution of its necessary non-answer to its final question,
                instead asking “what is love?,” a triumph then of love rather than life. And so
                Shelley’s phantasmatic costume ball—Hazlitt referred to the poem as “a new and
                terrific The Dance of Death” (494)—theorizes love, not as Derrida does, as a love of ruins because everything
                falls to ruin, but beyond ruin; and not as de Man’s figure for disfiguration, but as
                an intra-active figural-materiality that is beyond transfiguration when it manifests
                as true love.<note place="foot" resp="author">For Derrida’s thinking that connects

                    Blind</title>.</note> In its roving disquisition on the quantum nature of
                light, the poem issues a last call to learn to love freely and fully, to feel, for
                someone, since this is all the survival we can ultimately have in the time of the
                present’s apathetic disaster, this time of fallen stars. </p>

                  <p>Shelley’s poem associates light and its shifting configurations with political
                factions, the sun serving as anarchy’s herald and the stars’ as love’s harbinger.
                Although for de Man, “it is unimaginable that Shelley’s non-epic, non-religious poem
                would begin by elegiacally or rebelliously evoking the tragic defeat of the former
                gods, the stars, at the hands of the sun” (<title level="a">Shelley</title> 117), what he terms “the
                unimaginable” is, rather, easily imagined, for the poem’s opening stages this battle
                precisely by <emph>not</emph> ascribing mythological
                god-like significance to the stars. In Shelley’s hands, they become significant
                framing devices of the poem’s political allegorization, linking patriarchal politics
                to the poetics of sunrise:

            The immediate opposition of the sun and the stars reverses the teleology of disaster,
                which derives from the Latin “astar”—which means disaster is literally a fallen
                star—by equating it to sunlight instead, the wellspring of earthly life, the
                figural-material alternative to sunlight’s figural masculinist power. Unlike the
                later feminized “shape all light,” the sun’s light is associated with the law of the
                father, which thus links it to the parade of “Anarchs old” (285) who signify
                destructive authoritarianism and tyrannical despotism. Dissociated from the sun, the
                speaker’s reflective thoughts, “which must remain untold,” stem specifically from
                “the stars that gem.” Only as the sun tears away the night’s mask does the speaker
                awaken from his sleepless reverie in the nighttime to the fantastic visions, and ill
                slumber, of the light of the day. Sunlight thus suggests veil-rending violence and
                the observationally specular, even as the stars are avatars of a gentle tranquility,
                a paradoxical sleep so peaceful it requires not the unconsciousness of sleep but
                hazy wakefulness. This wakefulness is different still from the wakeful sleep of day
                that brings with it Rousseau’s phantasmagoria of moral, cultural, and physical
                abominations bombinating in their own Bacchanal, thanatopolitical excess.
                Nighttime’s wakefulness, in contrast, like the stars, is not specular but
                speculatively realist, the imagining of some world we cannot envision or comprehend
                since it seems to exist beyond us, a signal fire guiding us through the dark to the
                shape all light. </p>
                  <p> Whereas for de Man the sun usurps natural, chronological progression—and thus
                renders historical progress always a matter of absolute contingency through its
                disfiguration—the sun’s sudden appearance manifests a different, decisively material
                event. As the editors of the Norton Shelley remind us, the line “the stars . . . gem
                the cone of night” refers to an actual, rather than figural, shadow that the earth
                casts as a result of its orbitational locality in relation to the sun. The poem
                fixes the earth’s physical coordinates, evoking Newton’s own “System of the World,”
                even as its opening passage works by prosopopoeia, personification, and apostrophe,
                which figure what de Man calls “the master trope of poetry” (<title level="a">Hypogram</title> 48). Sun,
                stars, sky, earth, light and shadows, are all both figural and material.</p>
                  <p> Later in the poem, this twinning of figurality and materiality becomes more confused
                and confusing by aligning the sun with the political faction of anarchism, linked to

            The passage twists post-apocalyptically, the sun of the law of the father with which
                the poem opens obscuring and rebuffing the true sun of reality. Caesar and
                Constantine, Gregory and John, rise like a false eclipse between the world and the
                Sun even as the Sun, by its very nature, is part of this eclipse. Enacting the end
                of the world, the sun blots out not just the stars, but itself, the sun, the true
                son, light of all light, signaling that the world will literally end as a direct
                result of the sun’s parenting of a political anarchism with heliocentric destruction
                on its anthropocentric mind. Rousseau’s visions, like the poem itself, therefore
                figure state-of-nature tales told by Hobbesian warmongers that culminate with
                humanity’s extinction. Confronted with the spectacle of all these pale-horse
                death-dealers, it is perhaps no wonder that, as Hugh Roberts remarks, “in the
                pageant of life it is love, above all, that the narrator and Rousseau as abstract
                spectators seem least able to comprehend” (403). </p>
                  <p> To check the ontological cosmic disaster of the sun’s quenching extinction at its
                own patriarchal hands, Shelley, counterintuitively, reclaims the stars not as
                post-apocalyptic predictors of imminent disaster, as gestured to in his notes
                to <title level="m">Queen Mab</title>, but instead as love’s material register:

            With the speculative possibility of extinction, and the impending possibility of the
                world’s doom, love emerges as a non-transfigurable element in a political and
                materialist table of potential calamities. The stars, via Aster, and the flowers of
                heaven, imagine love in a post-apocalyptic reality we must grapple with in response
                to these apocalyptic dreams that delude us with hopes of a perfected world. This
                love shows and accepts that these fallen and falling stars of both disaster and
                humankind are neither here nor there but still falling, unlocatable in space or
                time. Hence, the stars, as they appear here, stand as more than a figure for love:
                for love is a figure beyond figuration, and so not
                <emph>just</emph> figural, but something real, both
                figural and material, what Karen Barad calls an “intra-active” phenomenon. </p>
                  <p>Kate Singer’s recent turn to feminist quantum theory and its investment in nonhuman
                materiality provides an example of how we can move beyond a singular focus on
                figurality (<title level="a">Limpid Waves</title>). Barad’s theory
                allows us to understand how in the shape all light subject and object are
                mutually constitutive of “quantum entanglement.”<note place="foot" resp="author">For
                            Goldstein, Shelley’s Lucretian materialism can bridge the gaps between
                            the poem’s various materialisms: “to the extent that three technical,
                            hard-to-reconcile senses of ‘matter’ compete in contemporary materialist
                            criticism—the deconstructive materiality of the letter, the Marxian
                            matter of history, and, more recently, the ‘vibrant’ and polymorphous
                            material that ‘new’ materialists retrieve from the history of philosophy
                            and modern science studies—<foreign xml:lang="la">De rerum natura</foreign> still
                            has something to offer” (64). I skew toward what we call “new
                            materialism,” although Barad’s work, I hope to show, exceeds all of
                            these formulations to suggest something much more radical about how the
                            real and non-real, the discursive and material, are mutually
                            constitutive.</note> Crucially, within entanglement relata do
                not precede relations; rather each new intra-action manifests a new relation between
                the discursive and the material, the subject and object. Barad’s development of this
                idea calls into question the up-to-now predominant linguistic turn that understands
                both the subject and object to be discursive constructs. </p>
                  <p>Barad borrows Donna Haraway’s use of the term “diffraction” as a helpful way to
                understand quantum entanglement. She glosses Haraway as follows: “diffraction can
                serve as a useful counterpoint to reflection: both are optical phenomena, but
                whereas the metaphor of reflection reflects the themes of mirroring and sameness,
                diffraction is marked by patterns of difference” (71). Barad emphasizes how
                diffraction expands the circle of difference away from reflective homologies of self
                and love that we can see Shelley, for instance, presenting in <title level="a">On
                    Love.</title> The point,
                for Barad, is to increase difference rather than curtail it, as reflection does.
                Extending Haraway’s usage, Barad’s diffraction becomes a metaphor for understanding
                both ontological difference as well as physical phenomena. Barad’s reading of
                diffraction in Niels Bohrs’ famous restaging of Young’s two-slit experiment,
                evidences this quantum paradox: a particle of light, when shined through a
                diffraction pattern grating, presents as either a wave or a particle. According to
                Newtonian physics, such a result is impossible, since “only waves produce
                diffraction patterns; particles do not (since they cannot occupy the same place at
                the same time)” (81). As Barad argues, this diffracted phenomena illustrates quantum
                entanglement since the production of matter as diffractal waves and particles
                <emph>depends</emph> on the entanglement of the subject, the apparatus
                (the diffracting grate), and matter itself. That is, only this particular
                intersection of subject (experimenter) and object (matter) produces particle-wave
                duality. For Barad this phenomenon means “that entanglements are highly specific
                configurations . . . [that] . . . change with each intra-action. In fact is it not
                so much that they change from one moment to the next or from one place to another,
                but that <emph>space, time, and matter do not exist</emph> prior to the
                intra-actions that reconstitute entanglements” (74; emphasis added). The
                consequences of Barad’s development of quantum entanglement are therefore
                astonishing since they challenge, and even dismiss, contemporary humanistic and
                scientific accounts of how space, time, and, matter, and hence subjects and objects,
                exist in reality. By manifesting a new spacetime in each entanglement,
                <emph>different</emph> spaces and times, quantum
                entanglement alters the very ways in which we understand ontology for humans: the
                world only exists in a non-fixed—indeed non-existent—space and time repeatedly
                created by the production of new spacetime worlds that are, in turn, created
                simultaneously by newly created subjects and objects. And since entanglement
                instantiates space and time new worlds are made with each entanglement even if these
                are not, properly speaking, between subject and object or subject and subject since
                all of these terms are now constantly being brought into existence with each
                iterative entanglement.</p>
                  <p>In Barad’s theory, it is only posterior to entanglement—and hence their
                existence—that manufactured (what she calls) “cuts” occur between intra-active
                agential subjects and materialities to produce discrete, identifiable “subjects” and
                “objects.” “Cuts” are thus social constructions that proceed from, rather than
                precede, the ontological origins of subjects and objects, just like the masks that
                “fell from the countenance / And form of all” at poem’s end, exemplify how wearing a
                person suit can falsely fashion oneself as an un-entangled “subject” (536–37). By
                de-masking the simulacra we don in the world, quantum entanglement undoes notions of
                the subject and object as independent agencies. Instead, the material world, which
                on speculative accounts exists apart for us is, actually, always already with us
                until we enact the artificial cuts that cleave a given entanglement. Similarly, the
                shape all light, linguistically personifying a quantum materiality, radically
                confounds our ability to conceive of subjects and objects as originarily
                distinguishable, a con-fused phenomenon that explicates the narrator’s, and
                Rousseau’s, own confused reaction to the shape. In proffering Rousseau nepenthe, the
                shape all light obliterates his mind as sand, which indicates the dissolution of the
                subject as model of and for human discursive epistemology and ontological
                prioritization as distinct from nonhuman materiality. Whereas Rousseau viewed
                himself through the aperture of his subjectivity, rather like being cut out with a
                cookie cutter, the shape all light illuminates the post-cuts that take place after
                entanglement. </p>
                  <p>The shape all light, an exemplar of discursive-material quantum entanglement, renders
                visible a post-social-contract politics that usurps the normative sociopolitical
                order of “the Anarchs.” In <title level="a">The Mask of Anarchy</title> (1832) for Shelley, such figures
                reveal paradise as an apocalyptic sleight-of-hand that conceals Hobbesian pale
                riders trampling on all life:

            In <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, however, love, and not death, nurtures hope

                    time in a newly created space and time</emph> that is the process of their

                    politics.<note place="foot" resp="author">But this antidote is not the

                that entangles humans in material love, refiguring, rather than disfiguring (as for
                de Man), and iterating, ever new entanglements. </p>
                  <p>Moving us away from anthropocentric epistemology to posthuman ontology, then, the
                discursive-material figure of the shape all light, differentiating itself from the
                sun, returns us to the quantum and its creation of spacetime, when it becomes a
                rainbow touching, melding with, the forest floor. Rainbows appear in the sky—for a
                rainbow is not, of course, any more than the stars, actually in the sky—when water
                droplets reflect, refract, and disperse in the air. As Barad explains, reflection is
                not merely specular but also occurs by diffraction, which is what happens when one
                type of light “bends” upon encountering another medium thus increasing or decreasing
                its wavelength. Shelley limns quantum reality in the rainbow’s ghostly radiance:

            Mark Lussier and Arkady Plotnitsky have both noted the quantum language rolling
                through the placidly pillowing water in this passage. But Barad’s
                reconceptualization of quantum matter as entangling the subject and object in a
                space and time of their own making in an act of creative simultaneity, reveals a
                much bolder, and as we’ll see, politically radical Shelley than either Lussier’s or
                Plotnitsky’s classical quantum accounts allow for. The steady, exact rhyme scheme
                (“willow,” “billow,” and “pillow”) maintains the rainbow’s illusory essence, an
                assonance that reflects the reflection of the water and hoodwinks us into reading
                the passage as an instance of classical quantum mechanics—the water rolls on
                naturally just like the end sounds in space and time understood as locational end
                points. But the poem acknowledges the quantum diffraction of the water when the
                personified shape all light “bend[s] her / Head under the dark boughs, till like a
                willow / Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream” (363–65). The shape reverse
                personifies the stream even as the shape all light itself becomes this stream in the
                emergence from the water of the light’s skyward-arcing rainbow that occurs because
                of both its <emph>reflection and diffraction</emph> in that water (since a
                rainbow can only occur by diffraction). Both material and figurative, the shape all
                light becomes now something else altogether again as it is entangled with the water
                in a flowing measure of eddying hair and chromatic illusion. The rainbow thus
                recalls us to the other side of the specular coin: the human observer who can see
                what does not exist, a unique form of, to repurpose de Man’s universally explanatory
                phrase of deconstructive rhetoricity, “blindness and insight.” For Shelley knows
                that rainbows are both material phenomena and optical illusions that both do and do
                not exist as tactile material in spatial reality: you both can and cannot touch and
                see a rainbow. Shelley’s rainbow is a diffraction, then, that makes a difference for
                in this passage Shelley reminds us that the figural and the material, the subject
                and object, can only be cleaved after their moment of entangled becoming.</p>
                  <p>For despite the rainbow’s illusory nature it does
                <emph>exist</emph> even it if cannot be touched by
                the speaker or seen for what it really is, a chromatic spectrum of moisture and dust
                fronting the sky. As such, it exemplifies the poem’s speculative ontological paradox
                since optical illusions require a perceiving subject, whose senses can be deceived
                by discrete objects (as Rousseau recounts to the speaker, while witnessing this
                scene, he was baffled and unable to comprehend not only its meaning but even what
                was actually occurring). So, on one hand, the human subject aestheticizes a
                material, ontological phenomenon, epistemologically constructing it as one thing
                understandable to the human mind, when it actually is something more diffractedly
                unknowable. On the other hand, the rainbow’s very material nature, its optical
                illusoriness, demonstrates how irrevocably blurred and smeared together the subject
                and object are. Just as we re-ontologize the rainbow as something it is not, so does
                the rainbow’s illusoriness re-ontologize humans by pointing out that humans are
                capable of being fooled by a world we think we command. In this sense, like the
                speaker and Rousseau, we are anthropocentric Anarchs and must be taught, by the
                poem’s quantum theory of love, to kick away the ladder of this anarchism we have
                climbed up. This is another of example of why, as Julie Carlson remarks, “a major
                impediment to adopting a Shelleyan practice of love is the difficulty of seeing what
                he is talking about” (76). The rainbow, we might say, is a weird type of material
                personification: by converting it from dust particles to this thing we call a
                rainbow, we make what cannot be seen seeable: we remake it in human terms as
                something that can be seen on human terms. In making the rainbow seeable, and making
                ourselves see it, the rainbow, a material smattering of particles, comes into
                discursive being literally in a space and time in which it actually ontologically
                exists but that also does not exist until it is entangled with the human. In turn,
                humans’ own subjectivity undergoes a radicalized becoming as the material reality of
                this optical illusion turns human eyes inside out to see what they cannot see.
                Reality literally gets made as real precisely because of, paradoxically, both its
                realness and non-realness—which are both made by the other at the same time. This is
                the lesson of the rainbow shape all light which makes “all that was [seem] as if it
                had been not” (385). Beliefs in human deterministic and constructivist powers fall
                away somewhere over the rainbow, a place and time that, with no fixed locative or
                temporal junction without this human and nonhuman entanglement, serves as a reminder
                that we have far surpassed Newtonian mechanical accounts of the world and even
                contemporary quantum accounts of the world. The rainbow and the human subject
                intra-act, demonstrating, together, how subjects and objects are entangled in the
                creation of their own world. </p>

                  <p>Then the poem materializes a new entanglement. The weird intra-active subject-object
                agency of the rainbow becomes a type of post-apocalyptic spatio-temporality when

                radiation and optical illusion but also starlight. Like starlight, the rainbow shape
                will turn us back to love:

            Although metaphorically like “heaven’s living eyes,” the stars that “reillumine” the
                darkness, the shape all light is also like the day, only here she functions as the
                true day, the feminine sun of no father, sun and not a son. She represents, then, a
                revolutionary, feminized, quantum truth, the light of the stars and true day that
                can politically rebel against the false sons of false suns. This revolution gets
                televised when the shape all light, now revealed as a late-arriving star, in an
                extraordinary gesture of post-apocalyptic power, tramples out human thought in order
                to remind it of its own mortal brevity in the face of the billions-of-years lifespan
                of the universe. And the shape joins “Lucifer,” the masculine light bringer, what de
                Man questionably reads as “metaphor,” to the rainbow’s feminine quantum materialism.
                This intra-active relational conflux, a marriage of starlight’s optics with the
                rainbow’s illusory effect, diffracts humans’ self-regard as rulers of the earth, the
                impolite fiction of an impolitic politics that renders us all anthropocentric
                anarchs. Like the rainbow, the stars always exist, but only always exist as we “see”
                them once we do not see them. </p>
                  <p>The shape all light opposes the light of the patriarchal sons of anarchy, guiding us,
                as love guides Dante out of fire and flame into paradise, towards the new forms of
                being love’s post-apocalyptic politics guarantees. After Rousseau drinks the
                nepenthe, he experiences, as he says, “a new Vision never seen before” in which the
                shape all light “waned in the coming light / as veil by veil the silent splendour
                drops / from Lucifer, amid the chrysolite / of sunrise” (411–20). The Morningstar,
                Lucifer, evanesces the shape all light, even as the doubling “of that fairest
                planet,” Venus, doubles Lucifer as the Eveningstar, twinning the morning to the
                night, to “that star’s smile” (419). Yet this star’s light “is like the scent / Of a
                jonquil when evening breezes fan it” (420). The simile repurposes morning light’s
                (Lucifer) and evening light’s (Venus) ethereal early-morning meeting as a meeting of
                reflection, for the jonquil is also known as “narcissus,” recalling us to Narcissus
                and the poem’s enemy, self-love. Lucifer, when he looks in the depths of fading
                night, sees his own face reflected back in the star’s millions-year-long Cheshire
                smile. The shape all light, however, despite its evanescence, nonetheless remains
                <emph>present</emph>, intra-acting with Rousseau’s materialistic
                speaker-companion, sidestepping the sun’s and the star’s egoistic cybernetic loop of
                self-love. </p>
                  <p>This is what makes this vision so powerfully, diffractedly, different: it is an
                instance of entanglement between the shape all light and Rousseau, who both now only
                begin to exist because they journey forward through the darkness that is light, an
                entangled phenomenon that signals an entire reorientation of how we understand the
                human in relation to the material. Rousseau, as both a material tree stump and a
                discursive subject, is already imbricated with the material world but here enters
                into a new entanglement with light. The word “knew,” which signals epistemology, is
                undercut by the ontological yoke of the “shape” that “moved, as I moved” combining
                the human and nonhuman, entangling the material and the figural: “So knew I in that
                light’s severe excess / The presence of that shape which on the stream / <emph>Moved,
                    as I moved</emph> along the wilderness” (424–26; emphasis
                added). A cascade of imagery captures the shape’s “presence”:

            Like the day and night of dream and wakefulness divided by the absent-present stars
                with which the poem opens, the shape all light seems to exist as both presence and
                absence, the momentary difference between the time of day’s giving way to night and
                vice versa—a moment that is “forever sought, forever lost,” pure day separated from
                pure night, each uninterrupted, exorbitant from its opposite, forever sought and
                lost because day and night are forever blended in the other. Space and time get
                remade in the shape all light as neither day nor night, sun nor star, and hence by
                exceeding the time of day and night the shape creates a non-anthropocentric world
                since day and night are human inventions. Like the stars that remain in the sky
                obscured by the sun (77–79), the shape all light appears as both material real shape
                and its own ghost, just as Rousseau himself lives only partially, neither dead nor
                alive: “so did that shape its obscure tenour keep” (432). The shape all light, in
                keeping its musical voice (“tenour”) level yet also obscure, becomes one with
                Rousseau, his material ghost just as Rousseau is the shape’s material ghost that
                entangles rather than demarcates. Rousseau and the shape are an “uncut”
                intra-action: subject and object, figural and material, light and night. </p>
                  <p>Rousseau becomes, here, not just the Enlightenment patriarch who Mary Wollstonecraft
                targets as one of feminism’s arch-villains, but a phenomenon made of and for a new
                kind of feminist post-social-contract politics. By revealing the intra-action of the
                shape all light’s feminist critique of Enlightenment patriarchy
                <emph>with</emph> a key figure of that patriarchy, Shelley reversions the social
                contract as forms of intra-action that denude egocentric individualism of its power
                to cut people into Hobbesian individuals invested in their own welfare and warfare
                against the communal concerns of others. For Shelley’s carefully-chosen invocation
                of the Enlightenment via the wraith-like Rousseau, of course also conjures
                Rousseau’s main antagonist, the even more spectral Hobbes, and with him the
                attendant fears that life in the post-apocalypse will return us to a war of all
                against all, which the poem depicts in its (mon)anarchs and Bacchic simulacra
                chained to Death’s chariot, whose chaos we call variously libertarianism, despotism,
                or fascism. All such ideologies and factions, if they can even be distinguished, are
                grounded in <foreign xml:lang="fr">amour propre</foreign>, Rousseau’s, and Shelley’s, enemy.
                So whereas Kate Singer rightly remarks that “Rousseau’s dream presents him with
                nightmare visions of the social contract” (and that only the feminine shape all
                light can lead Rousseau out of “the nightmare of history”), for Rousseau and Shelley
                such nightmares are also dreamt because these are actually Hobbesian visions of life
                (<title level="a">Stoned</title> 706, 688). In response to these nightmares,
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> explodes both
                monarchical despotism and social-contract anarchic and democratic Enlightenment
                theories to rethink a viable post-social-contract community, to forge modes of being
                together on a post-apocalyptic world where governmental, cultural, familial, and
                religious institutions have all fallen, similar to what Rousseau and Hobbes describe
                in their differing versions of the originary state of nature.</p>
                  <p>As such the shape all light differs from twilight, a diffracted course-change that
                runs away from the Anarchs’ navel-gazing self-love toward a love that tarries
                somewhere with the other, just as the material shape does with the nearest human
                subject, Rousseau. Here Shelley’s choice of Rousseau as Virgilesque guide to the
                speaker’s Dante culminates in a warning to abjure self-love or it will leave you,
                like Rousseau at poem’s end, “as one between desire and shame / suspended” (394–95).
                For it is Rousseau, and not Hobbes or Wollstonecraft, who targets self-love in
                <title level="m">A Discourse on Inequality</title>(1755) and
                <title level="m">Reveries of the Solitary Walker</title> (1770), in which humans’
                egocentricity in the state of nature must be annihilated for any genuine
                social-contract politics to overpower human passion for self from self, a foundation
                for politics the poem lays bare as nothing more than a reset of Hobbesian anarchy
                disguised in the resulting simulacra of democratic revolutions that must be ruled by
                social contracts equally laid bare as ineffectively useless. But whereas Rousseau’s
                solution is the erasure of self completely in <title level="m">Reveries</title>, his
                last book, Shelley repurposes Rousseau as his guide to checkmate the anthropocentric
                self-love that operates the Anarchs’ politics.<note place="foot" resp="author">Hamilton (180) has also noticed this
                            link between Shelley and Rousseau’s <title level="m">Reveries</title>. See
                            also Duffy for a historical situating of Rousseau’s work in the period.</note> As
                Orrin Wang argues, Shelley’s Rousseau critiques both the
                Enlightenment’s failure and a post-Enlightenment, post-Napoleon despair over failed
                revolutions. That Rousseau the Enlightenment
                <emph>philosophe</emph> is most associated with the
                French Revolution signals this failure even as the poem targets Rousseau’s intense
                engagement with overcoming his own egocentricism, like an arrow loosed, not by the
                sun god, Apollo, but by the god of the stars, Hesperus: self-love as the foundation
                for an anthropocentrism that is killing us. Witness Rousseau throughout the poem,
                constantly concerned with himself—“Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why”
                (398)—rather than others since “none seemed to know / Whither he went or whence he
                came, or why” (47–48).<note place="foot" resp="author">Earl Schulze also notices that Rousseau’s questions
                            are indicative of self-love (54).</note> Nepenthe is meant to
                erase self-love—which is patriarchal and masculine as opposed to the feminist shape
                all light—through its erasure of the self but it only blots out the Lockean
                <emph>tabula rosa</emph> of the mind, blots out the subject as
                epistemologically constructed. Touching his lips to the cup of self-forgetting
                recalls the speaker to himself, but only up to the moment of intra-action between
                Rousseau and the shape all light, which ontologically recreates the self and the
                other as a new entangled phenomenon. <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>
                therefore illustrates how such an entanglement can overcome, finally, the
                revolutions that ultimately fail because of self-love: anthropocentric apocalyptic
                belief in a progressive utopian future brought about by humans acting upon a world
                that exists <emph>for</emph> rather than <emph>with</emph> and
                <emph>without</emph> them (since entanglement upends
                such temporal and spatial coordinates). </p>
                  <p>The poem thus finds Shelley confronting his own earlier narcissistic theorization of
                love as well as Rousseau’s <title level="m">Julie</title> (1761),
                an ur-text for the poem about those, to quote Rihanna, who fall in love in a
                hopeless place. Drawing on Enlightenment ideas about sympathy, Shelley writes, in
                <title level="a">On Love,</title> that “we are born into the world and there is something within us which
                from the instant that we live and move thirsts after its likeness” (504). Even while
                we seek homology in another’s form, an instance of narcissistic externalization, our
                parched self’s thirst for self-love—like the anarchs whose self-love quenches the
                sun, which is their mirror—turns inward and “we dimly see within our intellectual
                nature a miniature as it were of our entire self” (504). Delving into the self is
                explicitly reflective rather than diffractive physics, “a mirror whose surface
                reflects only the forms of purity and brightness: a soul within our soul that
                describes a circle around its proper Paradise which pain and sorrow or evil dare not
                overlap” (504). In this earlier essay, love, for Shelley, remains grounded in the
                desire for the apocalyptic, or paradisiacal, unity of perfection within the self, a
                kind of tunneled-under version of Rousseau’s self-love in
                <title level="m">Julie</title>: “love is but illusion; it fashions for itself, so to speak, another
                Universe; it surrounds itself with objects that do not exist, or to which it alone
                has given being; and as it renders all its sentiments by images, its language is
                always figurative. […] When passion is at the full . . . [it] . . . can see nothing
                but Paradise, Angels, the virtues of Saints, the delights of the celestial” (10).
                For Rousseau in <title level="m">Julie</title>, love’s figurative nature is tethered
                to its essentially mutable nature: it creates non-real universes, new person suits,
                constantly transfigurable. </p>
                  <p>In contrast, <title level="m">The Triumph</title> theorizes love,
                not as figuration, but as entanglements that are unadorned by the masks of
                Rousseauvian self-delusion exhibited by the skeletal trick n’ treaters at poem’s
                end. Shelley’s Rousseau, in relating his vision of Dante, claims that the world is
                dumb to love’s music:

            Love is music, a light, a singer, that melodically rhymes to lovers but which the
                world itself cannot hear because love’s materiality is external to human beings.
                Love is a feeling between two subjects but also materialist, a “light” or external
                song that only comes into being as hearable music—apparently the evidence of its
                existence—between two subjects. In other words, love is a quantum entanglement that
                can only be heard, to put it paradoxically, <emph>once it is heard</emph>
                since its existence appears as the harmonic melody produced through the note-playing
                of one lover to another. And yet, because the world cannot hear love, this means
                that love, more paradoxically still,
                <emph>does exist</emph> separately, materially from
                the world dumb to its song. Nonetheless, “the sphere,” or world that cannot hear
                love, is moved by this very melody it is deaf to. At the syntactic level, the poem
                runs the world up against the wondrous rhyming of love’s musical melody, the dash
                shoving in like a trident from the sea against the line as if the world, while deaf
                to love, peers outward to Dante’s fiery inferno:

                     <emph>This</emph> earth filled with phantoms and dim-form people reminds us
                that subjects remain shadowy strands of gossamer, black striations on the pattern of
                the world’s light, a difference, we must recall, between sleep and waking, and
                waking sleepfulness, and sleepy dreaming. Neither subject nor love exists then,
                neither in the world nor between lovers prior to their love: it is a thing that is
                neither object nor subject but an entanglement between the two. Here, life begins
                and ends as one-to-one.</p>
                  <p>Donald Reiman writes that Shelley changed his conception of love between
                <title level="a">On Love</title> (circa 1818) and
                <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (1821) from “love as
                a response from others to his nature” to “a pursuit and celebration of the good that
                he saw in others” (10), one that evokes Humean and Smithian sympathy. But
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> revolts against any such notions. As the
                masks falling from the countenances of the poem’s orgiastic revelers remind us—as
                indeed does the speaker’s and Rousseau’s phantasmaticity—no autonomous subjects,
                either in body or mind, exist as yet in the world of the poem, only simulacra, a
                false impression of a reality suspended by its own naïve beliefs in a division
                between humans and the world as if they are independent actors irresponsible for
                their own delusions. What the poem discovers instead is that love is its own
                material entity, external to the subject, yet also, paradoxically, reliant on its
                entanglement with the subject for its life. One cannot go outside oneself to love
                the good in the other because the subject does not exist before love; every
                iteration of love fashions itself and the subject anew. And, indeed, the great moral
                of the poem is that such iterations form the architecture and architexture of a
                social contract after all social contracts can no longer exist in politics-as-usual
                manifestations, when institutional restraints like those favored by Hobbes and
                Rousseau are no longer possible, when life can only continue by bravely not knowing
                what life is, when no answers are any longer possible. To the question “then, what
                is life?” the poem answers: knowledge of the contour, nature, and time of life are
                irrelevant. For love is the answer, an entanglement that may fail, like any
                politics, and fail again, and again, until an entanglement shapes lovers’ light as
                what love is for real: ontologically beyond transfiguration, true love. And this is
                where Shelley surpasses Barad because for him a final spacetime of love can emerge
                between two people. </p>
                  <p>By thinking love as non-transfigurational because it only exists as intra-active
                entanglement (again, space and time do not change they are made), Shelley crafts a
                vision of future spacetimes wherein love creates its subjects even as they create
                love for the first time. Seen in this light, the many lights of Shelley’s poem,
                before the subject and object are entangled in love, no subject, no self, exists,
                nor, indeed, does love itself. Love, then, <emph>is</emph> love, in a
                space and time of its own loving. In <title level="m">Epipsychidion</title> (1821),
                Shelley remained faithful to the idea of love as a relation between a subject and
                object, a lover and beloved. But the bonds in such relations dissolve, as they do in
                that poem, since, like the simulacra in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>,
                subjects cling to the notion that they are human subjects. Shelley realizes that
                this “cut” between subject and object is itself a delusion. A priori notions of
                anthropocentric subjects are simply masks humans put on to cut themselves off from
                the world; in so doing they assume the title of another Napoleon or Frederick or
                Caesar, anthropocentricism as another form of the narcissism and egocentricity
                attributed to love that the poem resists and rewrites. Instead, the music of love
                arrives from outside the human even as it is also arises from the subjects who fall
                in love, the material drawing humans together into relations even as, in the
                process, love creates both itself and the subjects-as-lovers. </p>
                  <p>Imagining beyond the anthropocentric subject, Shelley’s theory of love suggests not
                the egoistic chaos of a world lost to political anarchy but rather a radical
                politics of love that creates worlds anew. Love is an intra-action that manifests
                new types of life, of living on, from a future-yet-to-come, of spacetimes on a world
                without us we could never have possibly anticipated because those worlds do not yet
                exist (this is why the poem breaks off). The poem wants us to know that this lovely
                spatiotemporality is like the stars, which, in their ulteriority beyond human life,
                constantly evince our own end even as this turns us back to consider our own
                survival since it reminds us that there may be none without love.
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> triumphs by knowing that life cannot be defined since
                each entanglement is of its own making, its own life. While we can never know what
                life is, Shelley entreats us, we must learn what true love is, and that is all we
                may know on earth and all we need to know. This is what Shelley knew, sitting on the
                sands of the Bay of Lerici, writing this poem, gazing at the sea that would soon
                claim him. In this time of disaster, of fallen stars, the triumph of love means a
                becoming of ourselves in our entanglement with the other in the darkness of light
                before the waves carry us away. For the uncertainty of our survival guarantees the
                paradox both of love’s radical indestructibility and the limited time it has left to
                live, to love, while we gaze up at the stars.</p>
