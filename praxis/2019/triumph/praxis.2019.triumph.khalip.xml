                Life</hi>, “as if that look must be the last,” as an aside that asks what occurs
                after that last look. In a post-Waterloo poem that imagines a hallucinatory
                end-of-the-world scenario amidst several last things, including a kiss, Shelley
                explores the adjacencies opened up by his unfinished late piece. It also turns to
                disparate works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Peter Hujar that serve as further
                instantiations of the kind of lastness that the poem complexly meditates on.</p>

                <p>In his essay <title level="a">The End of All Things,</title> Immanuel Kant zeroes in on what he
                    calls “the last thought, the last feeling in the thinking subject [who] will then remain forever
                    the same without any change” (227). This congealed and apocalyptic condition, in which “all alteration . . . ceases”
                    and “outrages the imagination,” is an unblinking nightmare for the philosopher: “For then the whole of nature will
                    be rigid and as it were petrified” (227). With some ambivalence, Kant puzzles over what it would mean for a subject
                    “to think itself into such a state,” which, as you might expect, he says is impossible, for it would mean that the
                    subject who thinks its own non-existence craves destitution, or a life “equivalent to annihilation” (227). And yet,
                    Kant gets at something obscure here, as if reluctantly putting his finger on something he would otherwise not like
                    to touch, but still does. What does it mean to come as close as possible to a last thought or a last feeling
                    <emph>as if</emph> it were the last? And how does one dwell with the “end of the world” otherwise?</p>
                <p>This essay begins with another kind of very last thing:<note place="foot" resp="author">My thanks to

                I am reminded of Mary Shelley’s sense of helpless fascination while editing the <title level="m">Posthumous 
                Poems</title>: “Did any one see the papers from which I
                drew that volume, the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of
                extracting it from so confused a mass, interlined and broken into fragments, so that
                the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses” (Reiman 119). Scanning the
                guesswork of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s last page (if seeing is even
                possible here), another opaque desideratum appears: the faint notation of the words
                “Alas I kiss you Julie” just above the dangling deletion of “<emph>from whose limbs the</emph>.”
                What does one make of the
                barely marked errancies of a last look and a last kiss? Both are minor affects that
                equivocally fall “by the way side” of a poem that remains unfinished, materially
                illegible, and an echo-text of other writings that ghost it.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                    <title level="m">Shelley’s Poetry and Prose</title> 541. All citations of

                            numbers will be given parenthetically.</note> Shelley seems to
                conjure a virtual and diffuse infrastructure that traffics at all limits between a
                “public way” and a “way side” (43, 541)&#8212;two ways that conceptualize the poem’s
                silent inscriptions and render it discontinuous with its own borders. </p>
            <p>In his study of the manuscript, Donald Reiman lists its “contents”: financial
                calculations; the poems “Lines Written in the Bay of Lerici” and “To Jane”;
                drawings, doodles, and sketches; various “apocrypha” or texts deleted from the final
                version; aborted openings, tryouts, and fragments (226–27). Additionally, we know
                that <title level="m">The Triumph</title> bears complex
                subterranean traces of the drama Shelley was researching since 1819:
                <title level="m">Charles the First</title>, a work he abandoned
                in 1822 in order to write the poem. It is worth pondering how these jottings, inter-texts, or graffiti also tug at
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> like a cog in the editorial
                wheel of the car itself, as if to delay any kind of last take or last look cast upon
                it. This elemental mass constitutes the poem’s “hidden transcript,” a concept James
                C. Scott uses in his book
                <title level="m">Domination and The Arts of Resistance</title> to
                describe “a critique of power spoken behind the back of the dominant” as a strategy
                of covert, unavowable resistance from within power relations (xii). Thus Shelley’s
                hidden transcript isn’t just the shapeless sum of all other texts within the poem’s
                folios, nor is it something to be excavated and interpreted exclusively through
                recourse to social or political lenses. Rather, the transcript gestates through its
                own mute, virtual resistances and underperformances that operate from within and in
                excess of the boundaries that inform it, disturbing them while simultaneously
                remaining below the radar of capture. The hiddenness of the transcript refuses and
                exhausts a text&#8212;it amounts to a negativity or <foreign xml:lang="fr">désoeuvrement</foreign>
                that, with varying nuances, stops and starts, ends and begins the “Life” that the
                triumph burdensomely bears along: “little profit brings / Speed in the van and
                blindness in the rear” (100–1). </p>
            <p>Tilottama Rajan writes that to look at <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> in
                its pre-published state is “to experience an enormous gulf between its chaos and the
                iconic clarity of the printed text . . . That
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title> survives only in manuscript
                may be an accident. But the accident is part of the text’s history and produces that
                history as a kind of mirror-stage on which the identity of editing, of philology,
                and of reading is projected and broken” (341). “The iconic clarity of the printed
                text” brilliantly evokes how a drive for perceptual coherence vainly repairs the
                messy “broken” gulf of the poem in its two states, or its two worlds. Within the
                context of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, it isn’t hard to hear how that rift
                becomes the mirror stage for all the scholarship that has followed the poem: writing
                over thirty years ago, Paul de Man famously asked how reading <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> required us to wonder what we should do with the scene of the
                unburied body “within” the text:
            <quote>
                This defaced body [Shelley’s drowning] is present in the margin of the last
                manuscript page and has become an inseparable part of the poem. At this point,
                figuration and cognition are actually interrupted by an event which shapes the text
                but which is not present in its represented or articulated meaning . . . The final
                test of reading, in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title>, depends on how one
                reads the textuality of this event, how one disposes of Shelley’s body. (120, 121)

                The question of disposal might be juxtaposed with Derrida’s remark in a reading of
                Paul Celan: “When the world is no more, when it is on the way to being no longer
                <emph>here but over there</emph>, when the world is no longer near…then I
                must carry <emph>you</emph>, you alone, you alone in
                me or on me alone” (<title level="a">Rams</title> 158). What Derrida emphasizes is the recession of that
                rift, the intervallic indeterminacy that turns the end of the world into a kind of
                “epistemological therapeutics”:<note place="foot" resp="author">I borrow this term

                For each time, and each time singularly, each time irreplaceably, each time
                infinitely, death is nothing less than an end of
                <emph>the</emph> world. Not <emph>only one</emph> end among others, the end of
                someone or something <emph>in the world</emph>, the end of a life or of a
                living being. Death puts an end neither to someone in the world nor to
                <emph>one</emph> world among others. Death marks each
                time, each time in defiance of arithmetic, the absolute end of the one and only
                world, of that which each opens as a lone and only world, the end of the unique
                world, the end of the totality of what is or can be presented as the origin of the
                world for any unique living being, be it human or not. (<title level="a">Rams</title> 140)
            </quote>
                For Derrida, death generically enacts this apocalyptic end, again and again, as an
                ethical injunction: attend to the end of the world as the Other’s end, but do not
                make it your own, even as “the end” occurs throughout life at the risk of always
                cannibalizing the other in our thoughts. In what follows, I read the end of the
                world for its form, which is to say as a <emph>non-catastrophic</emph>
                structure or formula that performs extinguishments at micro-levels. Turning to the
                line “as if that look must be the last,” I want to consider this comparatively brief
                and under-read textual moment as opening up an ethico-aesthetics that emerges for
                Shelley out of a formal quandary: what happens in the poem <emph>after</emph> the 
                last look has been drained? And what is an <emph>after-look</emph>? I admit that for years, I have been perplexed by the minimal
                yet arresting force of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s last words, to the point
                where the whole apparatus of the poem dissolves for me like a stone in a river. The
                line has also been so powerful to me because of its resonance with an earlier moment
                where the poet deplores the coercive logic of <title level="m">The Triumph’s</title>
                spectacular visuality: “Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow / Of people, and
                my heart of one sad thought” (298–99). One might call this “ideological fatigue,”
                Siegfried Kracauer’s term for what he diagnosed as the profound “apathy” and
                “insensitivity” of American culture reflected in postwar Hollywood cinema, where
                confrontations with historical trauma expose a lack in values and total social and
                political paralysis (79). The sick eyes of the poet, like Mary Shelley’s, become
                passive precipitates of a fatigue that succumbs to the imperatives of ocular reason,
                but at the same time, the poem counters this passivity with a queerly erotic
                openness to disabling and world-ending encounters that flash up with last looks and
                last kisses. In these non-appropriating and partial moments, lifeless bodies and
                things approach each other as seductive “evidence” of pleasures that blur the lines
                between seeing, reading, and looking at last sight. </p>
            <p> For a poem that frenetically begins (as Faflak has described it) like the musical
                <title level="m">42nd Street</title> and “works like hell to
                bring the world prosopopoeically to life” (“Dancing” 168), the springing forth of
                the sun and the subsequent “unclosing” of all things in the proem are no sooner
                choreographed than everything soon disappears in an end of the world that overworks
                its own resources (9). The poet experiences a “scene . . . / As clear as when a veil
                of light is drawn / O’er evening hills they glimmer” (31–33), one which gives way to
                a “trance of wondrous thought” (41). In turn, it effects a “Vision . . . rolled” on
                [the poet’s] brain (40)&#8212;a mechanized rolling that prefigures the last roll of the
                chariot of Life itself (“the car which now had rolled / Onward”), and annuls his
                gaze which is trained at the unclosing world. William Jewett notes that “Shelley’s
                daemonized <emph>aubade</emph> explicitly revises a
                topos of revolution poetry: the appearance of the day’s new light as an emblem of a
                new age abruptly dissociated from the time of an ancien régime” (225). If we are
                confronting something like the revolutionary unclosing of the first eyes of the
                world&#8212;“All flowers in field or forest which unclose / Their trembling eyelids to the
                kiss of day” (9–10)&#8212;the proem introduces seeing as not only an originating way of
                being, but as a forced act of unblocking an opening, an unclosing that rearranges
                perceptions. It recalls Schopenhauer’s puzzling reflection in <title level="m">The
                World as Will and Representation</title> (1818) that
                <quote>
            the existence of the whole world remains forever dependent on that first eye that
                opened, were it even that of an insect. For such an eye necessarily brings about
                knowledge, for which and in which alone the whole world is, and without which it is
                not even conceivable . . . This world is the succession of the representations of
                this consciousness, the form of its knowing, and apart from this loses all meaning,
                and is nothing at all. (1: 30)
                </quote>
            Even though the world precedes the first eye, for Schopenhauer it can only exist as
                something a priori insofar as it occurs as a world by virtue of and for that first
                eye. In this way, the eye’s <emph>aubade</emph> is
                also, generically speaking, its address of the lover through a song of separation
                and farewell: to wake is to part at the limit of dawn. </p>
            <p>What kind of world is left after the last eye goes misty? Is it the “world after the
                end of the world” (Derrida, <title level="a">Rams</title> 140)? For Shelley, there is never the opening of
                one eye, but multiple eyes, disconnected from any autonomous entity; in their
                multiplicity, no one line of sight predominates. And at this point, “unclosing”
                suggests something else: not another kind of opening nor a deprivation of closure,
                but a seeing with and through negativity, one that proceeds to veil things just as
                they glimmer. If a “poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth”
                as Shelley claims in
                <title level="m">A Defence of Poetry</title> (515), his ontology
                of the image is essentially not amenable to the visible. The “wondrous trance” opens
                onto a topology of things seen <emph>as unseen</emph>&#8212;stanzas (or rooms)
                unfurnished, not so much noumenal as absent, forgotten, unmade, and emptied out. For
                example, later on in the <title level="m">Defence</title> he states the following:
                <quote>
            All things exist as they are perceived: at least in relation to the percipient. ‘The
                mind is its own place, and of itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.’
                But poetry defeats the curse which binds us to be subject to the accident of
                surrounding impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain or withdraws
                life’s dark veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a being
                within our being. It makes us inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is
                a chaos. It reproduces the common universe of which we are portions and percipients,
                and it purges from our inward sight the film of familiarity which obscures from us
                the wonder of our being. It compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to
                imagine that which we know. It creates anew the universe after it has been
                annihilated in our minds by the recurrence of impressions blunted by reiteration.

            William Keach reminds us that Shelley’s post-Lockean formulation of the image staked
                its ground on its non-picturable possibilities: delinked from sense-perception,
                Shelley’s images are often produced by an inside/outside mode of perception that
                (re)creates what the world does or does not give&#8212;what it ostensibly closes. The line
                between giving and not giving, like the one between opening and unclosing, is
                impossible to firmly draw (42–78). For example, in the preface to <title level="m">Prometheus
                Unbound</title>: “Imagery which I have employed will be found in many
                instances to have been drawn from the operations of mind, or from those external
                actions by which they are expressed” (207). Poetry is other to itself: on the one
                hand, if it is an ostensibly equalizing medium, one which “creates a being within
                our being” and “reproduces the common universe,” it has a power of apprehension
                which seizes the common&#8212;it “purges . . . the film of familiarity” and renews the
                universe after its “annihilation” by the everyday. But for poetry to make something
                happen as a faculty, it operates by way of cuts and endings&#8212;it “defeats” and
                “purges,” as if overcoming or deleting the very concepts it endlessly generates into
                legibility. As an image of life and a faculty for seeing such a life, poetry closes
                and uncloses the aperture towards a life that is discontinuous with it, a poetic
                life that “poetry” can never wholly see because, like a camera, it always sees for
                others and sees things <emph>as</emph> other&#8212;a look without a seer.
                Shelley’s poetry is on the cusp of what one sees and doesn’t see&#8212;a limit or
                borderline that takes time to unclose. It has a long exposure&#8212;like the undetermined
                route of <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, there is no end in sight to life/Life.
                When it uncloses, things and places patiently open up but not for our eyes only. And
                because we can only see or read through another, we submit or yield ourselves to the
                insistence of a life beside itself that has become so vividly absent at its edges.</p>

            <p>When Rousseau casts an eye at the car, what does he look at? Is it a
                defensive response, an automated reflex? Between “What is Life?” and “Happy are
                those for whom the fold / Of,” these two units bookend the last look as something
                that transpires imperceptibly in the middle of things. From one point of view, the
                unfinished conversation between Rousseau and the poet takes place in the poem’s
                foreground while all other actions and events outside the quotes fall into the
                background noise. But if we recall that the manuscript of <title level="m">The
                Triumph</title> did not have quotation marks (a posthumous editorial add-on by Mary
                Shelley), looking and speaking blend into one another like a queerly textual
                assemblage or melée. In a poem of extraordinary light imagery and various instances
                of vision, looking, beholding, and seeing, this small moment is confounding. The
                word <emph>eye</emph> appears in the text more than any other figure for
                visualization: at my count, it appears ten times, whereas “gaze”=3; “vision”=4; and
                “look”=2. Thus the casting out of the eye, or its de-eyeing, becomes a significant
                topos for Shelley in <title level="m">The Triumph of Life</title> and in its parallel
                text, <title level="m">Charles The First</title>. Jewett has
                shown how in the drama, the figure of the Sun “is a tyrannical Sun King, modelled
                not, as critics have suggested, after Louis XIV, but after Charles I rejoicing in
                his courtly spectacles” (227). The assault, moreover, on “courtly spectacles” like
                <title level="m">The Triumph of Peace</title> (performed in
                1633), which “arose out of a wish by City lawyers to defend the court’s spectacles
                from the antitheatrical attacks of Puritan iconoclasts like their colleague William
                Prynne” (232), would not have been lost on Shelley.<note place="foot" resp="authors">Jewett surmises that
                            <title level="m">The Triumph of Peace</title> at the
                            court of Charles I would have brought to mind the contemporary excesses
                            of the Prince Regent.</note> When Charles the First imagines
                himself as the “golden sun” of the court while “[t]he wild million / Strike at the
                eye that guides them” (<title level="m">Poetical Works</title> 144–45), he conceives
                of the body politic “like Oedipus . . . [which] strikes out its own eye” (Jewett
                244). The line echoes “the million with fierce song and maniac dance/Raging around”
                in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> (110–11), or “the throng
                of Life that not only obscures but permanently extinguishes the illumination
                Rousseau might have shed” (Jewett 244). Jewett underscores this parallel in order to
                argue that Shelley’s mobile imagery of light and obscurity depicts history not as
                traditionally successional but “as a nontemporal repetition of obscurings that blot
                a light shining from a realm beyond time” (231–32). If the poem works to forget what
                the past remembers, then the abandonment of the play for the poem was, in Jewett’s
                estimate, Shelley’s anxious “political dilemma,” or the question of how to think
                beyond the embodiment of history on stage (253) even as the poem “engenders an
                unquenchable nostalgia for the doings and sufferings that once could be found in
                history” (252). </p>
            <p>I want to suggest, however, that Shelley’s casting out of the eye enacts another
                gesture, one that ends a world but in a manner that is involuntary and
                intentionless&#8212;an <emph>abjecting</emph> or throwing out of what comes to configure itself
                as what Kristeva terms the “in-between, the ambiguous, the composite” (4). Rousseau
                throws out the eye like a futile apostrophe or address, abjuring or discarding the
                very organ associated with the possibility of perception (hence his eyelessness).
                Additionally, the line allows for the thought that the eye throws and attaches
                itself <emph>to</emph> the moving triumphal car, as if to let the car
                carry the eye “onward” and put an end to the look while also absorbing its expulsion
                into the engine of the car. The million that strike the “eye that guides them” might
                be like Hegel’s work of art, a “thousand-eyed Argus, whereby the inner soul and the
                spirit is seen at every point” (1: 153–54). And like the heart which manifests its
                inner workings all over the human body, art must “convert every shape in all points
                of its visible surface into an eye” in order to confirm and see such affects as
                revelations of the spirit (1: 153). But for Shelley, the heterogeneity of the
                million that “rage around” the chariot disturb the work of art’s spectatorial
                privilege. Rather than convert and homogenize, the throng explodes around Life as
                “in-between” and “composite,” at once fascinated and bound to it but also
                <emph>called</emph> to it as a situation waiting for its event, implicitly
                displacing it as a source or center of attention.<note place="foot" resp="author">I draw 
                here on Alain Badiou’s definition of the event in <title level="m">Being and Event</title>.</note>
                It isn’t that there are more lines of sight that open up; instead, Shelley’s
                weariness with <title level="m">The Triumph</title> imitates the depleting movements
                of figures within it that challenge spectatorship as a world-making project. Indeed,
                this reversal of the eye’s observational capacities is what Michel Foucault locates
                in Georges Bataille’s work&#8212;rather than persist as the (Romantic) figure of a “mirror
                and lamp,” the eye works differently: “Sight carries it away in this luminous stream
                (an outpouring fountain, streaming tears and, shortly, blood), hurls the eye outside
                of itself, conducts it to the limit” (81). The eye is removed from its own
                operations <emph>by</emph> sight just as “the philosophizing subject has
                been dispossessed and pursued to its limit” (82). Visualization becomes a cutting
                force, a non-reactive limit-experience achieved via abjection and eyelessness: “And
                in the place from which sight had once passed, only a cranial cavity remains”
                (81–82). </p>
            <p>The hegemony of that project proves catastrophic for Shelley; to reject it becomes a
                speculative pursuit for him, and he evokes it with the words “as if”: raising a
                possibility one might dwell with, but not conclusively put down. In a reading of
                Kant’s own <emph>as ifs</emph>, David L. Clark reminds us that the
                philosophic form of the <foreign xml:lang="de">als ob</foreign> appears throughout Kant’s
                writings as a regulatory principle supposing an action outside of actual experience.
                This capacity Kant calls abstraction, or “negative attentiveness” in
                <title level="m">Anthropology From A Pragmatic Point of View</title> (1798): “Either
                the <emph>paying attention to (attention)</emph> or the <emph>turning away from</emph> an idea of which I
                am conscious (<emph>abstraction</emph>).&#8212;The latter is not the mere
                failure and omission of the former . . . but rather a real act of the cognitive
                faculty of stopping a representation of which I am conscious from being in
                connection with other representations in one consciousness” (19). Clark notes that
                “a turning <emph>from</emph> that is also always a
                turning <emph>to</emph>, and that works to separate worlds without making
                them inaccessible to each other . . . [“negative attentiveness” 
                [<foreign xml:lang="de">negative Aufmerksamkeit</foreign>]] means never having finally to say
                <emph>no</emph> to no” (266). Here we are asked to
                imagine how looking away from something&#8212;the “misfortune of others, yes, even from
                our own good fortune” (20)&#8212;is at once affirming and negating. It isn’t a
                dialectical movement per se, but a way of seeing and acting upon things
                simultaneously and differently, as if spinning possibilities both against and with
                each other. The <emph>as if</emph> thus lets one thing stand with another
                without relation; it turns things to address themselves under conditions where
                ordinarily such an address would be impossible. And it does so to suggest that the
                turn, if it happens <emph>there</emph> in the moment of the
                <emph>as if</emph>, will also happen again. The last
                look might suggest a way of never perceiving the last look as the last&#8212;never
                thinking we could see the last world and the last look&#8212;but also never entirely
                saying <emph>no</emph> to lastness outright because in each case, lastness
                must happen one more time beyond itself. And to further emphasize the severity of
                that movement, the look <emph>must</emph> be the last: it is <emph>as if</emph> it must be
                so. The <emph>must</emph>
                insists and requests with all the austerity of a sovereign imperative, although in
                this case, it occurs without sovereign authority&#8212;an obligation to be the last in the
                absence of knowing from where such a decree is summoned. It must be and it ought to
                be. And as one adjusts oneself to that must-ness, one looks upon and reads the last
                look as an unreal symptom of that obligating statement. One looks just as one is
                told to stop looking&#8212;the last look on the world here is infinitely repeatable&#8212;one
                does not look, one does not look, one <emph>does</emph> look, etc. </p>
            <p>I have made the argument elsewhere that one question which goes unnoticed and
                unspoken in <title level="m">The Triumph</title> concerns the untranslateable
                “language” spoken or translated between the English poet and the Swiss philosopher
                (Khalip 184). In the context of this chapter, I rephrase my observation: what do the
                poet and Rousseau <emph>see</emph> when they look at each other? If the
                language of poetry is, according to the <title level="m">Defence</title>, already
                foreign in the sense of being a medium of “evanescent visitations . . . always
                arising unforeseen and departing unbidden” and derived from “words which express
                what they understand not,” then there is also an
                    untranslateability or an “unapprehended inspiration” in looking (534, 535). To
                    look is to perceive something from a position where we have not made ourselves
                    available to be looked at. We cannot but fail under such conditions of looking.
                    “Vision can only proceed,” notes Faflak, “on the basis of what it cannot
                see, what is unavailable to or left out of perception” (“Difficult” 59), which is to
                say that looking proceeds through an inhibition that looks at what is imperceptible
                to it, or an unclosing intrinsic to the look; otherwise, there would be no reason to
                look at all. When Rousseau looks upon the car, in that interval nothing is seen, or rather, what
                <emph>is</emph> seen does not solely pertain to the image of the car. Remember: where “the
                holes it vainly sought to hide / Were or had been eyes” (187-88). Rousseau’s
                <emph>disfigurement</emph> is also (to extend the trope) <emph>uncorrected</emph>,
                incorrigible, and impenitent (“as one between desire and
                shame / Suspended” [394–95]. In the non-capacity to see, looking occurs in spite of
                itself, <emph>as if</emph> in this interval. And with all the quickness of a
                    photographic shot, an image appears just as it abstains from visibility.<note place="foot" resp="author">I 
                        allude here in my thinking to Didi-Huberman’s <title level="m">Images in Spite of All.</title></note> In
                <title level="m">Specters of Marx</title>, Derrida reminds us that while it is difficult
                “<emph>to make or to let</emph> a spirit <emph>speak</emph>,” it is also the case that “the last one to whom a
                specter can appear, address itself, or pay attention is a spectator as such . . . As
                theoreticians or witnesses, spectators, observers, and intellectuals, scholars
                believe that looking is sufficient. Therefore, they are not always in the most
                competent position to do what is necessary: speak to the specter” (11). A sufficient
                looking is one that is content with mutuality, recognition, and likeness. It
                respects the boundaries in things drawn together and apart, like the difference
                between a human and a ghost, death and life. Such a looking is sufficient insofar as
                it thinks it is <emph>just enough</emph> and nothing more, as if looking
                were directed by the teleology of an address that has reached what it wants to know.
                I look and see the other and <emph>no other</emph>: “And for despair / I
                half disdained mine eye’s desire to fill / With the spent vision of the times that
                were / And scarce have ceased to be” (231–34).</p>
            <p>One comes to believe that figures of speech are somewhat inadequate here for reading
                the materiality of a look as if it “must be the last,” precisely because Shelley is
                tending towards something inexpressive and non-phenomenological, a refusal of the
                communicable contract of words themselves. In an essay entitled “The Look of the
                Portrait” (and which in part reads Miguel Barceló’s 1994 painting
                <title level="m">Double Portrait</title>) Jean-Luc Nancy cites Wittgenstein’s statement that “We
                don’t see the human eye as a receiver . . . When you see the eye, you see something
                go out from it. You see the blink of an eye [<foreign xml:lang="de">Blick des
                Auges</foreign>].” Nancy continues:
                <quote>
            The look, Wittgenstein’s <foreign xml:lang="de">Blick</foreign>, is the
                thing that leaves or takes its leave, the thing of leaving. More precisely, the look
                is nothing phenomenal; on the contrary, it is the
                <emph>thing in itself</emph> of a departure from the
                self through which alone the subject becomes a subject . . . In truth, it is no
                longer even a look <emph>upon</emph> but a look as a whole, open not <emph>on</emph> but
                <emph>through</emph> the evidence of the world . . . it is nothing less than
                the presentation of a world rising up into its own vision, into its own evidence. (245)
                </quote>
            The look, as a thing in the world, a “thing of leaving,” dispenses itself
                <emph>as the world</emph> and <emph>of the world</emph>,
                an unclosing of the world as both affirmation and dismissal. It “happens”
                separately, away from any spectator or subject. This “departure from the self” marks
                the irruption of the very thing we cannot see because the look uncloses a world in
                the absence of our perspective, after the last. It hints at a genre of the
                non-apocalyptic that frees itself over and over, a “thing that leaves or takes its
                leave”&#8212;a <emph>poetry of the after-all</emph>, to adapt a term by Peter
                    Szendy.<note place="foot" resp="author">In <title level="m">Apocalypse-Cinema</title>, Szendy
                            describes the disaster at the end of Lars von Trier’s film
                            <title level="m">Melancholia</title> thus: “<emph>The end of the movie 
                                is the end of the world</emph> . . . [it answers the demand that] the last image be the very last image,
                            that is, the last <emph>of them all</emph>&#8212;of all past,
                            present, or future images” (2). In this way, the film presents us with
                                “<emph>a cinema of the after-all</emph>” (3), a cinema
                            that doesn’t merely survive after the annihilation of the planet, but
                            rather a cinema that incinerates itself&#8212;a negativity at the very center
                            of the medium’s own aspiration to show, to represent the
                        world.</note> The last look ends the world, and a compulsion to
                have a certain kind of life with that world. Such a look is less a means for sight
                than it is an end unto itself, retreating from the “self” to present a world in its
                departure. </p>
            <p>Thus the impossible gazes of the poet and Rousseau are less about solidarity than
                about their irreconcilability, an asymmetry of desires that confounds the
                pedagogical relationship between the two. For Shelley, learning painfully emerges as
                “thought’s empire over thought” (211). If “what was once Rousseau” (204) is the
                philosopher of the poem’s last word for Shelley&#8212;indeed, its Virgilian
                representative&#8212;he is also quite strikingly an actor and spectator
                <emph>of</emph>the last look&#8212;the so-called “first”
                or <emph>radical</emph> Romantic (again, “an old root”), now become its
                last and eyeless spectator&#8212;the last Romantic of the triumph, as well as implicitly
                the last of “Life” itself. “Whence I came, partly I seem to know . . . / Whither the
                conqueror hurries me still less” (300, 304). The poet, upon lamenting that he is
                “sick of this perpetual flow / Of people,” turns to Rousseau, who goes on to
                stand-in for the poet by seeing and thinking for him. His <emph>re-</emph>presentation
                of looking, however, implicitly hands over pedagogic vision as
                a void or abyss&#8212;an inaccessible and unlearned knowledge that uncloses between the
                two of them: “And what thou wouldst be taught,” says Rousseau to the poet, “I then
                may learn / From thee” (307–8). Rousseau counsels the poet, however, to “from
                spectator turn / Actor or victim in this wretchedness” (305–6), and accept a painful
                vulnerability that renders indiscernible acting and not acting. The poet disdains
                his own desire to see because that desire cannot
                <emph>not</emph> look away from the “spent vision” of
                a stale and cumulative history of all those that have “ceased to be”&#8212;Voltaire,
                Frederick II, Kant, Catherine the Great, and Leopold II. The eye fills with a
                half-full history that must come to an end. Thus when the poet cries out “Let them
                pass” (243), his wish to let the figures move along becomes interchangeable with the
                hint that they (and their historical narratives) might die a second time and
                disappear from sight altogether. </p>

                replaces the chariot with the actual British
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> as the vehicle of the last
                look&#8212;a spectral, postwar commodity on one of the nighttime streets of New York City
                that Hujar cruised and captured on film in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> in the photograph is a
                conspicuously older model, a last thought and last feeling that appears
                anachronistically out of place in a place of desertion. With exemplary force,
                Hujar’s car illustrates the kind of object of desire that subtends Walter Benjamin’s
                notion of “love&#8212;not at first sight, but at last sight,” the love that waves “a
                farewell forever” through its commodified look, fleetingly glimpsed by Baudelaire’s
                <foreign xml:lang="fr">flâneur</foreign> in the urban crowd (169). Like a drag on the
                surface of the photograph’s visual field, the car tarries or brakes with a last look
                that is somehow there but <emph>not</emph> quite
                there. What kind of demand does such a farewell make? And is this a portrait, an
                urban landscape, or something infinitely more inarticulable? In what way is a
                farewell endlessly performed here&#8212;a wish to leave that expresses itself
                <emph>as a wish</emph> and not a resolution, an adieu that repeats itself
                with each end? The photograph almost suggests that these questions are the car’s
                own: it timelessly sits on a street without traffic or persons. It might move
                onward, but it doesn’t; parked close to the curb, it is suspended somewhere between
                movement and stasis&#8212;a suspension, moreover, accented by several markers that
                conspire to tie together its holding environment: the curb’s parallel lines, the
                elevated railway above, the piece of wood or cardboard on the ground by the tires,
                and the three white stripes around the central column that bisect the photograph.
                These stripes, in turn, are offset by the pale verticality of the columns on which a
                one-way sign in the background points to something beyond the frame. The
                crisscrossing parallel and perpendicular lines in the photograph stall a movement of
                relations that it wants to invalidate. It is as if Hujar wants to nullify the
                implied vehicular pressure of all elements within his plane, and in so doing, he
                shoots a photograph that requires no agents at all. Nor does he secure the car as an
                object of anyone’s interpretative desire&#8212;in other words, he has us think it
                <emph>as</emph> a figure for the <emph>asubjectivity</emph> of desire itself. Like Keats’ Grecian urn which depicts a
                “little town . . . emptied of [its] folk,” and whose “streets for evermore / Will
                silent be” (Keats 462), Hujar’s car is embedded in a site of relational
                desolation&#8212;without drivers or passengers,
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> depicts a last world with one
                last car left in it after driving and riding have been eliminated.<note place="foot" resp="author">This
                    is a riff on Fisher’s <title level="a">A Museum with One Work Inside.</title></note>
            </p>
            <p>In this photograph, <foreign xml:lang="fr">désoeuvrement</foreign> shades into driverlessness
                and riderlessness. The darkened, underexposed tones of the photograph compose a
                field where the car seems bathed in an exacting and precise light, drawing the
                spectator towards something that enigmatically correlates with the eye’s longing for
                focus. But only the front part of the car is lit whereas the rest of the body is
                dappled or brushed with shadows that hold it down in the swathe of black that blots
                the car’s right front and rear tires. In Hujar’s monochromatic
                chiaroscuro, the wheels kiss the road,
                pooling downward in what appears to be a rectangular, box-like void between the
                tires and the curb. And as if to further emphasize a light that cannot
                <emph>not</emph> look away, <title level="m">Triumph</title> visualizes the suspension of a
                suspension in the small blot of illumination caught in its upper left-hand corner&#8212;an
                overexposed shot of a train signal (possibly a yellow light) that flashes
                permanently between “go” and “stop.” The light is marginal in the sense that it is
                literally to the side of the foregrounded car, but it also doesn’t light (or
                enlighten) it. In a certain sense, it is as if the substance of Hujar’s photograph
                is like the “tain of the mirror”&#8212;Rodolphe Gasché’s term for a mirror’s “silver
                lining, lusterless back” that negatively enables a mode of thinking that is not
                reflective but the “systematic exploration of that dull surface without which no
                reflection and no specular and speculative activity would be possible” (6). At once
                holding back and pulling the <title level="m">Triumph</title> in
                several directions, Hujar’s tain-like night evokes an ethical and epistemological
                quandary that one hears in Maurice Blanchot’s reading of the myth of Orpheus: by
                turning back towards Eurydice, Orpheus’s “forbidden gaze destines [him] to lose
                everything: not only himself, not only day’s reality, but night’s essence” (174).
                Orpheus’s relation to his work depends on
                <emph>not</emph> turning back to Eurydice in order to
                keep to the work implied in his gaze; but, so that he can “carry the work beyond
                what assures it,” the look must be broken or forgotten. “In this gaze, the work is
                lost . . . Thus it is only in that look that the work can surpass itself, be united
                with its origin and consecrated in impossibility” (174). </p>
            <p>Hujar presents this impossibility of the look&#8212;its loss
                <emph>with</emph> the work&#8212;just as Shelley presents
                Rousseau’s “new Vision”: this is not an alternate life, but an encounter with and a
                greeting of bodies and pleasures that are late to arrival, already realized after
                they have come to term&#8212;negatives without positive prints. It is for this reason that
                Giorgio Agamben, in his little essay “Judgment Day,” describes photography as
                “represent[ing] the world as it appears on the last day, the Day of Wrath . . . the
                judgment concerns a single person, a single life: precisely this one and no other . . . In 
                the supreme instant, man, each man, is given over forever to his smallest,
                most everyday gesture . . . A good photographer knows how to grasp the
                eschatological nature of the gesture” (23, 24, 25). The last day of the photograph
                is, however, also its “demand for redemption” (26), as if the last day can never be
                the last, can never give up on a future rescue of the petrified last thought or last
                feeling that the photograph eschatologically captures. But Hujar’s 
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is irredeemable: it doesn’t presume a world where the relation
                between the photograph and the person can be confirmed. Experimenting with a
                photography without life or a life after New York (un)closes its last queer eye,
                Hujar roams the city like the poetic scavenger Shelley evokes looking at the
                “charnel” of the earth. His photograph receives or addresses phenomena that are
                there and not there, as if “‘waiting for the person to come to him and just being
                very present’” (Carr, <title level="m">Fire In the Belly</title> 188). Such presence
                insists on being <emph>here</emph> amidst a queer world that bears a right
                to exist and not exist in the sense of abjuring legibility, rights, and
                documentation. <title level="m">Triumph</title> is not a portrait of a car, nor is it
                a last look given by it. It is an image rent by a marginality that tears at the
                image, and queerly loiters around its multiple lines of force. </p>
            <p>For me, light and dark smear Hujar’s <title level="m">Triumph</title> with the same
                spellbinding effect that I read in the handwriting that ripples Shelley’s illegible
                manuscript pages. And as one instant of the erotically intervallic or minor in that
                poem, the phrase “Alas I kiss you Julie” has stayed with me as something at once
                unfinished and discreet, erotically unreleased into the edited life of the published
                text. As a standalone, this last kiss appears (as Reiman describes it) between “And
                <del rend="crossout">sank</del> fell, as I have by the” and “Those soonest,
                <del rend="crossout">from whose limbs the,</del>” written “in an extremely
                fine hand after the quill had been sharpened (probably after
                ‘<emph>limbs the</emph>’ below); the word [G.M. Matthews’s 1960 article on the poem and
                its various discarded passages in the <title level="j">Times Literary
                    Supplement</title>] reads as ‘Jane’ I believe to be “Julie”: At least there seems
                to me to be five rather than four letters, two of which rise above the level of the
                others” (Reiman 211). What would it mean to read this line as an afterthought, a
                superfluous addition, or a commentary without a speaker or an addressee, all of
                which “happen” after the deletion of other words and phrases on the page? Think of
                “Alas I kiss thee Julie” as a written speech act of a kiss&#8212;or more plainly, the act
                of a kiss&#8212;that is planted after a word or a poetic line,
                something <emph>after-all</emph> or after an
                infinitesimal world ends (erases, deletes) with the last drop of ink before the
                quill is sharpened. Like the rest of the “dialogue” in
                <title level="m">The Triumph</title>, the kiss is unbound from
                quotation marks in the Bodleian manuscript, a kind of silent non-speech; like
                Hujar’s <title level="m">Triumph</title>, it is caught in-between
                the margins of various intersecting lines of sight. The fact that “Julie” could have
                been also “Jane” hints that any name could be an anonymous or neutral placeholder
                within the phrase’s ghostly, blank address. And if “Alas I kiss you Julie” resembles
                on the surface a speech act, the resemblance is very much short-lived: tucked in
                almost unseen as something small and tactfully noted, it comes
                <emph>after</emph> the quill, quietly deposited
                between <title level="m">The Triumph</title>’s lines. The phrase is not much of
                anything: it doesn’t need publicity at all. </p>
            <p>But how does the last look <emph>look</emph> at the last kiss, or how does
                the last kiss <emph>kiss</emph> the last look? To think this, the key
                remains Rousseau: Reiman helpfully excavates elements of <title level="m">Julie, ou
                    la nouvelle Héloïse</title> (1761) in <title level="m">The Triumph</title>,
                especially the paralleling of Julie’s garden in Clarens with Shelley’s depiction of
                the visionary world where Rousseau encounters the “shape all light.” “Alas I kiss
                you Julie,” however, explicitly cites Letter XIV where Saint-Preux, Julie’s
                tormented tutor and lover, mourns the “fatal kiss” he shared with her in the
                garden:
                <quote>
                What have you done, ah! what have you done, my Julie? You meant to reward me and you
                have undone me. I am drunk, or rather insane. My senses are impaired, all my
                faculties are deranged by that fatal kiss. You meant to alleviate my sufferings?
                Cruel woman, you make them sharper. It is poison I have culled from your lips; it
                festers, it sets my blood afire, it kills me, and your pity is the death of me.
                (51)
                </quote>
               In this memory “of illusion, of delirium and enchantment” (51), Saint-Preux writes to
                her recalling the triangulated “fatal moment” of their kiss: having gone to the
                garden with Julie and her cousin Claire at sundown, Saint-Preux is at first taken
                aback by Claire’s own request for a kiss. Sensing Julie’s “signals of complicity”
                (52), he is possessed by a more overpowering desire that comes after&#8212;an
                <emph>after-kiss</emph>: “But what became of me a moment later, when I
                felt . . . my hand is shaking . . . a gentle tremor . . . your rosy lips . . .
                Julie’s lips… alighting on mine, pressing mine, and my body clasped in your arms?. .
                . Every part of me came together under that delightful touch. Our burning lips
                breathed out fire with our sights” (52). For Rousseau, Saint-Preux’s kiss is the
                emblem of a ruptured intensity of thinking, an intimacy of shared separation. In a
                novel that begins with the line, “Il faut vous fuire, Mademoiselle, je le sens bien”
                (“I must flee you Mademoiselle, that I can see”) a certain world ends with the first
                kiss: “tu m’as perdu” (“you have undone me”) writes Saint-Preux as he is consumed by
                a devastating perdition that puts him beyond death. As an emblem of romantic love,
                <title level="m">Julie</title> has to reinvent itself as a novel
                by going back to the romance of Abelard and Héloïse in order to explore the kiss as
                just this kind of truth of betrayed knowledge&#8212;a betrayal, moreover, whose errors
                split the self in language, elegizing it and its mistaken desires through fiction.
                The novel thus cannot be read as a fiction in the service of decipherment, but as a
                betrayed form whose “old world” has ended. Saint-Preux’s punishing “alas”
                affectively imparts just this kind of philosophy of the last kiss, as fatal as it is
                pleasurable: “Thus alarm extinguished pleasure, and my happiness was no more than a
                flash” (52). To read and to desire, Rousseau suggests, is to elegize a look and a
                kiss as the last signifiers of a world that is now no more. Saint-Preux’s flash,
                like Hujar’s camera and Rousseau’s cast out eye, is a love at last sight that hovers
                over its own self-extinction in a last world where things like
                <title level="m">Julie</title>, “Julie,” or “Jane” bleed into
                each other. </p>
            <p>In one of his fragments, Novalis cryptically muses: “One must never confess to
                oneself that one loves oneself. The secret of this confession is the life principle
                of the one true and eternal love. The first kiss in this understanding is the
                principle of philosophy&#8212;the origin of a new world&#8212;the beginning of absolute
                chronology&#8212;the completion of an infinitely growing bond with the self. Who would not
                like a philosophy whose germ is a first kiss?” (58–59). This first kiss, like
                Schopenhauer’s first eye, opens a world of difference that discovers the self in its
                “confession” to the other. In Nicolas-André Monsiau’s engraving of the novel’s first
                    kiss,<note place="foot" resp="author"><ref
                                target="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The-First-Kiss-of-Love-La-Nouvelle-Heloise.jpeg"

                this “germ” is starkly depicted: the central, oval-like
                entwining of the couple excludes Claire just as they require her to witness the
                crystallized heteronormative bond that seals the selves of Saint-Preux and Julie
                into the reproductive “beginning of absolute chronology” inaugurated by the kiss.
                What Saint-Preux actually finds, as we have seen, is a darker betrayal, a mistaken
                and negative philosophy that derealizes itself through the kiss: “I no longer see
                you the same” (52). Parceled out in an epistolary form where sender and receiver,
                addresser and addressee try to exchange conversation, the kiss comes to be disposed
                or cast out within the form of letter-writing where the return of an address becomes
                indistinguishable from its revocation&#8212;something Julie, in her response to
                Saint-Preux in Letter XV, herself stresses: “It is important, my friend, that we
                separate for some time” (52). </p>
            <p>Thus the queerness of Saint-Preux and Julie’s “fatal” love turns on first and last
                looks and kisses that traverse each other in the evening. In <title level="a">Typewriter Ribbon,</title>
                Derrida writes: “forgiveness or pardon, the excuse, and the remission of sin,
                absolute absolution, are always proposed in the figure, so to speak, of the ‘last
                word.’” The pardon’s “disturbing proximity . . . to the last judgment” evinces the
                impossibility of a forgiveness so total that it annihilates the world in which it
                takes places (100). A pardon that only forgives what it knows, what it sees, what it
                sympathizes with, is ineffective. It is as if pardoning were the gesture through
                which one could, in some way, speak the last word or see the last look in such a way
                that an end impossibly <emph>happens</emph>. Both Shelley and Hujar’s
                works, I suggest, <emph>forgive life&#8212;</emph> life as the unforgiveable
                which is always already there, incessantly, at once seen and not seen, kissed and
                not kissed, known and unknown. The absence of any kiss in Hujar’s
                <title level="m">Triumph</title> is the sign of it not only being everywhere, but rather that we
                should <emph>expect</emph> it everywhere, like the light of the train
                signal or the ubiquitous light in Shelley’s poem. The last is unforgiveable because,
                like life, it is always the last, and thus impossible to conclusively,
                catastrophically, forgive. Hujar instructs us not try to capture it with the camera,
                but to receive it. Shelley, writing after Rousseau, would have understood this: to
                greet life, to anonymously kiss and be non-fatally consumed by what we cannot look
                at, and to look at what we cannot kiss.</p>
