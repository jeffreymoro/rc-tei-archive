            <p class="noCount"><em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em> represent antitheses of Byron’s poetic style. However, their overt differences with
               respect to poetic manner, content, and sensibility obscure their shared thematic material.
               Observing how the ending of <em>Manfred</em> strikingly resembles the ending of the <em>Don Juan</em> source material leads to an awareness of gender issues underlying both works. Despite
               the apparent extreme contrast between the personalities and experiences of the poems’
               protagonists, both their tales embed a two-part structure, the first part focusing
               on heterosexual transgression, the culmination, an all-male scene of reckoning.</p>

               <p>Byron completed <em>Manfred</em> in the summer of 1817, just one year before beginning <em>Don Juan</em>, yet the contrast between Byron’s two most remarkable poetic achievements could not
                  be more obvious. Byron, at least, saw it that way, declaring <em>Manfred</em> “too much in my old style,” while <em>Don Juan</em> is in the new “style and manner of <em>Beppo</em>” (<em>BLJ</em> V:185, VII:67). Who could seem more unlike one another than Don Juan and Manfred,
                  and what two story lines could possibly be more dissimilar than theirs as Byron presents
                  them? Loving one woman too much and to the exclusion of all others is ostensibly the
                  fate of Byron’s solitary Alpine brooder; guilt haunts him, and forgetfulness is the
                  one thing he longs for. The hyper-gregarious hero from sunny Spain that Byron adopts
                  for <em>Don Juan</em> is defined by not loving any woman for more than a few fleeting moments; he seems
                  utterly lacking a capacity for guilt, and forgetfulness is the wind beneath his wings.
                  Yet the protagonists of <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em> and their life stories have much in common, as different as they appear to be at first
                  glance. It’s not merely that the poems share a philosophical viewpoint, as one might
                  expect to find in two works by a given author. Peel away a thin layer of their narrative
                  surfaces and deconstruct Byron’s “mock” recasting of the Don Juan source material,
                  and you will find that these two poems share a deep structure: the outline of a common
                  story and central character.

                           while when not italicized, Don Juan should be read as Don Hwan, the protagonist of
                           numerous European works. The relation of the character of Manfred to that of Don Juan,
                           despite their antithetical personalities and life stories, has not gone entirely unnoticed.
                           Romantic literary and musical interpretations of Don Juan in fact show more of an
                           influence of Manfred than of Don Juan. Thus, Svetlana Klimova points out that the
                           hero of A. K. Tolstoy’s Don Juan (1862) “is much closer to the ‘classical Byronic

            </div>
            <p>Because Byron’s ironic treatment of the Don Juan source material initially obscures
               the connection between <em>Don Juan</em> and <em>Manfred</em>, my point of departure is a consideration of <em>Manfred</em> alongside a more straightforward treatment of the Don Juan story well-known in Byron’s
               day and ever since: namely, Mozart’s incomparable opera <em>Don Giovanni</em>, with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte. Noting resemblances between the opera and <em>Manfred</em> helps illuminate the fact that, despite how different these poems appear to be, <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan </em> are two variations on the same plot and the same central character. Indeed, regarding
               these two poems almost as one continuous work helps illuminate important themes latent
               in both of them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The culminating scene in <em>Don Giovanni</em>, the Commendatore scene, is one of the most musically thrilling and dramatically
                  powerful scenes in opera. In this scene the Don locks hands with a statue that he
                  has invited to dinner: the statue of the Commendatore whom (in Act I) Don Giovanni
                  killed in a duel after the Commendatore intervened to prevent the Don’s seduction
                  or rape (interpretations vary) of his daughter. The parallels between this scene in
                  the opera and the final scene in <em>Manfred</em> with respect to action, character, imagery, and general atmosphere are immediately
                  obvious. In the opera, the statue repeatedly demands—in a resonant <span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">basso profundo</span> and more in anger than sorrow—the Don’s repentance for the dissolute ways of his life;
                  the villain refuses to repent, and he is finally engulfed in the flames of hell, as
                  his servant, Leporello, looks on in terror. In the final scene of <em>Manfred</em>, a larger-than-life, indeed otherworldly, male figure, identified as the Spirit,
                  similarly booms forth his implacable taunts and demands, beckoning Manfred to his
                  final doom, while the Abbot looks on, fearful for Manfred (though not, he claims,
                  for himself).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Despite the obvious and significant similarity between the final scene in Manfred
                           and the Commendatore scene in Don Giovanni, I have found only one reference to it,
                           in Schumann by Eric Frederick Jensen (50). Whether Byron had ever seen Mozart’s Don
                           Giovanni is an open question. The short answer is probably not. Don Giovanni, which
                           premiered in Prague in 1787 and had its Italian premier in Rome in 1811, did not receive
                           its London premiere until 1817, after Byron had left England, and was not performed
                           in Venice until 1833 (strange though that seems for an enormously popular opera that,
                           in the f…</span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Thus, both scenes involve three male figures. At the center is the work’s hero (or
               anti-hero), a charismatic aristocrat, a sexual taboo breaker (if not actual criminal)
               who remains fearless and unrepentant in his final hour. Next is his antagonist, a
               supernaturally powerful, older, punishing, or at least challenging, male figure who
               demands something of the hero: the Commendatore demands the Don’s repentance; the
               Spirit demands that Manfred go with him. In <em>Manfred</em>, too, there is a plea for the hero’s repentance, which comes from the Abbot in Act
               III, scene one. The third man present in the scene—Leporello in the opera, the Abbot
               in <em>Manfred</em>—is an onlooker; lacking the stature both of the hero and of the supernatural figure,
               he is merely a human being with normal responses, registering, like the chorus in
               a Greek tragedy, the terrors that the audience must feel.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In addition to the male triangle that structures these scenes, they share other features.
                  Both heroes verbally communicate death’s taking hold of them: Don Giovanni cries out,
                  “What strange tremor now assails my spirits!”;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Da qual tremore insolito sento assalir gli spiriti! Quotations from Don Giovanni are
                           from the libretto accompanying the CD recording by the Théâtre National de l’Opéra,
                           Paris (CBS, 1979), English translation by Lionel Salter. I have occasionally provided
                           a more literal translation than Salter’s, which was made to correspond to the Italian
                           verse line.</span></div>
                  </div> Manfred observes, “I feel my soul / Is ebbing from me” (III.iv.99-100). Death-related
                  coldness is invoked in both scenes: when Don Giovanni takes the Statue’s hand, he
                  shudderingly exclaims, “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">Che gelo e questo mai</span>!”; the Abbot, taking the hand of Manfred in his dying moment, observes: “Cold—cold—even
                  to the heart” (III.iv.149). Thus, too, a male handclasp occurs in both scenes. Both
                  works culminate in a terrifying glimpse of the afterlife, and both heroes (or are
                  they villains?) expire supernaturally: that is, from no known bodily cause. Also worth
                  considering is the Abbot’s reference to the Spirit as one of Manfred’s “guests” (III.iii.73).
                  While Manfred does not appear to extend an invitation to the Spirit in the way that
                  Don Giovanni famously invites his “stone guest” to dinner, the verbal echo is resonant:
                  the protagonists’ fate is one they themselves invite—one might say desire.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>“Stone guest,” the common epithet for the statue in Don Giovanni, derives from El
                           burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso
                           de Molina that was the source for later Don Juan dramatizations.</span></div>
                  </div>
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>But the most striking thematic and dramatic similarity between the final scenes of
               the opera and the play is their emphasis on the hero’s defiance in the face of supernatural
               threats and conventional moral or religious claims. It’s true that, consistent with
               the original story and audience tastes, the opera affirms Christian beliefs by presenting
               a horrified and groaning Don Giovanni swallowed by the terrors of hell, followed by
               the happy moralizing of the finale (“heaven has avenged us all,” etc.). In this respect
               the opera presents a distinct contrast with <em>Manfred</em>, whose hero finds it “not so difficult to die,” having denied all supernatural powers,
               infernal or otherwise, external to the human mind (III.iv.151). Yet the brief display
               of hellfire at the end of the Commendatore scene (often an occasion for hokey stage
               effects) feels like an afterthought compared to the thrilling power of the scene leading
               up to that point. Dramatically and musically, the force of the scene derives from
               the sudden appearance of the Commendatore, his threatening commands, and the defiance
               of a fearless man who, even in the face of death and the terrors of hell, refuses
               to repent:</p>

            <p> The final “No!” is not so much sung as shouted from the very depths of the baritone’s

            <p>That the ending of <em>Don Giovanni</em>—in other words, the classic ending of the Don Juan dramatizations ubiquitous in early
               nineteenth-century Europe—should bear such striking resemblance to the ending of <em>Manfred</em> might surprise us. After all, in all other respects, as I noted at the outset, the
               tone and content of <em>Manfred</em> could not seem more unrelated to that of Mozart’s <span class="foreign" xml:lang="it" lang="it">dramma giocosa</span>. Yet since Byron did, as we well know, write a poem utilizing the Don Juan story,
               observing the classic Don Juan ending in <em>Manfred</em> immediately suggests the possibility of a connection between Byron’s metaphysical
               drama and his mock epic. The line of connection may be easily discovered by recalling
               the source for the many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century, French, English, and
               Italian adaptations of the Don Juan tale, <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="es" lang="es">El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra</span></em>, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso de Molina. As its two-part title suggests,
               Tirso’s drama was very likely an engrafting of two legends: the escapades of a libertine
               and the story of a statue who comes to dinner and drags the sinner off to hell (Waxman
               189). Thus, it’s easy to see how Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> bears reference to the first part of Tirso’s play, and <em>Manfred</em> to the denouement, which the uncompleted <em>Don Juan</em> does not arrive at (though Candace Tate, in her psychological reading of <em>Don Juan</em>, suggests that Juan’s encounter with the Black Friar, aka the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke,
               at the close of the sixteenth canto, is indeed relatable to Tirso’s and Mozart’s scene
               of the avenging stone guest [147]). But the material common to <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em>, as highlighted by their connection to the Don Juan story, is found not merely in
               the way one work corresponds to the first part of the Don’s adventures, the other
               to his demise, but in fact is found more broadly throughout both works.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To begin with, the heroes of both poems, indeed the poems themselves, represent challenges
                  to authority, religious authority in particular. This is something both works have
                  in common with the Don Juan source material. Tirso’s title identifies Don Juan not
                  as a lover, but as a <span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">burlador</span>, a word commonly connoting “seducer,” but, as its etymological relation to burlesque
                  suggests, more literally meaning mocker or trickster. Tirso de Molina was a monk,
                  and his play was intended to ridicule the hypocritical, cheaply purchased repentance
                  that allowed wealthy immoralists to misbehave. Later interpretations have seen in
                  Don Juan’s libertinism and mockery a challenge not merely to a corrupt clergy, but
                  to the taboos themselves, and in some cases to religion itself, when set against human
                  drives and rational understanding. Now, the mocking element is certainly just as strong
                  in <em>Manfred</em> as it is in <em>Don Juan</em>; both works take up cudgels against “cant moral” and “cant religious” (<em>The Works of Lord Byron</em>, V:542). While a comic turn to the satire is overt in <em>Don Juan</em>, the burlesque element of the original version of the third act of <em>Manfred </em><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           sometime between 25 April and 5 May 1817. It is this revised third act that has been
                           transmitted through all printed editions of the poem. For the original version of

               <p>But beyond the poems’ challenges to religion and traditional mores, reading <em>Manfred</em> in its relation to <em>Don Juan</em> illuminates significant embedded themes that they share. Such a reading begins with
                  the observation that the two-part structure of Tirso’s drama, of its various literary
                  and operatic descendants, and of <em>Manfred</em> is noticeably gendered: women define the content of the first part of the narrative,
                  men the second.

                           vocal element. A comment posted at a YouTube recording of the Commendatore scene goes
                           as follows: “There is not a tenor or soprano on that stage. It’s two basses and a

                  </div> The life of taboo-breaking pleasure focuses on women (or a woman); the scene of fear,

                  law of the father? A scene of male bonding? However one interprets it, the legendary
                  Don Juan and Manfred, the first part of whose stories centers on heteroerotics, reach
                  their tragic apotheosis in an all-male world. (Here, by the way, is a distinct departure
                  from <em>Faust</em>, which bears certain resemblances to the legend of Don Juan as it does to <em>Manfred</em>, but which culminates in the lure of the Eternal Feminine.)</p>

               <p>The contest between men, the agon of son and father, is implicit throughout Don Juan’s
                  escapades with women, not just in the final scene of reckoning. While women are the
                  Don’s obvious target, his misbehavior with them mocks, in the most direct and personal
                  way, the authority of their lovers, husbands, and fathers, the power and laws of men.

                           the Don Juan story, women are the immediate objects of the hero’s desire, but the
                           ultimate targets of his exploits are men, the men who hold the women in their keeping:
                           fathers, husbands, fiancés . . . [W]omen are prizes at stake in a struggle for power
                           between men” (94-95).</span></div>
                  </div>Thus, in <em>Don Juan</em>, Juan’s lovemaking first cuckolds an old husband, then undermines a tyrant father,
                  then outwits a sultan, and then takes aim at the English country gentry. Peter Manning,
                  discussing “the ubiquitous and decisive presence of fathers, father figures, and ancestors”
                  in <em>Manfred</em>, observes that “Byron’s pattern of setting Manfred in relief against other male figures
                  culminates in the soliloquy which opens the last scene of the play” (906). In that
                  soliloquy, Manfred recalls standing “within the Coliseum’s wall, / ‘Midst the chief
                  relics of almighty Rome” (III.iv.10-1):
                  <blockquote class="quote">

                     </div>
                  </blockquote>As Manning explains: “The legendary Caesars, mentioned three times in the first thirty
                  lines of the soliloquy, are the inclusive symbol of the masculine authority to which
                  [Manfred] now bows” (907). But the admiration is tinged with ambivalence, as Manfred
                  derides the power of these revered fathers, noting that “Caesar’s chambers, and the
                  Augustan halls, / Grovel on earth in indistinct decay” (IV.iv.29-30). While a pleasing
                  interpretation of the characters and behavior of Manfred and Juan (as of the legendary
                  Don Juan) is that they represent an attack on the Ancien Régime, we do not forget
                  that these characters are themselves aristocrats and are empowered and admired on
                  account of that.

                           description: “a strangely ambiguous titanism . . . Does he belong fully to the society
                           of the Ancien Régime, as its most ruthless representative, or do we detect in him,

                  as far back as his early fragment “When to their airy hall my fathers’ voice” (an
                  anxiety, incidentally, equaled if not surpassed by Mozart’s towards his father, which

                  in <em>Manfred</em>—“the deadliest sin to love as we have loved”—is not incest but homosexuality (II.iv.123).

                           secret of Byron’s life lay somewhere within the area of homosexuality” (Lord Byron’s
                           Marriage, as discussed in Elfenbein, 39). We recall, too, that the first appearance
                           of Astarte in the poem comes when a male spirit (“him, / Who is most powerful of ye”)

                  mine”), and passive causation (“withered”). One thing they do not state clearly, if
                  at all, is that Astarte killed herself. The expression “to break someone’s heart”
                  typically means not the sharing of a mutual love but, rather, the opposite: rejection,
                  lack of mutual feeling. In fact, the lines seem to suggest that something in Manfred’s
                  “heart,” in his inmost being, caused his lover’s heart (i.e., her love, her life)
                  to wither. Perhaps it was this essential, hidden truth of Manfred’s nature—a truth
                  that dare not speak its name—that was fatal to his female lover and caused her to
                  disappear from his life. Certainly, Manfred’s self-accusations heard in the Incantation
                  seem a bit excessive for, even incongruent with, one who merely loved not wisely but
                  too well. What does his “cold breast and serpent smile” (I.i.242), his “shut soul’s
                  hypocrisy” (I.i.245), or his “brotherhood of Cain” (I.i.249) have to do with Manfred’s
                  avowedly passionate and profound love for Astarte? Cain, of course, was the original
                  slayer of a man more favored by the all-powerful, law-giving father. Such anxiety
                  about masculine identity and power, perhaps underlying Manfred’s sense of hypocrisy
                  or sinfulness, was neither caused, nor apparently could be cured, by the love of a
                  good woman.</p>

                  as Don Juan, they are certainly also a recurrent motif in the poetry of Lord Byron.
                  From 
                  “Maid of Athens, Ere We Part”
                   to 
                  “So, We’ll go No More A-Roving,”
                   Byron’s lyrics repeatedly suggest that pleasure, when it comes to his relationships
                  with women, is ever at its lips bidding adieu.

                           fare thee well, deceitful maid” (
                           “To—”

                           “Oh! had my Fate been join’d with thine”
                           ], 1807); “Your lover should bid you a lasting adieu” (
                           “To Anne,”
                           1807); “Mary, adieu! I must away” (
                           “Well! Thou Art Happy,”
                           1808); “In flight I shall be surely wise / Escaping from temptation’s snare” (
                           “The Farewell to a Lady,”
                           1808); “And though I bid thee now farewell” (
                           “To Florence,”
                           1809); 
                           “On Parting”

                  </div> While Byron is hardly the only poet to have made sweet sorrow of lovers’ farewells,
                  in Byron’s case, not only his poetry but his life was a perpetual illustration of
                  the principle he confided to Hobhouse within three months after beginning his love
                  affair with Teresa Guiccioli: “that a man should not consume his life at the side
                  and on the bosom—of a woman” (<em>BLJ</em> VI:214). Thus, while Manfred self-identifies as the abandoned lover, and readers identify
                  Don Juan as the one who abandons, the outcome for these heroes—one might say the desired
                  outcome— is the same.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Citing several references to Manfred’s preoccupation with male power—with serving
               and swaying—and to his alternating guilt over inadequacy and pride in triumph, Manning
               concludes that “it may seem strange to suggest that one current of the action is Manfred’s
               struggle to earn a place in the world of men” (906). Strange or not, that assessment
               certainly rings true. About 
               “La Belle Dame Sans Merci,”
               Karen Swann observed: “We tend to assume that the knight sincerely wants to capture
               the lady. . . . Focusing on his loss, we fail to notice what he gains at the end of
               the poem—accession to an all-male community. Could this community, and not the ideal
               or even the fatal woman, be the true object of his quest?”(90). Focusing on what Manfred
               identifies as his life-consuming loss, we may fail to notice that his identity is
               achieved not as a woman’s lover, but in the fantasy of a triumphant contest with powerful
               male authority figures. In discussing Romantic triangles, Sonia Hofkosh noted that
               the “male relation, like the masculine subject, is the primary and prior one; the
               feminine, empty or derivative,” quoting Mary Jacobus’ explanation that “this triangle
               characteristically invokes its third (female) term only in the interests of the original
               rivalry and works finally to get rid of the woman” (Hofkosh 102; Jacobus 119). The
               tales of both Don Juan and Manfred do indeed “get rid of the woman,” and these heroes
               achieve their end by enormous self-assertion amidst powerful male figures. We might
               note in passing that the word “love” or “loved” occurs nineteen times in <em>Manfred</em> while “power” or “powers” occurs thirty-nine times.</p>
            <p>Laurence Lipking has quipped that the “true moral of <em>Don Giovanni</em>, as a libertine might see it, seems far from instructive: raping a daughter is permissible,
               so long as one does not also kill her father” (46). In fact, the heterosexual misbehavior
               of the legendary Don Juan should be considered in light of the denouement: an anxiety
               dream about male identity, performance, and the laws and power of men. Although Byron
               presents different surface treatments of this theme in <em>Manfred</em> and <em>Don Juan</em>, its outline is visible in both works.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In this paper <em>Don Juan</em>, italicized, refers to Byron’s poem, pronounced Don Joo-an, while when not italicized,
               Don Juan should be read as Don Hwan, the protagonist of numerous European works. The
               relation of the character of Manfred to that of Don Juan, despite their antithetical
               personalities and life stories, has not gone entirely unnoticed. Romantic literary
               and musical interpretations of Don Juan in fact show more of an influence of <em>Manfred</em> than of <em>Don Juan</em>. Thus, Svetlana Klimova points out that the hero of A. K. Tolstoy’s <em>Don Juan</em> (1862) “is much closer to the ‘classical Byronic hero’ than to Byron’s Don Juan .
               . . [and] reveals Tolstoy’s debt not only to Goethe . . . but also to Byron’s <em>Manfred</em>” (344). Thomas Gray, writing about the figure of Don Giovanni in Romantic music,
               notes “the overwhelming impact of Lord Byron’s literary oeuvre and persona on the
               collective cultural imagination of Europe in the 1810s and twenties,” but offers the
               caveat that Byron’s “own epic-satiric poem, <em>Don Juan</em>,” is “one of his few major works entirely unsusceptible to dramatic or operatic adaptation.”
               Rather, Gray explains, the “unbridled, hedonistic exuberance” of Mozart’s character”
               is in Romantic works tempered “with new Byronic shadows . . . is suffused with a newly
               Romantic chiaroscuro,” so that Richard Wagner “carries the brooding Byronization of
               the Don Juan figure to an extreme in the person of the Flying Dutchman, the doom-driven
               spectral seducer in search of redemptive quiescence” (78-79).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><span class="noteBody">Despite the obvious and significant similarity between the final scene in <em>Manfred</em> and the Commendatore scene in <em>Don Giovanni</em>, I have found only one reference to it, in <em>Schumann</em> by Eric Frederick Jensen (50). Whether Byron had ever seen Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em> is an open question. The short answer is probably not. <em>Don Giovanni</em>, which premiered in Prague in 1787 and had its Italian premier in Rome in 1811, did
               not receive its London premiere until 1817, after Byron had left England, and was
               not performed in Venice until 1833 (strange though that seems for an enormously popular
               opera that, in the first fifty years since its premiere “made its way all around Europe,
               and as far afield as New York and Calcutta”) (Parakilas 253). That said, Byron revised
               Act III of <em>Manfred</em> in April and May of 1817, during which time he had left Venice for Rome, traveling
               through Ferrara, Bologna, and Florence. Regular operagoer that he was, he could possibly
               have caught a performance of Mozart’s opera while on his travels. It should be noted
               that the first version of Act III, written in Switzerland, has none of the <em>Don Giovanni</em> elements: no Abbott or Spirit, no scene of Manfred’s repeated rejection and denial.
               Regardless of whether Byron had seen a complete production in a major opera house
               of Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em>, he would undoubtedly have been familiar with some version of the statue scene, elements
               of which found its way into <em>Manfred</em>’s revised third act. For one thing, Da Ponte’s libretto borrowed heavily from a libretto
               by Giovanni Bertati, which was used in two other <em>Don Giovanni</em> operas frequently performed in Venice. Furthermore, the ubiquity, both in England
               prior to Byron’s departure and in Italy, of theatrical, balletic, and amateur operatic
               performances of scenes from Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em>, as well as of other Don Juan dramas, make it highly unlikely that Byron would not,
               at some point, have seen something very much like the Commendatore scene familiar
               to most of us through Mozart’s opera. As Byron noted of the hero of <em>Don Juan</em>, he is known to us from “plays in five, and operas in three acts,” and “We all have
               seen him in the pantomime / Sent to the devil, somewhat ere his time” (I: ll. 1620,
               7-8).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               Don Juan dramatizations.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">After John Gifford criticized the original third act of <em>Manfred</em>, Byron rewrote it sometime between 25 April and 5 May 1817. It is this revised third
               act that has been transmitted through all printed editions of the poem. For the original
               version of Act III, see <em>CPW </em>IV.67-71.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">In <em>Don Giovanni</em>, the intense maleness of the Commendatore scene, following the opera’s series of
               girl-chasing episodes, is hard not to notice, if only with respect to the vocal element.
               A comment posted at a YouTube recording of the Commendatore scene goes as follows:
               “There is not a tenor or soprano on that stage. It’s two basses and a baritone going
               at it. I love this. . . .”</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><span class="noteBody">As Marina Warner points out: “In <em>Don Giovanni</em>, as in earlier, Spanish versions of the Don Juan story, women are the immediate objects
               of the hero’s desire, but the ultimate targets of his exploits are men, the men who
               hold the women in their keeping: fathers, husbands, fiancés . . . [W]omen are prizes
               at stake in a struggle for power between men” (94-95).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">8. </span><span class="noteBody">Bernard Williams writes: “[Don Giovanni] is dependent, dialectically, on social institutions
               which he rejects—wealth, and the liberty given by class.” Williams quotes Ernst Bloch’s
               description: “a strangely ambiguous titanism . . . Does he belong fully to the society
               of the Ancien Régime, as its most ruthless representative, or do we detect in him,
               in the erotic explosive rebellion, part of a return to nature?” (113).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9. </span><span class="noteBody">On Mozart’s ambivalence towards the towering figure of his father and its influence
               on <em>Don Giovanni</em>, the final scene in particular, see Peter Gay, “The Father’s Revenge.” See also Maynard
               Solomon, <em>Mozart: A Life</em>, p. 246.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">10. </span><span class="noteBody">See Crompton, pages 369-70, notes. G. Wilson Knight considered the “incest motif”
               in Byron’s life “a red herring” and “that a more important and more consistently motivating
               secret of Byron’s life lay somewhere within the area of homosexuality” (<em>Lord Byron’s Marriage</em>, as discussed in Elfenbein, 39). We recall, too, that the first appearance of Astarte
               in the poem comes when a male spirit (“him, / Who is most powerful of ye”) appears
               “in the shape of a beautiful female figure” (I.i.185<em>ff</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11. </span><span class="noteBody">For example, Jerome McGann notes that “some have argued that Byron deliberately left
               the nature of [his secret] sin vague and mystified. But this is by no means the case,
               as various early readers show. Reviewing the play in <em>Blackwood’s</em>, John Wilson . . . had no difficulty at all in understanding Manfred’s guilt: ‘.
               . . Manfred had conceived a mad and insane passion for his sister, named Astarte,
               and . . . she had, in consequence of their mutual guilt, committed suicide.’ The play
               is not at all equivocal on these matters” (McGann 15). Elsewhere, however, McGann
               has written, “Astarte of the play is not Augusta . . . [it] is Manfred’s Fate understood
               as his destined and inmost Self, his epipsyche,” thus veering away from “not at all
               equivocal” with respect to the play’s references to incest and his lover’s suicide
               (<em>CPW</em> 4:467).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               histories” for Astarte’s death, and that “[t]he issue is not what happened, but what
               [Manfred] thinks happened. According to him the cause of her death was not incest
               but her gazing upon his heart” (39).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">13. </span><span class="noteBody">The following lines and titles are among Byron’s numerous farewells to women: “Then
               fare thee well, deceitful maid” (
               “To—”
               [
               “Oh! had my Fate been join’d with thine”
               ], 1807); “Your lover should bid you a lasting adieu” (
               “To Anne,”
               1807); “Mary, adieu! I must away” (
               “Well! Thou Art Happy,”
               1808); “In flight I shall be surely wise / Escaping from temptation’s snare” (
               “The Farewell to a Lady,”
               1808); “And though I bid thee now farewell” (
               “To Florence,”
               1809); 
               “On Parting”
               (1811); “Adieu, dear maid!” (
               “Love and Gold,”
               1813); “I only know we loved in vain— / I only feel—Farewell!—Farewell!" (
               “Farewell! If ever fondest prayer,”
               1813); 
               “Fare Thee Well!”
               (1816). The subject of love’s passing is a related topic: 
               “Love’s Last Adieu”
               (1807); 
               “They Say That Hope Is Happiness”
               (1814); 
               “Could Love for ever”
               (1819); 
               “January 22<span class="sup">nd</span> 1824. Messalonghi. On this day I complete my thirty-sixth year.”
