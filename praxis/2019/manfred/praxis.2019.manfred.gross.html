            <p>The writers and political figures Byron most admired—Alexander Pope, Robert Burns,
               Walter Scott, Benjamin Franklin, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and George Washington—were
               all Freemasons. He admired them because of their talent and their moral outlook. Byron
               praises Franklin for his letters on religious toleration, for example, and holds up
               Washington as an example of self-effacing civic leadership in “Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte”
               (1814). Yet Byron’s relationship to the craft was at least as complex as Benjamin
               Franklin’s. The unlikely name Franklin adopted of “Silence Dogood” (Van Doren 21)
               concealed Benjamin Franklin’s more lascivious and libertine ways: his erstwhile marriage
               to Deborah Read (Van Doren 50), his illegitimate son William (Van Doren 91), pornography
               collection, sexual advice column, and 16-day visit to the notorious Sir Francis Dashwood
               in October 1772, when Dashwood led the Hellfire club, or Medmenham monks (Van Doren
               437). Franklin conversed with Byron’s grandfather about the Patagonians (Van Doren
               357). Unlike Franklin, however, Byron enjoyed making himself appear worse than he
               was, quite the opposite conduct of a Mason. Byron inherited his interest in masonry
               from William Byron, the fifth Baron Byron (1722-1798), the uncle of George Gordon
               (our poet) and the one who shot Mary Chaworth’s father. That such a man could also
               become master of a Masonic lodge proved to some the depths to which masonry had fallen
               (Bullock 11). Nevertheless, this same uncle of George Gordon, the Sixth Lord, defended
               a man tortured by the Portuguese inquisition and took principled stands on political
               issues of the day (Walker 126). Appearances could be deceiving. Man was “Half-dust,
               half-deity,” to use the language of <em>Manfred</em>, alike unfit “to sink or soar” (I.ii.40-1).</p>
            <p>In several quotations from “The Vision of Judgment,” Byron treated masonry facetiously,
               mocking the back stairs diplomacy and mysterious mumbo jumbo connected with its practitioners.
               As a young man, Byron staged lodge-like fraternal meetings at Newstead Abbey in imitation
               of Sir Francis Dashwood’s Medmenham Monks, where he would sip wine from a human skull,
               a ritual specified in the Royal Arch ceremony and several Carbonari rituals, and one
               which may well have been practiced by his great-uncle who built Folly Castle at Newstead.
               (Moore 142). Charles Skinner Matthews noted how he kept a wolf and a bear at Newstead,
               in separate rooms, and his friends dressed in monkish masquerade (Moore 142). Yet
               this appearance of wickedness concealed a passion for moral self-improvement: the
               villainous libertine and notorious womanizer, seducing the wives of his close friends,
               such as James Webster, joined a Masonic lodge in Ravenna and became the unlikely patron
               of Italian and Greek independence. Masonry seems a strange master ritual for Manfred,
               whose name connects him to the gothic novel, <em>The Castle of Otranto</em>, but perhaps it is not so strange after all. Which side will Manfred join after evoking
               three sets of spirits, the Witch of the Alps, and the Abbot? Good or evil? What I
               hope to show in the pages that follow is that the play neither rejects Western dualism
               (man/nature; good/evil) nor critiques radical autonomy, but rather embraces Freemasonry
               as a unifying national and trans-national force, a vehicle for social improvement
               relatively free of cant.</p>
            <p>It might be helpful to begin with a definition: “Freemasonry is a fraternal organization
               that purports to ‘make good men better’ by teaching them a number of moral precepts
               through a complex and secret brand of symbolism and ritual” (Gunn 247). If Freemasonry
               is a form of theatre, then there is a theatrical aspect to Masonic initiation, alluded
               to explicitly in Act 3, that might be connected to Byron’s forays into mental theatre
               in <em>Manfred</em>. In Act 3 of <em>Manfred</em>, for example, the hero calls for a “casket” and a “key” (objects used in Masonic
               ceremonies) (III.i.5), but rejects magic, Manichaeism, the occult, the Witch of the
               Alps, and Arimanes; he accepts Freemasonry, which embraces all religions, repudiating
               the Abbot with his narrow notions of doctrinal religion, and returns his body to Nature
               by propelling himself off a mountain.</p>
            <p>Washington, Franklin, and other Enlightenment figures submitted themselves to a theatrics
               of self-improvement, as did Byron with the Carbonari in 1818. In most Masonic initiation
               ceremonies, such as Washington’s, the inductee is led into a room blindfolded (Hodapp
               23). He utters a catechism. At the end of the ceremony, the blindfold is removed.
               Light symbolizes enlightenment. Various symbols are learned as mnemonic devices of
               the Mason’s rebirth. The tracing board and knotted rope become symbols of thorny problems
               that must be untied; the drinking from the skull of Christ, in the 32-degree ceremony,
               all demonstrate the power of moral edification through gesture, movement, and ceremony.</p>
            <p>According to the ceremony involved in becoming a Master Mason, the death of Hiram
               Abif, a murdered architect who helped build the temple of Solomon, is ritually re-enacted
               through the act of initiation. He knew the secret Mason’s word, died to be reborn,
               and his death reminds us that Freemasonry is connected with building not only pyramids,
               nations, and religions, but also moral human beings (Bullock 11). As Hiram prayed
               daily for guidance from his God before drawing the designs that would set the craftsmen
               to work, so must we. Each Master Mason becomes his own architect. Each supervises
               the building of that temple not made by hands, but by Yahweh (“I am that I am,” as
               he is known in the Hebrew bible). In <em>Manfred</em>, the hero actually repeats the Old Testament statement, “I am that I am” (<em>Exodus</em> 3:14), which has been adopted “in the higher Degrees of the York, American, and several
               other Rites” (Mackey II:326): </p>

            <p> Like Freemasons themselves, each unique Masonic apron (even Washington’s or Burns’s)
               is a testament to its owner’s belief in a life well lived in brotherhood with other
               like-minded men. Freemasonry is not a religion; the fraternity of Freemasonry embraces
               all religions. Alexander Pope, perhaps the greatest poetic influence on Byron and
               the figure he most often defended, spoke as an enlightened Mason when he published
               <em>The Temple of Fame</em> in 1715. He refers to Egyptian temples, suggesting that their columns, walls and
               altars exemplified architectural perfection. In the “Universal Prayer, completed in
               1738, Pope suggests ethical views resembling those of Freemasonry. He maintains that
               humans utilize reason to develop their spiritual temples and are benevolent, just,
               and tolerant in their relations with others” (Weisberger 52). “Before the conclusion
               of the Master Mason Degree, the candidate was told to seek the lost word during his
               travels. Known only by Hiram, this word was associated with the Attributes of Deity.
               Symbolized by the All-Seeing Eye, the Supreme Architect was described to the candidate
               as being Omnipotent and Omniscient” (Weisberger 34). Traditionally, the movement of
               the mason is from darkness to light, symbolized by the blind-fold he wears and that
               is dramatically removed. “After ending his travels, the candidate was given an oath,
               had his blindfold removed, and was provided with light and with the teachings of the
               first degree. The candidate was informed that the lodge represents Nature and society
               and that his efforts should be devoted to understanding their laws and operations”
               (Weisberger 33). According to Margaret Jacob, “American orators spoke of the Copernican
               sun that unified and Enlightened’ the universe and bound it together `by the powerfully
               attractive influence of the Divine Principle of Friendship, Affection and Knowledge’”
               (146). Weisberger notes how “The Fellow Craft Degree especially embodied Enlightenment
               concepts and revealed the commitment of Modern Masonry to education. The Master of
               the lodge told the candidate that he was a fellow of the Masonic society, was expected
               to be benevolent and virtuous, and was to follow the light of knowledge” (34).</p>
            <p><em>Manfred</em> reverses the conventional direction of the Masonic initiative. Manfred goes from
               light toward darkness and finally toward self-oblivion, as in Beckford’s <em>Vathek</em>, where Solomon’s temple becomes “Soliman’s” (Beckford 247-49). I see this not as
               a critique of “the radical autonomy of the Byronic hero in this dramatic poem’s exploration
               of isolation, incest, and irreligion” (Dan White, Broadview, back jacket) or even
               as a celebration of it (Hubbell 17), but more as a restaging of Masonic ceremonies
               of self-improvement in and through nature (something like Byron’s pantheistic poem,
               “The Prayer of Nature”) (Moore 89). The nature Byron alludes to in <em>Manfred</em>, however, is a nature radically un-Wordsworthian, as Timothy Morton has shown (Morton
               158, 161). The problem with ecological readings of Byron’s play, beyond their presentism,
               however, is that they do not account for the direct engagement with forms of religion
               (Christian, Muslim, and Persian). Religion, after all, and the religious injunction
               against suicide, is what Byron’s mental drama is also, if not only, about. Here Madame
               de Staël’s “Essay on Suicide” might be more helpful than Hegel’s “Unhappy Consciousness,”
               especially since Madame de Staël was living across Lake Leman the very summer Byron
               wrote the play and Byron met her on more than one occasion (Morton 159). “She has
               made Copet as agreeable as society and talent can make any place on earth,” he told
               John Murray (Marchand 2:659). Even <em>Hamlet</em>, the work from which Byron borrows the play’s epigraph, might be more useful than
               either Hegel or De Staël, for it directly raises the existential question of whether
               to be or not to be, and how.</p>
            <p>Manfred sees beyond the narrow world of simple-minded friends who console him, the
               Chamois Hunter and the Abbot. “There is more in the world than is dreamt of in your
               philosophy,” the epigraph reads, echoing Hamlet’s address to Horatio. Building on
               Alan Richardson’s careful tracing of Byron’s debts to <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Paradise Lost</em> in <em>Manfred</em>, I would like to argue for <em>Hamlet</em>’s relevance, since <em>Hamlet</em> treats the ghostly presence of a murdered father and explores how ghosts influence
               the hero (<em>Mental Theatre</em> 48, 56). <em>Manfred</em>’s counterpart to Hamlet’s father is Count Sigismund. The theme of magic recalls Richard
               Burton’s <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em>, one of Byron’s favorite books, and one that deals directly with the connection between
               spirits, melancholia, and the act of reading (Moore 81). <em>Manfred</em> thus shares alchemical and Rosicrucian, not to say Masonic, interests with the seventeenth
               century Scottish spy and alchemist, Robert Moray; Alexander Pope’s “Rape of the Lock”
               (1712); Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire’s Rosicrucian novel, <em>The Sylph </em>(1779), which quotes Pope in its epigraph and title; Mozart’s <em>The Magic Flute </em>(1791); William Godwin’s <em>St. Leon, or the Rosicrucian </em>(1799); Percy Shelley’s <em>St. Irvyne, or the Rosicrucian </em>(1810), which was influenced by Godwin’s novel; and the opening scene from Goethe’s
               <em>Faust, </em>which was developed in three sections until finally published in 1806 (1772-1775;
               1790; 1806). <em>Manfred</em> is very much a poem or play of its day and reflects these literary works that treat
               the importance of Freemasonry as a revolutionary political movement.</p>
            <p>In 1819-1820, when he became involved with the Masonic lodge of the “’mericani” and
               the Carbonari (Eisler 670), Byron embarked on a course of Masonic “do-gooding,” which
               had begun in the House of Lords, continued in Italy, and ended in Greece (Gross, “A
               Poetic Revolutionary” 217, 227). At this time, Byron began to deliberately misspell
               his publisher’s name, changing Murray to Moray. The allusion, unremarked upon in footnotes
               to Leslie Marchand’s letters, can be traced thanks to David Stevenson’s <em>The Origins of Freemasonry</em>. Byron’s deliberate misspelling of Murray’s name most likely alludes to Robert Moray,
               Scottish occultist, diplomat, and spy for Charles II (1667), the royal family for
               whom Byron’s ancestors had fought. Moray is a Scottish Faust. As Stevenson notes,
               his interest in Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, and symbols typifies the sort
               of late Renaissance influences which had given birth to Scottish freemasonry in the
               era of William Schaw (102). This era folded occult studies into Christianity and recognized
               that esoteric knowledge could augment and explain Christian scripture, though its
               meanings should not be made accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>Robert Moray reads the pentacle as an anagram spelling “Agapa” (Stevenson 173). “This
               character of Hyeroglyphick, which I call agapa, is famous amongst the Egyptians and
               Grecians,” Moray explains. “For the Egyptian part of it I remit you to Kircherus books…The
               Greekes accounted it the symbol of health and tranquillity.” Having explained “Agapa’s
               relationship to the pentacle, Moray then used that word as the basis for an acrostic
               which he wrote out for his correspondent: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Agapa (“he loves” or “love thou”) </div>
                  <div class="l">Gnothi (an imperative “know” or “gain knowledge”) </div>
                  <div class="l">Anecho (“remain constant” or “endure”) </div>
                  <div class="l">Pisteuei (“he puts his trust in” or “he has faith in”) </div>
                  <div class="l">Apecho (“Abstain” or “exercise restraint”)” (Stevenson 174) </div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Moray thought that his pentacle was a sign of health that exhibited God’s love (Agapa,
               or Agape). Henry Cornelius Agrippa illustrated the pentacle with five Greek letters
               round it in his famous <em>De Occulta Philosophia</em> of 1533. That Manfred would also make use of imagery in his evocation of the spirits
               (Astarte as star) and in the opening of Act III seems fitting, since Manfred connects
               Astarte to another five-letter word, “Kalon” (III.i.13). The same summer that Byron
               started <em>Manfred</em>, Mary Shelley began <em>Frankenstein</em>, which makes much use of the Faust legend, Rosicrucianism, Agrippa’s writings, and
               other aspects of the occult explored by her father’s Rosicrucian novel, <em>St. Leon</em> (1799).</p>
            <p>For Masons, the pentagram recalls the five points of fellowship: <span class="quote">‘[T]he figure five, often expressed as a pentacle, was widely regarded symbolically
                  as referring to man by depicting his five extremities (head and limbs), and could
                  also stand for the five wounds of Christ—connotations that may well account for the
                  fact that the points of fellowship in freemasonry number five… Moray expounded the
                  pentacle as a personal symbol standing for <em>Agapa</em>, but he also accepted other levels of symbolic meaning, as when it was equated to
                  stars. (Stevenson 175)’</span> Moray thought that his pentacle was a sign of health that exhibited God’s love (Agapa,
               or Agape), but there is nothing healthy about Astarte, the star that rules Manfred’s
               destiny. Astarte, “thy star,” appears to Manfred in the form of a pentagram, a star
               with occult significance (I.i.134). The reference is ambiguous: the stage direction
               tell us that “a star is seen at the darker end of the gallery” (51); we do not know
               by whom (the audience, Manfred?) and later we are told that “The star which rules
               thy destiny / Was ruled, ere earth began, by me” (a spirit, that rules a star) (I.i.110-1).
               Inverted, this pentagram, connected with Astarte, can be an Eden, in pre-lapsarian
               terms, or hell, a sign of the devil. The “lovelier star,” the seventh spirit’s words
               (which rules over this spirit of Astarte), becomes a comet and then the “monster of
               the upper sky!” (I.i.115-23). In Moray’s life “the star is Moray’s dead wife, now
               in the heavens, the seal a declaration of his continuing love” (Stevenson 178).</p>
            <p>In Goethe’s <em>Faust, </em>a folded pentagram allowed Mephistopheles to enter and leave Faust’s study, in order
               to tempt him (I.1063-70). Like the five-lettered “Agape,” Astarte also works numerically.
               Both Astarte and Augusta are words with 7 letters (IV:1.1.110-31), a number with magical
               significance (“Seven”). Though Manfred naively assumes that all seven spirits are
               under his control, he comes to realize that six of the male spirits—Manfred addresses
               each as “him”—are subordinate to the seventh, that of woman; in fact, “mountain” and
               “night” are added as spirits for no other reason than to complete the anagram of woman
               (White and Beazel 18-9). The first letters of “ocean, air, night, mountains, winds”
               when re-arranged spell “w-o-m-a-n,” and “earth” and “star” are left over. Woman’s
               power is shown by the fact that the Witch of the Alps bargains with Manfred’s soul
               to lead him to Arimanes: not unlike Caliph Vathek’s arrival at the Hall of Eblis in
               Beckford’s <em>Vathek</em>.</p>
            <p>Masons believe that geometry represents the craft and that all six arts are subordinate
               to this all-important principle of measurement: geometry. “The seven liberal sciences
               or arts, as defined by classical authors, were grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic,
               geometry, music, and astronomy…all seven sciences were founded on one science, that
               of geometry,” as Stevenson explains (20). That Byron’s wife was an “amiable mathematician”—the
               “Princess of Parallelograms”– explains why this seventh spirit in the form of a woman
               is so powerful (February 6, 1814, <em>BLJ</em> IV:47). On October 28, 1816 Byron described Annabella as “formed for my destruction”;
               in a letter to his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, she is like Manfred’s “comet” (Augusta
               becomes Annabella, and finally a kind of sky-“monster”) (<em>BLJ </em>V:119). He had finished <em>Manfred</em> only a few months before. “I loved her, and destroy’d her” could be said of both
               Augusta and Annabella (II.ii.117). Though he claims he has polluted Astarte, he also
               suggests why this is not so. One man’s incest is another man’s religion, as Montesquieu’s
               <em>Persian Letters</em> shows, the text where the names Astarte and Aspheridon are first employed.</p>
            <p>Montesquieu’s <em>Persian Letters</em> encouraged Byron to think about ethics deontologically: that is to say, not in terms
               of consequences but in terms of the acts themselves. In <em>Manfred</em>, Byron uses the religion of the Gabars, as Montesquieu had done in <em>Persian Letters</em>, to view incest not as a taboo, but as a cultural practice. “What can you expect
               from a religion which makes you unhappy in this world and gives you no hope for the
               next?” Astarte’s brother asks Aspheridon in Montesquieu’s <em>Persian Letters</em>. He continues to suggest that Magism precedes Islam and thus has a greater authority:
               <span class="quote">‘Songez que la nôtre est la plus ancienne qui soit au monde ; qu'elle a toujours fleuri
                  dans la Perse, et n'a pas d'autre origine que cet empire, dont les commencements ne
                  sont point connus ; que ce n'est que le hasard qui y a introduit le mahométisme ;
                  que cette secte y a été établie, non par la voie de la persuasion, mais de la conquête.
                  Si nos princes naturels n'avaient pas été faibles, vous verriez régner encore le culte
                  de ces anciens mages. Transportez−vous dans ces siècles reculés : tout vous parlera
                  du magisme, et rien de la secte mahométane, qui, plusieurs milliers d'années après,
                  n'était pas même dans son enfance. (Ibben to Usbek, Letter LXVII, p. 232)’</span> <span class="quote">‘Remember that ours (Magism, or Zoroastrianism) is the oldest religion in the world,
                  that it has never ceased to flourish in Persia, and that it originated with the Persian
                  empire, the beginnings of which are unknown; that it was only by chance that the religion
                  of Mohammed was introduced, and that his sect established itself not by persuasion,
                  but by conquest. If it were not for the weakness of our rightful princes, you would
                  see the religion of the ancient magi still in force. If you go far back into the past,
                  what you will hear everywhere is the voice of Magism, not of the Islamic sect, which
                  several thousand years later was not even in its infancy. (Ibben to Usbek, Letter
                  LXVII, p. 139) ’</span> According to this reading, Byron’s exploration of Magism in <em>Manfred</em> allows him to transvalue Christian morality, as he had done in <em>Hebrew Melodies</em>, and as Beckford does in <em>Vathek</em>. Byron does not critique “<em>Western</em> Dualism” (my italics) in <em>Manfred</em>, for the play locates Manichaeism in Eastern religions as well (Hubbell 11). <em>Manfred</em> shows Byron emancipating his hero from institutionalized religion altogether, as
               he hoped to do through his activity with the Carbonari and in Manfred’s rejection
               of the Abbott’s consolations. “For some, and Moray [see below] was evidently among
               them, the social bond provided by membership of a masonic lodge, provided a substitute
               bond to that of organised religion, with strong ethical overtones and ritual to replace,
               or more than replace, that present in protestant public religion” (Stevenson 186).
               Byron held this emancipated position as early as 1811, five years after he had penned
               “The Prayer of Nature” (Moore 88). “I am no Platonist, I am nothing at all,” he wrote
               to the amiable Francis Hodgson on September 3, 1811, “but I would sooner be a Paulician,
               Manichean . . . Zoroastrian, than one of the seventy-two villainous sects who are
               tearing each other to pieces for the love of the Lord and hatred of each other” (<em>BLJ</em> II:89). Without proclaiming himself a “stupid atheist” or “irreligious libertine”
               (to use the language of the Masonic “Charges” that dated from 1723, chapter one, p.
               48), Byron refuses to subscribe to one religious sect, for he sees Zoroastrianism
               as pre-dating them all (Manfred is later dubbed “A Magian of great power” [II. iv.31]).
               “Let me live well if possible, and die without pain,” he concluded in his letter to
               Hodgson; “The rest is with God” (<em>BLJ</em> II:89). Byron’s refusal to engage in religious dissension in his letters with Hodgson
               is strikingly Masonic. As James Anderson’s “Constitution of the Freemasons” (1723)
               states, “But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of
               the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more
               expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their
               particular Opinion to themselves, that is, to be good Men and true . . . by whatever
               Denominations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d” (“The Charges of a Freemason”).
               Benjamin Franklin published this volume in 1734 in the United States.</p>
            <p>Taking this deontological and deistic stance a step further, following Franklin and
               other Masons, Manfred visits Arimanes. The play moves from the Christian gothic setting
               that opens the play to another hell, a Persian one, the Hall of Eblis, to use the
               term William Beckford employs (and from which Byron borrows). The stage direction
               at the beginning of Act II, scene iv states: “The Hall of Arimanes–Arimanes on his
               throne, a Globe of Fire, surrounded by the Spirits” (<em>CPW</em> II.iv.473). Yet, when all is said and done, Manfred’s shocking journey, like Vathek’s,
               resembles nothing so much as a tedious lodge ceremony; worse still, the Eastern mysteries
               appear to be nothing more than a kind of Christian baptism. More unites these fellowship
               ceremonies than divides them. As Matthews notes of Newstead Abbey, Byron’s friends
               engaged in unspeakable acts, which involved little more than nibbling on sandwiches
               and reading books (Moore 142).</p>
            <p>In Act II, Manfred visits a pre-historic (in fact, Persian) hell connected with stars
               and the sky, a mental theatre or Masonic embracing of all religions, though in inverted,
               Persian form. Byron borrows allusions to Arimanes and the Hall of Eblis from Beckford’s
               <em>Vathek</em>, just as he borrowed the name Manfred from Walpole’s <em>Castle of Otranto</em>, who was an excommunicated (1254) King of Sicily (1258-1266) (Montague 23). In <em>Vathek</em>, characters who worship the pre-Adamite Sultans wander around with hearts on fire
               in their chests, like the somewhat variable iconography of the Rosicrucians, from
               which Freemasonry was an outgrowth. “The Rosicrucians took their name from the supposed
               founder of their order or brotherhood, Christian Rosenkreutz, or `Rosy Cross’ . .
               . It would also immediately recall the coat of arms adopted by Martin Luther, a rose
               with a cross emerging from it, thus specifying that the movement was a Protestant
               one which strove for religious reform in the tradition of Luther—though it was not
               narrowly and exclusively bound to Lutheranism” (Stevenson 97). From ancient times,
               the rose was also a symbol of Aphrodite or Venus, and all acts of love that are <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">sub rosa</span> or hidden (Stevenson 97). In <em>Manfred</em>, these Masonic allusions are to Persia, Germany, and Greece, Englished, as it were.
               Arimanes “derives his name from Ahriman, the Principle of Darkness and Evil” in Zoroastrian
               mythology (McGann <em>, CPW</em> IV:473). Having chosen to remove the “H” from Arimanes for example, Byron dabbles
               in orientalist themes, as portrayed by the freemason Montesquieu, without committing
               himself to the Persian religion, German Lutheranism, or the Greek worship of Aphrodite.
               Manfred is not a Christian but a “Magian of great power” (II.iv.31); “Aphridon,” as
               Richardson points out, describes his religion as Magisme, “le culte de ces anciens
               Mages” (Richardson 143). “Although the poem’s pervasive dualism ("half-dust, half-deity”
               [1.ii.40]) seems reason enough for Byron to have introduced Zoroastrianism into <em>Manfred</em>, it is nevertheless helpful to have in Montesquieu’s connection of sibling incest
               with “Magisme” another ground for the initially startling appearance of a Persian
               deity set mainly in the Alps” (22). Since Manfred has also addressed Roman gods in
               the Coliseum passage, and the Greek term “Kalon” earlier in the play (another pentagram
               type word with five letters), I would argue that there is nothing startling at all
               in these allusions when we consider the thoroughly Masonic symbolism of the play,
               which has not been remarked upon before (III.i.13). Manfred’s interest is in “Kalon,”
               the Greek ideal of perfection and beauty (Broadview 49n2): “leaving that beautiful
               which still was so,” he says of the Roman Coliseum, “till the place / Became religion,
               and the heart ran o’er / With silent worship of the great of old” (III.iv.37-39).
               As Masons suggest, places can “Bec[o]me religion”: there is a direct analogy between
               the Masonic art of building beautiful buildings and the keeping of secrets necessary
               for the production of such architecture as pyramids, the Second temple, and the Coliseum.</p>
