            <p>The writers and political figures Byron most admired—Alexander Pope, Robert Burns,
               Walter Scott, Benjamin Franklin, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and George Washington—were
               all Freemasons. He admired them because of their talent and their moral outlook. Byron
               praises Franklin for his letters on religious toleration, for example, and holds up
               Washington as an example of self-effacing civic leadership in “Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte”
               (1814). Yet Byron’s relationship to the craft was at least as complex as Benjamin
               Franklin’s. The unlikely name Franklin adopted of “Silence Dogood” (Van Doren 21)
               concealed Benjamin Franklin’s more lascivious and libertine ways: his erstwhile marriage
               to Deborah Read (Van Doren 50), his illegitimate son William (Van Doren 91), pornography
               collection, sexual advice column, and 16-day visit to the notorious Sir Francis Dashwood
               in October 1772, when Dashwood led the Hellfire club, or Medmenham monks (Van Doren
               437). Franklin conversed with Byron’s grandfather about the Patagonians (Van Doren
               357). Unlike Franklin, however, Byron enjoyed making himself appear worse than he
               was, quite the opposite conduct of a Mason. Byron inherited his interest in masonry
               from William Byron, the fifth Baron Byron (1722-1798), the uncle of George Gordon
               (our poet) and the one who shot Mary Chaworth’s father. That such a man could also
               become master of a Masonic lodge proved to some the depths to which masonry had fallen
               (Bullock 11). Nevertheless, this same uncle of George Gordon, the Sixth Lord, defended
               a man tortured by the Portuguese inquisition and took principled stands on political
               issues of the day (Walker 126). Appearances could be deceiving. Man was “Half-dust,
               half-deity,” to use the language of <em>Manfred</em>, alike unfit “to sink or soar” (I.ii.40-1).</p>
            <p>In several quotations from “The Vision of Judgment,” Byron treated masonry facetiously,
               mocking the back stairs diplomacy and mysterious mumbo jumbo connected with its practitioners.
               As a young man, Byron staged lodge-like fraternal meetings at Newstead Abbey in imitation
               of Sir Francis Dashwood’s Medmenham Monks, where he would sip wine from a human skull,
               a ritual specified in the Royal Arch ceremony and several Carbonari rituals, and one
               which may well have been practiced by his great-uncle who built Folly Castle at Newstead.
               (Moore 142). Charles Skinner Matthews noted how he kept a wolf and a bear at Newstead,
               in separate rooms, and his friends dressed in monkish masquerade (Moore 142). Yet
               this appearance of wickedness concealed a passion for moral self-improvement: the
               villainous libertine and notorious womanizer, seducing the wives of his close friends,
               such as James Webster, joined a Masonic lodge in Ravenna and became the unlikely patron
               of Italian and Greek independence. Masonry seems a strange master ritual for Manfred,
               whose name connects him to the gothic novel, <em>The Castle of Otranto</em>, but perhaps it is not so strange after all. Which side will Manfred join after evoking
               three sets of spirits, the Witch of the Alps, and the Abbot? Good or evil? What I
               hope to show in the pages that follow is that the play neither rejects Western dualism
               (man/nature; good/evil) nor critiques radical autonomy, but rather embraces Freemasonry
               as a unifying national and trans-national force, a vehicle for social improvement
               relatively free of cant.</p>
            <p>It might be helpful to begin with a definition: “Freemasonry is a fraternal organization
               that purports to ‘make good men better’ by teaching them a number of moral precepts
               through a complex and secret brand of symbolism and ritual” (Gunn 247). If Freemasonry
               is a form of theatre, then there is a theatrical aspect to Masonic initiation, alluded
               to explicitly in Act 3, that might be connected to Byron’s forays into mental theatre
               in <em>Manfred</em>. In Act 3 of <em>Manfred</em>, for example, the hero calls for a “casket” and a “key” (objects used in Masonic
               ceremonies) (III.i.5), but rejects magic, Manichaeism, the occult, the Witch of the
               Alps, and Arimanes; he accepts Freemasonry, which embraces all religions, repudiating
               the Abbot with his narrow notions of doctrinal religion, and returns his body to Nature
               by propelling himself off a mountain.</p>
            <p>Washington, Franklin, and other Enlightenment figures submitted themselves to a theatrics
               of self-improvement, as did Byron with the Carbonari in 1818. In most Masonic initiation
               ceremonies, such as Washington’s, the inductee is led into a room blindfolded (Hodapp
               23). He utters a catechism. At the end of the ceremony, the blindfold is removed.
               Light symbolizes enlightenment. Various symbols are learned as mnemonic devices of
               the Mason’s rebirth. The tracing board and knotted rope become symbols of thorny problems
               that must be untied; the drinking from the skull of Christ, in the 32-degree ceremony,
               all demonstrate the power of moral edification through gesture, movement, and ceremony.</p>
