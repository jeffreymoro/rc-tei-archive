               “The Dashes in <em>Manfred</em>”
               examines the ways in which one aspect of Byron’s manuscripts has been translated by
               his editors. The dash is one of the most distinctive and controversial features of
               Byron’s writing and is the vehicle for the silent part of his voice. Like many other
               editors, I think that accidentals can be substantive. In this paper, I look at the
               cultural associations of the dash, its translation from manuscript into print in Byron’s
               particular case, and the different versions of  <em>Manfred</em> that come into sight (and hearing) if we use Byron’s manuscripts as a musical score.</p>

               <p>In the opening scene of the play, Manfred tells the spirits to appear “in your accustom’d

                           comments on the paper and to Helen Symington for her invaluable assistance in making
                           images from Byron’s manuscripts in the NLS. For obvious reasons, MLA-style formatting
                           of quotations is not helpful when discussing Byron’s open punctuation and I have departed
                           from it where necessary when quoting from Byron’s manuscripts.</span></div>
                  </div> In response, they ask him to “choose a form –” and Manfred replies: “I have no choice”
                  (I.i.183-4). This is not only an expression of doomed fatefulness (because the shape
                  can only be Astarte), but also a world-weary “I don’t care” or, as my teenage son
                  would say, just before he gets grounded, “I don’t give ––.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Manfred’s “I have no choice” is a kind of textual shrug – one which Byron redeploys
               in the fair copy of <em>Don Juan</em> Canto II, stanza 151, when he offers alternative metaphors to his publisher. As shown
               below, he writes in the margin of the manuscript, “Take of the variations what is
               thought best –– I have no choice.”</p>

               <p>This paper examines the expressive mark of punctuation that leads to “I have no choice”—the
                  long dash (reproduced by Byron’s printers and in this paper as a double “em” dash
                  “–”), which has a distinctive place in <em>Manfred</em> and Byron’s writing as a whole. Like the “em” dash, the long or double “em” dash is
                  both a mark of punctuation and (in Byron’s case) a refusal to punctuate. Its ambivalence
                  heightens our awareness of the reader as a co-producer of meaning and as one of the
                  many who are coerced by Manfred’s (and Byron’s) assertions of authority. The long
                  dash, therefore, encapsulates many of puzzles about the interpretive freedom of Byron’s
                  readers, his editors and, indeed, his actors.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>One of the most searching investigations I have found of the role of the dash in the
                           reading experience is the discussion of Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy in Hunter
                           41-69. I discovered this essay through Warren Oakley’s work after the Manfred Symposium
                           in April 2017, but Hunter’s summary of the work of the dash anticipates my sense that
                           Byron’s dashes provide a musical “score” for the reader: “Its quantitative guide to
                           pause, rhythm, and silence and its indication of shifts of speaker, changes of direction,
                           or modifications in tone provide for readers a score that the voice can perform by
                           …</span></div>
                  </div> In reading <em>Manfred</em> we assume all three of these roles and none of them.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Byron is not alone in the Romantic period in his promiscuous use of dashes: the manuscripts
               of P.B. Shelley and Jane Austen also flicker and pulse with dashing energy, but Byron’s
               editors seem to have allowed a higher proportion of his manuscript dashes to appear
               in printed form (William Gifford, we remember, edited works by both Byron and Austen).
               In published form, Byron’s dashes were still controversial. The <em>British Critic</em>’s review of <em>The Bride of Abydos</em> remonstrated about the prolixity of dashes in January 1814: <span class="quote">‘We must protest against the effect of dashes, which occur, without any reason whatsoever,
                  sometimes twice or thrice in one line, and never less than a dozen times in a page.
                  (50)’</span> The same reviewer suspected that dashes were introduced “to give spirit to what was
               previously flat and a mysterious meaning to what was before unintelligible.” Encountering
               the same device in <em>The Corsair</em>, the <em>British Critic</em> sounded increasingly impatient: “[w]e wish the Noble Lord would omit these linear
               conjunctions” (March 1814, 288).</p>
            <p>The art of Byron’s dashes was shaped by print technology as well as the diverse hands
               that worked over the manuscripts. When published by John Murray, Byron’s poetry normally
               appeared on the page in Thomas Davison’s elegant typeface in which the “em” dash almost
               joins the last letter of the preceding word to the first letter of the next, forming
               a sort of “linear conjunction.” Davison’s “em” dashes are usually seamless, but in
               the third stanza of the first edition of “When we two parted,” for example, which
               was printed by Bulmer &amp; Co, one can see how the “em” dash occasionally gets broken
               in the middle, forming a sort of typographical shudder. </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/stabler-image2Thumb.png" alt="Lord Byron, Poems (1816), p. 15]" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> The visual frisson of the broken dash is uncommon, but <em>affective</em> dashing in Byron’s poetry is not unusual. Byron’s dashes often seem to be the metrical
               equivalent of the exclamations listed at the beginning of <em>Don Juan</em> Canto XV: “An ‘Oh!’ or ‘Ah!’ of joy or misery” (XV.1,] <em>CPW</em> V:589), or of non-verbal moments such as “a syncope, / Or a singultus” (XV.2), a
               sigh, an intake of breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent
               of a pause, a rest, or silence. In the midst of a densely literary work, dashes highlight
               the importance of the non-verbal as a marker of intense emotion. As Janine Barchas
               points out, however, in relation to the eighteenth-century novel, “[t]he overwhelming
               physicality of these moments may . . . draw attention to themselves not as innocent
               approximations but as telltale evidence of the habits of a master printer” (132).
               The translation of affect into luxurious print takes us to the heart of the reviewers’
               dilemma about the Byronic hero, and the uncertainty about whether Byron’s readers
               were sharing the intimate secrets of a wounded soul or being taken for a ride by a
               shrewd marketing operation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When the <em>British Critic</em> praised Byron for omitting the dashy “eye-traps” in <em>Lara,</em> the phrase “eye-trap” (from the 1750s, according to the <em>OED</em>) was used presumably as a variant of “clap-trap,” the extended pause that set apart
                  moments of high emotion in theatrical performances, designed to attract the attention
                  and applause of the audience.

                           in Laurence Sterne’s prose (also an influence on Byron), linking it with the effects
                           of the pauses in David Garrick’s acting. For further details on the dash as melodrama,
                           see Oakley 34-9.</span></div>
                  </div> On the page, Byron’s promiscuous “em” dashing resembles the visual appearance of the
                  Shakespeare plays David Garrick prepared for the Drury Lane Threatre. Garrick used
                  a dash to signal where an actor should pause for effect so that in his published adaptations,
                  as Warren Oakley has shown, “[t]ypography indicates the location of each dramatic
                  caesura, but is silent about the nature of the action filling the expressive pause
                  … prompting the imagination of the reader” (34). The similarly hyperventilated appearance
                  of the page in Byron’s Turkish Tales represents a test for the reader which is taken
                  a stage further by the appearance of a still more elongated dash in the first edition
                  of <em>The Corsair</em> (as shown in figure 3).

                           rhythm: “The typographical dash . . . both speeds up and slows down the narrative”
                           (58).</span></div>

It is placed here
                  to mark dramatic interruption, and is used for similar arresting effect in the prose
                  fragment attached to <em>Mazeppa</em>, and for coy innuendo in <em>Beppo</em>: “For my part, now, I ne’er could understand / Why naughty women –– but I won’t discuss
                  / A thing which is a scandal to the land” (stanza 68; [“em” dash in <em>CPW</em> IV:150, but restored to double “em” in <em>The Major Works</em> 333]). In the Garland facsimile of the fair copy of <em>Beppo</em>, one can see how Byron’s manuscript dash after “naughty Women” is at least twice
                  the length of the dash after “For my part now,” suggesting that Byron intended a salacious
                  pause in which to conjure and then flamboyantly repress the thought of “naughty Women”
                  and what they do. The relative length of dashes within and between manuscripts is
                  not always as easy to decipher, however, and, as with all his punctuation, Byron relied
                  on his editors to translate manuscript into print.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Gifford’s significant role in the production of Byron’s poems means that the textual
                           situation of Byron’s dashes is not the same as that outlined for Sterne by Hunter
                           where “The ubiquity of the dash insistently calls attention to the manipulating hand
                           of the author behind the printer: for all the freedom Sterne pretends to give individual
                           readers, the firm, set-in-print authority of the text remains inflexible and controls
                           readers, getting them up to speed or slowing them down as he wants” (49).</span></div>
                  </div> Gifford’s dashing almost always has a graphic basis in Byron’s manuscripts (in that
                  there is nearly always a dash in the immediate vicinity), but Gifford’s usual role
                  is to reduce the frequency of the Byronic dash and to turn it into other marks such
                  as a comma or (especially) a colon. Like the poem’s infamous asterisks, the “2 ems”
                  long dash in <em>Don Juan</em> (––) signals the unsayable; but whereas a row of asterisks shows where authorial content
                  has been excised retrospectively by the editor or publisher to avoid obscenity or
                  legal prosecution, the long dash suggests that a speaker <em>nearly</em> said something, but was then stopped or thought better of it: <em>aposiopesis</em>—the mark of knowing self-censorship. The long dash (––) is also a mark of complicity
                  with the reader who is usually able to imagine what would have come next, as in Juan
                  and Julia’s first sexual act: “And then –– God knows what next – I can’t go on; /
                  I’m almost sorry that I e’er begun” (I. 115); or the reference to Donna Inez / Lady
                  Byron: “His lady-mother, mathematical, / A –– never mind” (II.3); or, perhaps something
                  less readily imaginable, “And horrid was the contrast to the view ––” (V.38), a more
                  meditative pause as the narrator of <em>Don Juan</em> contemplates the body of the assassinated military commandant in Ravenna.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Murray’s printer made a distinction between the one “em” dash (–) and the “2 ems”
               long dash (––). In the Clarendon <em>Complete Poetical Works</em> (1980-93), however, some of these long dashes (including all the long dashes in <em>Manfred</em> in the corrected reprinting of 1992) were standardised to “em” dashes, and it was
               not until <em>The Major Works</em> that they made a reappearance. In the meantime, the new Penguin editions of <em>Don Juan</em> and Byron’s <em>Selected Poems</em> by Peter Manning and Susan Wolfson retained long dashes from the earlier Murray and
               Hunt editions. Viewed in the Penguin typeface, however, the difference between “em”
               (–) and double “em” (––) dashes seems to me slightly more subtle than in the Oxford
               texts (possibly because there is more space around the dash?). Since most students
               who want an authoritative text of <em>Manfred</em> will be directed to use the Clarendon <em>Complete Poetical Works</em> Volume IV as the current standard edition, it is helpful to ask what (if anything)
               is lost when we <em>don’t</em> see the long dashes and what are we meant to do with them when we do. I’ll begin
               with the dashes that we do not see in the <em>Manfred</em> of <em>CPW</em> IV because of OUP’s tidiness and I’ll move on to the ones that were not in the <em>Manfred</em> of 1817 because of Gifford’s tidiness.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The key editorial difficulty about retaining Byron’s dashes was summed up by Gifford
                  [writing of <em>The Corsair</em>]: “Lord B. uses dashes for commas – this gives the work a very singular appearance,
                  &amp; in some places, mars the sense” (Nicholson, <em>Letters</em> 70n). Byron, like Shelley, tends to use dashes in place of other punctuation and sometimes,
                  at least in his rough drafts, as vital contact between pen and page as he reaches
                  for the word that will come next.

                           indicates that the dash might be used “like the way people use ‘like’ to fill a silence
                           rather than a deliberate or even semi-deliberate punctuation.”</span></div>
                  </div> Byron trusted his editors to supply regular punctuation for him, but unlike the normal
                  “em” dash, one feels that the long double “em” dash never really signifies a comma.
                  Although in some respects it stands alone, the long dash shares the paradoxical and
                  musical nature of Byron’s other dashes and extra-punctuational markings. The long
                  dash is a horizontal (in print) or slanting (in some manuscripts) line that can signal
                  opposing things: a fragmentary, uncertain, but logically continuous progression of
                  thought or a termination, a change of logical direction, a <span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">pausa</span> or pivot.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The first thing to note is that Byron often changes the position and length of his
               dashes between draft and fair copy. On the first draft, Manfred asks the mountains
               of the Jungfrau, “Why are ye beautiful? – –” with a couple of separate dashes after
               the question mark, but this becomes just a question mark in the fair copy and the
               first edition of 1817 (Levine and McGann 45).</p>
            <p>The second thing to notice is that (as in <em>Don Juan</em>) some of the long dashes (––) are inserted by the editor (Gifford again), and do
               not exist in the MSS at all. When Manfred sees the beautiful form at the end of the
               first scene: </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
               <div class="stanza">
                  <div class="l">Oh God! if it be thus, and <em>thou</em></div>
                  <div class="l">Art not a madness and a mockery,</div>
                  <div class="l">I yet might be most happy. – I will clasp thee,</div>
                  <div class="l">And we again will be –– (I.i.188-91, “em” dashes in <em>CPW</em>),</div>
               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The agonised emphasis on “<em>thou</em>” and the long dash after “we again will be” are not present in the fair copy but
               were added when the fair copy was set up in type in 1817 (16).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The third thing to bear in mind is that long dashes are shared between most of the
                  characters and are not characteristic of Manfred alone. When Peter Graham perceptively
                  remarks that Manfred’s dashes supply the place of “dark unvoiced thoughts,” this is
                  true in some cases, but not in all of them, and it does not extend to the other characters
                  such as the Chamois Hunter (53). In the draft manuscript, when Manfred attempts to
                  dismiss the Chamois Hunter with “I am not of thine order,” the man retorts: “Thanks
                  to Heaven – / I would not be of thine – for the free fame / Of William Tell; ––” and
                  the long dash here makes the exchange much more like the playful abruptness of dialogue
                  in <em>Don Juan</em> (reminding us of the comic and conversational use of the dash in Sterne’s novels and
                  in eighteenth-century stage comedy) (Levine and McGann 57). The cheeky long dash for
                  the Chamois Hunter was not retained in Byron’s fair copy, nor in Murray’s first edition,
                  but its presence on the first draft might be seen as a residual trace of the experimental
                  serio-comic <em>Manfred</em> which John Wright and Jerome McGann remind us was there from the start.

                           the 17-volume 1832-33 edition. As early as 1817, however, reviewers were suspicious
                           about the hybrid tone and form of Manfred. The British Critic described Manfred as
                           a “nondescript” and an “Olla Podrida” – both terms which Byron associates with the
                           style of Don Juan; see British Critic (July 1817) 47 and McGann 181-99.</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Many of the long dashes that Gifford allowed into the 1817 edition are performative
                  or gestural, telling us that in the midst of his poem, as in the narration of <em>Don Juan</em>, Byron (and his editor) were aware that the characters needed stage time to do something,
                  or textual time for readers to <em>imagine</em> them doing something. It is significant that the agency that propels these dashes
                  often fails to summon or dismiss or assist the body that is being invoked or cajoled
                  repulsed, so that in the duration of the dash there is often something of a struggle
                  with materiality (or immateriality) that might involve a certain flailing of arms.
                  The questionable authority of speech acts is evident in Manfred’s initial commands
                  to the spirits: “–– Rise! appear!” and “– Rise! appear! ––Appear!” (25), where the
                  long dashes suggest something of an embarrassing pause as Manfred initially fails
                  to make anything rise or appear.

                  Manfred back from the cliffs with, “Away with me –– I will not quit my hold” (25).
                  The long dashes that articulate his instructions as he leads Manfred down the mountain
                  represent the offer of physical assistance (perhaps initially resisted, but eventually
                  accepted) and a shared faltering progress downward. In the next act, the Witch of
                  the Alps dismisses Manfred’s apparent attachment to a mortal, his alleged clinging
                  on to “recreant mortality” with an “ ––Away!” (36) and, at the end of the poem, the
                  Abbot attempts to dismiss the fiend in the third act with “Avaunt! ––”, and an equally
                  vain “I do charge ye in the name ––” (72).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes enact Manfred’s dismissal of the Wordsworthian figures,
                  the Chamois Hunter and the Abbot: the Chamois Hunter, speaking of “heavenly patience
                  ––” is impatiently interrupted by Manfred with, “Patience and patience! Hence – that
                  word was made / For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey” (28). The Abbot, remonstrating
                  with Manfred at the start of Act III, is also cut off: “yet so young, / I still would
                  ––” and: “Yet, hear me still ––” (61); the Spirit who comes to claim Manfred in the
                  last act tells him, “thy many crimes / Have made thee ––” but Manfred intercepts the
                  adjective with “What are they to such as thee?” (74). Long dashes in such instances
                  accentuate Byron’s stichomythia, the insistent line breaks that interrupt the flow
                  of the blank verse and enforce a poetics of un-Wordsworthian rupture.

            <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes are self-interruptions, which increase tension about
               what is being withheld or concealed. When Manfred speaks with the Witch of the Alps,
               he initiates a series of half-revelations that begin with the detail of the exceptional
               “one who –– but more of her anon” (33; 35). And the same secret is almost disclosed
               but then withheld in the most famous broken line in the whole poetic drama when Manuel
               speaks to Herman of “the only thing he seem’d to love, – / As he, indeed, by blood
               was bound to do, / The lady Astarte, his –– / Hush! Who comes here?” (66).</p>
            <p>These are all dramatic dashes which depend on conflict between two voices (or in the
               last example, a change of interlocutor). In a separate category are the more lyrical
               long dashes which create a pause after a completed statement, allowing the last sound
               before the dash to reverberate. There are lots of these in the manuscript, but only
               one survives into the 1817 first edition. It is when the spirits ask Manfred what
               he wants from them and he says, “Forgetfulness ––” (see figure 6). </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/stabler-image6Thumb.png" alt="Lord Byron, Manfred (1817; first edition, “second issue”) 14" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> This is not an instance of interruption, or self-interruption, or <em>aposiopesis</em>, and the reader or speaker delivering the line has to decide for how long to pause.
               It is possible to imagine a performance of <em>Manfred</em> extended by several minutes if actors heeded all Byron’s dashes as if they were Beckett-like
               pauses. If we use the manuscript as a dramatical-musical score (which is how, I think,
               Byron wrote it), “Forgetfulness” is meant to echo round the auditorium or the reader’s
               mind for a bit. The long dash here (my last example of the long dashes that are present
               in 1817 but missing from <em>CPW</em>) is a way of augmenting the force of unforgettability, or the nature of consciousness
               with a silence that is the echo of Manfred’s own thoughts.</p>
            <p>In order to recover some of the long dashes that Gifford filtered out of Byron’s fair
               copy when he copy-edited the manuscript in 1817, I have arranged the following illustrations
               to contrast the fair copy of <em>Manfred</em> (now in the Murray archive in the National Library of Scotland) and the first edition.
               I am using the “second issue” as described by T. J. Wise (I: 122) or the “Dramatis
               Personae Variant” as described by F. L. Randolph (Randolph argues that this is more
               likely to be the first issue) (64). First, Manfred’s soliloquy at I.i.21-4 (see figure
               7). </p>

            <p> What was a succession of dashes after “sands” and “since” in the first draft (Levine
               and McGann 27), and a heavy long dash after “hour” in the fair copy has become just
               a full stop after “that all-nameless hour” in the first edition. In both manuscripts,
               Manfred haltingly and hesitantly approaches a fatal moment, a moment which becomes
               much more discreet and self-contained after it passes through the hands of Gifford.
               The 1817 first edition version of Manfred’s soliloquy is less uneven and more matter-of-fact,
               but in the fair copy manuscript above one can see a darker stroke of erasure signalling
               a pause to sound unfathomable agony.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At II.ii.31-2, Manfred summons the Witch of the Alps: “– to call thee thus, / And
                  gaze on thee a moment” (see figure 8).

                  and there is one long dash in the fair copy (above); for the 1817 edition, Gifford
                  again turns the long dash into a single full stop. In the manuscripts, however, Byron
                  seems to indicate that Manfred should dwell on the beauty of the Witch for some time.
                  This impression is strengthened a little later in the fair copy when he says that
                  he desires to “look upon thy beauty – nothing further –” and after seeking refuge
                  in the mysteries of the earth, “I search no further. – – – –” (see figure 8). There
                  were two separate dashes after “no further” in the first draft (Levine and McGann
                  64), growing to four separate dashes in the fair copy above. In the first edition
                  of 1817, everything is gathered into a terminal full stop (see figure 9). 
                  <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/stabler-image9Thumb.png" alt="Lord Byron, Manfred (1817) 33" class="inline"/></figure> Even allowing for the fact that Byron often finishes the last line of a manuscript
                  page with multiple dashes as a sort of “PTO” to himself, the manuscripts urge more
                  of a pause than is audible in the grammatically rationalized punctuation of 1817.
                  Gifford’s removal of so many dashes makes Manfred into a cooler, more composed, and
                  more purposeful speaker in the first edition than he is in the manuscripts, where
                  the multiple breaks and pauses in speech suggest a much more jagged melodramatic delivery.

            <p>The fair copy of Manfred’s exchange with Nemesis in Act II, scene 4 is another heavily
               dashed section of manuscript dialogue, indicating extreme emotional disturbance. To
               the question of Nemesis: “Whom wouldst thou uncharnel?” Manfred answers in the fair
               copy, “One without a tomb. – Call up – / Astarte. ––” (see figure 10). </p>

            <p> In the first edition, this exchange becomes positively brisk, closed by Gifford’s
               neatly self-sufficient full stop after “Astarte.” The appearance of the speech on
               the printed page of 1817 renders the necromancy as a routine day’s work for Arimanes
               and Nemesis; whilst for Manfred, the summoning of Astarte is terse rather than the
               more traumatic venture it appears to be in manuscript.</p>
            <p>When Astarte appears, the stage directions for both Manfred and Astarte are implied

            <p> “She is silent,” we are told at II.iv.110, but when Manfred’s thick heavy dash on
               the fair copy becomes a comma in the 1817 first edition, what looks like unspeakable
               anguish in the manuscript is rendered as a calm, potentially impassive observation
               of her silence. Through Gifford’s paring and re-punctuating for the 1817 edition,
               the whole emotional temper of Manfred’s speech becomes much more even and controlled
               whereas Byron’s manuscripts suggest that (as usual) he was using dashes as a graphic
               means of drawing out and intensifying affect.</p>
            <p>It would be misleading, however, to focus solely on dashes which carry the affective
               freight of the unbearable or in Hunter’s elegant phrase “something unspeakable and
               yet compellingly actual” (47). Dashes are used in the fair copy of <em>Manfred</em> for a wider range of effects, including a sort of rapture—just as in the fair copy
               manuscript of <em>Don Juan</em> X.3, dashes will carry the “glow” and “caper” cut by the poet’s “internal Spirit.”
               In <em>Manfred</em> Act III, scene i, Byronic dashes signal the boundlessness of mental travel. To the
               Abbot, Manfred recalls his youthful aspirations “to rise / I knew not whither – it
               might be to fall;” and then Manfred/Byron digresses to give us the lovely image of
               a Manfredian fall, which is actually an aesthetic rise (a version of the rebound or
               recovery described by Clara Tuite in the symposium): </p>

            <p> As figure 12 shows, the fair copy has longish dashes after “whither” and “fall” and
               “mistook themselves,” and medium-sized dashes after “abyss” and “past” that help to
               create a dawdling, meditative habit of mind (though one must be wary of placing too
               much interpretive weight on what are very variably-sized markings). The manuscript
               brackets in this passage encourage us to notice Manfred’s imagination snagging on
               a detail of external beauty, which leads him to digress from visions of himself and
               offer an aside on forms of natural plenitude and renewal. The dashes, meanwhile, encourage
               that lingering with nature that occurs when Manfred describes the Alps, or in his
               recollection of the Colosseum as a moon-softened necropolis.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In one of his most discerning asides, Jerome McGann calls the Alpine Journal “[o]ne
                  of the great acts of English prose attention” (to what extent was Byron acting, one
                  wants to ask) (McGann 177). Sights and sounds are recorded with a febrile, raw-nerved
                  concentration for Augusta, linked by dashes that suggest Byron’s headlong plunge into
                  each experience as he attempts to escape consciousness with an accumulation of sense
                  impressions. 
                  <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/stabler-image13Thumb.jpg" alt="MS. 43350 f. 5v. Manuscript journal of a tour of the Alpines by Byron (1816). Entry for 22 September 1816" class="inline"/></figure> The manuscript page of the Alpine journal in figure 13 is a graphic illustration of
                  Byron’s attempt to describe the indescribable: “It is neither mist nor water but a
                  something between both ––.” The dash carries the affective force of the liminal “something,”
                  which is re-transcribed in Byron’s slow realization of the lasting power of a formless
                  form that has almost brought him to speechlessness: “–– wonderful – &amp; indescribable.
                  –– .” In the fair copy of <em>Manfred</em>, one can see the same <span xml:lang="it" lang="it" class="foreign">pausa</span>, the same pivotal seductions of the human mind by its own imaginings. This lagging,
                  internal re-play of beauty suspends the onward rush of dramatic time and inevitability.
                  Its backward-looking, valedictory effect is evident in my final example of a longish
                  dash that was edited out by Gifford see figure 14). 
                  <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/stabler-image14aThumb.jpeg" alt="Fair copy of Manfred MS. 43335 f. 37v.

                  He is gone ––” becomes in 1817 “He is gone:” with Gifford’s characteristic colon (Byron
                  rarely uses colons in his manuscripts). If one treats the manuscript as theatrical
                  script, the dashes suggest that Manfred takes time to watch the sun disappear. In
                  a stage performance, a director might arrange a shadow to lengthen into total darkness
                  by the time Manfred reaches “gone.” A musical score might hold the final note, its
                  echo and the silence afterwards. Manfred, we know, “must watch” (I.i.2), and the time
                  he spends in “wanderings / And watchings” is important (III.iii.43-4). As Michael
                  O’Neill pointed out last year when the text was discussed in the Summer of 1816 conference
                  at Sheffield, one of the great paradoxes of <em>Manfred</em> is that its hero keeps saying beauty means nothing to him: “there is no form on earth
                  / Hideous or beautiful to me,” but his speeches are full of exquisitely shaped hymns
                  to natural beauty (I.i.184-5). Byron clearly was ravished by the Alpine scenery of
                  1816 which recurs throughout his poetry after the summer of 1816.

                  </div> The dashes around Manfred’s acts of attention partake of what Ian Balfour notes as
                  the “telegraphic notation” of the Alpine Journal (12), or what Susan Wolfson refers
                  to as the “lightning on the page” of dashes in <em>Childe Harold</em> Canto III (765).</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Manfred’s tactile attentiveness (almost adhesiveness) to form finds its echo in the
                  very final scene where the Abbot attends the dying Manfred. Manfred expires, of course,
                  on a dash: “Old Man – ’tis not so difficult to die. –” (Levine and McGann 130).

                  </div> Neither the dashes nor the rest of the line made it into the first edition of 1817;
                  and when the line was restored, the terminal dash was cancelled and became a full
                  stop. As he watches Manfred expire, the Abbot reiterates Manfred’s words on the sinking
                  sun: “He’s gone. – […] he is gone.”

Reproduced by permission of the National Library of Scotland" class="inline"/></figure> And then, as figure 15 above shows, we have Byron’s lovely signing off: “End of act
                  third – &amp; of this poem. – . –” with a swirl that seems a more emphatic version of
                  the one under the journal entry of September 22, 1816 in figure 13.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In the post-production discussion, the director of the Red Bull production of <em>Manfred</em> spoke about the challenges of adapting a poem lacking in causality for the stage.
               As a dramatic poem, Byron deliberately juxtaposes causality with (forgive me) what
               we might call “pausality.” At the micro-level of the dash and the macro-level of all
               those passages that had to be cut for the performance (such as the Colosseum soliloquy),
               Manfred steps back from decisive action to “linger yet with Nature” (III.iv.3). Poetically,
               he fights against the constraint that is fate or dramatic time and his dashes signal
               a determination to carve out form from poetic destiny so that “what ye take / Shall
               be ta’en limb by limb” (III.iv.103-4); “limb” is followed by three dashes in the fair
               copy. In the colder print of 1817, Manfred’s heroic resistance against the spirits
               of conventional drama becomes just another full stop. But the pause implicit in those
               three dashes help to make more sense of the spirit’s taunt: “Can it be that thou /
               Art thus in love with life?” (III.iv.107-8).</p>
            <p>Manfred is not in love with life, but he is sensually and syntactically involved with
               it; he is, we might say, attached to it. Byron’s hero has his own music, and the dashes
               that punctuate his speech are often extra-metrical silent notes of resistance that
               might seem indistinguishable from the terminal silence that ends the poem. But these
               dashes are also cues for action; they are the echoes of the last note but also the
               foot prints of the next move – a halting progress that drives the poem forward. In
               order to see, hear and feel that complex music we might pay more attention to the
               dashes in <em>Manfred</em>.</p>

               my sense that Byron’s dashes provide a musical “score” for the reader: “Its quantitative
               guide to pause, rhythm, and silence and its indication of shifts of speaker, changes
               of direction, or modifications in tone provide for readers a score that the voice
               can perform by giving the eye a visual diagram of structural transitions” (49).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               of the author behind the printer: for all the freedom Sterne pretends to give individual
               readers, the firm, set-in-print authority of the text remains inflexible and controls
               readers, getting them up to speed or slowing them down as he wants” (49).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               about the hybrid tone and form of <em>Manfred</em>. The <em>British Critic</em> described <em>Manfred</em> as a “nondescript” and an “Olla Podrida” – both terms which Byron associates with
               the style of <em>Don Juan</em>; see <em>British Critic</em> (July 1817) 47 and McGann 181-99.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
