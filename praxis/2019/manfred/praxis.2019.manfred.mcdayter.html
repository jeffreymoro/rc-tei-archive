               particularly images of his two heroines, <em>Manfred</em>'s Astarte and <em>The Giaour</em>'s Leila, reveal a great deal about the public response not so much to Byron’s poetry
               but rather to their own projected narratives and fantasies <em>about</em> Byron on to his poetry. Perhaps counter-intuitively, I will argue that it is by taking
               a careful look at the ways in which Byron’s heroines are illustrated that we are granted
               a window into the public view of the poet himself.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Let me begin by quoting a well-known Byronic passage:
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">. . . I rose,</div>

                        <div class="l">And clasp her to my desperate heart;</div>
                        <div class="l">I clasp—what is it that I clasp?<span class="lineNumber">5</span></div>
                        <div class="l">No breathing form within my grasp,</div>
                        <div class="l">No heart that beats reply to mine,</div>

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> While this passage is taken from Byron’s fragment tale, <em>The Giaour</em>, written in 1813, the illustration I have provided above depicts a very different
                  hero attempting to embrace his own lost love, the spirit of Astarte from Byron’s 1817
                  dramatic poem, <em>Manfred</em>. And yet, unless you knew something about Byron’s poetry, it would be difficult to
                  distinguish between the poetic narrative of the Turkish Tale and the image I have
                  shown you. The text appears to match the image very closely. Nor is this the only
                  similarity between the two poems: critics and reviewers have long remarked on their
                  shared indulgence in mysteries around unspoken and unspeakable crimes and representation
                  of gothic action, made only darkly visible in <em>The Giaour</em> through a multi-perspectival and fragmentary structure and in <em>Manfred </em> by its echoing of what Byron referred to as Augusta’s “absurd, obscure hinting style
                  of writing full of megrims and mysteries” (<em>BLJ</em> V:231-2). They have also long been associated with obfuscation and scandal if not
                  because of their poetic style then at least because of their shared plot details
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In John Wilson’s review of Manfred for Blackwood’s Magazine (June 1817), the critic,
                           while fundamentally approving of the poem, is critical of the unnecessary confusion
                           that dominates the plot. He observes that “it is difficult to comprehend distinctly
                           the drift of the composition, and almost impossible to give anything like a direct
                           account of it” (119). Similarly, the reviewer for the Critical Review (July 1813)
                           argues that, while on a second reading he was not as disturbed by the confusion at
                           the heart of The Giaour’s plot, he was annoyed by it at first. “It is possible, he
                           says, “that poss…</span></div>
                  </div> —we might remember the Giaour’s insistence that he did not kill his lover (“Not mine
                  the act, though mine the cause,” [1061]), and Manfred’s similar confession (“I loved
                  her, and destroyed her . . . Not with my hand, but heart . . .” [II.ii.117-9]). Arguably,
                  this was rather a moot distinction for the heroines in question.</p>
            </div>
            <p>These strong textual resemblances, however, serve to highlight the very different
               manner in which these very works have been approached by the artists and illustrators
               of Byron’s poetry. Exploring some of the most widely circulated nineteenth-century
               illustrated editions reveals that the character of Leila is rarely represented, with
               artists preferring to focus on the vendetta between men—the Giaour and Hassan—which
               is the real “action” at the heart of the poem. One can choose from a wide array of
               images of these two testosterone-driven men, locked in a deadly, albeit vaguely libidinal,
               combat, while Leila appears very rarely. On the other hand, Leila’s spectral sister,
               Astarte, has a much more material presence in these printed texts and appears countless
               times in engravings or illustrations.</p>
            <p>What I would like to explore in this essay is the way in which the illustrations of
               these two heroines reveal a great deal about the public response not so much to Byron’s
               poetry, but rather to their own projected narratives and fantasies <em>about</em> Byron on to his poetry. Perhaps counter-intuitively, I will argue that by taking
               a careful look at the ways in which Byron’s heroines are illustrated, we are granted
               a window into the public view of the poet himself.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To begin with the erasure of Leila, one must ask why poor Leila is left to languish
                  in poetic oblivion while Astarte is so frequently represented. Given that their stories
                  are so similar, why are not their visual fates?
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For an interesting reading of the erasure of Leila and the exploration of homoerotic
                           desire in this poem, see Bari.</span></div>
                  </div> On one level the answer is probably pretty straightforward. The plot of <em>The Giaour</em> is often read as political allegory, and Caroline Franklin reminds us that, while
                  the character of Leila is in part based on a real woman “rescued” by Byron while on
                  his travels, she is also strongly “compared to [her] native land of Greece” (38-40).
                  Critics such as Jerome Christensen (93), and David Roessel (56), specifically associate
                  her form with the image of the corpse-like Greece, the victim of Turkish oppression
                  and violence,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Jerome Christensen writes, “Love for Leila is like love for nature, or an unspoiled
                           Greece” (93), while for David Roessel “[t]he use of the loaded word tyranny, which
                           could be used almost as a synonym for Ottoman rule, links the personal freedom of
                           Leila to the political freedom of Greece implied in the historical setting of the
                           poem (sometime after 1770)” (56).</span></div>
                  </div> while Alan Richardson complicates this reading by drawing our attention instead to
                  Leila’s identity as a Circassian Beauty—the quintessentially desirable woman in nineteenth-century
                  terms (221). Even while playing a role in such political allegories, however, she
                  stands in for a type (the Orientalized, Eastern beauty), rather than an individual
                  woman.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Richardson is quick to problematize the easy opposition between East and West that
                           we are tempted to assume in these characters’ national associations. He makes a strong
                           argument for Byron’s attempt to complicate this binary throughout The Giaour , in
                           part by having Leila described as a Circassian who embodies not only beauty but hybridity
                           (221).</span></div>
                  </div> As such, it is possible to read Leila not as a woman or as a fully defined character,
                  but rather as a marker in a political allegory: the symbol of a victimized and Orientalized
                  beauty, the site of political turmoil and hybridity, or very specifically as “Greece,
                  but living Greece no more! / So coldly sweet, so deadly fair” (<em>Giaour</em> 91-2). Certainly, the few images we have of her show her in a highly Orientalized
                  dress, vaguely vapid in appearance and often staring into the middle distance (Figures
                  2 and 3).

                  depicting the leading ladies of his poetry, which serve as a mere pretext for the
                  creation of exotic albums filled with lush images. In no way do these engravings serve
                  as illustrations of the poems or their action, and what is notable about Leila’s image
                  is that she could be represented by any young woman from the Peloponnese.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Astarte, however, has a far more complex and sensational history. One reason for this
                  is that she was based on a real woman and was repeatedly identified as a representation
                  of Byron’s half-sister and lover, Augusta Leigh. As Peter Manning quite rightly observes,
                  “In an understandable effort to circumvent the scandalmongering that befuddled earlier
                  interpretations, criticism has tended lately to minimize the importance of incest
                  in the drama” (77). Modern critics are wary of indulging in biographical readings
                  of the play and even when read biographically, recent criticism has denied Augusta
                  her role in the drama. Peter Cochran thus argues that “Astarte—all that <em>Manfred</em> offers by way of heroine—is often taken, by those intent on creating sensation at
                  all costs, to be a version of his half-sister Augusta; but I’d argue that in her remoteness
                  and verbal economy Astarte is closer to Annabella” (<em>Manfred</em> 15).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Annabella Milbanke and Byron were married on January 2nd 1815. The marriage was a
                           disaster and the couple separated shortly thereafter, with rumors of the poet’s incestuous
                           relations with his half sister, Augusta, and acts of sodomy circulating around the
                           case.</span></div>
                  </div> And yet, whatever modern criticism might think of Astarte’s identity or poetic function,
                  Byron’s contemporaries were generally in agreement that Augusta was the model of Manfred’s
                  criminal love.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Having said this, I won’t rehearse the, indeed, sensational and often unpleasant details
               of the affair between Byron and Augusta, nor go over all the shocked references to
               it by the poem’s reviewers. To summarize briefly: when <em>Manfred</em> was published in 1817, shortly after Byron’s ignominious departure from England,
               London society was waiting for yet more scandal to feed the growing interest in the
               unfolding saga of his separation from Annabella. Few reviewers of this new poetic
               drama missed the fact that Astarte was described as the sister and the lover of this
               Byronic hero, and the commentaries on the poetic drama did little to quell the crescendoing
               gossip. <em><span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Belle Assembleé</span></em>remarked rather coyly that “this drama is interesting, yet there are many domestic
               allusions, from which works of a dramatic nature should ever be free” (Reiman II:107).
               The <em>European Magazine</em>, however, issued its own more damning and decidedly more pointed review of <em>Manfred</em> in August of 1817, first summarizing the incest plot for its readers and then suggesting
               that this crime was the key to—if not Manfred’s—then at least the poet’s hidden meaning.
               Here, we are told, the “wretched brother more fully, though still darkly and ambiguously,
               alludes to the early circumstances of his life, (which) will more clearly enable readers
               to judge if we have made a correct guess at the elucidation of the noble poet’s story”
               (Reiman II:963). Such reviews seem mean spirited, but there is much to suggest that
               Byron was very aware of the brouhaha that he would create with <em>Manfred</em>’s publication. He noted in a letter to Augusta written in March of 1818 that he is
               curious as to whether the publication of <em>Manfred</em> has caused a “pucker” (qtd. in Lovelace 168). Augusta wrote back that she had been
               hurt both by the subject matter of the poem and by Byron’s apparent insensitivity
               to her plight, left behind as she was to face the Manfredian music on her own. “A
               propos of ‘puckers’ I thought there was unkindness which I did not expect, in doing
               what was but too sure to cause one—&amp; so—I said nothing—&amp; perhaps should not but for
               your questions” (qtd. in Lovelace 168). And a pucker there was. The Hon. Mrs. Villiers,
               an ally of Annabella Milbanke, wrote to the poet’s estranged wife that the <em>Day and New Times</em> of June 1817 had released a review of <em>Manfred</em> in which “the allusions to Augusta are dreadfully clear. No avowal could be more
               complete. It is too barefaced for her friends to attempt to deny the allusion” (qtd.
               in Lovelace 166).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>So strong was the assumption that <em>Manfred</em> represented Byron’s (as well as his tortured hero’s) confession of a secret sin that
                  other reviewers also made explicit reference to it. The reviewer for the <em>Theatrical Inquisitor</em>, for example, worries “we hope for the sake of manhood and morality, that the rumor
                  is incorrect which has identified his inmost feelings with the subject before us”
                  and we as readers are urged to “turn away from this book at this repulsive point”
                  (Reiman V:2266-7). Indeed, many critics in either veiled or quite brazen terms make
                  reference to <em>Manfred</em> as a potential clue to the events leading up to the poet’s separation from his wife.
                  Their greatest frustration, however, was that Byron’s absence from England made it
                  impossible to see the effect that these accusations and condemnations had on him.
                  Guilt could not be read on his countenance as one might the visage of any of his great
                  “Conradian” heroes because he was well and truly hidden from society’s gaze. This
                  was Byron’s great advantage and Augusta’s recurring tragedy. For, if Byron’s behavior
                  could not be scrutinized for signs of moral depravity and guilt, then his partner-in-crime’s
                  behavior could. It is for this reason that Augusta, left to the vigilant reforming
                  zeal of Annabella and her circle, was rigidly policed and regimented so as to erase
                  or obfuscate any possible outward signs of a criminal relationship to Byron. She was
                  publicly “forgiven” and supported by Annabella, but only to ensure that she did not
                  go to join her half-brother in Italy; her letters were rewritten by Annabella and
                  her actions supervised so as to produce the most convincing image of innocence. In
                  so doing, Augusta protected not only her own reputation, but Annabella’s as well.
                  Augusta agonized over how to redeem her reputation after Byron’s departure, and when
                  the spectral shadow of her past rose before her in the image of <em>Manfred</em>’s Astarte only a year later it was a considerable blow. What Augusta knew, and what
                  Byron failed to acknowledge, was that it was not to the Byronic hero of <em>Manfred </em>to which the public turned to decipher the truth of the poet’s incestuous relations,
                  but to Astarte/Augusta. Augusta quite literally stood in for Astarte in the popular
                  imagination of the day, as is made very clear by the infamous publication of Harriet
                  Beecher Stowe’s 1869 <em>Lady Byron Vindicated</em>. Stowe, freed from her promise of discretion to Annabella by her death, reveals to
                  the world “the truth” about Augusta and Byron (236-7). A cartoon that appeared in <em>Merryman’s Monthly</em> in October of 1869 makes the connection to <em>Manfred</em> very clear, referencing as it does in its description, Stowe’s raising of Byron’s
                  demonic spirit in this writer’s own version of the Manfredian “Incantation.”

                  iteration as the fragment of a Witch’s Drama, commonly believed to be a sly swipe
                  at Annabella.

                           to “the period of my married life with Annabella Milbanke” (206).</span></div>
                  </div> Here, Manfred/Byron appears as a demonic spirit through Stowe’s conjuring. It came

                  </div> felt the need to publish his own 1906 defense of his grandmother under the title, <em>Astarte: A Fragment of Truth.</em> As he observes in the purple prose for which the entire text is remarkable, “Astarte
                  (Augusta) was haunted and ridden by a spectral Astarte vivified for a flash of time
                  out of the eternal silences to prophesy judgment by the infernal gods upon Manfred”
                  (<em>Lovelace</em> 70). For Byron’s contemporaries and even for subsequent generations, <em>Manfred</em> was a play that was first and foremost about deciphering Augusta, for it was only
                  by reading and understanding her poetic incarnation, Astarte, that one could now hope
                  to learn anything about the poet himself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>With this in mind, what are we to make of the ways in which Astarte is depicted? One
                  of the earliest images of Astarte appears in <em>Finden’s Byron’s Beauties</em> in 1836. 
                  <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image6Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 6" class="inline"/></figure> Like the images of Leila we have already seen, the image of Astarte in <em>Finden’s Byron’s Beauties</em> (Figure 6) is taken out of its narrative context—even more so than in the illustrations
                  of Leila who at least looked appropriately Turkish in dress. <em>Finden’s</em> Astarte, however, is represented as a Greek goddess, perhaps gesturing to a Hellenized
                  version of the Persian deity, Ishtar. In true Hellenic style, she sports carefully
                  coiled hair, Chiton, and an arm bracelet. Innocent and demure, this Astarte seems
                  an unlikely partner for Manfred, not to mention her being curiously dressed for a
                  resident of the Alps. The text that accompanies the heroine’s image is noteworthy:
                  Byron’s heroines, it is insisted, “are solitary symbols of loveliness which need no
                  foil” (Finden vii). They are admirably adapted for isolated pictorial illustration,
                  we are told, since their charm exists not in “the dramatic action in which they are
                  engaged,” but “in their intensity of individual feeling” (Finden vii). The artist
                  of this portrait of Astarte is careful to remove any possible hint of a context that
                  might draw the reader’s attention back to the action of <em>Manfred</em> and its scandalous associations in part because this album was produced specifically
                  for young women and devotees of the poet. The illustration itself is accompanied by
                  a long quotation from “Professor (John) Wilson,” a frequent contributor to <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em> where he served on the editorial board, often publishing under the alias “Christopher
                  North.” Wilson, who was made professor of moral philosophy at Edinburgh University
                  in 1820, positions Astarte as “young, beautiful, innocent.” He does not deny her guilt
                  but assures us that she has been “murdered—judged [and] pardoned” (qtd. in Finden
                  vii). She was, Wilson insists, a soul cleansed of sin: “At last, she rises up before
                  us in all the mortal silence of a ghost, and with fixed, glazed, and passionless eyes,
                  revealing death, judgment, and eternity” (qtd. in Finden vii). What we find in her
                  figure, then, is all passion spent. If there had been any guilt, we need not concern
                  ourselves with it. Innocence and purity now reside in <em>her</em> looks and the implication is that, since a judgment has already been passed on Byron,
                  the presumed instigator of the crime, it would be presumptuous of us to attempt a
                  judgment of our own. Along these same lines, a production of <em>Manfred</em> was mounted in Covent Garden in 1834 for a total of 36 performances.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                           Burwick’s words, as “the incarnation of Byron” (80).</span></div>
                  </div> Augusta attended one of them and saw herself represented in angelic form, surrounded
                  by spirits as she embarked on the salvation of her fictional brother. In this adaptation
                  of the play, when Manfred is about to die, Astarte appears before him and cries out:
                  “Manfred! Look up! I do forgive thee” (qtd. in Cochran, <em>Theater</em> 175).

                  </div> And so again, all is forgiven, heaven sought, judgment passed.</p>
            </div>
            <p>In two slightly later illustrations, we see the act of judgment in process. In an
               1838 illustration (Figure 7), Manfred reaches out to embrace Astarte, who, again looking
               like a Hellenic deity, arches away from his grasp in a gesture of modesty and evasion.
               </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image7Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 7" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> She is surrounded by a bright cloud or nimbus and her arms stretch up to the heavens.
               Manfred’s gesture, while clearly reaching out to the image, is as much one of adulation
               and reverence as desire. His sword points down to the ground in the shape of a cross
               and a skull lies in the corner as a <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">memento mori</span>. The room he inhabits is in every other way, scrupulously academic, with open texts,
               a globe, and instruments. The second image (Figure 8), almost certainly crudely copied
               from the first (circa 1854), represents a similar composition but a very different
               moral. </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image8Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 8" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> Astarte is now a voluptuous siren, her breasts fully exposed to her brother’s gaze
               beneath her diaphanous shroud. Manfred encircles the form in a gesture of passionate
               excitement, his robes rising with his sudden movement. His sword has morphed into
               a candelabra that symbolically burns, shall we say, rather brightly. The background
               has also undergone a tonal shift; it is now a sepulchral and gothic space, its décor
               given to skulls, crows, and snakes. Astarte, far from reaching up to heaven in a celestial
               arabesque, now reaches behind her head, her hand a claw that visually echoes the beak
               of the vulture above her. The iconography is equally clear. In this interpretation
               of the action, Manfred and Astarte have been judged—and damned—for their sins.</p>
            <p>By the mid-century, the interpretive attitude to Byron’s drama and potentially to
               Byron’s judgment shifted again. Astarte has left the pagan Elysian fields for a more
               conventional realm of Christian blessedness. It would seem that a pagan gesture of
               forgiveness from a Hellenic Astarte was too ambiguous for Byron’s defenders: the blessing
               now had to come from the Virgin Mary herself. Indeed, in the following two images
               of Astarte, dated 1849 (Figure 9) and 1891 (Figure 10) respectively, the young woman
               takes on all the iconographic attributes of the intercessor of man with God. In the
               first image, the iconography is so reminiscent of classic Mariology as to belie the
               context of <em>Manfred</em> all together. She might as well be an icon. In the second image, the artist at least
               places Manfred in the picture, who bends in reverence to the spirit before him. </p>

            <p> A book lies open on the ground beside him and gone is the paraphernalia of the sorcerer
               dabbling in an infernal realm. This is an image of a sinful man in a state of repentance
               and humility—hardly the image of Byron’s disdainful Manfred who defies the spiritual
               forces that threaten him with a sneer.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The final Astarte image I want to discuss, however, is by far the most interesting.
                  (Figure 11) 
                  <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image11Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 11" class="inline"/></figure> The original painting is by John Roberts Herbert, who produced several Byron illustrations
                  in the late 1830s, including images of Don Juan, the Corsair, Beppo and Foscari, all
                  circa 1838.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>My thanks to the Herbert scholar, Nancy Langham Cooper, who helped me to date this
                           particular image of Astarte and Manfred to circa 1838. For more on Herbert see Cooper.</span></div>
                  </div> Once more we have the Madonna and penitent composition that we have seen before, but
                  with some important variations. At this point, even the book has disappeared from
                  Manfred’s side, and he now simply kneels, hands clasped in supplication before the
                  figure of Astarte, who is once more surrounded by a celestial nimbus. But the lovers
                  are no longer alone. Now a row of angels can be seen lining the wall behind the central
                  figures, their heads buried in their hands in sorrow.</p>
            </div>
            <p>How are we to read this interpretation of the action? Is this an image of the act
               of forgiveness with the angelic host appearing as evidence of Astarte’s innocence
               and thus Manfred’s redemption? Arguably not. In fact, this engraving is the most damning
               of all those we have seen thus far, partially because in this representation of Astarte,
               unlike all the others, she is depicted in modern dress. No longer does she resemble
               a goddess, a muse, or even the Virgin Mary—now she looks like a young woman just about
               to step out for a ball. If one studies the dress style of the late 1830s and early
               40s—tight bodice, layered with an overskirt, full sleeves and off the shoulder cut—one
               sees that this Astarte embodies it perfectly. (Figure 12) Even the chain girdle that
               hangs from Astarte’s waist (something that was very popular in the sixteenth century,
               it is true) made a fashion comeback in 1836 London as a Chatelaine. (Figure 13) </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image12Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 12" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> Herbert has carefully woven elements of the old and the new here, but his Astarte
               would not at all be out of place in a contemporary society ballroom—or, indeed, in
               Augusta Leigh’s circle.</p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image13Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 13" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p>What is Herbert doing in this image? Why is his Astarte so clearly marked as a modern
               woman? The answer, of course, is that he has very cagily drawn the acknowledged but
               unspoken parallel between Astarte and her supposed biographical model, Augusta. If
               this hypothesis is correct, then the message does not bode well for Byron’s spiritual
               state. For, while it is possible to read the gesture of Astarte as one of absolution,
               I think this unlikely given a comparison with a second Herbert painting from 1851,
               “The Judgment of Daniel” (Figure 14). </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image14Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 14" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> Here, too, the blessed figure holds a hand up in exactly the same gesture that we
               see from Astarte, but in the case of Daniel, we can be certain that this expresses
               condemnation and not absolution, since he is in the process of condemning the elderly
               judges to death for their false accusations of Susanna, now found innocent of adultery.
               </p>
            <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/manfred/images/McDayter/mcdayter_image15Thumb.jpeg" alt="Figure 15" class="inline"/></figure>
            <p> The Byronic hero is explicitly being chastised and judged by Augusta’s stand-in,
               Astarte. Penitent though he may appear, he is not forgiven, and the angels weep in
               despair at the sight of his figure bathed in ominous shadows. Unlike the Covent Garden
               Astarte, this spirit does not speak in a voice of forgiveness, but her lofty silence
               speaks volumes.</p>
            <p>To conclude, there is something rather poignant in these many nineteenth-century images
               of Astarte as a powerful force who dominates, judges, and directs the Byronic hero’s
               moral path. For if ever there was a figure less likely to be held up as a moral guide,
               it was Augusta. But we have been complicit in this process too: our critical reluctance
               to be seen as sensational and our refusal to study the very real role that Augusta
               played in Byron’s life, creative or otherwise, has silenced Astarte/Augusta and made
               her as invisible as Annabella could have wished. This is not to say that Augusta and
               the issue of incest <em>should</em> be seen to be at the heart of <em>Manfred</em> or indeed any other text by Byron—but to ignore her presence seems to me equally
               wrongheaded. Having been silenced and bullied into at least the performance of middle-class
               morality after Byron’s departure for the continent, Augusta, alone and isolated, was
               never allowed a public voice again. On her deathbed, after a painful decline, she
               had tried to communicate one last message to the world. Predictably, it could not
               be understood.</p>

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><span class="noteBody">In John Wilson’s review of <em>Manfred</em> for <em>Blackwood’s Magazine</em> (June 1817), the critic, while fundamentally approving of the poem, is critical of
               the unnecessary confusion that dominates the plot. He observes that “it is difficult
               to comprehend distinctly the drift of the composition, and almost impossible to give
               anything like a direct account of it” (119). Similarly, the reviewer for the <em>Critical Review</em> (July 1813) argues that, while on a second reading he was not as disturbed by the
               confusion at the heart of <em>The Giaour</em>’s plot, he was annoyed by it at first. “It is possible, he says, “that possession
               of a key to the mystery that it involves, might obviate much of an objection to which
               we presume that it will by most readers be considered mainly liable, especially of
               such as are not satisfied unless everything be perfectly clear and intelligible to
               them on first perusal” (II.620).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               desire in this poem, see Bari.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><span class="noteBody">Jerome Christensen writes, “Love for Leila is like love for nature, or an unspoiled
               Greece” (93), while for David Roessel “[t]he use of the loaded word <em>tyranny</em>, which could be used almost as a synonym for Ottoman rule, links the personal freedom
               of Leila to the political freedom of Greece implied in the historical setting of the
               poem (sometime after 1770)” (56).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><span class="noteBody">Richardson is quick to problematize the easy opposition between East and West that
               we are tempted to assume in these characters’ national associations. He makes a strong
               argument for Byron’s attempt to complicate this binary throughout <em>The Giaour </em>, in part by having Leila described as a Circassian who embodies not only beauty but
               hybridity (221).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">5. </span><span class="noteBody">Annabella Milbanke and Byron were married on January 2<span class="sup">nd</span> 1815. The marriage was a disaster and the couple separated shortly thereafter, with
               rumors of the poet’s incestuous relations with his half sister, Augusta, and acts
               of sodomy circulating around the case.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">As McGann observes, most readers would have understood Byron’s reference to the “Incantation”
               as “an unfinished Witch Drama, which was begun some years ago” as a vicious reference
               to “the period of my married life with Annabella Milbanke” (206).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
