          <p rend="noCount"><title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> represent antitheses of Byron’s

              underlying both works. Despite the apparent extreme contrast between the personalities and experiences of the poems’
              protagonists, both their tales embed a two-part structure, the first part focusing on heterosexual transgression, 
              the culmination, an all-male scene of reckoning.</p>

          <p>Byron completed <title level="m">Manfred</title> in the summer of 1817, just one year before beginning 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, yet the contrast between Byron’s two most remarkable poetic achievements could 
              not be more obvious. Byron, at least, saw it that way, declaring <title level="m">Manfred</title> “too much in my old 
              style,” while <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is in the new “style and manner of <title level="m">Beppo</title>” 
              (<title level="m">BLJ</title> V:185, VII:67). Who could seem more unlike one another than Don Juan and Manfred, and what 
              two story lines could possibly be more dissimilar than theirs as Byron presents them? Loving one woman too much and to 
              the exclusion of all others is ostensibly the fate of Byron’s solitary Alpine brooder; guilt haunts him, and 
              forgetfulness is the one thing he longs for. The hyper-gregarious hero from sunny Spain that Byron adopts for 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title> is defined by not loving any woman for more than a few fleeting moments; he seems 
              utterly lacking a capacity for guilt, and forgetfulness is the wind beneath his wings. Yet the protagonists of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and their life stories have much in common, 
              as different as they appear to be at first glance. It’s not merely that the poems share a philosophical viewpoint, 
              as one might expect to find in two works by a given author. Peel away a thin layer of their narrative surfaces and 
              deconstruct Byron’s “mock” recasting of the Don Juan source material, and you will find that these two poems share 
              a deep structure: the outline of a common story and central character.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In this paper <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, italicized, refers to Byron’s poem,
              pronounced Don Joo-an, while when not italicized, Don Juan should be read as Don Hwan, the protagonist of numerous European 
              works. The relation of the character of Manfred to that of Don Juan, despite their antithetical personalities and life
              stories, has not gone entirely unnoticed. Romantic literary and musical interpretations of Don Juan in fact show more 
              of an influence of <title level="m">Manfred</title> than of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>. Thus, Svetlana Klimova 
              points out that the hero of A. K. Tolstoy’s <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (1862) “is much closer to the ‘classical 
              Byronic hero’ than to Byron’s Don Juan . . . [and] reveals Tolstoy’s debt not only to Goethe . . . but also to Byron’s 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title>” (344). Thomas Gray, writing about the figure of Don Giovanni in Romantic music, notes
              “the overwhelming impact of Lord Byron’s literary oeuvre and persona on the collective cultural imagination of Europe 
              in the 1810s and twenties,” but offers the caveat that Byron’s “own epic-satiric poem, <title level="m">Don Juan</title>,”
              is “one of his few major works entirely unsusceptible to dramatic or operatic adaptation.” Rather, Gray explains, the 
              “unbridled, hedonistic exuberance” of Mozart’s character” is in Romantic works tempered “with new Byronic shadows . . . 
              is suffused with a newly Romantic chiaroscuro,” so that Richard Wagner “carries the brooding Byronization of the Don 
              Juan figure to an extreme in the person of the Flying Dutchman, the doom-driven spectral seducer in search of redemptive
              quiescence” (78-79).</note></p>
          <p>Because Byron’s ironic treatment of the Don Juan source material initially obscures the connection between 
              <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and <title level="m">Manfred</title>, my point of departure is a consideration of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> alongside a more straightforward treatment of the Don Juan story well-known in Byron’s 
              day and ever since: namely, Mozart’s incomparable opera <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, with a libretto by Lorenzo
              da Ponte. Noting resemblances between the opera and <title level="m">Manfred</title> helps illuminate the fact that,
              despite how different these poems appear to be, <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan </title>
              are two variations on the same plot and the same central character. Indeed, regarding these two poems almost as one
              continuous work helps illuminate important themes latent in both of them.</p>
          <!--MS SHOWS SECTION BREAK HERE: HOW TO SHOW?-->
          <p>The culminating scene in <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, the Commendatore scene, is one of the most musically
              thrilling and dramatically powerful scenes in opera. In this scene the Don locks hands with a statue that he has invited 
              to dinner: the statue of the Commendatore whom (in Act I) Don Giovanni killed in a duel after the Commendatore intervened
              to prevent the Don’s seduction or rape (interpretations vary) of his daughter. The parallels between this scene in the
              opera and the final scene in <title level="m">Manfred</title> with respect to action, character, imagery, and general 
              atmosphere are immediately obvious. In the opera, the statue repeatedly demands—in a resonant <foreign xml:lang="it">
              basso profundo</foreign> and more in anger than sorrow—the Don’s repentance for the dissolute ways of his life; the 
              villain refuses to repent, and he is finally engulfed in the flames of hell, as his servant, Leporello, looks on in 
              terror. In the final scene of <title level="m">Manfred</title>, a larger-than-life, indeed otherworldly, male figure,
              identified as the Spirit, similarly booms forth his implacable taunts and demands, beckoning Manfred to his final doom,
              while the Abbot looks on, fearful for Manfred (though not, he claims, for himself).<note place="foot" resp="editors">Despite 
              the obvious and significant similarity between the final scene in <title level="m">Manfred</title> and the Commendatore 
              scene in <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, I have found only one reference to it, in <title level="m">Schumann</title> by 
              Eric Frederick Jensen (50). Whether Byron had ever seen Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> is an open 
              question. The short answer is probably not. <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, which premiered in Prague in 1787 and
              had its Italian premier in Rome in 1811, did not receive its London premiere until 1817, after Byron had left England, 
              and was not performed in Venice until 1833 (strange though that seems for an enormously popular opera that, in the first
              fifty years since its premiere “made its way all around Europe, and as far afield as New York and Calcutta”) (Parakilas
              253). That said, Byron revised Act III of <title level="m">Manfred</title> in April and May of 1817, during which time 
              he had left Venice for Rome, traveling through Ferrara, Bologna, and Florence. Regular operagoer that he was, he could
              possibly have caught a performance of Mozart’s opera while on his travels. It should be noted that the first version of 
              Act III, written in Switzerland, has none of the <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> elements: no Abbott or Spirit, no
              scene of Manfred’s repeated rejection and denial. Regardless of whether Byron had seen a complete production in a major
              opera house of Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, he would undoubtedly have been familiar with some version 
              of the statue scene, elements of which found its way into <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s revised third act. For one
              thing, Da Ponte’s libretto borrowed heavily from a libretto by Giovanni Bertati, which was used in two other 
              <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title> operas frequently performed in Venice. Furthermore, the ubiquity, both in England
              prior to Byron’s departure and in Italy, of theatrical, balletic, and amateur operatic performances of scenes from 
              Mozart’s <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as well as of other Don Juan dramas, make it highly unlikely that Byron
              would not, at some point, have seen something very much like the Commendatore scene familiar to most of us through 
              Mozart’s opera. As Byron noted of the hero of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, he is known to us from “plays in five, 
              and operas in three acts,” and “We all have seen him in the pantomime / Sent to the devil, somewhat ere his time” 
              (I: ll. 1620, 7-8).</note></p>
          <p>Thus, both scenes involve three male figures. At the center is the work’s hero (or anti-hero), a charismatic aristocrat, 
              a sexual taboo breaker (if not actual criminal) who remains fearless and unrepentant in his final hour. Next is his
              antagonist, a supernaturally powerful, older, punishing, or at least challenging, male figure who demands something of 
              the hero: the Commendatore demands the Don’s repentance; the Spirit demands that Manfred go with him. In 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title>, too, there is a plea for the hero’s repentance, which comes from the Abbot in Act III,
              scene one. The third man present in the scene—Leporello in the opera, the Abbot in <title level="m">Manfred</title>—is 
              an onlooker; lacking the stature both of the hero and of the supernatural figure, he is merely a human being with 
              normal responses, registering, like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, the terrors that the audience must feel.</p>
          <p>In addition to the male triangle that structures these scenes, they share other features. Both heroes verbally communicate
              death’s taking hold of them: Don Giovanni cries out, “What strange tremor now assails my spirits!”;<note place="foot" resp="editors"> 
              <foreign xml:lang="it">Da qual tremore insolito sento assalir gli spiriti!</foreign> Quotations from <title level="m">
              Don Giovanni</title> are from the libretto accompanying the CD recording by the Théâtre National de l’Opéra, Paris 
              (CBS, 1979), English translation by Lionel Salter. I have occasionally provided a more literal translation than Salter’s,
              which was made to correspond to the Italian verse line.</note> Manfred observes, “I feel my soul / Is ebbing from me”
              (III.iv.99-100). Death-related coldness is invoked in both scenes: when Don Giovanni takes the Statue’s hand, he
              shudderingly exclaims, “<foreign xml:lang="it">Che gelo e questo mai</foreign>!”; the Abbot, taking the hand of Manfred 
              in his dying moment, observes: “Cold—cold—even to the heart” (III.iv.149). Thus, too, a male handclasp occurs in both
              scenes. Both works culminate in a terrifying glimpse of the afterlife, and both heroes (or are they villains?) expire
              supernaturally: that is, from no known bodily cause. Also worth considering is the Abbot’s reference to the Spirit as 
              one of Manfred’s “guests” (III.iii.73). While Manfred does not appear to extend an invitation to the Spirit in the way 
              that Don Giovanni famously invites his “stone guest” to dinner, the verbal echo is resonant: the protagonists’ fate is 
              one they themselves invite—one might say desire.<note place="foot" resp="editors">“Stone guest,” the common epithet for the statue 
              in <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, derives from <foreign xml:lang="es">El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de
              piedra</foreign>, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso de Molina that was the source for later Don Juan
              dramatizations.</note></p>
          <p>But the most striking thematic and dramatic similarity between the final scenes of the opera and the play is their 
              emphasis on the hero’s defiance in the face of supernatural threats and conventional moral or religious claims. It’s 
              true that, consistent with the original story and audience tastes, the opera affirms Christian beliefs by presenting 
              a horrified and groaning Don Giovanni swallowed by the terrors of hell, followed by the happy moralizing of the finale
              (“heaven has avenged us all,” etc.). In this respect the opera presents a distinct contrast with <title level="m">
              Manfred</title>, whose hero finds it “not so difficult to die,” having denied all supernatural powers, infernal or
              otherwise, external to the human mind (III.iv.151). Yet the brief display of hellfire at the end of the Commendatore 
              scene (often an occasion for hokey stage effects) feels like an afterthought compared to the thrilling power of the 
              scene leading up to that point. Dramatically and musically, the force of the scene derives from the sudden appearance 
              of the Commendatore, his threatening commands, and the defiance of a fearless man who, even in the face of death and 
              the terrors of hell, refuses to repent:<quote>

              The final “No!” is not so much sung as shouted from the very depths of the baritone’s being. The repetition of 
              Manfred’s contemptuous exclamations of rejection is likewise the core of the final scene of Byron’s drama:<quote>

          <p>That the ending of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>—in other words, the classic ending of the Don Juan 
              dramatizations ubiquitous in early nineteenth-century Europe—should bear such striking resemblance to the ending
              of <title level="m">Manfred</title> might surprise us. After all, in all other respects, as I noted at the outset, 
              the tone and content of <title level="m">Manfred</title> could not seem more unrelated to that of Mozart’s 
              <foreign xml:lang="it">dramma giocosa</foreign>. Yet since Byron did, as we well know, write a poem utilizing the 
              Don Juan story, observing the classic Don Juan ending in <title level="m">Manfred</title> immediately suggests the
              possibility of a connection between Byron’s metaphysical drama and his mock epic. The line of connection may be easily
              discovered by recalling the source for the many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century, French, English, and Italian
              adaptations of the Don Juan tale, <title level="m"><foreign xml:lang="es">El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de
              piedra</foreign></title>, the early seventeenth-century play by Tirso de Molina. As its two-part title suggests, 
              Tirso’s drama was very likely an engrafting of two legends: the escapades of a libertine and the story of a statue who
              comes to dinner and drags the sinner off to hell (Waxman 189). Thus, it’s easy to see how Byron’s <title level="m">Don
              Juan</title> bears reference to the first part of Tirso’s play, and <title level="m">Manfred</title> to the denouement,
              which the uncompleted <title level="m">Don Juan</title> does not arrive at (though Candace Tate, in her psychological
              reading of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, suggests that Juan’s encounter with the Black Friar, aka the Duchess of
              Fitz-Fulke, at the close of the sixteenth canto, is indeed relatable to Tirso’s and Mozart’s scene of the avenging stone
              guest [147]). But the material common to <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, as
              highlighted by their connection to the Don Juan story, is found not merely in the way one work corresponds to the first
              part of the Don’s adventures, the other to his demise, but in fact is found more broadly throughout both works.</p>
          <p>To begin with, the heroes of both poems, indeed the poems themselves, represent challenges to authority, religious 
              authority in particular. This is something both works have in common with the Don Juan source material. Tirso’s title
              identifies Don Juan not as a lover, but as a <foreign xml:lang="it">burlador</foreign>, a word commonly connoting
              “seducer,” but, as its etymological relation to burlesque suggests, more literally meaning mocker or trickster. Tirso de
              Molina was a monk, and his play was intended to ridicule the hypocritical, cheaply purchased repentance that allowed
              wealthy immoralists to misbehave. Later interpretations have seen in Don Juan’s libertinism and mockery a challenge not
              merely to a corrupt clergy, but to the taboos themselves, and in some cases to religion itself, when set against human
              drives and rational understanding. Now, the mocking element is certainly just as strong in <title level="m">Manfred</title>
              as it is in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>; both works take up cudgels against “cant moral” and “cant religious” 
              (<title level="m">The Works of Lord Byron</title>, V:542). While a comic turn to the satire is overt in <title
              level="m">Don Juan</title>, the burlesque element of the original version of the third act of <title level="m">Manfred
              </title><note place="foot" resp="editors">After John Gifford criticized the original third act of <title level="m">
              Manfred</title>, Byron rewrote it sometime between 25 April and 5 May 1817. It is this revised third act that has been
              transmitted through all printed editions of the poem. For the original version of Act III, see <title level="m">CPW
              </title>IV.67-71.</note>—as it takes aim at an Abbot who demands, along with Manfred’s repentance, a “gift of all [his]
              lands / To the Monastery” (<title level="m">CPW</title> IV:468)—reveals a kinship between the spirit of Byron’s somber
              drama and his “merry” poem (<title level="m">Don Juan</title> IV.39).</p>
          <p>But beyond the poems’ challenges to religion and traditional mores, reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> in its relation 
              to <title level="m">Don Juan</title> illuminates significant embedded themes that they share. Such a reading begins with 
              the observation that the two-part structure of Tirso’s drama, of its various literary and operatic descendants, and of 
              <title level="m">Manfred</title> is noticeably gendered: women define the content of the first part of the narrative, men
              the second.<note place="foot" resp="editors">In <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, the intense maleness of the
              Commendatore scene, following the opera’s series of girl-chasing episodes, is hard not to notice, if only with respect 
              to the vocal element. A comment posted at a YouTube recording of the Commendatore scene goes as follows: “There is not a
              tenor or soprano on that stage. It’s two basses and a baritone going at it. I love this. . . .”</note> The life of 
              taboo-breaking pleasure focuses on women (or a woman); the scene of fear, threat, punishment and/or triumph is a 
              homosocial scene. An Oedipal triangle? The law of the father? A scene of male bonding? However one interprets it, the
              legendary Don Juan and Manfred, the first part of whose stories centers on heteroerotics, reach their tragic apotheosis 
              in an all-male world. (Here, by the way, is a distinct departure from <title level="m">Faust</title>, which bears certain
              resemblances to the legend of Don Juan as it does to <title level="m">Manfred</title>, but which culminates in the lure 
              of the Eternal Feminine.)</p>
          <p>The contest between men, the agon of son and father, is implicit throughout Don Juan’s escapades with women, not just in 
              the final scene of reckoning. While women are the Don’s obvious target, his misbehavior with them mocks, in the most 
              direct and personal way, the authority of their lovers, husbands, and fathers, the power and laws of men.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors">As Marina Warner points out: “In <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as in earlier, Spanish versions 
              of the Don Juan story, women are the immediate objects of the hero’s desire, but the ultimate targets of his exploits 
              are men, the men who hold the women in their keeping: fathers, husbands, fiancés . . .  [W]omen are prizes at stake in 
              a struggle for power between men” (94-95).</note>Thus, in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Juan’s lovemaking first
              cuckolds an old husband, then undermines a tyrant father, then outwits a sultan, and then takes aim at the English 
              country gentry. Peter Manning, discussing “the ubiquitous and decisive presence of fathers, father figures, and ancestors”
              in <title level="m">Manfred</title>, observes that “Byron’s pattern of setting Manfred in relief against other male 
              figures culminates in the soliloquy which opens the last scene of the play” (906). In that soliloquy, Manfred recalls
              standing “within the Coliseum’s wall, / ‘Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome” (III.iv.10-1):<quote>
          <lg style="stanza"><l>With silent worship of the Great of old,</l>
              <l>The dead, but sceptered, Sovereigns, who still rule</l>
              <l>Our spirits from their urns. (III.iv.39-41)</l></lg></quote>As Manning explains: “The legendary Caesars, mentioned 
              three times in the first thirty lines of the soliloquy, are the inclusive symbol of the masculine authority to which
              [Manfred] now bows” (907). But the admiration is tinged with ambivalence, as Manfred derides the power of these revered
              fathers, noting that “Caesar’s chambers, and the Augustan halls, / Grovel on earth in indistinct decay” (IV.iv.29-30).
              While a pleasing interpretation of the characters and behavior of Manfred and Juan (as of the legendary Don Juan) is that
              they represent an attack on the Ancien Régime, we do not forget that these characters are themselves aristocrats and are
              empowered and admired on account of that.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Williams writes: “[Don Giovanni] is
              dependent, dialectically, on social institutions which he rejects—wealth, and the liberty given by class.” Williams quotes
              Ernst Bloch’s description: “a strangely ambiguous titanism . . . Does he belong fully to the society of the Ancien Régime,
              as its most ruthless representative, or do we detect in him, in the erotic explosive rebellion, part of a return to
              nature?” (113).</note> Even the pure mountain air and “natural music of the mountain reed” recall to Manfred an idyll
              defined in terms of gender and power: “here the patriarchal days are not / A pastoral fable” (I.ii.49-50). Byron’s own
              anxiety about fathers may be traceable as far back as his early fragment “When to their airy hall my fathers’ voice” (an
              anxiety, incidentally, equaled if not surpassed by Mozart’s towards his father, which some critics have regarded as a
              psychological underpinning of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>).<note place="foot" resp="editors">On Mozart’s
              ambivalence towards the towering figure of his father and its influence on <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, the 
              final scene in particular, see Peter Gay, “The Father’s Revenge.” See also Maynard Solomon, <title level="m">Mozart: A
              Life</title>, p. 246.</note> Thus, attempting to undermine powerful male figures and yet wanting to best them at their 
              own game form the Janus-head of these heroes’ deeds and words.</p>
          <p>To whatever extent Oedipal antagonism underlies the Don’s famed philandering or Manfred’s fateful fidelity, reading any 
              of the Don Juan literature or <title level="m">Manfred</title> without considering how they thematize anxiety about
              heterosexual love is scarcely possible. Some critics have suggested, in fact, that the mysterious taboo relationship 
              in <title level="m">Manfred</title>—“the deadliest sin to love as we have loved”—is not incest but homosexuality
              (II.iv.123).<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Crompton, pages 369-70, notes. G. Wilson Knight considered the “incest
              motif” in Byron’s life “a red herring” and “that a more important and more consistently motivating secret of Byron’s 
              life lay somewhere within the area of homosexuality” (<title level="m">Lord Byron’s Marriage</title>, as discussed in
              Elfenbein, 39). We recall, too, that the first appearance of Astarte in the poem comes when a male spirit (“him, / Who is
              most powerful of ye”) appears “in the shape of a beautiful female figure” (I.i.185<emph>ff</emph>).</note> 
              This is an idea worth pursuing in the present context, even if ultimately one prefers not to translate the poem’s 
              mysteries and destabilizing ambiguities into a fixed code with specific references. Astarte is, after all, an obvious
              mirroring, Manfred’s feminized version of himself:<quote><lg style="stanza">	
                  <l>She was like me in lineaments—her eyes,</l>
                  <l>Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone</l>
                  <l>Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;</l>
                  <l>But soften’d all, and temper’d into beauty;</l>
                  <l>She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,</l>
                  <l>The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind</l>
                  <l>To comprehend the universe: nor these</l>
                  <l>Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,</l>
                  <l>Pity, and smiles, and tears—which I had not;</l>
                  <l>And tenderness—but that I had for her;</l>
                  <l>Humility—and that I never had. (II.ii.105-15)</l></lg></quote>
              Equally significant is the fact that Manfred’s unhappiness and alienation, his sense of difference from other men, date 
              to his youth, in other words predate “that all-nameless hour” that he identifies in Act 1 as the beginning of his 
              suffering and guilt, and which we take to refer to Astarte’s death (see II.ii.50-61).</p>
          <p>And what is the cause of Astarte’s death? Suicide—presumably over guilt or despair at her incest—is hinted at, and 
              many readers have accepted suicide as the cause of her death and, therefore, of Manfred’s guilt.<note place="foot" 
              resp="editors">For example, Jerome McGann notes that “some have argued that Byron deliberately left the nature of [his
              secret] sin vague and mystified. But this is by no means the case, as various early readers show. Reviewing the play 
              in <title level="j">Blackwood’s</title>, John Wilson . . . had no difficulty at all in understanding Manfred’s guilt: 
              ‘. . . Manfred had conceived a mad and insane passion for his sister, named Astarte, and . . . she had, in consequence 
              of their mutual guilt, committed suicide.’ The play is not at all equivocal on these matters” (McGann 15). Elsewhere,
              however, McGann has written, “Astarte of the play is not Augusta . . . [it] is Manfred’s Fate understood as his destined
              and inmost Self, his epipsyche,” thus veering away from “not at all equivocal” with respect to the play’s references to
              incest and his lover’s suicide (<title level="m">CPW</title> 4:467).</note>
              But what is Manfred’s—and <title level="m">Manfred</title>’s—explanation of Astarte’s death?<quote><lg style="stanza">
                  <l>I loved her, and destroy’d her!</l>
                  <l>. . . Not with my hand, but heart—which broke her heart— </l>
                  <l>It gazed on mine, and wither’d. (II.ii.117-9)</l></lg></quote>
              These are crucial lines that, as often as one finds them quoted in criticism of the poem, have not been given the 
              attention they warrant.<note place="foot" resp="editors">An exception is Andrew Elfenbein, who notes that readers “have
              been tempted to invent histories” for Astarte’s death, and that “[t]he issue is not what happened, but what [Manfred]
              thinks happened. According to him the cause of her death was not incest but her gazing upon his heart” (39).</note> 
              Their teasing mysteriousness derives from the interplay of positive declaration of agency (“I . . . destroyed her!”),
              negation of means (“Not with my hand”), metaphoric substitution (“with my . . . heart,” “broke her heart,” “her heart
              . . . gazed on mine”), and passive causation (“withered”). One thing they do not state clearly, if at all, is that 
              Astarte killed herself. The expression “to break someone’s heart” typically means not the sharing of a mutual love but,
              rather, the opposite: rejection, lack of mutual feeling. In fact, the lines seem to suggest that something in Manfred’s
              “heart,” in his inmost being, caused his lover’s heart (i.e., her love, her life) to wither. Perhaps it was this 
              essential, hidden truth of Manfred’s nature—a truth that dare not speak its name—that was fatal to his female lover 
              and caused her to disappear from his life. Certainly, Manfred’s self-accusations heard in the Incantation seem a bit
              excessive for, even incongruent with, one who merely loved not wisely but too well. What does his “cold breast and 
              serpent smile” (I.i.242), his “shut soul’s hypocrisy” (I.i.245), or his “brotherhood of Cain” (I.i.249) have to do with
              Manfred’s avowedly passionate and profound love for Astarte? Cain, of course, was the original slayer of a man more 
              favored by the all-powerful, law-giving father. Such anxiety about masculine identity and power, perhaps underlying
              Manfred’s sense of hypocrisy or sinfulness, was neither caused, nor apparently could be cured, by the love of a good
              woman.</p>
          <p>Of course, we all know what caused the death of Astarte. It was Byron who caused the death of Astarte, in his dream that 
              he called <title level="m">Manfred</title>. If farewells to women are part of the recurrent imagery in the male fantasy
              known as Don Juan, they are certainly also a recurrent motif in the poetry of Lord Byron. From <title level="a">Maid of
              Athens, Ere We Part</title> to <title level="a">So, We’ll go No More A-Roving,</title> Byron’s lyrics repeatedly 
              suggest that pleasure, when it comes to his relationships with women, is ever at its lips bidding adieu.<note place="foot"
              resp="editors">The following lines and titles are among Byron’s numerous farewells to women: “Then fare thee well,

Messalonghi. On this day I complete my thirty-sixth year.</title> Peter
              Cochran stated it flatly: “The Byronic Hero has no time for women" (<title level="m">Byron and Women [and Men]</title>
              xlv).</note> While Byron is hardly the only poet to have made sweet sorrow of lovers’ farewells, in Byron’s case, not 
              only his poetry but his life was a perpetual illustration of the principle he confided to Hobhouse within three months
              after beginning his love affair with Teresa Guiccioli: “that a man should not consume his life at the side and on the
              bosom—of a woman” (<title level="m">BLJ</title> VI:214). Thus, while Manfred self-identifies as the abandoned lover, and
              readers identify Don Juan as the one who abandons, the outcome for these heroes—one might say the desired outcome—
              is the same.</p>
          <p>Citing several references to Manfred’s preoccupation with male power—with serving and swaying—and to his alternating
              guilt over inadequacy and pride in triumph, Manning concludes that “it may seem strange to suggest that one current of 
              the action is Manfred’s struggle to earn a place in the world of men” (906). Strange or not, that assessment certainly
              rings true. About <title level="a">La Belle Dame Sans Merci,</title> Karen Swann observed: “We tend to assume that the
              knight sincerely wants to capture the lady. . . . Focusing on his loss, we fail to notice what he gains at the end of 
              the poem—accession to an all-male community. Could this community, and not the ideal or even the fatal woman, be the 
              true object of his quest?”(90). Focusing on what Manfred identifies as his life-consuming loss, we may fail to notice 
              that his identity is achieved not as a woman’s lover, but in the fantasy of a triumphant contest with powerful male
              authority figures. In discussing Romantic triangles, Sonia Hofkosh noted that the “male relation, like the masculine
              subject, is the primary and prior one; the feminine, empty or derivative,” quoting Mary Jacobus’ explanation that “this
              triangle characteristically invokes its third (female) term only in the interests of the original rivalry and works 
              finally to get rid of the woman” (Hofkosh 102; Jacobus 119). The tales of both Don Juan and Manfred do indeed “get rid 
              of the woman,” and these heroes achieve their end by enormous self-assertion amidst powerful male figures. We might 
              note in passing that the word “love” or “loved” occurs nineteen times in <title level="m">Manfred</title> while “power” 
              or “powers” occurs thirty-nine times.</p>
          <p>Laurence Lipking has quipped that the “true moral of <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, as a libertine might see it,
              seems far from instructive: raping a daughter is permissible, so long as one does not also kill her father” (46). In 
              fact, the heterosexual misbehavior of the legendary Don Juan should be considered in light of the denouement: an anxiety
              dream about male identity, performance, and the laws and power of men. Although Byron presents different surface 
              treatments of this theme in <title level="m">Manfred</title> and <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, its outline is 
              visible in both works.</p>
