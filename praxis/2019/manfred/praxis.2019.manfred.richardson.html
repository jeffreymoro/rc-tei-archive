            <p class="noCount">Early reviewers of Byron's <em>Manfred</em> were troubled by one of the same features that has piqued the interest of readers
               and audiences from Byron's time to the present: its relentless and daring religious
               iconoclasm. Mingling references to Christian beliefs with figures and practices from
               many different traditions, among them Greek mythology, European witchcraft, and various
               "Oriental" religions, and seeming to treat them all with equal skepticism, Byron implicitly
               challenged one of the linchpins of English orthodoxy: the Established Church. In this
               essay, I pay special attention to the array of references to various Asian or "Oriental"
               motifs, including Zoroastrianism and Byron's debt to Montesquieu's representation
               of that religion in his <em>Persian Letters</em>. <em>Manfred</em> is not a work of literary Orientalism, yet its network of Orientalist references
               made a crucial aspect of its radical contemporary impact.</p>

               <p>I begin with a little-known episode in the early reception history of Byron’s <em>Manfred</em>, an episode that reminds us that we can only assume so much about a book’s contemporary
                  audience based on its pricing and print run. Readers, including lower-class readers,
                  will at times show great persistence and ingenuity in getting their hands on a notorious
                  poem or play.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn1" id="ftn1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> One such reader, the artisan, Chartist agitator, and self-educated writer, Thomas
                  Cooper, records his first exposure to Byron’s poetry when, at age thirteen, he managed
                  to get “only a few hours” access to a canto of <em>Childe Harold</em> and the poetic drama, <em>Manfred</em>, which would have been in print for only about a year.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn2" id="ftn2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For an introduction to Cooper and other Romantic-era self-educated readers, see Richardson,
                           Literature, pp. 232-47.</span></div>
                  </div> “I knew nothing of their noble author’s life or reputation,” he continues, “but they
                  seemed to create almost a new sense within me. I wanted more poetry to read from that
                  time; but could get hold of none that thrilled through my nature like Byron’s” (35).</p>
            </div>
            <p>What accounts for this revolution in sensibility in an apprentice shoemaker brought
               about by a single exposure to a difficult, generically uncertain, and deliberately
               evasive work? Certainly, <em>Manfred’</em>s iconoclasm would have appealed to the future radical, not least (especially given
               his midlife period of freethinking and anti-clericalism) its religious iconoclasm,
               a feature that troubled more than one contemporary reviewer. The <em>Literary Gazette</em> noted Manfred’s “conversations with witches, spirits, deities, Nemesis, and Arimanes,”
               commenting: “truly a rather heterogeneous assemblage of mythology” (337-38). The <em>Critical Review</em> also mentions pointedly how Byron draws “at once from the Grecian, Persian, and Gothic
               mythology” (627). Meanwhile, the <em>British Critic and Theological Review</em> vents its anxieties over what it calls a “strange jumble of all the mythologies which
               ever existed” more overtly: “The fire worship of the Persians, the Nemesis of the
               Greeks, the fairy tales of our nursery, are brought into action, and what is worst
               of all, are combined with the appearance of Christianity,” all making for a veritable
               “Olla Podrida,” “execrable” in taste, “in execution absurd” (47). And that was <em>after</em> Byron cut the scene in which the near-Eastern demon, Ashtaroth, carries the Abbot
               of St. Maurice away to a time-out on the highest peak of the Shreckhorn.</p>
            <p>This olla or gumbo or pilaf, this mixture of local and exotic ingredients that is
               <em>Manfred</em>, seems most heterogeneous, not to say incoherent, in its brazen commingling of Alpine
               setting and Orientalist lexicon. John Wilson, writing in <em>Blackwood’s</em>, found the Alpine location central to the style and spirit of the poem: “The action
               is laid among the mountains of the Alps—the characters are all, more or less, formed
               and swayed by the operations of the magnificent scenery around them” (290). And yet
               he describes the majority of these characters as so many “Wild personifications,”
               making the usual remark about the heterogeneity of this Alpine cast: “the Prince of
               the Air, witches, demons, destinies, spirits, and all the tribes of immaterial existences”
               (290, 292). Tribes, perhaps, does double duty here, for Byron has not simply recruited
               his supernatural players from among a variety of ethereal species, but from a decidedly
               global array of cultural traditions as well.</p>
            <p>In his recent book on Romanticism, global war, and global culture, Jeffrey Cox argues
               that what Byron himself called a “mixed mythology of my own” in <em>Manfred</em> implies that “we too should reject any and all providential schemes, for none of
               them can contain the heterodox, heterological ‘nature of this world’” (<em>BLJ</em> V:195; 78). And I agree. But beyond this general point, I wish to devote the rest
               of this essay to examining the particular Orientalist flavors running so boldly through
               Byron’s heterodox mélange. These range from incidental similes and allusions—the dusty
               “Simoom” wind of the Arabian desert, the “Chaldean shepherds” of Mesopotamia, the
               Syrian philosopher and mystic Iamblichus, “he who from out their fountain” raised
               Eros and Anteros (III.i.128, III.ii.13, II.ii.73-4)—to a much more significant network
               of references to Zoroastrianism, comparatively neglected by modern criticism of the
               poem, though noted by those early reviewers who mention its “Persian” mythology. As
               Marilyn Butler argued in her important 1989 essay on “Romantic Manichaeism,” references
               to paganism in the early nineteenth century frequently involved either undermining
               or attempting to shore up the claims of orthodox Christianity, and Zoroastrianism
               in particular became the “thinking radical’s favorite form of paganism” (15). The
               Zoroastrian elements of <em>Manfred</em> go deeper than many of Byron’s readers have supposed.</p>
            <p>Everyone notices, of course, the unexpected presence of Arimanes, that is, Ahriman
               or Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit of Zoroaster’s antithetical cosmology, in
               the cast of Byron’s Alpine Gothic drama. Byron gives Arimanes lordship over all the
               various demons, sprites, witches, and lesser gods mentioned elsewhere in the play,
               whatever their provenance, though Arimanes himself seems ultimately subordinate to
               the “overruling Infinite,” presumably Ohrmazd or Ahura Mazda, Zoroaster’s supreme
               god and the source of all that is good (II.iv.47). But another Zoroastrian figure
               appears in <em>Manfred</em>’s list of <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personae</span> as well, though she has rarely been recognized as such: Manfred’s sister, lover,
               victim, and object of perpetually frustrated desire, Astarte.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Or, at least, Astarte’s name should be taken as Zoroastrian. Byron most likely did
                  not connect the name Astarte with the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, precisely because
                  he introduces Ashtaroth, a corruption of the same name and a totally different character,
                  in one of the excised passages of Act III. Then where did Byron find the name Astarte?
                  As I noted back in 1991 in the <em>Keats-Shelley Journal</em>, Montesquieu’s <em><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">Lettres Persanes</span></em> or <em>Persian Letters</em> contains an interpolated tale guaranteed to have drawn the attention of Byron, with
                  its portrayal of political oppression, lovers separated by arbitrary religious codes,
                  and even an escape from a harem (Richardson, “Astarté”).

                  </div> This tale concerns the history of a Zoroastrian brother and sister who fall in love
                  as children, become separated on account of the invidious laws of their Muslim oppressors,
                  and after various adventures and reverses reunite, marry, and live happily together.
                  The incestuous brother, who recounts the story, is named Apheridon; his sister is
                  named Astarté.</p>

               <p>Thanks to the greatly expanded electronic archive and ever more powerful search engines
                  of the twenty-first century, I can now say that what I took, after duly diligent research
                  and peer review, as an original scholarly discovery of my own was in fact my independent
                  rediscovery of a connection made by Maurice Quinlan in an article on <em>Manfred</em> and Zoroastrianism published in the <em>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</em> in 1958, soon to disappear from Byron scholarship until quite recently (734).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn4" id="ftn4_return"><sup class="super">

                           Astarté made by Alois Brandl in an article published in 1936. For more recent studies,
                           see Cochran, “Byron and the Dualists,” and Cochran, Manfred, pp. 136-43 (“Manfred
                           and Zoroastrianism”).</span></div>
                  </div> Quinlan also anticipates the point about Astarte and Ashtaroth made above, and I am
                  happy for this chance to acknowledge his precedence (734). Quinlan brings in the connection
                  to Montesquieu rather late in his article, however, almost as an afterthought, and
                  I have in contrast come to believe that the story of Apheridon and Astarté plays a
                  larger role in <em>Manfred</em> than either Quinlan or I myself initially believed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>To begin with, Montesquieu seems to go out of his way to make representations of Zoroastrianism
                  attractive for later writers in the radical and skeptical traditions such as Byron
                  and Shelley. Islam (or what the text, in John Ozell’s 1722 translation, terms “<em>Mahometism</em>”), functions as a state-sanctioned, established church under whose “Yoke” the Zoroastrians,
                  or Guebres, live (245, 237).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn5" id="ftn5_return"><sup class="super">

                           1, pp. 234-55).</span></div>
                  </div> In his conversations with Astarté, after she has been forcibly converted to Islam,
                  Apheridon relativizes the truth claims of her new religion by noting the antiquity
                  of their original creed (“the ancientest in the whole world”) and the historical contingency
                  that has made Persia a Muslim state: “it was chance alone that introduced <em>Mahometism</em>” (245). Naturally, much the same could be said of the historical rise of Christianity
                  and its chance spread to Europe and Great Britain. Lamenting his sister’s captivity
                  behind harem walls, Apheridon associates Zoroastrianism with both “sweet Liberty”
                  and female “Equality,” while Islam becomes linked instead with slavery and the oppression
                  of women (244). At last convinced to return to her childhood faith, Astarté thanks
                  her brother for finding a “way to break the Chains which my mind had forg’d to it
                  self,” a remarkable anticipation of Blake’s “mind-forg’d manacles” (247).
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn6" id="ftn6_return"><sup class="super">

            </div>
            <p>In one of their dialogues, Apheridon tells Astarté that, should Persia somehow manage
               to return to Zoroastrian rule, she “would again see the morality of the ancient <em>Magi</em> predominate,” returning to a time when Persia was “all Magism” (245). In Act II,
               scene two of <em>Manfred</em>, Byron’s occultist hero explicitly equates himself to the “Magi,” whose eyes, like
               his own, grew “familiar with Eternity”; in the Hall of Arimanes, the second spirit
               calls Manfred a “Magian of great power,” an identification repeated by the spirit
               who appears at the end of the play in an attempt to carry Manfred away (II.ii.89-91,
               II.iv.31, III.ii.105). The spirits, in other words, seem to identify Manfred as a
               Zoroastrian (since they could easily have used the more general term “magician”),
               and Manfred himself invites the identification.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Manfred even seems, at least at one moment in the play, to be “practicing Zoroastrianism,”
                  a point made by Quinlan over half a century ago and one that comparison with the <em>Persian Letters</em> makes stronger (733). When, not yet convinced to abjure Islam, Astarté contrasts the
                  monotheism of her imposed faith to her brother’s polytheism—“you likewise worship
                  the Sun, the Stars, Fire, and even the Elements”—Apheridon defends the religion of
                  their ancestors: “they only paid the sort of Religious Reverence, due to the Works
                  of the Creator, and the Manifestations of the Deity” (246). Manfred’s striking apostrophe
                  to the setting sun in Act III, shortly before his death, proceeds very much in the
                  spirit of Apheridon’s apologia: 
                  <blockquote class="quote">
                     <div class="stanza">
                        <div class="l">Most glorious orb! that wert a worship, ere</div>

                        <div class="l">Themselves in orisons! Thou material God!</div>
                        <div class="l">And representative of the Unknown—</div>

                     </div>
                  </blockquote> Manfred’s rhetorical exchange with Nemesis and Arimanes also implies that, at the
                  very least, Manfred understands the Zoroastrian faith in a sophisticated manner that
                  contrasts with its popular reputation for sun-worship or, as in Thomas Moore’s <em>Lalla Rookh</em> (published only some weeks before Byron’s dramatic poem), fire-worship.

                           Moore absolves the Zorastrians or “Ghebers” of both sun worship and fire worship,
                           calling these “false charges” advanced by their “Mussalman tyrants” (p. 436, f.n.
                           #2). Yet Moore not only calls this section of Lalla Rookh “The Fire-Worshippers” but
                           frequently alludes to fire worship as well, as when the Zoroastrian hero, Hafed, immolates
                           himself on a shrine dedicated to the “Fire divine” (p. 459).</span></div>
                  </div> It would be too much to follow the spirits in claiming Manfred for the Zoroastrian
                  faith. For one thing, Manfred’s evident sense of the forbidden nature of his incestuous
                  relation to Astarte—“though it were / The deadliest sin to love as we have loved”—contrasts
                  markedly with Apheridon’s assurance that, according to their inherited religious beliefs,
                  he and <em>his</em> sister Astarté should feel entirely free to love, marry, and have children together
                  (II.iv.123-4; 237). More importantly, the corrosive power of Byron’s iconoclastic
                  poem emerges precisely from his commingling, leveling, and fusing of any number of
                  religious and mythological traditions, not from reasserting the claims of one of the
                  more ancient religions. But Manfred certainly comes closer to professing Zoroastrianism
                  than he does to Christianity, Greek paganism, or anything else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Zoroastrianism plays only a minor role in William Beckford’s <em>Vathek</em>, one of Byron’s favorite Orientalist fictions: we discover midway through the narrative
                  that Dilara, Vathek’s favorite before meeting Nouronihar, “had been brought up amongst
                  the magi,” and “cherished the idea of the Caliph’s devoting himself to the worship
                  of fire” (138). But the Caliph himself deserves a prominent position among the many
                  literary forebears—Faust, Faustus, Macbeth, Hamlet, Milton’s Satan, Godwin’s Falkland,
                  Byron’s own earlier heroes, and still more—that Byron weaves into his thickly textualized
                  characterization of Manfred.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#ftn8" id="ftn8_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> The multiple resonances with <em>Vathek</em>, then, represent still another aspect of the Orientalism of <em>Manfred</em>, whose hero displays various characteristics of Beckford’s parodically inflated Oriental
                  despot. For one thing, both Vathek and Manfred reign supreme in their respective domains,
                  though the former is a caliph of the Abbasid empire and the latter the lord of a feudal
                  holding in a Swiss region apparently lacking any form of centralized government. Both
                  have passed through a Faustian pursuit of knowledge—Vathek had “wished to know everything;
                  even sciences that did not exist,” and both resort to the study of occult knowledge,
                  Manfred in the company of his sister, Vathek in the company of his mother, Carathis,
                  with whom he has an unnaturally close if not outright incestuous relation (82). Like
                  Manfred, however, Vathek does pursue an illicit sexual connection, not to his sister,
                  but to Nouronihar, whom he seduces in violation of her prior betrothal to her cousin
                  and of the sacred “rights of hospitality” claimed in vain by her father (128). Both
                  spurn the advice and scorn the intervention of the orthodox religious figures who
                  alone might check their unbridled power—Manfred in relation to the Abbot, and Vathek
                  in relation to a series of Muslim divines—and in the cancelled Ashtoroth episode from
                  Act III, Manfred, like Vathek before him, goes so far as to mock and abuse his would-be
                  religious sponsor.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Most strikingly, perhaps, both inherit the inner hell of Milton’s Satan, Vathek ending
               more or less where Manfred begins. Each refuses a final offer of mediation, repentance,
               and perhaps redemption, on the grounds that the hour of redemption has long passed
               by. Manfred refuses, of course, in his rousing, yet oddly derivative, response to
               the Abbot in Act III: </p>

            <p> The echoes we cannot help but hear emanate from Milton’s Satan, yet Beckford’s Vathek
               makes a similar claim when offered a final chance to repent by a well-meaning Genius
               in the guise of a devout shepherd: “If what I have done be so criminal, as thou pretendest,
               there remains not for me a moment of grace. I have traversed a sea of blood . . .”
               (148). Less memorable, much less poetic, but no less definitive. Vathek’s end, as
               I have already suggested, instills in him the same state of inner torment, the same
               Satanic mind, that Manfred already endures at the play’s beginning. Finding himself
               at last in the subterranean realm of Eblis, the Muslim Satan, Vathek learns from Soliman
               precisely what sort of eternal torment to expect when his brief period of infernal
               enjoyment has ended: “I am in torments, ineffable torments! an unrelenting fire preys
               on my heart” (154). In other words, “myself am hell.” And this is the inner hell that,
               as the Seventh Spirit makes clear in the drama’s very first scene, Manfred suffers
               from beginning to end: “I call upon thee! and compel / Thyself to be thy proper Hell!”
               (I.i.250-1). This curse resonates throughout the play, most audibly, perhaps, in Manfred’s
               final exchange with the demon or “genius”—this one anything but devout—who comes to
               fetch him off to some indeterminate underworld, Christian or pagan or neither: “I
               bear within / A torture that could nothing gain from thine” (III.iv.137-8).</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A final parallel between <em>Vathek</em> and <em>Manfred</em> concerns the towers that constitute key settings in both works. Beckford’s tower,
                  a Babel-like monument to Vathek’s self-infatuation, becomes the scene of a grisly
                  combination of necromancy and human “sacrifice” (102). Manfred’s tower, featured in
                  Act III, seems to have been the scene of another human sacrifice of sorts, the mysterious
                  death of Astarte, who, according to the servant Manuel, was with Manfred “within his
                  tower” at the time of an “event” still “darkly” spoken of, an event the reader cannot
                  help relating to the “all-nameless hour” mentioned in Manfred’s opening speech (III.iii.32-41,
                  I.i.24). Peter Cochran, following McGann’s notes, seeks to differentiate the two works,
                  consigning the “stupid” Vathek to a “monomaniac level” of “mother-fixation” and shared
                  guilt that contrasts starkly with Manfred’s “dignity” and autonomous status as “his
                  own tempter” and “his own Nemesis” (<em>CPW</em> IV:474; <em>Manfred</em> 202-4). Yet when one looks closely at Manfred’s relevant speeches, one finds not autonomy
                  but a tissue of allusion and quotation, especially in relation to Milton’s Satan,
                  but, as we have noticed, with a secondary echo of Vathek as well. Manfred’s—and Byron’s—ironic
                  reliance on prior texts and voices precisely at the moment of claiming a sovereign,
                  self-determining “mind” remains, for me, crucial to understanding the self-cancelling,
                  self-critical nature of Manfred’s wishfully autonomous stance (III.iv.129).

            </div>
            <p>In concluding, let me stress that I have not attempted to build a case for regarding
               <em>Manfred</em> as a work of literary Orientalism. Had Byron wished to write an Orientalist poem,
               he knew exactly how to do so, having revived and all but patented that form in <em>The Giaour</em> and the other “Turkish Tales” that followed. Rather, in <em>Manfred</em>, Byron gave a pronounced Orientalist edge to an Alpine Gothic play that programmatically
               refuses to declare its allegiances, religious, mythological, geographical, literary,
               or generic. This studied and, for its time, shocking eclecticism, this iconoclastic
               resistance to categorization, does indeed risk being taken for comedy, as more than
               one reviewer and critic has noted, and does invite parody, as Gilbert Abbot à Beckett’s
               <em>Man-Fred</em> so memorably attests. Yet it also inspires the sort of iconoclastic “thrill” that
               Thomas Cooper recalled in the early nineteenth century and that, I believe, remains
               available to us in the early twenty-first. To borrow a key term from Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud’s
               recent and excellent study, <em>Radical Orientalism</em>, in its heterodox and skeptical treatment of religion, in its hero’s resistance to
               all forms of authority, in its implicit idealization of an illicit sexual relation,
               and even in its generic ambiguity, <em>Manfred</em> embodies in its own way what Cohen-Vrignaud calls, in relation to the Turkish Tales,
               Byron’s “infidelity” (178-217). We scholars continue to interrogate <em>Manfred</em>, as indeed we should and as the other essays in this <em>Praxis</em> volume eloquently attest. And, in a time of renewed hostility between West and East,
               a time of borders and walls and reactionary nationalistic nostalgia worthy of Castlereagh,
               we might do well to let <em>Manfred</em> interrogate us.</p>
