            <p rend="noCount"><title level="a">The Dashes in <title level="m">Manfred</title></title> examines the
                    ways in which one aspect of Byron’s manuscripts has been translated by his
                    editors. The dash is one of the most distinctive and controversial features of
                    Byron’s writing and is the vehicle for the silent part of his voice. Like many
                    other editors, I think that accidentals can be substantive. In this paper, I
                    look at the cultural associations of the dash, its translation from manuscript
                    into print in Byron’s particular case, and the different versions of 
                    <title level="m">Manfred</title> that come into sight (and hearing) if 
                we use Byron’s manuscripts as a musical score.</p>

            <p>In the opening scene of the play, Manfred tells the
                    spirits to appear “in your accustom’d forms” (I.i.180).<note place="foot" resp="author">I am grateful
                            to David Fairer, Alice Levine, and Susan Wolfson for their perceptive
                            comments on the paper and to Helen Symington for her invaluable
                            assistance in making images from Byron’s manuscripts in the NLS. For
                            obvious reasons, MLA-style formatting of quotations is not helpful when
                            discussing Byron’s open punctuation and I have departed from it where
                            necessary when quoting from Byron’s manuscripts.</note>
                In response, they ask him to “choose a form –” and
                    Manfred replies: “I have no choice” (I.i.183-4). This is not only an expression
                    of doomed fatefulness (because the shape can only be Astarte), but also a
                    world-weary “I don’t care” or, as my teenage son would say, just before he gets
                    grounded, “I don’t give ––.”
            </p>
            <p>Manfred’s “I have no choice” is a kind of textual shrug – one which Byron redeploys in the fair copy of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title> Canto II, stanza 151, when he offers alternative metaphors to his publisher. As shown below, he writes in the margin of the manuscript, “Take of the variations what is thought best –– I have no choice.”

                <p>This paper examines the expressive mark of punctuation that leads to “I have no choice”—the long dash (reproduced by Byron’s printers and in this paper as a double “em” dash “–”), which has a distinctive place in 
                  <title level="m">Manfred</title> and Byron’s writing as a whole. Like the “em” dash, the long or double “em” dash is both a mark of punctuation and (in Byron’s case) a refusal to punctuate. Its ambivalence heightens our awareness of the reader as a co-producer of meaning and as one of the many who are coerced by Manfred’s (and Byron’s) assertions of authority. The long dash, therefore, encapsulates many of puzzles about the interpretive freedom of Byron’s readers, his editors and, indeed, his actors.<note place="foot" resp="author"> One of the
                            most searching investigations I have found of the role of the dash in
                            the reading experience is the discussion of Laurence Sterne’s 
                    <title level="m">Tristram Shandy</title> in Hunter 41-69. I discovered
                            this essay through Warren Oakley’s work after the <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                    Symposium in April 2017, but Hunter’s summary of the
                            work of the dash anticipates my sense that Byron’s dashes provide a
                            musical “score” for the reader: “Its quantitative guide to pause,
                            rhythm, and silence and its indication of shifts of speaker, changes of
                            direction, or modifications in tone provide for readers a score that the
                            voice can perform by giving the eye a visual diagram of structural
                            transitions” (49).</note>
                In reading <title level="m">Manfred</title> we assume all three of these roles and none of them.</p>
            <p>Byron is not alone in the Romantic period in his
                    promiscuous use of dashes: the manuscripts of P.B. Shelley and Jane Austen also
                    flicker and pulse with dashing energy, but Byron’s editors seem to have allowed
                    a higher proportion of his manuscript dashes to appear in printed form (William
                    Gifford, we remember, edited works by both Byron and Austen). In published form,
                    Byron’s dashes were still controversial. The <title level="m">British
                        Critic</title>’s review of <title level="m">The Bride of Abydos</title>
                remonstrated about the prolixity of dashes in January 1814:
                <quote>
            We must protest against the effect of dashes, which occur,
                    without any reason whatsoever, sometimes twice or thrice in one line, and never
                    less than a dozen times in a page. (50)</quote>
            The same reviewer suspected that dashes were introduced “to give spirit to what was previously flat 
            and a mysterious meaning to what was before unintelligible.” Encountering the same device in 
                <title level="m">The Corsair</title>, the <title level="m">British Critic</title> 
                sounded increasingly impatient: “[w]e wish the Noble Lord
                    would omit these linear conjunctions” (March 1814, 288).</p>
            <p>The art of Byron’s dashes was shaped by print technology
                    as well as the diverse hands that worked over the manuscripts. When published by
                    John Murray, Byron’s poetry normally appeared on the page in Thomas Davison’s
                    elegant typeface in which the “em” dash almost joins the last letter of the 
                    preceding word to the first letter of the next, forming a sort of “linear conjunction.” 
                    Davison’s “em” dashes are usually seamless, but in the third stanza of the first edition 
                    of “When we two parted,” for example, which was printed by Bulmer &amp; Co, one can 
                    see how the “em” dash occasionally gets broken in the middle, forming a sort of typographical shudder.

            </figure>
                The visual frisson of the broken dash is uncommon, but <emph>affective</emph> dashing in 
                Byron’s poetry is not unusual. Byron’s dashes often seem to be the metrical equivalent 
                of the exclamations listed at the beginning of <title level="m">Don Juan</title> 
                Canto XV: “An ‘Oh!’ or ‘Ah!’ of joy or misery” (XV.1,] <title level="m">CPW</title> V:589), 
                or of non-verbal moments such as “a syncope, / Or a singultus” (XV.2), a sigh, an intake of 
                breath, a yawn, a cough, an inebriated hiccup or the musical equivalent of a pause, a rest, 
                or silence. In the midst of a densely literary work, dashes highlight the importance of the 
                non-verbal as a marker of intense emotion. As Janine Barchas points out, however, in relation 
                to the eighteenth-century novel, “[t]he overwhelming physicality of these moments may . . . draw 
                attention to themselves not as innocent approximations but as telltale evidence of the habits 
                of a master printer” (132). The translation of affect into luxurious print takes us to the 
                heart of the reviewers’ dilemma about the Byronic hero, and the uncertainty about whether 
                Byron’s readers were sharing the intimate secrets of a wounded soul or being taken for a ride 
                by a shrewd marketing operation.</p>
            <p>When the <title level="m">British Critic</title> praised Byron for omitting the 
                dashy “eye-traps” in <title level="m">Lara,</title> the phrase “eye-trap” 
                (from the 1750s, according to the <title level="m">OED</title>) was
                    used presumably as a variant of “clap-trap,” the extended pause that set apart
                    moments of high emotion in theatrical performances, designed to attract the
                    attention and applause of the audience.<note place="foot" resp="author">(October
                            1814) 409. Warren Oakley has investigated the significance of the “em”
                            dash in Laurence Sterne’s prose (also an influence on Byron), linking it
                            with the effects of the pauses in David Garrick’s acting. For further
                            details on the dash as melodrama, see Oakley 34-9.</note>
                On the page, Byron’s promiscuous “em” dashing resembles
                    the visual appearance of the Shakespeare plays David Garrick prepared for the
                    Drury Lane Threatre. Garrick used a dash to signal where an actor should pause
                    for effect so that in his published adaptations, as Warren Oakley has shown,
                    “[t]ypography indicates the location of each dramatic caesura, but is silent
                    about the nature of the action filling the expressive pause … prompting the
                    imagination of the reader” (34). The similarly hyperventilated appearance of 
                    the page in Byron’s Turkish Tales represents a test for the reader which is 
                    taken a stage further by the appearance of a still more elongated dash in the 
                    first edition of <title level="m">The Corsair</title> (as shown in figure 3).
                <note place="foot" resp="author">In relation to <title level="m">The Corsair</title> 
                    Matthew Bevis points out that Leigh Hunt captures the “air between hesitation 
                    and hurry” in Byron’s voice, which Bevis sees embodied in a dashing 
                    rhythm: “The typographical dash . . . both speeds up and slows down the narrative” (58).</note>

                The mark after “Waits but my chief” is Davison’s double “em” dash. It is placed 
                here to mark dramatic interruption, and is used for similar arresting effect in 
                the prose fragment attached to <title level="m">Mazeppa</title>, and for coy innuendo in
                <title level="m">Beppo</title>: “For my part, now, I ne’er could understand / 
                Why naughty women –– but I won’t discuss / A thing which is a scandal to the land” 
                (stanza 68; [“em” dash in <title level="m">CPW</title> IV:150, but restored to 
                double “em” in <title level="m">The Major Works</title> 333]). In the Garland facsimile 
                of the fair copy of <title level="m">Beppo</title>, one
                    can see how Byron’s manuscript dash after “naughty Women” is at least twice the
                    length of the dash after “For my part now,” suggesting that Byron intended a
                    salacious pause in which to conjure and then flamboyantly repress the thought of
                    “naughty Women” and what they do. The relative length of dashes within and
                    between manuscripts is not always as easy to decipher, however, and, as with all
                    his punctuation, Byron relied on his editors to translate manuscript into
                    print.<note place="foot" resp="author">Nicholson (1998) 258. There is a long 
                        dash after ‘naughty women’ in the earlier draft MS as well. See Levine

                    recently in the John Murray Archive at 50 Albemarle Street, London), readers 
                    can still make out the editorial hand that determined the length of the 
                    dashes (see figures 4 and 5).

                    The pencil of Gifford had the authority to cancel Byron’s
                    own ink dashes and to adjust the pauses and, therefore, the pace of the
                    poem.<note place="foot" resp="author">
                            Gifford’s significant role in the production of Byron’s poems means that
                            the textual situation of Byron’s dashes is not the same as that outlined
                            for Sterne by Hunter where “The ubiquity of the dash insistently calls
                            attention to the manipulating hand of the author behind the printer: for
                            all the freedom Sterne pretends to give individual readers, the firm,
                            set-in-print authority of the text remains inflexible and controls
                            readers, getting them up to speed or slowing them down as he wants”
                            (49).</note>
                Gifford’s dashing almost always has a graphic basis in Byron’s manuscripts (in 
                that there is nearly always a dash in the immediate vicinity), but Gifford’s 
                usual role is to reduce the frequency of the Byronic dash and to turn it into 
                other marks such as a comma or (especially) a colon.  Like the poem’s infamous 
                asterisks, the “2 ems” long dash in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> (––) signals 
                    the unsayable; but whereas a row of
                    asterisks shows where authorial content has been excised retrospectively by the
                    editor or publisher to avoid obscenity or legal prosecution, the long dash
                    suggests that a speaker <emph>nearly</emph> said something, but was then 
                    stopped or thought better of it: <emph>aposiopesis</emph>—the mark of knowing 
                    self-censorship. The long dash (––) is also a mark of complicity with the 
                    reader who is usually able to imagine what would have come next, as in Juan 
                    and Julia’s first sexual act: “And then –– God knows what next – I can’t go 
                    on; / I’m almost sorry that I e’er begun” (I. 115); or the reference to Donna 
                    Inez / Lady Byron: “His lady-mother, mathematical, / A –– never mind” (II.3); 
                    or, perhaps something less readily imaginable, “And horrid was the contrast to 
                    the view ––” (V.38), a more meditative pause as the narrator of <title level="m">Don
                        Juan</title> contemplates the body of the assassinated military commandant 
                    in Ravenna.</p>
            <p>Murray’s printer made a distinction between the one “em” dash (–) and the “2 ems” 
                long dash (––). In the Clarendon <title level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title> (1980-93), 
                however, some of these long dashes (including all the long dashes in 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> in the corrected reprinting of 1992) were standardised 
                to “em” dashes, and it was not until <title level="m">The Major Works</title>
                that they made a reappearance. In the meantime, the new Penguin editions of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title> and Byron’s <title level="m">Selected Poems</title>
                by Peter Manning and Susan Wolfson retained long dashes from the earlier Murray and 
                Hunt editions. Viewed in the Penguin typeface, however, the difference between “em” (–) 
                and double “em” (––) dashes seems to me slightly more subtle than in the Oxford 
                texts (possibly because there is more space around the dash?). Since most students who 
                want an authoritative text of <title level="m">Manfred</title> will be directed to use 
                the Clarendon <title level="m">Complete Poetical Works</title> Volume IV as the 
                current standard edition, it is helpful to ask what (if anything) is lost when we 
                <emph>don’t</emph> see the long dashes and what are we meant to do with them when 
                we do. I’ll begin with the dashes that we do not see in the <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                of <title level="m">CPW</title> IV because of OUP’s tidiness and I’ll move on to the 
                ones that were not in the <title level="m">Manfred</title> of 1817 because of 
                Gifford’s tidiness.</p>
            <p>The key editorial difficulty about retaining Byron’s dashes was summed up by 
                Gifford [writing of <title level="m">The Corsair</title>]:
                    “Lord B. uses dashes for commas – this gives the work a very singular
                    appearance, &amp; in some places, mars the sense” (Nicholson,
                <title level="m">Letters</title> 70n). Byron, like Shelley, tends to use dashes 
                in place of other punctuation and sometimes, at least in his rough drafts, as 
                vital contact between pen and page as he reaches for the word that will come next.
                <note place="foot" resp="author"> In email
                            correspondence after the <title level="m">Manfred</title> Symposium, Alice
                            Levine made the suggestive point that the greater number of dashes in
                            Byron’s drafts as opposed to fair copies indicates that the dash might
                            be used “like the way people use ‘like’ to fill a silence rather than a
                            deliberate or even semi-deliberate punctuation.”</note>
                Byron trusted his editors to supply regular punctuation for him, but unlike the 
                normal “em” dash, one feels that the long double “em” dash never really signifies 
                a comma. Although in some respects it stands alone, the long dash shares the paradoxical 
                and musical nature of Byron’s other dashes and extra-punctuational markings.  The long 
                dash is a horizontal (in print) or slanting (in some manuscripts) line that can signal 
                opposing things: a fragmentary, uncertain, but logically continuous progression of thought 
                or a termination, a change of logical direction, a <foreign xml:lang="it">pausa</foreign>
                or pivot.</p>
            <p>The first thing to note is that Byron often changes the
                    position and length of his dashes between draft and fair copy. On the first
                    draft, Manfred asks the mountains of the Jungfrau, “Why are ye beautiful? – –”
                    with a couple of separate dashes after the question mark, but this becomes just
                    a question mark in the fair copy and the first edition of 1817 (Levine and
                    McGann 45).</p>
            <p>The second thing to notice is that (as in <title level="m">Don Juan</title>)
                    some of the long dashes (––) are inserted by the editor (Gifford again), and do
                    not exist in the MSS at all. When Manfred sees the beautiful form at the end of
                    the first scene:
            <quote>
           <div type="poetry"><lg type="stanza">
            <l>Oh God! if it be thus, and <emph>thou</emph></l>
            <l>Art not a madness and a mockery,</l>
            <l>I yet might be most happy. – I will clasp thee,</l>
            <l>And we again will be –– (I.i.188-91, “em” dashes in <title level="m">CPW</title>),</l></lg></div>
            </quote>
                The agonised emphasis on “<emph>thou</emph>” and the long dash
                    after “we again will be” are not present in the fair copy but were added when
                    the fair copy was set up in type in 1817 (16).</p>
            <p>The third thing to bear in mind is that long dashes are
                    shared between most of the characters and are not characteristic of Manfred
                    alone. When Peter Graham perceptively remarks that Manfred’s dashes supply the
                    place of “dark unvoiced thoughts,” this is true in some cases, but not in all of
                    them, and it does not extend to the other characters such as the Chamois Hunter
                    (53). In the draft manuscript, when Manfred attempts to dismiss the Chamois
                    Hunter with “I am not of thine order,” the man retorts: “Thanks to 
                    Heaven – / I would not be of thine –  for the free fame / Of William Tell; ––” 
                    and the long dash here makes the exchange much more like the playful 
                    abruptness of dialogue in <title level="m">Don Juan</title> 
                (reminding us of the comic and conversational use of the dash in Sterne’s novels 
                and in eighteenth-century stage comedy) (Levine and McGann 57). The cheeky long dash 
                for the Chamois Hunter was not retained in Byron’s fair copy, nor in Murray’s first 
                edition, but its presence on the first draft might be seen as a residual trace of the 
                experimental serio-comic <title level="m">Manfred</title> which John Wright and 
                Jerome McGann remind us was there from the start.<note place="foot" resp="author">The rejected
                            (comic) third act was first published by John Wright in footnotes to the
                            17-volume 1832-33 edition. As early as 1817, however, reviewers were
                            suspicious about the hybrid tone and form of <title level="m">Manfred</title>. 
                    The <title level="m">British Critic</title> described <title level="m">Manfred</title> 
                    as a “nondescript” and an “Olla Podrida” – both terms which Byron associates with 
                    the style of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>; see <title level="m">British Critic</title> 
                    (July 1817) 47 and McGann 181-99.</note></p>
            <p>Many of the long dashes that Gifford allowed into the 1817 edition are performative 
                or gestural, telling us that in the midst of his poem, as in the narration of 
                <title level="m">Don Juan</title>, Byron (and his editor) were aware that the 
                characters needed stage time to do something, or textual time for readers to 
                <emph>imagine</emph> them doing something. It is significant that the agency 
                that propels these dashes often fails to summon or dismiss or assist the body 
                that is being invoked or cajoled repulsed, so that in the duration of the dash 
                there is often something of a struggle with materiality (or immateriality) that 
                might involve a certain flailing of arms. The questionable authority of speech acts 
                is evident in Manfred’s initial commands to the spirits: “–– Rise! appear!” and “– Rise! 
                appear! ––Appear!” (25), where the long dashes suggest something of an embarrassing pause 
                as Manfred initially fails to make anything rise or appear.<note place="foot" resp="author">Michael
                            Simpson glosses this failure as a more dignified dramatization of the
                            labour of discourse (131).</note>
                A more solid connection between words and action is
                    evinced when the Hunter hoists Manfred back from the cliffs with, “Away with me
                    –– I will not quit my hold” (25). The long dashes that articulate his
                    instructions as he leads Manfred down the mountain represent the offer of
                    physical assistance (perhaps initially resisted, but eventually accepted) and a
                    shared faltering progress downward. In the next act, the Witch of the Alps
                    dismisses Manfred’s apparent attachment to a mortal, his alleged clinging on to
                    “recreant mortality” with an “ ––Away!” (36) and, at the end of the poem, the
                    Abbot attempts to dismiss the fiend in the third act with “Avaunt! ––”, and an
                    equally vain “I do charge ye in the name ––” (72).</p>
            <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes enact Manfred’s dismissal of
                    the Wordsworthian figures, the Chamois Hunter and the Abbot: the Chamois Hunter,
                    speaking of “heavenly patience ––” is impatiently interrupted by Manfred with,
                    “Patience and patience! Hence – that word was made / For brutes of burthen, not
                    for birds of prey” (28). The Abbot, remonstrating with Manfred at the start of
                    Act III, is also cut off: “yet so young, / I still would ––” and: “Yet, hear me
                    still ––” (61); the Spirit who comes to claim Manfred in the last act tells him,
                    “thy many crimes / Have made thee ––” but Manfred intercepts the adjective with
                    “What are they to such as thee?” (74). Long dashes in such instances accentuate
                    Byron’s stichomythia, the insistent line breaks that interrupt the flow of the
                    blank verse and enforce a poetics of un-Wordsworthian rupture.
                <note place="foot" resp="author">Michael Simpson notes the importance of the 
                    competition for verbal space in stichomythia (131-3).</note></p>
            <p>Some of the 1817 long dashes are self-interruptions,
                    which increase tension about what is being withheld or concealed. When Manfred
                    speaks with the Witch of the Alps, he initiates a series of half-revelations
                    that begin with the detail of the exceptional “one who –– but more of her anon”
                    (33; 35). And the same secret is almost disclosed but then withheld in the most
                    famous broken line in the whole poetic drama when Manuel speaks to Herman of
                    “the only thing he seem’d to love, – / As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,
                    / The lady Astarte, his –– / Hush! Who comes here?” (66).</p>
            <p>These are all dramatic dashes which depend on conflict
                    between two voices (or in the last example, a change of interlocutor). In a
                    separate category are the more lyrical long dashes which create a pause after a
                    completed statement, allowing the last sound before the dash to reverberate.
                    There are lots of these in the manuscript, but only one survives into the 1817
                    first edition. It is when the spirits ask Manfred what he wants from them and he
                    says, “Forgetfulness ––” (see figure 6).

            This is not an instance of interruption, or self-interruption, or <emph>aposiopesis</emph>, 
                and the reader or speaker delivering the line has to decide for how long to pause. It 
                is possible to imagine a performance of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                extended by several minutes if actors heeded all Byron’s dashes as if they were 
                Beckett-like pauses. If we use the manuscript as a dramatical-musical score (which 
                is how, I think, Byron wrote it), “Forgetfulness” is meant to echo round the auditorium 
                or the reader’s mind for a bit. The long dash here (my last example of the long dashes 
                that are present in 1817 but missing from <title level="m">CPW</title>) is a
                    way of augmenting the force of unforgettability, or the nature of consciousness
                    with a silence that is the echo of Manfred’s own thoughts.</p>
            <p>In order to recover some of the long dashes that Gifford filtered out of Byron’s 
                fair copy when he copy-edited the manuscript in 1817, I have arranged the following 
                illustrations to contrast the fair copy of <title level="m">Manfred</title>
                (now in the Murray archive in the National Library of Scotland) and the first edition. 
                I am using the “second issue” as described by T. J. Wise (I: 122) or the “Dramatis 
                Personae Variant” as described by F. L. Randolph (Randolph argues that this is more 
                likely to be the first issue) (64). First, Manfred’s soliloquy at I.i.21-4 (see figure 7).

            What was a succession of dashes after “sands” and “since”
                    in the first draft (Levine and McGann 27), and a heavy long dash after “hour” in
                    the fair copy has become just a full stop after “that all-nameless hour” in the
                    first edition. In both manuscripts, Manfred haltingly and hesitantly approaches
                    a fatal moment, a moment which becomes much more discreet and self-contained
                    after it passes through the hands of Gifford. The 1817 first edition version of
                    Manfred’s soliloquy is less uneven and more matter-of-fact, but in the fair copy
                    manuscript above one can see a darker stroke of erasure signalling a pause to
                    sound unfathomable agony.</p>
            <p>At II.ii.31-2, Manfred summons the Witch of the Alps:
                    “– to call thee thus, / And gaze on thee a moment” (see figure 8).

            The first draft uses three separate dashes after “a
                    moment” (Levine and McGann 63) and there is one long dash in the fair copy
                    (above); for the 1817 edition, Gifford again turns the long dash into a single
                    full stop. In the manuscripts, however, Byron seems to indicate that Manfred
                    should dwell on the beauty of the Witch for some time. This impression is
                    strengthened a little later in the fair copy when he says that he desires to
                    “look upon thy beauty – nothing further –” and after seeking refuge in the
                    mysteries of the earth, “I search no further. – – – –” (see figure 8). There
                    were two separate dashes after “no further” in the first draft (Levine and
                    McGann 64), growing to four separate dashes in the fair copy above. In the first
                    edition of 1817, everything is gathered into a terminal full stop (see figure
                    9).

           Even allowing for the fact that Byron often finishes the
                    last line of a manuscript page with multiple dashes as a sort of “PTO” to
                    himself, the manuscripts urge more of a pause than is audible in the
                    grammatically rationalized punctuation of 1817. Gifford’s removal of so many
                    dashes makes Manfred into a cooler, more composed, and more purposeful speaker
                    in the first edition than he is in the manuscripts, where the multiple breaks
                    and pauses in speech suggest a much more jagged melodramatic delivery.

                    uncharnel?” Manfred answers in the fair copy, “One without a tomb. –

                In the first edition, this exchange becomes positively
                    brisk, closed by Gifford’s neatly self-sufficient full stop after “Astarte.” The
                    appearance of the speech on the printed page of 1817 renders the necromancy as a
                    routine day’s work for Arimanes and Nemesis; whilst for Manfred, the summoning
                    of Astarte is terse rather than the more traumatic venture it appears to be in
                    manuscript.</p>
            <p>When Astarte appears, the stage directions for both
                    Manfred and Astarte are implied in Manfred’s speech (see figure 11).

            “She is silent,” we are told at II.iv.110, but when
                    Manfred’s thick heavy dash on the fair copy becomes a comma in the 1817 first
                    edition, what looks like unspeakable anguish in the manuscript is rendered as a
                    calm, potentially impassive observation of her silence. Through Gifford’s paring
                    and re-punctuating for the 1817 edition, the whole emotional temper of Manfred’s
                    speech becomes much more even and controlled whereas Byron’s manuscripts suggest
                    that (as usual) he was using dashes as a graphic means of drawing out and
                    intensifying affect.</p>
            <p>It would be misleading, however, to focus solely on dashes which carry the 
                affective freight of the unbearable or in Hunter’s elegant phrase “something 
                unspeakable and yet compellingly actual” (47). Dashes are used in the fair 
                copy of <title level="m">Manfred</title> for a wider range of effects, including 
                a sort of rapture—just as in the fair copy manuscript of <title level="m">Don Juan</title>
                X.3, dashes will carry the “glow” and “caper” cut by the poet’s “internal Spirit.” In
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> Act III, scene i, Byronic dashes signal 
                the boundlessness of mental travel. To the Abbot, Manfred recalls his youthful aspirations “to
                    rise / I knew not whither – it might be to fall;” and then Manfred/Byron
                    digresses to give us the lovely image of a Manfredian fall, which is actually an
                    aesthetic rise (a version of the rebound or recovery described by Clara Tuite in
                    the symposium):

            </figure>
            As figure 12 shows, the fair copy has longish dashes after “whither” and “fall” 
            and “mistook themselves,” and medium-sized dashes after “abyss” and “past” that 
            help to create a dawdling, meditative habit of mind (though one must be wary of 
            placing too much interpretive weight on what are very variably-sized markings). 
            The manuscript brackets in this passage encourage us to notice Manfred’s imagination 
            snagging on a detail of external beauty, which leads him to digress from visions of 
            himself and offer an aside on forms of natural plenitude and renewal. The dashes, 
            meanwhile, encourage that lingering with nature that occurs when Manfred describes 
            the Alps, or in his recollection of the Colosseum as a moon-softened necropolis.</p>
            <p>In one of his most discerning asides, Jerome McGann calls
                    the Alpine Journal “[o]ne of the great acts of English prose attention” (to what
                    extent was Byron acting, one wants to ask) (McGann 177). Sights and sounds are
                    recorded with a febrile, raw-nerved concentration for Augusta, linked by dashes
                    that suggest Byron’s headlong plunge into each experience as he attempts to
                    escape consciousness with an accumulation of sense impressions.

                        Entry for 22 September 1816</figDesc>
            </figure>
            The manuscript page of the Alpine journal in figure 13 is a graphic illustration 
            of Byron’s attempt to describe the indescribable: “It is neither mist nor water 
            but a something between both ––.” The dash carries the affective force of the 
            liminal “something,” which is re-transcribed in Byron’s slow realization of the 
            lasting power of a formless form that has almost brought him to speechlessness: 
            “–– wonderful – &amp; indescribable. –– .” In the fair copy of
                <title level="m">Manfred</title>, one can see the same <foreign xml:lang="it">pausa</foreign>, 
                the same pivotal seductions of the human mind by its own imaginings. This lagging,
                    internal re-play of beauty suspends the onward rush of dramatic time and
                    inevitability. Its backward-looking, valedictory effect is evident in my final
                    example of a longish dash that was edited out by Gifford see figure 14).

            </figure>
                In the fair copy of Act III, scene 2, Manfred’s soliloquy to the sunset 
                ending: “–– He is gone ––” becomes in 1817 “He is gone:” with Gifford’s 
                characteristic colon (Byron rarely uses colons in his manuscripts).  If 
                one treats the manuscript as theatrical script, the dashes suggest that 
                Manfred takes time to watch the sun disappear. In a stage performance, a 
                director might arrange a shadow to lengthen into total darkness by the time 
                Manfred reaches “gone.” A musical score might hold the final note, its echo 
                and the silence afterwards. Manfred, we know, “must watch” (I.i.2), and the 
                time he spends in “wanderings / And watchings” is important (III.iii.43-4). 
                As Michael O’Neill pointed out last year when the text was discussed in the 
                Summer of 1816 conference at Sheffield, one of the great paradoxes of 
                <title level="m">Manfred</title> is that its hero keeps saying beauty means 
                nothing to him: “there is no form on earth / Hideous or beautiful to me,” 
                but his speeches are full of exquisitely shaped hymns to natural beauty 
                (I.i.184-5). Byron clearly was ravished by the Alpine scenery of 1816 
                which recurs throughout his poetry after the summer of 1816.

                            stirring of a stream within an Alpine hollow (IV:30); the sleeping
                            occupant of the harem like a snow minaret on an Alpine steep (VI:68).</note>
               The dashes around Manfred’s acts of attention partake of
                    what Ian Balfour notes as the “telegraphic notation” of the Alpine Journal (12),
                    or what Susan Wolfson refers to as the “lightning on the page” of dashes in
                <title level="m">Childe Harold</title> Canto III (765).</p>
            <p>Manfred’s tactile attentiveness (almost adhesiveness) to form finds 
                its echo in the very final scene where the Abbot attends the dying
                    Manfred. Manfred expires, of course, on a dash: “Old Man – ’tis not so difficult
                    to die. –” (Levine and McGann 130).<note place="foot" resp="author">In the fair 
                        copy there is also a dash after “die.”</note>
                Neither the dashes nor the rest of the line made it into
                    the first edition of 1817; and when the line was restored, the terminal dash was
                    cancelled and became a full stop. As he watches Manfred expire, the Abbot
                    reiterates Manfred’s words on the sinking sun: “He’s gone. – […] he is
                    gone.”

            And then, as figure 15 above shows, we have Byron’s lovely signing off: 
            “End of act third – &amp; of this poem. – .  –” with a swirl that seems a more 
            emphatic version of the one under the journal entry of September 22, 1816 in 
            figure 13.</p>
            <p>In the post-production discussion, the director of the Red Bull production 
                of <title level="m">Manfred</title> spoke about the challenges of adapting 
                a poem lacking in causality for the stage. As a dramatic poem, Byron deliberately 
                juxtaposes causality with (forgive me) what we might call “pausality.” At 
                the micro-level of the dash and the macro-level of all those passages that 
                had to be cut for the performance (such as the Colosseum soliloquy), Manfred 
                steps back from decisive action to “linger yet with Nature” (III.iv.3). Poetically, 
                he fights against the constraint that is fate or dramatic time and his dashes signal 
                a determination to carve out form from poetic destiny so that “what ye take / Shall 
                be ta’en limb by limb” (III.iv.103-4); “limb” is followed by three dashes in the fair 
                copy. In the colder print of 1817, Manfred’s heroic resistance against the spirits of 
                conventional drama becomes just another full stop. But the pause implicit in those three 
                dashes help to make more sense of the spirit’s taunt: “Can it be that thou / Art thus in 
                love with life?” (III.iv.107-8).</p>
            <p>Manfred is not in love with life, but he is sensually and syntactically involved 
                with it; he is, we might say, attached to it. Byron’s hero has his own music, and 
                the dashes that punctuate his speech are often extra-metrical silent notes of 
                resistance that might seem indistinguishable from the terminal silence that ends 
                the poem. But these dashes are also cues for action; they are the echoes of the 
                last note but also the foot prints of the next move – a halting progress that drives 
                the poem forward. In order to see, hear and feel that complex music we might pay 
                more attention to the dashes in <title level="m">Manfred</title>.</p>
